    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the side effects and how well cyclophosphamide, paclitaxel, and
      trastuzumab work when given after surgery in treating patients with stage I-II human
      epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2/neu) positive breast cancer (confined to the breast or
      the breast and lymph nodes under the arm). Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      cyclophosphamide and paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,
      either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from
      spreading. Monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, may interfere with the ability of
      tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving cyclophosphamide, paclitaxel, and trastuzumab after
      surgery may help prevent the cancer from coming back.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the toxicities and ability to complete the planned treatment of a dose-dense
      regimen of cyclophosphamide and paclitaxel with trastuzumab in subjects with newly diagnosed
      stage I-II HER2/neu positive breast cancer.

      II. To estimate recurrence free survival of a dose-dense regimen of cyclophosphamide and
      paclitaxel with trastuzumab in subjects with newly diagnosed stage I-II HER2/neu positive
      breast cancer.

      OUTLINE:

      SYSTEMIC THERAPY: Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) over 1 hour,
      paclitaxel IV over 3 hours, and trastuzumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats
      every 14 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      MAINTENANCE TRASTUZUMAB THERAPY: Beginning in course 6, patients receive trastuzumab IV over
      30-60 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 52 weeks in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients may undergo radiation therapy at the discretion of the radiation oncologist and
      medical oncologist and patients with estrogen/progesterone receptor positive tumors receive
      hormonal therapy as determined by the medical oncologist per standard National Comprehensive
      Care Network (NCCN) guidelines.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.
