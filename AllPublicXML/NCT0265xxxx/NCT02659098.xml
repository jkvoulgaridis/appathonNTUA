    <measure>Change From Baseline in Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) Total Letters Score at Month 1- Treated Eye</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Month 1</time_frame>
    <description>Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was assessed in the study eye (Treated eye). BCVA measurements were made using the logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) visual acuity testing charts. Each letter on the chart has a score value of 0.02 log units. Since there were 5 letters per line, the total score for a line on the logMAR chart represented a change of 0.1 log units. The formula for calculating the logMAR BCVA score was: 1.7 - 0.02*number of letters read. A lower BCVA score indicates better vision. A negative change score indicates improvement.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of geographic atrophy (GA) secondary to age-related macular degeneration
             (AMD) confirmed within 45 days prior to initial randomization verified by the central
             reading center

          -  Study eyes will have a best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 20/80 to 20/800 [Early
             Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) log of the minimum angle of resolution
             (logMAR) value 0.6-1.6]. The treatment eye will be that with the worse BCVA at
             Screening. If BCVA is clinically equivalent, the eye with the larger GA determines the
             study eye

          -  Participant is a suitable candidate for ophthalmologic surgery, is willing and able to
             comply with the surgical procedure, scheduled visits, treatment plan, laboratory tests
             and other study procedures. Participant has met criteria of the surgery center
             anti-coagulation protocol, if applicable

          -  Each participant must sign an informed consent form (ICF) indicating that he or she
             understands the purpose of and procedures required for the study and are willing to
             participate in the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant has a history of neovascular (&quot;wet&quot;) AMD in the treatment eye, including
             evidence of retinal pigment epithelium rips or evidence of subretinal or choroidal
             neovascularization or fluid. In cases where imaging is inconclusive, review of the
             case with the study site, considering history and imaging will determine eligibility.
             History or evidence of neovascular AMD in the fellow eye is allowed, if anti-vascular
             endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy has not been required for at least 8 weeks
             prior to Screening

          -  Geographic atrophy secondary to any causes other than AMD in either eye

          -  A diagnosis of glaucoma with an intraocular pressure (IOP) greater than or equal to
             (&gt;=) 25 millimeter of mercury (mmHg) while being treated with an ocular hypotensive
             drug. Treatment should be no more than 1 drug preparation/combination, which can
             contain 1 or 2 ocular hypotensive active ingredients; participants receiving more than
             2 ocular hypotensive active ingredients are excluded

          -  Nuclear sclerotic cataract, cortical spoking, posterior subcapsular cataract above
             Grade 2 per Age Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) scale or any other ophthalmologic
             condition that reduces the clarity of the media that, in the opinion of the
             investigator or reading center, interferes with ophthalmologic examination (example,
             corneal abnormalities, inadequate pupillary dilation), surgery or imaging in the study
             eye

          -  Myopia greater than minus (&gt;-) 8 diopters and participants with greater than (&gt;) 4
             diopters of astigmatism, and greater than plus (&gt;+) 10 diopters of hyperopia

        <title>Change From Baseline in Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) Total Letters Score at Month 1- Treated Eye</title>
        <description>Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was assessed in the study eye (Treated eye). BCVA measurements were made using the logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) visual acuity testing charts. Each letter on the chart has a score value of 0.02 log units. Since there were 5 letters per line, the total score for a line on the logMAR chart represented a change of 0.1 log units. The formula for calculating the logMAR BCVA score was: 1.7 - 0.02*number of letters read. A lower BCVA score indicates better vision. A negative change score indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) Total Letters Score at Month 1- Fellow Eye</title>
        <description>BCVA was assessed in the fellow eye. BCVA measurements were made using the logMAR visual acuity testing charts. Each letter on the chart has a score value of 0.02 log units. Since there were 5 letters per line, the total score for a line on the logMAR chart represented a change of 0.1 log units. The formula for calculating the logMAR BCVA score was: 1.7 - 0.02*number of letters read. A lower BCVA score indicates better vision. A negative change score indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Best Corrected Visual Acuity Total Letters Score at Month 30- Fellow Eye</title>
        <description>BCVA was assessed in the fellow eye. BCVA measurements were made using the logMAR visual acuity testing charts. Each letter on the chart has a score value of 0.02 log units. Since there were 5 letters per line, the total score for a line on the logMAR chart represented a change of 0.1 log units. The formula for calculating the logMAR BCVA score was: 1.7 - 0.02*number of letters read. A lower BCVA score indicates better vision. A negative change score indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Best Corrected Visual Acuity Letters at Months 6 and 12: Treated Eye</title>
        <description>BCVA was assessed as letters read using early treatment diabetic retinopathy study charts and reported as the number of letters read correctly (ranging from 0 to 100 letters) in the study eye (Treated eye). The lower the number of letters read correctly on the eye chart, the worse the vision (or visual acuity). A positive change from baseline indicates an improvement and a negative change from baseline indicates a worsening.</description>

        <description>Number of participants with TEAEs and SAEs were assessed. An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant administered a medicinal (investigational or non investigational) product. An AE does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment and can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not related to that medicinal product. SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, Is life-threatening, Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, Is a suspected transmission of any infectious agent via a medicinal product.</description>
