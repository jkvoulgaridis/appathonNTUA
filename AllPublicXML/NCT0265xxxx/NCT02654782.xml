  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to show which of two different types of fluid is best for
      cardiac surgical patients. During and after the subject's heart surgery, the subject will be
      given either Lactated Ringer's or 5% human albumin to replace lost blood and body fluids and
      to regulate blood pressure.

      Albumin (human) 5% is a sterile, liquid preparation of albumin derived from large pools of
      human plasma. All units of human plasma used in the manufacture of Albumin (human) 5% are
      provided by FDA approved blood establishments only.

      Lactated Ringer's is a sterile, nonpyrogenic solution containing isotonic concentrations of
      electrolytes in water for injection. It is FDA approved for administration by intravenous
      infusion for parental replacement of extracellular losses of fluid and electrolytes.

      The hypothesis of this study is that the individual total fluid volume and alveolar-arterial
      gradient will be less with 5% human albumin compared to Lactated Ringer's in the
      perioperative cardiac surgical patient.

      Following Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval and written informed patient consent, 40
      elective, cardiac surgical patients will be randomized to two different fluid therapy
      regimens, 5% human albumin only or Lactated Ringer's only, beginning in the intraoperative
      period and up to 6 hours in the intensive care unit. Providers and patients will be blinded
      to the fluid administered in the operating room and intensive care unit. The primary outcome
      measure will be the total volume of 5% human albumin or Lactated Ringer's given during the
      study period to maintain specified hemodynamic guidelines. Hemodynamic instability will be
      defined according to each patient's stipulated baseline parameters. Fluid will be
      administered at the request of providers in the operating room and intensive care unit in
      compliance with a perioperative fluid algorithm.

          <description>Adequate fluid volume plays a major part in maintaining the necessary hemodynamics to prevent organ damage during cardiac surgery. This will be measured by the total volume of fluid administered to the subject from the start of surgery up to 6 hours in the intensive care unit.</description>
