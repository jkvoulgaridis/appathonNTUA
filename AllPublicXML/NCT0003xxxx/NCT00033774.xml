  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the development of stem cells (very immature cells produced by the
      bone marrow) and their potential to change into cells of other organ types. These cells will
      be studied for their potential use in creating replacement tissue for diseases ranging from
      diabetes to Parkinson s.

      Healthy volunteers 18 years of age or older may be eligible for this study. Candidates will
      be screened with a medical history, physical examination, and blood tests.

      Participants will undergo a process called 'stem cell mobilization and apheresis' to collect
      bone marrow stem cells. For five days before the collection they will receive injections of a
      hormone called G-CSF, which stimulates release of stem cells from the bone marrow into the
      bloodstream. On the fifth day of the injections, stem cells will be collected through
      apheresis. For this procedure, blood is collected through a catheter (plastic tube) placed in
      an arm vein and directed into a cell separator machine. There, the white cells and stem cells
      are separated from the other blood components through a spinning process and collected in a
      bag inside the machine. The rest of the blood is returned to the donor through a catheter in
      the other arm.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The renewal of various tissues and organs at steady state or following damage relies upon a
      small population of locally residing tissue specific &quot;stem cells&quot; Stem cells from adult bone
      marrow represent an ideal stem cell source based on their ease of collection. In order to
      begin to explore the potential of adult bone marrow for the correction of genetic diseases
      that affect the blood such as sickle cell disease, we propose in vitro and in vivo mouse
      studies to examine the regulation of normal differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells
      collected from adult volunteers. In order to obtain adult hematopoietic stem cells in large
      numbers for in vitro and in vivo studies, volunteers will undergo mobilization with G-CSF for
      5 consecutive days followed by large volume apheresis on the 5th day of G-CSF injection. The
      harvested product will be immunomagnetically purified for the primitive progenitor population
      and viably cryopreserved in multiple aliquots.

    <description>Collection and storage of hematopoietic stem cells will allow in vitro studies to explore the control of normal hematopoiesis stem cell differentiation. In some cases, steady state (without G-CSF mobilization) peripheral blood mononuclear cells will be collected to serve as controls. The hematopoietic stem cells will be cultured under a variety of conditions designed to mimic normal hematopoietic stem cell terminal differentiation. The hematopoietic stem cells will also be transplanted into immunodeficient mice, a surrogate stem cell assay, to further study in vivo differentiation potential. Populations of cultured cells will be analyzed for genes involved in the process ofnormal differentiation. Following collection and processing, identifiers will be stripped from the samples prior to their distribution to the investigators with retention of only the gender of the donor for purposes of cell tracking.</description>

        Recruitment will occur from a pool of normal volunteers. Volunteers who are not undergoing
        pretreatment with G-CSF will receive two hundred and fifty (250) dollars for the
        leukapheresis. Volunteers who undergo pretreatment with G-CSF will receive a payment of
        five hundred (500) dollars upon completion of 5 days of G-CSF, blood draws, and the
        leukapheresis. In the event of early withdrawal from the study before the leukapheresis,
        the volunteer will receive fifty (50) dollars for each visit to the hospital which includes
        blood draws and G-CSF administration.
