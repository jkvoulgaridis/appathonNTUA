      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of sarCNU in treating patients who have
      recurrent malignant glioma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the efficacy of SarCNU, in terms of objective response and duration of
           response, in patients with recurrent malignant gliomas.

        -  Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the time to progression and survival of patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral SarCNU on days 1, 5, and 9. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks for up to 4
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 4 weeks and then every 3 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18
      months.
