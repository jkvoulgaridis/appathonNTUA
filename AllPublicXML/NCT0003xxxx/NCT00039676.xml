  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

        -  Individuals may be prone to develop blood or lymph node cancers (leukemia or lymphoma)
           for a variety of reasons, including genetic predisposition to these cancers,
           environmental exposures or other medical conditions.

        -  Studies of people and families at high risk of cancer often lead to clues about their
           cause that may also be important regarding the sporadic occurrence of these cancers in
           the general population.

        -  Identifying genetic or environmental factors that play a role in the development of
           these diseases may be important in developing prevention trials, screening programs and
           treatments.

      Objectives:

        -  Describe the cancers and other conditions in families with blood or lymph node cancer.

        -  Find and describe genes that may cause blood and lymph node cancer, and understand how
           they work in families.

        -  Use laboratory methods to try to determine if it is possible to identify who is at
           highest risk of blood or lymph node cancer.

        -  Test how genes act with other factors to alter the risk of disease, its severity or its
           manifestations in families.

      Eligibility:

        -  Individuals of any age with a personal or family history of a blood or lymph node
           cancer.

        -  Individuals with a personal or family history of medical conditions or environmental
           exposures that may predispose to blood or lymph node cancer.

      Design:

        -  Participants complete questionnaires about their personal and family medical history and
           provide consent for researchers to review their medical records and pathology materials
           related to their care and those of deceased relatives with blood or lymph node cancer,
           tumors, or other related illnesses for whom they are the legally authorized
           representative.

        -  Participants donate a sample of blood or cheek cells, or a lock of hair for genetic
           studies.

        -  Patients may also be evaluated at the NIH Clinical Center by one or more of the
           following specialists: cancer doctor or blood specialist, medical geneticist, research
           nurses or clinical social worker. They may have blood and urine tests and a cheek swab
           or mouth wash to collect cheek cells. Some patients may also be asked to have x-rays and
           routine imaging, such as CT scans or ultrasound tests, cell surface markers, skin
           biopsy, and, with special consents, bone marrow biopsy, MRI or PET scans, apheresis or
           fluorescein angiography and photography.

      Background:

        -  Persons may be prone to develop hematologic or lymphoproliferative cancer for a variety
           of reasons including: inherited predisposition of benign, premalignant, or malignant
           conditions; environmental exposures shared by family members; previous tumors or
           preneoplastic conditions; immune deficiency; or stochastic processes

        -  Investigations of individuals and families at high risk of cancer often lead to
           etiologic clues that may be important in the sporadic counterparts of these cancers in
           the general population

        -  Identification of etiologically important genetic factors could inform chemoprevention
           trials, screening programs, and treatment of hematologic and lymphoproliferative cancers

      Objectives:

        -  To evaluate and define the clinical spectrum and natural history of disease in syndromes
           predisposing to hematologic cancer

        -  To evaluate potential precursor states of malignancy in families at risk and increase
           understanding of the factors that cause progression

        -  To quantify the risks of specific tumors in family members and define syndromic
           constellations

        -  To identify, map, characterize, clone, and determine function of tumor susceptibility
           genes

        -  To validate and test associations of biomarkers with risk

        -  To identify genetic determinants, environmental factors, and gene-environmental
           interactions conferring cancer risk in individuals and families

        -  To identify differences and similarities between the familial and sporadic condition

        -  To educate and counsel study participants about their risk of hematologic malignancy
           including prevention recommendations and early detection activities when known

        -  To develop syndrome-specific educational materials for medical professionals and
           high-risk family members

      Eligibility:

        -  Persons of any age will be considered if

             -  there is a personal or family medical history of hematologic/lymphoproliferative
                malignancy of an unusual type, pattern, or number; or,

             -  there are known or suspected factor(s) predisposing to hematologic malignancy,
                either genetic or congenital factors, environmental exposure, or unusual
                demographic features

        -  For familial neoplasms, two or more living affected cases among family members are
           generally required

      Design:

        -  This is a prospective study. Families are studied long-term using a cohort approach.

        -  The study design and clinical evaluation vary by the specific type of familial neoplasm
           being studied

        -  The overall approach to eligible families includes defining affection status,
           characterization of disease, localization of genetic loci, identification of genes,
           evaluation of phenotype/genotype correlations, estimation of risk of the disease
           associated with carrier status and identification of other risk factors that modify
           penetrance (genetic, environmental, and host factors)

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        On referral, persons of any age will be considered for inclusion in the study because of
        either:

          -  A family or personal medical history of hematologic/ lymphoproliferative malignancy of
             any unusual type, pattern, or number; or,

          -  Known or suspected factor(s) predisposing to hematologic malignancy, either genetic
             and/or congenital factors (birth defects, metabolic phenotype, chromosomal anomalies
             or Mendelian traits associated with tumors), environmental exposure (medications,
             occupation, radiation, diet, infectious agents, etc.), or unusual demographic features
             (very young age of onset multiple tumors, etc.).

        Personal and family medical history must be verified through questionnaires, interviews,
        and review of pathology slides and medical records. For familial neoplasms, two or more
        living affected cases among family members are generally required, although in selected
        instances exceptions may be made, e.g., for WM, one cases plus a living 1st degree relative
        with an autoimmune condition will qualify a family for further investigations.

        Disease-specific considerations. Familial aggregation of any hematologic cancer(s) is
        eligible for study, Disease specific procedures are outlined in appendices:

          1. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)

          2. Waldenstrom s macroglobulinemia (WM)

          3. Non-Hodgkin s Lymphoma (NHL)

          4. Hodgkin disease (HD)

          5. Mixed/miscellaneous hematologic and lymphoproliferative diseases

        Ability of subject or Legally Authorized Representative (LAR) to understand, and the
        willingness to sign, a written informed consent document.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Referred individuals for whom reported diagnosis cannot be verified.

          -  Referred individuals who decline informed consent.
