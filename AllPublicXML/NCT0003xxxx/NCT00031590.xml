      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells, but also damages
      normal cells in the developing brains of children. Combining low-dose radiation therapy in
      combination with chemotherapy should be effective in treating medulloblastoma while avoiding
      the long-term side effects of giving higher dose radiation to children with newly diagnosed
      average risk medulloblastoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  By giving reduced dose craniospinal radiation followed by nine cycles of maintenance
           chemotherapy comprised of alternating cycles of lomustine, cisplatin, and vincristine
           alternating with cyclophosphamide and etoposide, we will reduce the late effects of
           higher dose radiation in children while maintaining the therapeutic efficacy (86% 3-year
           relapse-free survival) of current standard therapy

        -  To evaluate the late neurotoxic effects of low-dose craniospinal radiotherapy, in terms
           of cognitive, endocrinologic, and auditory function, in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multi center study of reduced dose craniospinal radiotherapy and
      chemotherapy in patients ages 3 - 30 years with newly diagnosed average risk medulloblastoma.

        -  Induction chemoradiotherapy: Beginning within 28 days after complete surgical resection,
           patients undergo radiotherapy to the craniospinal axis (1800 centigray (cGy)) followed
           by conformal radiotherapy to the tumor bed (5400 cGy). Patients receive vincristine
           weekly for 6 weeks.

        -  Maintenance chemotherapy: Beginning 4 weeks after the completion of craniospinal
           radiation therapy, patients receive two 6-week courses of regimen A as outlined below
           alternating with one 6-week course of regimen B for a total of 9 courses (AABAABAAB).

             -  Regimen A: Patients receive oral lomustine and cisplatin on day 0 and vincristine
                on days 0, 7, and 14.

             -  Regimen B: Patients receive cyclophosphamide on days 0 and 1 and etoposide
                intravenous (IV) on days 0 and 1, followed by oral etoposide on days 14-34.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then
      annually thereafter with surveillance neuroimaging using Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan (MRI
      scan) and clinical examination.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.

Treatment must begin within 28 days of surgery. Reduced dose craniospinal irradiation (CSI) (1800 centiGray (cGy) CSI + 3780 cGy tumor bed) will last for 6 weeks with concurrent, weekly vincristine. 4 weeks after radiation therapy is completed, all subjects will begin 9 cycles of maintenance chemotherapy: Regimen A (CCNU, Vincristine, and Cisplatin) and Regimen B (Cyclophosphamide, given with Mesna, and Etoposide). Cycles will be given as AABAABAAB
Regimen A:
Cisplatin: 70mg/m2/dose x 1 dose on day 0 Vincristine: 1.5 mg/m2/dose on days 0, 7, 14 CCNU: 75 mg/m2/dose x 1 dose on day 0
