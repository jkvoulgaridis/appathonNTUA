  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is designed as a phase Ib open-label, dose-escalation, multicenter study
      evaluating the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of StrataGraft skin tissue in promoting the
      healing of the deep partial-thickness component of complex skin defects. The proposed study
      population will include patients with 3-49% Total Body Surface Area (TBSA) complex skin
      defects including a deep partial-thickness component resulting from thermal injury. The study
      has been designed to focus on the evaluation of safety and tolerability of prolonged exposure
      to increasing amounts of a single application of StrataGraft skin tissue, while also
      assessing the potential for StrataGraft tissue to promote healing of the deep
      partial-thickness component of these complex skin defects as an alternative to donor site
      harvesting and autografting. Targeted enrollment for this study is up to 30 patients with
      complex skin defects due to thermal burns which require surgical excision and autografting.
      Subjects will be sequentially enrolled in two cohorts of increasing treatment area receiving
      StrataGraft skin tissue that has been stored refrigerated prior to clinical use. A third
      cohort will receive StrataGraft skin tissue which has been stored cryopreserved and thawed in
      the operating room just prior to grafting.

    <description>All subjects enrolled in this study will receive StrataGraft tissue. Will randomly assign treatment regimens to the two comparable study treatment sites pre-identified as A or B. A sealed randomization envelope will be supplied to the clinical site along with the shipment of clinical tissue. Neither the surgeon nor scrubbed operating room personnel will be informed of the randomization until completion of surgical excision. The treatment sites A or B will be randomized to receive either StrataGraft skin tissue or autograft using a 1:1 ratio.
Two comparable areas of healthy skin will be pre-identified by the clinical staff as donor sites A or B. The randomization assignment will be identical as that above for the treatment sites. For example, if treatment site A is randomized to receive an autograft, donor site A will be designated the donor site for autografting</description>

      <recruitment_details>The study evaluated the safety and efficacy of StrataGraft skin tissue in promoting the healing of deep partial-thickness burns. Subjects had surgical excision and placement of StrataGraft skin tissue and autograft. The trial was conducted at six clinical sites throughout the United States.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>All subjects were treated with both StrataGraft skin tissue and autograft as part of the intrapatient comparator design. Two comparable excised areas of deep partial-thickness burn per subject were randomized to receive a single application of autograft or StrataGraft skin tissue.</pre_assignment_details>

            <description>StrataGraft skin tissue is a fully-differentiated tissue which exhibits barrier function comparable to that of intact human skin. StrataGraft consists of an epidermal layer of fully-stratified human keratinocytes growing on a dermal layer which is comprised of human fibroblasts embedded in a collagen matrix. StrataGraft skin tissue is a tough, suturable, meshable tissue product that is manufactured with a surface area of 44 cm2. StrataGraft tissue is not intended to be a patient-specific product but rather to provide an allogeneic skin substitute which reproduces many of the structural and biological properties of normal human skin and is anticipated to serve as a biological wound dressing.</description>

            <title>StrataGraft Skin Tissue</title>
            <description>StrataGraft skin tissue is a fully-differentiated tissue which exhibits barrier function comparable to that of intact human skin. StrataGraft consists of an epidermal layer of fully-stratified human keratinocytes growing on a dermal layer which is comprised of human fibroblasts embedded in a collagen matrix. StrataGraft skin tissue is a tough, suturable, meshable tissue product that is manufactured with a surface area of 44 cm2. StrataGraft tissue is not intended to be a patient-specific product but rather to provide an allogeneic skin substitute which reproduces many of the structural and biological properties of normal human skin and is anticipated to serve as a biological wound dressing.</description>
