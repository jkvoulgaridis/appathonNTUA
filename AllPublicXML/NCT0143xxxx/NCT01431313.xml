  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, open label phase II study to evaluate the effect of inhaled nitrite
      delivered in a dose escalation manner on the change in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) in
      subjects with pulmonary hypertension undergoing right heart catheterization.

      A total of 50 subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension and meet all
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled in the study which will entail a single right
      heart catheterization and nebulized nitrite dose of 45mg with one subsequent dosage of 90 mg.

      Screening Visit:Initial screening evaluations including physical examination, medical
      history, and clinical laboratory assessments will be conducted to determine study
      eligibilities during a routine clinic visit at the UPMC HVI, CLC or inpatient at UPMC
      Presbyterian. Subjects who meet the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria
      will be entered into the study.

      Day 1: This study visit will occur on the same day subjects are scheduled for their
      clinically indicated right heart catheterization or who volunteer for a research right heart
      catheterization for this specific study. Subjects on oral background PAH therapy (ETRA or
      PDE5I) will be instructed to hold their regimen on the day of the study visit.

      Subjects will receive nebulized AIR001 doses escalated based upon safety and tolerability.
      The dose of inhaled nitrite will be delivered via electronic nebulizer. During the study
      right heart/pulmonary artery hemodynamics will be measured as well as noninvasive systemic
      blood pressure monitoring. Subjects will be tested for the changes in pulmonary vascular
      resistance (PVR) using standard clinical protocol hemodynamic recordings of right atrial,
      right ventricular, and pulmonary artery pressures, in addition to cardiac output at time
      zero,

      3 Day phone follow up

      30 Day follow up visit: All subjects enrolled in the study will be followed for 30 days (+/-
      5 day window) after completion of the study treatment. A physical exam and clinical labs will
      be obtained at this visit.

    <description>Linear mixed effects model across all time points and doses relative to baseline. The mixed effects model takes into account all time points combined (repeated measures) and has been extensively described for clinical trials (please see references). In this model, the effect of treatment on hemodynamics (measured at 0, 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes after 45mg followed by same times after 90 mg dose) was compared with baseline values. We assessed the overall linear trend of treatment. The effect of treatment on hemodynamics in each patient group was assessed separately in mixed-effects models. Since pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) was not normally distributed, it was transformed to natural log prior to analysis. The reported mean is the change from baseline of PVR over all subsequent times and doses (beta from the mixed effects model, converted back from natural log to Woods units), and is reported as the mean and 95% confidence interval.</description>

        <description>Linear mixed effects model across all time points and doses relative to baseline. The mixed effects model takes into account all time points combined (repeated measures) and has been extensively described for clinical trials (please see references). In this model, the effect of treatment on hemodynamics (measured at 0, 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes after 45mg followed by same times after 90 mg dose) was compared with baseline values. We assessed the overall linear trend of treatment. The effect of treatment on hemodynamics in each patient group was assessed separately in mixed-effects models. Since pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) was not normally distributed, it was transformed to natural log prior to analysis. The reported mean is the change from baseline of PVR over all subsequent times and doses (beta from the mixed effects model, converted back from natural log to Woods units), and is reported as the mean and 95% confidence interval.</description>

        <description>Linear mixed effects model across all time points and doses relative to baseline. The mixed effects model takes into account all time points combined (repeated measures) and has been extensively described for clinical trials (please see references). In this model, the effect of treatment on hemodynamics (measured at 0, 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes after 45mg followed by same times after 90 mg dose) was compared with baseline values. We assessed the overall linear trend of treatment. The effect of treatment on hemodynamics in each patient group was assessed separately in mixed-effects models. The reported mean is the change from baseline of MAP over all subsequent times and doses (beta from the mixed effects model), and is reported as the mean and 95% confidence interval.</description>

        <title>Change in Plasma Nitrite Concentrations in Mixed Venous Blood</title>
        <description>Linear mixed effects model across all time points and doses relative to baseline. The mixed effects model takes into account all time points combined (repeated measures) and has been extensively described for clinical trials (please see references). In this model, the effect of treatment on hemodynamics (measured at 0, 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes after 45mg followed by same times after 90 mg dose) was compared with baseline values. We assessed the overall linear trend of treatment. The effect of treatment on hemodynamics in each patient group was assessed separately in mixed-effects models. The reported mean is the change from baseline of plasma nitrite concentrations in mixed venous blood over all subsequent times and doses (beta from the mixed effects model), and is reported as the mean and 95% confidence interval.</description>
