  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study has two parts, dose escalation and dose expansion. For dose escalation, the
      primary objective is to estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of AEB071 in patients with
      uveal melanoma. For dose expansion, the primary objective is to characterize the safety and
      tolerability of the MTD of AEB071 in patients with uveal melanoma.
