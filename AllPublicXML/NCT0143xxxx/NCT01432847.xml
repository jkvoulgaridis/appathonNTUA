      Background:

      - Best Vitelliform Dystrophy (Best disease), Late-Onset Retinal Degeneration (L-ORD), and
      Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) all affect the retina, the light sensing area at the
      back of the eye. Doctors cannot safely obtain retinal cells to study these diseases. However,
      cells collected from hair follicles, skin, and blood can be used for research. Researchers
      want to collect cells from people with Best disease, L-ORD, and AMD, and compare their cells
      with those of healthy volunteers.

      Objectives:

      - To collect hair, skin, and blood samples to study three eye diseases that affect the
      retina: Best disease, L-ORD, and AMD.

      Eligibility:

        -  Individuals affected with ocular condition is one year of age or older.

        -  Individuals affected with Best disease, L-ORD, or AMD is 18 years of age or older.

        -  Unaffected individuals are seven years of age or older.

      Design:

        -  The study requires one visit to the National Eye Institute.

        -  Participants will be screened with a medical and eye disease history. They will also
           have an eye exam.

        -  Participants will provide a hair sample, a blood sample, and a skin biopsy. The hair
           will be collected from the back of the head, and the skin will be collected from the
           inside of the upper arm.

      This study will establish a repository of biospecimens to generate induced pluripotent stem
      (iPS) cells, which will be used to determine molecular mechanisms for potentially blinding
      eye diseases including but not limited to: Best Vitelliform Dystrophy (Best Disease);
      Late-Onset Retinal Degeneration (L-ORD); Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD); Leber
      congenital amaurosis (LCA); Joubert syndrome; X-linked retinitis pigmentosa (RP);
      oculocutaneous albinism; Stargardt s with ABCA4 gene mutations; Waardenburg syndrome,
      coloboma, Enhanced S-Cone syndrome (ESCS), Spinocerebellar Ataxia, Type 7 (SCA7) and eye
      diseases associated with MITF, PAX2, or PAX6 gene mutations. Skin fibroblasts, hair
      keratinocytes, and/or blood cells may be collected from participants with retinal diseases
      and from age, gender and ethnicity-matched healthy participants.

      Although research involving multiple different ocular cell types from these patients may be
      performed, the vast majority of the work will be centered on the retinal pigment epithelium
      (RPE) and neural retina. RPE and/or neural retinal cells generated from the iPS cells of
      participants with retinal diseases and healthy volunteers will be used to analyze molecular
      mechanisms involved in disease initiation and progression. In addition, the iPS cell-derived
      ocular cells will be used to perform high throughput (HTP) drug screens aimed at suppressing
      the molecular phenotypes of the disease and to identify potential therapeutic agents for
      these diseases.

      Objectives: The primary objective of this study is to generate participant-iPS cells that can
      be differentiated into ocular cell types, to be used to study the molecular mechanisms of and
      to develop treatments for ocular conditions. This objective will be carried out in three
      phases. First, this study will establish a repository of fibroblasts, keratinocytes, and/or
      blood cells collected from participants with eye diseases and from matched controls without
      any eye diseases. Second, the somatic cell repository will be used to generate iPS cells,
      which will be differentiated into RPE, neural retinal and/or other ocular cells. These cells
      will be used to elucidate molecular pathways that have led to disease pathogenesis. In the
      third phase, the participant-specific ocular cells will be used to perform high throughput
      drug screens to identify novel potential therapeutic compounds. The cells obtained in this
      protocol may be genetically modified, may be transplanted into animals in the laboratory,
      and, if used in the development of cell-based therapies, may be transplanted into humans.
      Transplantation into humans will be done as a part of a different study.

      Study Population: We plan to recruit 465 participants with ocular conditions including but
      not limited to: degenerative retinal diseases, optic atrophy, microphthalmia/anophthalmia,
      ciliopathy, and other ocular developmental or degenerative conditions, and 465 healthy
      volunteers without any eye disease. If possible, unaffected siblings and relatives of
      participants with eye diseases will be included as healthy volunteers.

      Design: In this basic science, research-oriented study, skin, hair, and/or blood samples may
      be collected from affected participants with the eye diseases and/or genetic mutations under
      study, and from control participants matched for age, gender and ethnicity. The sample
      collection procedures will incur only minimal risk to adult participants. Offsite minor
      participants will not undergo the skin biopsy. This study will typically require only one
      visit by each participant. Participants may be requested to return if their initial sample(s)
      did not produce adequate cells for study in the laboratory. Participants who were previously
      enrolled to provide samples for research-grade iPS cell generation may return for an
      additional visit to provide samples for clinical-grade iPS cell generation, if eligible. The
      skin fibroblast, keratinocyte, and/or blood samples will then be used to generate
      participant-specific iPS cells, and these cells will then be differentiated into RPE, neural
      retinal and/or other ocular cell types. iPS cells may not be made from all samples. The
      investigators will use the samples for research studies aimed at identifying molecular and
      signaling pathways underlying disease onset and progression and for developing potential
      therapeutic treatments for the eye diseases under study.

      Outcome Measures: The outcome measures for this study include the creation of iPS cells from
      at least one of the three types of somatic tissues collected from each participant, the
      differentiation of iPS cells into RPE, neural retinal cells and/or other ocular cells, and
      the identification of molecular and physiological phenotypes in these cells that may be
      linked to the onset or progression of the ocular conditions being studied. This analysis may
      lead to the discovery of therapeutic interventions for these diseases. There are no specific
      participant-based clinical outcomes for this protocol. Participants will, in general, be seen
      only once for this protocol, as they will be ascertained and/or receiving standard care under
      the NEI Ocular Natural History Protocol (16-EI-0134) or other NEI protocols. In rare cases,
      participants may be requested to return to the clinic if their initial sample(s) did not
      produce adequate cells for study in the laboratory.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        To be eligible, participants must meet the following inclusion criteria.

          1. Have the ability to understand and sign an informed consent or have a parent/legal
             guardian to do so if they are minor children or have a legally authorized
             representative if they are adults without consent capacity.

          2. Participant meets one of the following criteria:

               1. Participant has been diagnosed with an ocular condition of interest including but
                  not limited to: degenerative retinal diseases, optic atrophy,
                  microphthalmia/anophthalmia, ciliopathy, and other ocular developmental or
                  degenerative conditions.

               2. Participant is free of eye diseases and could serve as an unaffected control.
                  Participant s age, gender, and ethnicity must match an existing participant with
                  one of the eye diseases under study. Control participants matched to AMD
                  participants must not have drusen greater than 63 microns in size.

          3. Adult participant is able to provide a punch skin biopsy and 30 mL of peripheral
             venous blood OR child participant is able to provide a punch skin biopsy and the
             lesser of 5 mL/kg or 30 mL of peripheral venous blood. Healthy, unaffected children
             will only have one skin punch biopsy done 3mm or less in size. This will be taken from
             children ages seven years and older. Sampling of ten occipital hairs may be pursued at
             the investigator s discretion. As a rule, samples will be collected on
             non-sedated/anesthetized participants. Sedation/anesthesia will NOT be used solely for
             the purpose of sample collection. In rare instances where a minor requires sedation
             for another medically indicated procedure, samples may be collected at the time of
             sedation/anesthesia. Because young children may not be able to cooperate with sample
             collection, those unable to provide a skin biopsy and a blood sample may be excluded
             from the study, based on the judgment of the examining investigator.

          4. Participant meets one of the following criteria:

               1. Participant affected with an ocular condition is one year of age or older.

               2. Participant affected with Best disease, L-ORD, or AMD is 18 years of age or
                  older.

               3. Unaffected participant is seven years of age or older and willing and able to
                  provide assent.

          1. Participant is unable to comply with study procedures.

          2. Participant has a systemic disease that, in the opinion of the investigator,
             compromises the ability to provide adequate samples. Examples of co-existing diseases
             that would exclude a participant include a bleeding diathesis or a genetic
             susceptibility to infections, particularly cutaneous infections.

        ADDITIONAL CRITERIA FOR CLNICAL-GRADE CELL LINE GENERATION:

        The additional eligibility criteria must be met for participants donating samples for the
        generation of clinical-grade cell lines.
