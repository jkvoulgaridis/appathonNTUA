      The purpose of this study is to examine whether vilazodone attenuates the memory and mood
      effects of corticosteroids on the human hippocampus in 24 healthy controls.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In animals and humans, stress and corticosteroid excess are associated with changes in
      hippocampal structure and functioning. These findings have important implications to the
      millions of patients taking prescription corticosteroids and to patients with major
      depressive disorder or bipolar disorder who have elevated cortisol levels and memory
      impairment. The investigators believe that vilazodone may be a medication that can block the
      effects of hydrocortisone on the human hippocampus. The investigators propose to examine
      whether vilazodone attenuates the effects of corticosteroids in a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled pilot study using a within-subject crossover design.

    <measure>Change From Baseline RAVLT (Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test) Total T-Score at Day 19</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 19</time_frame>
    <description>The Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) measures verbal or declarative learning and memory. The test consists of 15 nouns read aloud for five consecutive trials with each trial followed by a free-recall trial. Following the fifth trial, an interference list of 15 different words is presented followed by a free-recall trial of that list. Delayed recall of the first list is tested immediately following the interference list and after a 20-minute delay. Equivalent, alternative versions (different words) were used to minimize practice or learning effects from repeated administration. The raw scores (number of words correct across trials 1-5) are converted to standardized T-scores (M=50; SD=10). This score is used to determine the participant's performance in relation to norm-referenced expectations based on age and sex. Higher score reflects better performance, and the values reflect scores at baseline minus the scores at Day 19.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline RAVLT (Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test) Total T-Score at Day 19</title>
        <description>The Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) measures verbal or declarative learning and memory. The test consists of 15 nouns read aloud for five consecutive trials with each trial followed by a free-recall trial. Following the fifth trial, an interference list of 15 different words is presented followed by a free-recall trial of that list. Delayed recall of the first list is tested immediately following the interference list and after a 20-minute delay. Equivalent, alternative versions (different words) were used to minimize practice or learning effects from repeated administration. The raw scores (number of words correct across trials 1-5) are converted to standardized T-scores (M=50; SD=10). This score is used to determine the participant's performance in relation to norm-referenced expectations based on age and sex. Higher score reflects better performance, and the values reflect scores at baseline minus the scores at Day 19.</description>
