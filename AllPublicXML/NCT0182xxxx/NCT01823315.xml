  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators conducted a trial to determine whether methotrexate or
      methotrexate/dactinomycin single-course treatment work well as multiple courses of single
      methotrexate chemotherapy in low-risk gestational trophoblastic neoplasia. It is not yet
      known whether single-course of chemotherapy is as the same effectiveness as multicourse.

    <description>Regimen: Methotrexate 0.4mg/(kg·d) intramuscularly (IM) on days 1-5. If 10-fold fall of hCG achieved 18 days after treatment completion, success of primary single-course chemotherapy was defined and further treatment was withheld; otherwise, failure was defined and the patient was referred to multi-course chemotherapy. During the period of observation for those with success, if the level of hCG became stationary for at least 3 weeks or rose again, the patient was also referred to multi-course chemotherapy. Additional consolidation chemotherapy with 1-3 courses was given for those who achieved CR by multi-course chemotherapy, but not by single-course regimen.</description>

    <description>Regimen: methotrexate 0.4mg/(kg·d) intramuscularly (IM) on days 1-5, 2-week intervals. Patients continue on treatment until 1 beta HCG titer is below the institutional normal. Patients then receive at least 1 additional consolidation treatment.
After treatment, all the patients were asked for contraception with condom or oral contraception. Regular hCG surveillance, once a month for 3 consecutive months and once every 3 months for 2 years, was performed. During follow-up period, pelvic ultrasound and pulmonary X ray or CT scan were conducted if needed.</description>
