  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infantile spasms constitute a unique age specific epilepsy syndrome of infancy, characterized
      by epileptic spasms often accompanied by neurodevelopmental regression and an EEG finding of
      hypsarrhythmia. When all 3 components are present, the eponym &quot;West syndrome&quot; is commonly
      used. West syndrome is a catastrophic epileptic encephalopathy. It does not respond well to
      standard anti-epileptic drugs. Hormonal therapy is the mainstay in the treatment of infantile
      spasms. This includes adreno-cortico trophic hormone (ACTH) and oral steroids. Variable dose
      of prednisolone used in the treatment. Oral prednisolone used in usual dose (2mg/kg) has been
      shown to be less effective as compared to ACTH. High dose prednisolone (4mg/kg) has been used
      in the treatment of infantile spasms, which has been shown to be as effective as ACTH.
      Pyridoxine has been used as first line treatment in Japan, however there is paucity of data
      on the efficacy of combination of pyridoxine with hormonal therapy. There are no studies
      comparing add on pyridoxine with high prednisolone versus high dose prednisolone alone in the
      treatment of infantile spasms. Therefore the study has been planned to see whether the
      addition of pyridoxine with high dose prednisolone in the treatment of infantile spasms
      improves the efficacy in terms of spasm cessation.
