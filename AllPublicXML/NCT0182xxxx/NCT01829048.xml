    <measure>Change From Baseline in Abbreviated Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (ESRS-A) Scores (Cohorts 1 and 2) at Day 10</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 (Baseline) up to Day 10</time_frame>
    <description>ESRS-A is a clinician rated scale consisting of 24 items to assess severity of extrapyramidal symptoms for following parameters: parkinsonism (10 items), dystonia (6 items), dyskinesia (6 items) and akathisia (2 items). Each item was scored on a 6-point scale (0=absent, 1=minimal, 2=mild, 3=moderate, 4=severe, 5=extreme). Additionally, 4 Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) items were assessed on a 7-point scale (1=normal, not ill at all; 2=borderline mentally ill; 3=mildly ill; 4=moderately ill; 5=markedly ill; 6=severely ill; 7=extremely ill): CGI-S parkinsonism; CGI-S dystonia; CGI-S dyskinesia; CGI-S akathisia.</description>

        <description>ESRS-A is a clinician rated scale consisting of 24 items to assess severity of extrapyramidal symptoms for following parameters: parkinsonism (10 items), dystonia (6 items), dyskinesia (6 items) and akathisia (2 items). Each item was scored on a 6-point scale (0=absent, 1=minimal, 2=mild, 3=moderate, 4=severe, 5=extreme). Additionally, 4 Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) items were assessed on a 7-point scale (1=normal, not ill at all; 2=borderline mentally ill; 3=mildly ill; 4=moderately ill; 5=markedly ill; 6=severely ill; 7=extremely ill): CGI-S parkinsonism; CGI-S dystonia; CGI-S dyskinesia; CGI-S akathisia.</description>

        <description>ESRS-A is a clinician rated scale consisting of 24 items to assess severity of extrapyramidal symptoms for following parameters: parkinsonism (10 items), dystonia (6 items), dyskinesia (6 items) and akathisia (2 items). Each item is scored on a 6-point Likert scale (0=absent, 1=minimal, 2=mild, 3=moderate, 4=severe, 5=extreme). Additionally, 4 CGI-S items were assessed on a 7-point scale (1=normal, not ill at all; 2=borderline mentally ill; 3=mildly ill; 4=moderately ill; 5=markedly ill; 6=severely ill; 7=extremely ill): CGI-S parkinsonism; CGI-S dystonia; CGI-S dyskinesia; CGI-S akathisia.</description>
