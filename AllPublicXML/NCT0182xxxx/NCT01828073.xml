  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine the washout pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety of in
      utero/intrapartum exposure to maternal raltegravir (RAL) in infants born to pregnant women
      with HIV infection who received RAL 400 mg twice daily. The study also provided data for the
      development of an infant RAL starting dosing regimen for IMPAACT P1110 (NCT01780831).

      Study participants were enrolled in two cohorts.

        -  Cohort 1 enrolled mother-infant pairs in which the infant was expected to be ≥2000 grams
           at birth (i.e. full term) at time of enrollment and the mother was living with HIV and
           received RAL 400 mg twice daily for at least 2 weeks prior to delivery and continued to
           receive antiretroviral (ARV) drugs during labor.

        -  Cohort 2 enrolled mother-infant pairs in which the infant was expected to be ≤2500 grams
           at birth [i.e. low birth weight (LBW)] at time of enrollment and the mother was living
           with HIV and received at least one dose of RAL 400 mg within 2 to 24 hours prior to
           delivery.

      Cohorts 1 and 2 provided pharmacokinetics and safety data of in utero and intrapartum
      exposure to maternal RAL in full-term and LBW infants, respectively. Also, the study data
      were pooled with data from IMPAACT P1066 (NCT00485264) (Cohorts IV and V) and P1026s
      (NCT00042289) to determine the starting RAL dosing regimen for full-term and LBW infants in
      IMPAACT P1110 (NCT01780831).

      The study initially opened accrual to Cohort 1 under protocol Version 1.0. Upon completion of
      accrual and follow-up of Cohort 1, the protocol was amended and accrual to and follow-up of
      Cohort 2 was under protocol Version 2.0.

      No study-specific treatment was given to the participants during this study. The women
      (mothers) received RAL for clinical indications outside of the study. Infants received
      standard of care ARV therapy for prophylaxis of perinatal transmission of HIV as prescribed
      by their primary care physicians.

      Cohort 1 mother-infant pairs were enrolled prior to delivery. The women were followed-up
      until discharge from the labor/delivery unit. Infants were followed from birth through 20
      weeks after birth. If infant was eligible for PK sampling (see &quot;Eligibility&quot; section), blood
      samples were collected at 1-5, 8-14, 18-24, and 30-36 hours after birth. Protocol defined
      infant safety evaluations were at birth, and at 8-14 hours, 30-36 hours, 1 week and 20 weeks
      after birth.

      Cohort 2 mother-infant pairs were enrolled prior to delivery or within 48 hours after
      delivery. The women were followed-up until discharge from the labor/delivery unit. Infants
      were followed from birth/entry through 6 weeks after birth. If infant was eligible for PK
      sampling, blood samples were collected at 1-6, 12-24, 36-48, 72-84, and 108-132 hours and
      7-14 days after birth. Protocol defined infant safety evaluations were at entry/birth, and at
      36-48 hours, 72-84 hours, 1 week and 6 weeks after birth.

      For both cohorts, all infants regardless of whether they were eligible for PK sampling were
      included in the safety analyses. Infant safety data included adverse birth outcomes,
      signs/symptoms, diagnoses and chemistry/hematology test results. Protocol required chemistry
      tests were AST, ALT, serum creatinine, total bilirubin and direct bilirubin. Protocol
      required hematology tests were CBC with differential and platelet count. Also included in the
      safety data were additional laboratory events done outside of the study but considered by the
      site as relevant information.

      For both cohorts, maternal blood and cord blood for RAL concentration testing were collected
      at delivery when specimen collection was possible. The optional genotypic testing (i.e.
      testing was done only if the mother consented) was limited to infants who were eligible for
      PK sampling. Information obtained about the effect of UGT1A1 polymorphisms on the PK of RAL
      was thought to provide a better understanding of the effect of genetics on the metabolism of
      RAL in neonates.

    <description>Neonatal RAL elimination was the time required for neonatal plasma concentration to decrease by one-half. Genotyping for polymorphisms of UGT1A1 were performed on infants who were eligible for PK sampling and were consented by their mothers/guardians(i.e. genotyping was optional) .

        Participants were enrolled in two cohorts.

        Cohort 1 enrolled Mother-Infant (M-I) pairs prior to delivery. Infants expected to be full
        term (i.e. ≥2000 grams at birth) born to women with HIV-1 infection who received RAL 400 mg
        twice daily for at least two weeks prior to delivery and continued to receive ARVs during
        labor, and their mothers, were enrolled to Cohort 1.

        Cohort 2 enrolled M-I pairs prior to delivery or within 48 hours after delivery. Infants
        expected to be LBW (i.e. ≤2500 grams at birth) born to women with HIV-1 infection who
        received at least one dose of RAL 400 mg within 2 to 24 hours prior to delivery, and their
        mothers, were enrolled to Cohort 2.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Participant study inclusions and exclusion criteria are listed below.

        Cohort 1 M-I pairs were enrolled prior to delivery so that only maternal study inclusion
        and exclusion criteria were assessed at enrollment.

        Cohort 1: Maternal Study Inclusion Criteria

          -  Documentation of HIV-1 infection.

          -  Viable singleton pregnancy with gestational age of at least 35 weeks based on clinical
             or other obstetrical measurements with normal fetal anatomy

          -  Currently receiving RAL 400 mg twice daily for at least 2 weeks prior to enrollment in
             combination with other ARV agents for clinical care

          -  Plan to continue taking RAL in combination with other ARV agents through labor prior
             to delivery

          -  Willing and intends to deliver at the study-affiliated clinic or hospital

          -  Willing and able to sign informed consent for participation of herself and her infant.
             Participant must be of an age to provide legal informed consent as defined by the
             country in which she resides. If not, informed consent must be signed by a legal
             guardian.

        Cohort 1: Maternal Study Exclusion Criteria

        - Receipt of disallowed medications (phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampin) within 4 weeks
        prior to enrollment

        Cohort 1 Infants were enrolled prior to delivery so there were no infant study
        inclusion/exclusion criteria. However, only infants who met the following criteria were
        eligible for PK blood sampling. Infants ineligible for PK sampling remained in the study
        and were followed-up for safety.

        Cohort 1: Infant PK Sampling Inclusion Criteria

          -  Infant born to women who received at least 2 weeks of RAL prior to delivery and
             continue to receive RAL during labor prior to delivery in addition to their other ARV
             drugs

          -  Infant birth weight of at least 2 kg

          -  Infant at least 37 weeks gestation at delivery

          -  Infant not receiving disallowed medications (phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampin). If
             these medications are required for the infant's care, the infant will be ineligible
             for further PK sampling. PK samples will be obtained up to the time of the
             introduction of the disallowed medication.

        Cohort 1: Infant PK Sampling Exclusion Criteria

        - Infant has a severe congenital malformation or other medical condition not compatible
        with life or that would interfere with study participation or interpretation, as judged by
        the examining clinician

        Cohort 2 enrolled M-I pairs at two time points: prior to delivery and within 48 hours after
        delivery.

          -  For M-I pairs enrolled prior to delivery, the maternal study eligibility criteria were
             assessed at enrollment. There were no infant study eligibility criteria. However, only
             infants who met the PK sampling eligibility criteria had PK blood sampling. Infants
             ineligible for PK sampling remained in the study and were followed-up for safety.

          -  For M-I pairs enrolled within 48 hours delivery, the maternal and infant study
             eligibility criteria were assessed at enrollment. A M-I pair was enrolled only if both
             the mother and the infant were eligible for the study. For multiple births, only
             infants who met the study eligibility criteria were enrolled.

        Cohort 2: Maternal Study Inclusion Criteria: M-I pairs enrolled prior to delivery

          -  Documentation of HIV-1 infection.

          -  Viable singleton or multiple birth pregnancy based on clinical or other obstetrical
             measurements with infant birth weight anticipated to be less than or equal to 2,500
             grams

          -  RAL is currently used as part of maternal ARV regimen and planned to continue through
             labor and delivery

          -  Willing and intends to deliver at the study-affiliated clinic or hospital

          -  Willing and able to sign informed consent for participation of herself and her infant.
             Participant must be of an age to provide legal informed consent as defined by the
             country in which she resides. If not, informed consent must be signed by a legal
             guardian.

        Cohort 2: Maternal Study Exclusion Criteria: M-I pairs enrolled prior to delivery

        - Receipt of disallowed medications (phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampin) within 4 weeks
        prior to enrollment or intent to be on any of the disallowed medications prior to delivery.

        Cohort 2: Infant PK Blood Sampling Eligibility Criteria: M-I pairs enrolled prior to
        delivery

        Infants were enrolled prior to delivery so there were no infant study eligibility criteria.
        Only infants who met the following criteria were eligible for PK blood sampling:

          -  Infant born to woman who received at least one dose of RAL within 2 to 24 hours prior
             to delivery. Dose administered to mother must have been at least 2 hours prior to
             delivery to allow time for adequate absorption and distribution.

          -  Infant birth weight less than or equal to 2,500 grams

          -  Infant not receiving disallowed medications (phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampin) as
             described in the protocol. If these medications are required for the infant's care,
             the infant will be ineligible for further PK sampling. PK data will be obtained up to
             the time of the introduction of the disallowed medication.

          -  Infant less than or equal to 48 hours of age

          -  Infant does not have any severe congenital malformation or other medical condition not
             compatible with life or that would interfere with study participation or
             interpretation, as judged by the examining clinician

        Cohort 2: Maternal Study Inclusion Criteria: M-I pairs enrolled after delivery

          -  Documentation of HIV-1 infection.

          -  Received at least one dose of RAL within 2 to 24 hours prior to delivery

          -  Willing and able to sign informed consent for participation of herself and her infant.
             Participant must be of an age to provide legal informed consent as defined by the
             country in which she resides. If not, informed consent must be signed by a legal
             guardian.

        <description>Neonatal RAL elimination was the time required for neonatal plasma concentration to decrease by one-half. Genotyping for polymorphisms of UGT1A1 were performed on infants who were eligible for PK sampling and were consented by their mothers/guardians(i.e. genotyping was optional) . The goal of the genotypic analysis is to determine if certain polymorphisms, particularly those with the UGT1A1*28/*28 genotype have slower RAL elimination than those with the UGT1A1*1/*1 genotype.</description>
        <time_frame>Genotype was assessed close to birth and if this is not possible at 1-2 wks after birth. PK samples were collected at 1-5, 8-14, 18-24 and 30-36 hrs after birth for Cohort 1; 1-6, 12-24, 36-48, 72-84 and 108-132 hrs after birth, and day 7-14 for Cohort 2.</time_frame>
