    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies molecular profiling-based assignment of cancer therapy (MPACT) in
      treating patients with solid tumors that have spread to other places in the body and usually
      cannot be cured or controlled with treatment (advanced). Adavosertib, everolimus, and
      trametinib are drugs that each target a specific variation in tumors by blocking different
      proteins needed for cell growth. Veliparib blocks an enzyme that helps repair
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damaged by chemotherapy, which may help chemotherapy drugs work
      better. It is not yet known whether testing patients for variations in their tumor and
      assigning treatment targeting the variation is more effective than standard non-targeted
      therapy in treating advanced solid tumors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Evaluate the proportion of patients with objective response (OR) to targeted study
      agent(s) in patients with advanced refractory cancers.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 4 treatment regimens corresponding to one of their
      mutation/amplification categories.

      REGIMEN I: Patients receive veliparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-7 and
      temozolomide PO once daily (QD) on days 1-5. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      REGIMEN II: Patients receive adavosertib PO BID for 5 doses starting on day 1 and carboplatin
      intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. (No longer an active study drug as of March
      2018)

      REGIMEN III: Patients receive everolimus PO QD on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. (No longer an active study drug
      as of March 2018)

      REGIMEN IV: Patients receive trametinib PO QD on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. (No longer an active study drug
      as of March 2018)

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days. Patients with
      unacceptable toxicities that have not resolved by day 30 are followed up biweekly until
      stabilization or resolution.

             combination of temozolomide plus a PARP inhibitor should not be considered eligible
             for a biopsy given that these patients would not be eligible for the active veliparib
             plus temozolomide arm

          -  TREATMENT: Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding

          -  TREATMENT: Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents; patients on
             other trials will be eligible as long as they are no longer receiving study treatment

          -  TREATMENT: Patients with active brain metastases or carcinomatous meningitis are
             excluded from this clinical trial; patients who have a history of seizures are not
             eligible to receive veliparib

          -  TREATMENT: Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited
             to psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
             requirements, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, myocardial infarction in the past 6 months, invasive fungal infections, or
             active (acute or chronic) or uncontrolled severe infection, liver disease such as
             cirrhosis, decompensated liver disease, and active and chronic hepatitis (i.e.,
             quantifiable HBV-DNA and/or positive HbsAg, quantifiable HCV-RNA) are not eligible to
             participate; testing for hepatitis B or other infections for eligibility will be
             performed only if clinically indicated

          -  TREATMENT: Patients with gastrointestinal conditions that might predispose for drug
             intolerability or poor drug absorption (e.g., inability to take oral medication or a
             requirement for IV alimentation, prior surgical procedures affecting absorption,
             malabsorption syndrome, and active peptic ulcer disease) are excluded; subjects with
             Crohn's disease or a partial or complete small bowel obstruction are also excluded, as
             are any patients who cannot swallow tablets or capsules whole; tablets or capsules
             must not be crushed or chewed; nasogastric or G-tube administration is not allowed

          -  TREATMENT: HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible
             because of the potential for PK interactions

          -  TREATMENT: Eligibility of subjects receiving any medications or substances known to
             affect or with the potential to affect the activity or pharmacokinetics (i.e.,
             cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A, polypeptide 4 [CYP450], P-glycoprotein [PgP])
             of any of the study drugs will be determined following review of their cases by the
             principal investigator (PI); patients on strong and moderate cytochrome P450 system
             inducers or inhibitors are ineligible; every effort would be made to switch patients
             off medications that are known substrates of CYP450; if it is medically important for
             the patient to remain on such medications, these patients can still be eligible to
             participate based on PI discretion

          -  TREATMENT: Patients who require use of coumarin-derivative anticoagulants such as
             warfarin are excluded; low molecular weight heparin is permitted for prophylactic or
             therapeutic use

          -  TREATMENT: Patients who have a history of another primary malignancy, with the
             exceptions of: non-melanoma skin cancer, and carcinoma in situ of the cervix, uteri,
             or breast from which the patient has been disease free for &gt; 3 years

          -  TREATMENT: Patients with treatment-related acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
             (t-AML)/myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), or with features suggestive of AML/MDS, or who
             have had prior allogeneic bone marrow transplant or double umbilical cord blood
             transplantation, should not receive veliparib due to reports of MDS and leukemia
             secondary to oncology therapy on Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP)-sponsored
             studies utilizing veliparib
