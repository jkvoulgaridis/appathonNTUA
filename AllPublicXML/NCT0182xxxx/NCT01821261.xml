  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be given special instructions about eating, smoking and taking care of their
      teeth during the 18 hours before they come to the dentist's office for screening. At that
      first visit, they will be examined by a dentist, who will examine their mouths with a dental
      instrument to determine whether they qualify to participate in the trial. Someone who works
      for the dentist will also take some oral measurements.

      Participants who qualify to be in the study will receive a treatment for their gingivitis and
      have an equal chance of being assigned to one of three treatment groups. Subjects in all
      three groups will be given toothpaste that is already available in stores. They will brush
      their teeth twice daily with a one-inch strip of toothpaste in their regular manner. After
      brushing, subjects in one group will use an experimental mouth rinse that is not available in
      stores. Another group will be given a mouth rinse to use that is already available in stores,
      and the third group will not use any mouth rinse at all. After they receive their assigned
      products subjects will be supervised while they brush their teeth and/or rinse to ensure they
      understand exactly how to use the products. All other brushing and rinsing over the next
      three months will be at home, but subjects will be required to keep a diary to record their
      brushing and rinsing times twice each day.

      Subjects will be required to bring their diaries and any leftover toothpaste and mouth rinse
      with them for four more scheduled appointments after about 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 3
      months. At those appointments, the dentist will examine their mouths, make sure there are no
      safety concerns, and examine again to get the measurements needed. One of the dentist's staff
      members will take other measurements as well.

      The study will determine the measured effects of the experimental mouth rinse on gingivitis,
      and compare these results to the mouth rinse that is already available, as well as to using
      no mouth rinse at all.

      At screening/baseline, subjects will present to the clinical site having refrained from oral
      hygiene for at least 8 hours, but no more than 18 hours, and from eating or smoking for at
      least 4 hours for baseline examinations. Baseline examinations will include Macpherson
      modification of the Lobene Stain Index (Extrinsic Stain), Volpe-Manhold Index (Calculus), and
      oral hard and soft tissue exam, Modified Gingival Index (MGI), Bleeding Index (BI) and Plaque
      Index (PI). After the baseline oral examinations, subjects who qualify will receive a
      whole-mouth supragingival dental prophylaxis and random assignment to one of three treatment
      groups.

      Subjects randomized to the control group will brush twice daily with a marketed fluoride
      toothpaste. Subjects randomized to the experimental group will brush twice daily with a
      marketed fluoride toothpaste and use an experimental mouth rinse. The last randomized group
      will brush twice daily with a marketed fluoride toothpaste and rinse with a marketed mouth
      rinse twice daily. The first product use will be conducted under supervision of study
      personnel. All other brushing and rinsing will be unsupervised and the subjects will be
      required to maintain a diary card to document twice-daily product use, with brushing and
      rinsing times. Diaries along with product accountability will be used to check for subject
      compliance.

      Subjects will return to the clinical site after one week (Day 7±1 day), two weeks (Day 14±2
      days), four weeks (Day 28±3 days) and three months (Day 91±5 days). Oral hard and soft tissue
      safety, MGI, BI, and PI will be assessed at all visits. Extrinsic Stain and Calculus will be
      assessed at baseline, four weeks and three months by a different examiner.

      At the end of the study, subjects will return all used and unused product to the clinical
      site.
