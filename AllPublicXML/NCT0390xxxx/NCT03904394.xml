  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exercise is probably the most effective approach to reduce blood pressure. In fact, a single
      bout of exercise induces a physiological response known as Post-Exercise Hypotension (PEH)
      where a prolonged decrease in resting blood pressure occurs in the minutes and hours after
      exercise. However, it is not fully understood how this response triggers. Recent evidence
      suggests that oral bacteria may play a key role in blood pressure control by enhancing
      nitrite, and then nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability under resting conditions in humans.
      However, no previous study has investigated whether this is a key mechanism involve in PEH.
      Thus, the main aim of this study was to investigate if the oral nitrate/nitrite pathway is a
      key regulator of PEH and vasodilation in healthy humans.

    <time_frame>Baseline and 1 hour and 2 hours after exercise</time_frame>
    <description>Blood pressure was measured before and at 1 hour and 2hours after exercise using an electronic sphygmomanometer (ProBP 3400, Welch Allyn). The second and third readings will be averaged to determine mean blood pressure.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in reactive hyperaemia</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 1 hour and 2 hours after exercise</time_frame>
    <description>Tissue oxygenation index (TOI) were recorded on the left forearm (extensor digitorum) using a NIRS system (NIRO-200NX, Hamamatsu) before exercise and 2 hours after exercise. After baseline measurements (2 minutes), an automatic pneumatic cuff (Hokanson E-20 AG101) was inflated ~5cm above the elbow for 5 minutes to an occlusion pressure of 200 mmHg. Then, inflation of the cuff was rapidly released (&lt; 1 second) and the NIRS measurements were continuously monitored for 5 minutes.</description>
