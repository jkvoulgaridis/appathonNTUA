  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Problem: A significant proportion of patients with cancer experience symptoms of sensory,
      motor or autonomic nerve damage from chemotherapy known as chemotherapy-induced peripheral
      neuropathy (CIPN). CIPN is a major dose-limiting toxicity of many chemotherapeutic regimens.
      Little is known about the natural history of CIPN, and the early detection and quantification
      of CIPN is a significant challenge.

      Design: The investigators propose a cohort study to evaluate the performance of the
      Pressure-Specified Sensory Device TM (PSSD) in assessing CIPN associated with various common
      chemotherapy regimens. The proposed study will examine peripheral nerve function before,
      during, and after chemotherapy treatment. Peripheral neuropathy will be assessed using the
      PSSD, the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life
      Questionnaire (QLQ) CIPN-20, and the Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument (MNSI). These
      are all established and validated methods to screen for a variety of conditions that cause
      peripheral neuropathy.

      Hypotheses: The investigators hypothesize that the PSSD will be a sensitive and specific tool
      for measuring CIPN. The onset of CIPN as detected by the PSSD will be compared with other
      screening modalities including the EORTC QLQ-CIPN20 and the MNSI.

      Importance: The development of CIPN often goes unnoticed until symptoms are bothersome.
      Having an objective tool in the care team's armament to screen for CIPN could have a
      significant public health impact.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pressure-Specified Sensory Device (PSSD) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The PSSD Sensory Score is based on 1-point static and 2-point static pressure thresholds and 2- point distances. Cutaneous pressure thresholds and inter-prong distances are reported by the PSSD and determined to be normal or abnormal at a 99% confidence limit based on age (&lt;/= 45, or &gt;45). These results correlate to a grading scheme which combines 1- and 2-point static pressure threshold with 2-point distance. An increase of greater than or equal to 1 grade from baseline as measured with the PSSD will be considered a meaningful change. The grading scale integrates normative data for each PSSD testing site. For the index finger pulp, big toe pulp, and first dorsal webspace of the foot, the grading scale goes from 0 to 5 inclusive. For the little finger pulp, the grading scale goes from 0 to 4 inclusive.</description>

    <measure>European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire module CIPN20 (EORTC QLQ-CIPN20)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The CIPN20 module of the EORTC QLQ, is a validated twenty item patient-reported outcomes questionnaire used to quantify symptoms of Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy. Those whose score is greater than or equal to 0.5 standard deviation increase from baseline will be considered positive for CIPN using the EORTC QLQ-CIPN20.</description>

    <description>The patient reported outcomes portion of the MNSI will be used as a secondary measure, where a higher score indicates more neuropathic symptoms.</description>
