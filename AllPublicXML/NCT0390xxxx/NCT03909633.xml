      The investigators want to study the effect of intravenous anesthesia on postoperative
      cognitive function in patients accepted gastroenteroscopy ,no additional medication or
      operation is involved.The investigators assess cognitive function through a series of tests
      for 4 times( within 3 days before the endoscopy ,2 hours after the endoscopy finished,1 week
      after the endoscopy,3 months after the endoscopy),including WCST、DSST、DST、HADS、MoCA,through
      self - contrast,the investigators will conclude whether intravenous anesthesia has bad impact
      on cognitive function or not .

    <description>The Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) is a neuropsychological test of &quot;set-shifting&quot;,.A number of stimulus cards are presented to the participant. The participant is told to match the cards, but not how to match; however, he or she is told whether a particular match is right or wrong. The test takes approximately 12-20 minutes to carry out and generates a number of psychometric scores, including numbers, percentages, and percentiles of: categories achieved, trials, errors, and perseverative errors</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in patient's cognitive dysfunction evaluated by DST</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>DST(Digit Span Test.),It is used to measure working memory's number storage capacity. Participants see or hear a sequence of numerical digits and are tasked to recall the sequence correctly, with increasingly longer sequences being tested in each trial. The participant's span is the longest number of sequential digits that can accurately be remembered. Digit-span tasks can be given forwards or backwards, meaning that once the sequence is presented, the participant is asked to either recall the sequence in normal or reverse order.Digit-span tasks are the most commonly used test for memory span, partially because performance on a digit-span task cannot be affected by factors such as semantics, frequency of appearance in daily life, complexity, etc.</description>

    <description>DSST(Digit Symbol Test).,The participants need to write the number referred to each symbol in 90 seconds.Number of hits are registered. The test measures short-term memory, visualspatial skills and attention.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in patient's cognitive dysfunction evaluated by MoCA</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>MoCA （Montreal Cognitive Assessment）, The visual spatial executive ability, naming,memory, attention, language fluency, abstract,thinking, delayed memory and directional force are included in the test, a total of 30 points. The subjects whose have less than 12-year of education were added 1 point in the testing result, with correction of bias in the degree of culture. The patients whose get higher scores indicate that the cognitive function is better, 26 points as normal.</description>
