    <textblock>
      An ileostomy is a surgical opening established by bringing the end or a loop of the ileum to
      discharge directly outside the body. This is typically done when part or the entire colon is
      removed because of IBD, cancer, or familial adenomatous polyposis. Reversal of this
      procedure, an ileostomy closure, may be done if possible. Ileostomy closure involves
      reconnecting the ileum to the remaining colon, allowing normal bowel movements again. This
      study will look at the outcomes of these surgeries in patients who were seen and operated on
      by the investigators.

      This study focused on outcomes and complications after ileostomy closure. An ileostomy is a
      surgical opening established by bringing the end or a loop of the ileum to discharge directly
      outside the body. This is typically done when part or the entire colon is removed because of
      IBD, cancer, or familial adenomatous polyposis. Reversal of this procedure, an ileostomy
      closure, may be done if possible to reconnect the ileum to the remaining colon and allow
      normal bowel movements again. This study looked at the outcomes for these surgeries in
      patients who were seen and operated on by the investigators. Patients were identified from
      the files and schedules of the investigators, and Epic was used to collect the information
      needed to determine perioperative clinical characteristics and post-operative outcomes. This
      data was kept in a secure electronic database, with identifiers removed as soon as all of the
      data was collected for a patient.
