      Aim: The study was aimed to identifying the effects of foot massage and acupressure on pain
      during heel lancing in neonates.

      Methods: A single-blinded randomized controlled trial was performed in a university hospital
      in Turkey between April-December 2018. Neonates were randomized into three groups as
      acupressure, massage and control groups. Data were obtained by using Information form,
      Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS), pulse oximeter device and chronometer. Acupressure was
      applied to the neonates in the acupressure group and massage was given to the neonates in the
      massage group for 2 minutes before heel lancing procedure. Pain levels of the neonates in the
      groups were evaluated during and 1 minute after heel lancing procedure. Furthermore, the
      oxygen saturation and heart rate values of the neonates in the groups were measured by pulse
      oximeter device before, during and after heel lancing procedure. Duration of crying and heel
      lancing procedure were recorded by chronometer.

      Massage is a systematic and scientific procedure applied by using hands or special tools. As
      for acupressure, it is a method applied by stimulating the acupuncture points using hands and
      fingers by applying pressure on the meridians in body.Both methods are reliable, economic and
      easy to learn and apply. Review of the related literature indicates studies on the
      effectiveness of acupressure and foot massage on reducing pain in neonates.

    <description>Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS): The scale was developed by Lawrence et al. in 1993 in order to asses the behavioral and physiological pain responses of premature and term neonates. The scale consists of five behavioral and one physiological sections including facial expression, crying, breathing, arm and leg movements, and alertness. Total scores range between 0 and 7. Scores from 0 to 2 indicate mild to no pain, 3 to 4 indicates mild to moderate pain, and &gt;4 indicates severe pain. Higher scores indicate more severe pain. In the study of Lawrence et al., NIPS 's Cronbach's Alpha 0.92 found (Larwence et al. 1993). The scale was adapted to Turkish by Akdovan, NIPS is used for the assessment of procedural pain of the premature and term neonates. Akdovan found the Cronbach's Alpha value to be 0.83. The pain intensity of neonates was evaluated during and 1 minute after heel lancing procedure</description>

    <description>2 neonates did not calm down before heel lancing; oxygen saturation and heart rate values of 2 neonates could not be monitored because the pulse oximeter tool probe was not fastened well.
Acupressure was performed when the mother was holding the neonate on her arm. For two minutes, acupressure was performed in the acupressure points (Kun Lun (UB60) and Taixi (K3). Each point was applied acupressure for 60 seconds, and heel lancing was performed right after this procedure. The acupuncture points that Kun Lun (UB60) and Taixi (K3) are on the side of the ankle.</description>
