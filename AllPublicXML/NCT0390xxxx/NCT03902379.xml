  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies how well web-based coping and communication skills
      intervention works in improving psychological adaptation in patients with gynecological
      cancer. Web-based intervention, such as coping and communication skills intervention, may
      help doctors to get a better understanding of ways to help gynecological cancer patients cope
      with their cancer experience.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine the feasibility and acceptability of an online coping and communication skills
      intervention (CCI).

      II. To collect pilot data on the impact of online CCI on global and cancer-specific distress.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients complete 3 modules of online CCI intervention.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 2 months.

    <measure>Examine feasibility of an online CCI as defined by participant's evaluation of the online intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Will define feasibility/acceptability as participant's evaluation of the online intervention using both qualitative and quantitative methods. Will summarize participant?s feedback by their overall impressions, the ease of use, how much the web intervention kept their attention, how much they liked the program, feedback about how the program looked, suggestions on how to improve the look, their satisfaction with the program and why, how useful they found the program and why, how easy the information was to understand and why, to what degree they think it would make them more confident in coping with cancer, what the most and least helpful components of the program were, what aspects if any were confusing, evaluation of places where navigation were unclear, and anything they would like to add to the program.</description>
