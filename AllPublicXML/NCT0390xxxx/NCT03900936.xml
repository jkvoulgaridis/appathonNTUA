      Aims

        1. To determine whether the 4 Mountains test of allocentric (i.e. viewpoint-independent)
           spatial memory, and tests of memory for a recent experience (e.g. watching a brief
           video), to diagnose the early stages of Alzheimer's disease.

        2. We operationalise this as the ability of these tests to predict whether or not an
           individual progresses from having some cognitive difficulties (diagnosed as 'mild
           cognitive impairment' MCI) to subsequently developing Alzheimer's disease up to two
           years later.

        3. To assess whether the ability to diagnose early stages of Alzheimer's disease can be
           improved by combining the scores from different memory tests, from questionnaires
           assessing spatial and social aspects of everyday life.

        4. To assess whether scores on the spatial memory test are correlated with patients'
           reports of their everyday spatial memory, using a newly-developed questionnaire.

      Outcome Measures

      Primary study objective:

      To determine the ability of allocentric spatial and episodic memory test performance to
      predict progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease.

      Secondary outcome measure

        1. To assess to what extent social characteristics of everyday life may impact upon
           progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease.

        2. To correlate allocentric spatial test performance with real-world spatial ability as
           assessed through a novel spatial questionnaire.

    <textblock>
      In recent years, the need for tests that reliably diagnose the early stages of Alzheimer's
      disease (AD) with high accuracy has been strongly emphasised. Detecting AD in its earliest
      stages increases the likelihood that therapeutic agents (e.g. newly-developed drugs) and
      interventions (e.g. changes in diet and exercise) can prolong the period of high-quality,
      independent living and reduce the impact on patients, families and care providers. An ideal
      test would have the sensitivity to detect everyone who has early-stage AD, while
      simultaneously not giving a 'false alarm' to anyone who shows some age-related impairments in
      cognition but who does not have early-stage AD. Secondly, an ideal test should be free and
      simple to administer on a national scale, without requiring extensive training on the part of
      the testers to set up, run, and interpret. Unfortunately, currently used tests do not come
      close to this ideal. There are some good biomarker-based tests for early stages of AD, but
      they are costly, highly invasive and in effect impossible to use for national screening
      purposes. MRI imaging of brain regions affected early in AD detects early AD no better than
      neuropsychological testing and whilst it is non-invasive, many patients find it aversive.
      Here, we propose to examine whether the use of spatial and episodic memory tests can get us
      nearer to this ideal, whether used singly, together, or in combination with other tests.

      The project has two stages. In stage 1, we will administer recently-developed spatial and
      episodic memory tests (along with more established neuropsychological tests) to patients who
      have recently been diagnosed with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). At stage 2, clinical
      follow up (c.15-30 months after MCI diagnosis) we will establish those patients who have, and
      have not, progressed to AD. Analysis will then determine which tests at stage 1 best
      predicted progression-to-AD at stage 2.

        Participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) will be recruited from memory clinics
        from several different trusts, including NHS South Tees NHS FT and NHS Tees, Esk and Wear
        Valleys NHS FT.

        The diagnosis of MCI will be made by clinicians in accordance with the four core clinical
        criteria of Albert et al (2011). Briefly, these are: 1) Evidence of change (worsening) in
        cognition; 2) Impairment in one or more cognitive domains greater than expected for
        age/education; 3) Preservation of independence in functional abilities; 4) No current
        dementia.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  . MCI diagnosis.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Presence of significant neurological condition such as Traumatic Brain Injury,
             Epilepsy, Stroke, Multiple Sclerosis, Brain tumour, Encephalitis, Meningitis,
             Parkinson's disease or visual impairment severe enough to hamper processing of visual
             test stimuli.

             2. Major psychiatric disorder, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and personality
             disorders such as borderline personality disorder. We will exclude severe (but not
             mild or moderate) clinical depression, and will exclude severe (but not mild or
             moderate) anxiety.

             3. The use of cognitive enhancing drugs e.g. Cholinesterase inhibitors. 4. A history
             of alcohol excess or excess of illicit drug use within the last 5 years.

        (By definition, the diagnosis of dementia excludes a participant, since this would conflict
        with the fourth basis for the MCI diagnosis)
