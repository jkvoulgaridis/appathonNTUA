    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this imaging trial is to evaluate crosssectional difference and
      longitudinal changes of [18F]PI-2620, a tau targeted positron emission computed tomography
      radioligand, in cognitively normal individuals, and subjects with mild cognitive impairment
      and Alzheimer's disease.

               -  Be â‰¥ 40 and &lt; 85 years of age at the Screening Visit.

               -  Be able to read at a 6th grade level or equivalent, (as determined by the
                  investigator, and must have a history of academic achievement and/or employment
                  sufficient to exclude mental retardation.)

               -  Be able to speak, read, hear, and understand the language of the trial staff, and
                  the informed consent form, and possess the ability to respond verbally to
                  questions, follow instructions, and complete questionnaires and detailed
                  neuropsychological test.

               -  Have results of clinical laboratory tests/physical examination, vital signs, and
                  ECG within normal limits (at 90 days prior to [18F]PI-2620 positron emission
                  computed tomography) or clinically acceptable to the investigator at screening.

               -  If female, not be of childbearing potential as indicated by one of the following

               -  Each subject (or legal representative) must sign the informed consent form in
                  accordance with local requirements after the scope and nature of the
                  investigation have been explained to them, and before screening assessments.

          2. Cognitively normal individuals

          3. Subjects with Mild Cognitive Impairment

          4. Subjects with Alzheimer Disease

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The subject must be excluded from participating in the trial if the subject fulfil any
        single criteria described below:

          1. General Exclusion Criteria

               -  Based on the investigators' judgement, if the patient is not capable of
                  communicating with the site personnel, if the patient is not proficient in the
                  language in which the psychometric tests will be completed, or if the patient is
                  not sufficient for compliance with the study procedures.

               -  The patient has an abnormal physical examination or abnormal laboratory test
                  results at the screening that are clinically significant to affect results of the
                  research, as judged by the investigator.

               -  If the patient has or is suspicious of having a hypersensitivity or allergy to
                  [18F] PI-2620 or its derivatives.

               -  The patient is pregnant, is attempting to become pregnant, or is nursing
                  (breast-feeding) children.

               -  The patient has a history of alcoholism or drug dependency/abuse within the last
                  2 years before screening.

               -  The patient has contraindications to undergo positron emission computed
                  tomography or MRI, which include but are not restricted to the examples below:
                  claustrophobia, cardiac pacemaker, metal devices around the eye or spinal cord,
                  cochlear implant, etc.) at the screening visit.

               -  The patient has been treated with any investigational medicinal product (IMP)
                  within 1 years prior to the screening visit.

          2. Cognitively normal individuals

          3. Subjects with Mild Cognitive Impairment

          4. Subjects with Alzheimer Disease
