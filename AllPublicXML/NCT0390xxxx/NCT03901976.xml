  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Falls are one of the most common NHS adverse events. With an increasing number of frail
      elderly patients being admitted this risk is likely to increase. In order to be able to
      assist patients with bed exit in a timely manner monitoring might be of help. In ZeroFall we
      will test the reliability of monitoring devices to notify care givers if a patient is
      attempting to exit the bed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In ZeroFall we intend to observe patients on risk of fall with two different devices during
      their hospital stay: The information from a no-touch optical sensing device that analyses
      movement and an under the mattress sensor that has already been used in a previous study at
      Bangor. Both are compatible with an existing monitoring system by Philips Healthcare and CE
      marked.

    <intervention_model_description>The study has several distinct phases:
Silent Phase: The devices run in the background, activity is blinded for clinicians, settings are optimized by the research team.
Run-In Phase: Bed exit notifications are turned on, notifications will be configurable for acceptability by clinical teams. Data extraction and data evaluation will be tested.
Phase I: Data collection of bed exit data of sensors as well as data related to falls
Phase II: Data collection of bed exit data with optimization of predictive algorithms
Phase III: Data collection for validation using predictive data for early notification</intervention_model_description>
