  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Salvianolic acid A has a variety of pharmacological effects, such as: anti-oxidation,
      scavenging oxygen free radicals, anti-fibrosis, anti-myocardial ischemia, anti-coagulation,
      anti-thrombosis, anti-tumor, etc. Professor Du Guanhua, at Institue of Materia Medica,
      Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, first discovered that salvianolic acid A can alleviate
      diabetic complications and improve patients' quality of life. With the support of major
      national science and technology projects, the preclinical research work of salvianolic acid A
      was completed, and the application was approved by the State Food and Drug Administration
      (Clinical Approval No.: 2016L06293).The purpose of this study is to assess the
      safety,tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of an extended dosing regimen ofsalvianolic
      acid A: open label, continuous subcutaneous infusion for 7 days were tested as ascending
      doses of salvianolic acid A from 90mg up to 180 mg.

      This was a Phase I repeated incremental doses study in healthy volunteers. A total of 24
      subjects was planned to be enrolled. This was performed according to a double blind,
      randomized, placebo controlled design and included two sequential dose groups of repeat
      doses. Each group enrolled 12 subjects on salvianolic acid A or placebo (ratio 9
      experimental: 3 placebo) and received salvianolic acid A or placebo twice daily (90mg) or
      daily (180mg) for 7 days, and follow-up to 3 or 4 days.
