  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      End-of-life (EOL) care has garnered increasing recognition and acceptance in the field of
      emergency medicine. Some emergency departments (EDs) in Singapore have instituted or plan to
      institute EOL care as part of the workflow. However, the EOL protocols are not standardised
      across all these EDs. The adherence to and quality of EOL care have not been formally
      measured in all institutions. Hence, gaps to improve the quality of care have yet to be
      determined.

      The aims are to systematically measure the current quality of EOL care in three Singapore
      hospital EDs and identify the quality gaps; formulate interventions to address these gaps and
      implement the improved EOL care; and measure the improvement post-implementation. The
      investigators hypothesise that the current quality of EOL care in three EDs is suboptimal and
      the interventions planned will improve the quality of care provided.

      The study team plans to conduct an interrupted time series study to detect whether the
      interventions have an effect significantly greater than any underlying trend over time. The
      quality of care indicators to be measured are timely identification of patients who require
      EOL care, adequacy of symptom control based on compliance to prescriptions, opportunities to
      discuss and develop an individualised care plan, perceived quality of care by healthcare
      providers and next-of-kin, and cost effectiveness. Planned interventions include refining the
      protocol with collaboration of content experts in palliative care, education and training of
      healthcare providers, and addressing specific gaps identified to improve cost effectiveness.
      The results of this study will form the standardisation and foundation for establishing the
      national benchmark for quality of EOL care in Singapore EDs.

    <description>To determine the effectiveness of the quality of care as perceived by relatives, we will perform a survey during the ED stay, with the next-of-kin to patients who was on the EOL pathway using a questionnaire developed for ED settings. The questionnaire will be administered by the research assistant face-to-face in the emergency department to assess the quality of care and the level of support provided to patients and their families in the last days of life.
We will also determine the level of staff's knowledge and perception of the EOL care using a locally-designed self-administered anonymous survey.
A focus group discussion (FGD) will be formed in each hospital to identify the gaps to the current EOL care by structured questionnaire. The group will also make recommendations to improve the quality of the EOL care. There will be separate FGD for: (i) healthcare professionals (ii) family members and (iii) general practitioners who will care for the patient if terminally discharged.</description>
