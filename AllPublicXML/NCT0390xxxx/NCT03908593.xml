      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of 12 months and 1 month of pantoprazole
      treatment to prevent upper gastrointestinal mucosal injury in patients on dual antiplatelet
      therapy (DAPT) after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).

      A single-center, open-label, randomized controlled trial to compare the efficacy of 12 months
      and 1 month of pantoprazole treatment for the prevention of upper gastrointestinal mucosal
      injury in patients on DAPT after CABG. 13C urea breath testing (UBT) is used to detect
      Helicobacter pylori infection before CABG and 12 months after CABG, respectively.
      Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is performed to evaluate the upper gastrointestinal mucosal
      injury at 6 and 12 months after CABG, respectively.

      Two subgroup analyses will be performed in this study, including: (1) Helicobacter pylori
      infection: negative and positive; (2) DAPT: aspirin + clopidogrel and aspirin + ticagrelor.

      To our knowledge, no published data or reference is available for the presence and severity
      of upper gastrointestinal mucosal injury evaluated by EGD in patients on DAPT (ticagrelor +
      aspirin). DACAB-GI-1 study, a single-center endoscopic observational study, was conducted
      with the DACAB randomized clinical trial (NCT 02201771, n=500). Briefly, patients aged 18 to
      80 years with indications for elective CABG surgery were randomized to 1 year of open-label
      antiplatelet therapy comprised of ticagrelor (90 mg twice daily) + aspirin (100 mg once
      daily), ticagrelor alone (90 mg twice daily), or aspirin alone (100 mg once daily). Upper
      gastrointestinal mucosal lesions and use of PPIs were assessed in 231 patients enrolled in
      Ruijin Hospital at 1 year post-CABG. According to the results of DACAB-GI-1, the minimum
      sample size of this study is determined to be 208 cases.

    <description>Gastroduodenal erosions and ulcers will be assessed according to the Lanza Endoscopic Scoring System. Lanza score is a categorical score (0-4) and defined as follows: 0, normal; 1, mucosal haemorrhages only; 2, 1-2 erosions; 3, 3-10 erosions; 4, &gt;10 erosions or an ulcer ≥3 mm. In addition, ≥1 ulcer with a diameter ≥5mm will be grouped separately.</description>

    <measure>Cumulative number of patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) according to the modified TIMI criteria.</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>According to the definition of non-CABG related bleeding in the modified TIMI criteria, the severity of UGIB is classified into 3 grades: major, minor and minimal. 1, Major: Clinically overt signs of hemorrhage associated with a drop in hemoglobin of ≥5 g/dL. 2, Minor: Clinically overt signs of UGIB, resulting in hemoglobin drop of 3 to &lt;5 g/dL. 3, Minimal: Any overt bleeding event that does not meet the criteria above. According to the consensus updated by the Asia-Pacific working group in 2018, patients with haemodynamic shock and signs of UGIB should be offered urgent endoscopy after resuscitation and stabilization (Gut 2018; 67:1757-68).</description>
