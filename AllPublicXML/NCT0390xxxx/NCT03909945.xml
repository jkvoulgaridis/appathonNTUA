  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The AM-HTN trial aim to investigate the effects of a tablet based on aqueous extracts of
      Annona muricata as add-on therapy in a hypertensive population.

      Patients with prehypertension or stage 1 hypertension confirmed, will be selected and assign
      in a single arm, non randomly, open label clinical trial.

      The group will receive in addition to their dietary measures, daily, one tablet of 796 mg of
      aqueous extracts of Annona muricata leaves.

      The objective of AM-HTN is to determine the antihypertensive and metabolic effects of AM
      tablets in a population of African hypertensives.

      Blood pressure profile, lipid profile, serum creatinine and transaminases profiles will be
      recorded and analysed at baseline and two months following enrolment.
