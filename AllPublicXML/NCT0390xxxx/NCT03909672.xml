    <textblock>
      Introduction: Low back pain is a very prevalent condition in the population and windsurf
      therapy has been presented as a non-pharmacological treatment currently used in this
      population. However, there is a lack of studies that evaluate such effects, besides a
      standardization of application of the technique in this condition. This protocol describes a
      placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind study that aims to assess the effectiveness of
      windsurf therapy in improving pain and other symptoms of individuals with chronic
      non-specific back pain. Methods: Ninety individuals with chronic nonspecific and localized
      chronic low back pain from 18 to 59 years, will be recruited according to the inclusion
      criteria. Afterwards they will be randomized to one of the 2 groups: intervention group (GI)
      where it will be submitted applied to the windspiration with 2 suctions; and placebo group
      (GP) with simulated application. Both applications will occur in parallel to the vertebrae
      from L1 to L5 bilaterally. The application will be performed once a week for eight weeks. The
      volunteers will be evaluated before treatment (T0), immediately after the first intervention
      (T1), 4 weeks after treatment (T4) and 8 weeks after treatment (T8). The primary endpoint
      will be pain, and the secondary ones will be kinesiophobia, physical function, lumbar range
      of motion, sleep quality, patient expectation, quality of life, and psychological factors.
      Discussion: This is the first protocol that proposes to evaluate the effect of windsotherapy
      on lumbar ROM, sleep quality, kinesiophobia and psychological problems. Few studies have been
      done on windsurfing individuals with low back pain, requiring further studies with good
      methodological quality. Because there is no consensus on the use of windsurf therapy in
      individuals with nonspecific chronic low back pain, our protocol will be the basis for the
      use of the technique by health professionals and for new studies to be performed.

    <measure>Change from Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) of Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>T0 -baseline, T4 (four week) and T8 (eight week)</time_frame>
    <description>The patients are asked to circle the number between 0 and 10. Zero usually represents 'no pain at all' whereas the upper limit represents 'the worst pain ever possible'</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Oswestry Disability Index (ODI)</measure>
    <time_frame>T0 -baseline and T8 (eight week)</time_frame>
    <description>will be used to analyze the quality of life in people with low back pain. This instrument contains in 10 items that assess the impact of low back pain on several functional activities. Values range from 0 to 5, the highest value indicating greater disability. The end result is the sum of all items.</description>

    <measure>Range of motion of the lower back (ROM)</measure>
    <time_frame>T0 -baseline, T4 (four week) and T8 (eight week)</time_frame>
    <description>Will be evaluated through the finger-to-floor test. This test presents high reliability and can be used for clinical practice and scientific studies.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Short-Form 36 questionnaire (SF-36)</measure>
    <time_frame>T0 -baseline and T8 (eight week)</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life will be assessed by the Short-Form 36 (SF-36) questionnaire. The instrument consists of 36 questions and assesses eight different domains that influence quality of life, considering the individual's perception of their health aspects in the last four weeks. Each item has a group of answers distributed on a Likert-graded scale, and the following dimensions were evaluated: physical function, physical aspect, pain, general health, vitality, social function, emotional aspect and mental health. Your total score ranges from 0 to 100, where the higher the value, the better quality of life score.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Timed Up and Go Test (TUG):</measure>
    <time_frame>T0 -baseline and T8 (eight week)</time_frame>
    <description>This is a functional test which quantifies the mobility of an individual in seconds through the time in which they perform the task, i.e. in how many seconds can they lift themselves from a chair, walk 3 meters, turn, return to the chair, and sit down again. The test has already been used in individuals to assess function in individuals with low back pain. The shorter the time taken to perform a task, the better the individual's ability to perform.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Global Perceived Effect Scale (GPE)</measure>
    <time_frame>T8 (eight week)</time_frame>
    <description>Is a direct scale about the patient's self-perception when the intervention is performed.The GPE evaluates using 11 points, starting from a negative 5 (much worse than when starting the treatment), a neutral rating of 0, and 5 is positive (much improvement from starting the treatment). The Portuguese version will be used. The GPE evaluates using 11 points, starting from a negative 5 (much worse than when starting the treatment), a neutral rating of 0, and 5 is positive (much improvement from starting the treatment) .</description>
