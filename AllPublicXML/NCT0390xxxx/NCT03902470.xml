  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thoracic procedures are routinely performed under general anesthesia (GA), with one lung
      ventilation (OLV)by double lumen tube or (GA) in spontaneously breathing patient by TIVA or
      LMA are usually combined with thoracic epidural analgesia.

      However, GA whether mechanically ventilated or spontaneously breathing may have adverse
      effects including peri-intubation hypoxia, trauma to the upper airway, mechanical
      ventilation-induced injuries, impaired cardiac performance, neuromuscular problems in OLV and
      increased risk of pneumonia, and release of proinflammatory mediators in generally.

      Recently, awake thoracic epidural anesthesia (ATEA) has been used alone in thoracic
      procedures The results achieved in early studies have been encouraging. ATEA may eventually
      provide an alternative method to GA for thoracic procedures that would not only eliminate the
      need for GA but also facilitate both surgical reconstruction and eventually patient recovery.

      Recent studies suggested better clinical outcomes with ATEA, including less intraoperative
      bleeding, a better control of postoperative pain, early mobilization and short hospital stay,
      oral intake tolerance, reduction of surgical stress response, reduction of intraoperative
      cardiac events, improvement of myocardial flow determinants and left ventricular function,
      and a reduction of complications including pulmonary, thrombotic and infectious events.

    <description>Patients in thoracic epidural (TE) group will pre-medicated using midazolam 3—4 mg intravenous (IV)and fentanyl 50 mcg intravenously(i.v.). Then patients will placed in the lateral decubitus position. An epidural catheter will be inserted between T3—T4 and T4—T5 for all thoracic procedures except sympathectomy and thymectomy. A test dose (5 ml) of 2% lidocaine will be given, followed by 15-20 ml of bupivacain 0.5% and 50 mcg of fentanyl.
The objective is to achieve sensory and motor block between C7 and T7 levels. At this level diaphragmatic respiration is maintained. The anaesthesia level will be monitored by warm—cold discrimination.</description>

    <description>Patients will receive general anesthesia as follows, Premedication in the form of 3-4 mg midazolam (IV), induction of a anesthesia with propofol (2mg/kg) and fentanyl (1 mcg/kg). Tracheal intubation and double endotracheal tube insertion will be facilitated with cisatracurium 0.1 mg/kg. and confirmation of it is position will made by fiberoptic bronchoscopy, Anesthesia will be maintained with isoflurane (1-2 %) and cisatracurium (0.05 mg/kg per dose).After the end of the operation, anesthesia will be discontinued, the wound dressing will be applied, and extubation of the patient will be done after reversal of muscle relaxant by neostigmine (0.05 mg/kg) and atropine (0.02 mg/kg) and extubation will be performed after complete neuromuscular recovery.</description>
