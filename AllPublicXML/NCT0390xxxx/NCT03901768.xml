  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the aging of population, osteoarthritis of knees and hips has become major orthopaedic
      problems in Hong Kong. Osteoarthritis of knees and hips is associated with significant pain
      problems and functional disability. Total joint replacement is the ultimate surgical
      procedure to deal with such problems.

      However total joint replacement is associated with significant tissue damage and
      post-operative pain problems, which would affect post-operative recovery and rehabilitation.

      The primary aims of total knee replacement are improvement in functional activities and
      reducing pain due to degenerated knee joints. However, there are around 20-30% of patients
      would develop significant pain problems despite uncomplicated total knee replacement. It
      accounts for major post-operative problems and burdens.

      Procedure specific analgesic method with multi-model analgesia technique is well-known to be
      useful in post-operative pain management, which reduces the post-operative pain score.
      Despite the use of multi-modal analgesic technique, pain after total joint replacement is
      still an unsolved issue. It prolongs the recovery period and increases post-operative
      analgesic consumption.

      Dexamethasone is a glucocorticoid which is associated with anti-inflammatory response. It is
      well known to have prophylaxis effect on post-operative nausea and vomiting. Perioperative
      single dose of systemic dexamethasone have shown to be useful for reduction in pain and
      cumulative opioid consumption. Meta-analysis from De Oliveira et al supports that
      dexamethasone (up to 0.2 mg/kg) is a safe and effective multimodal pain strategy after
      surgical procedures. However, this dose recommendation is not surgery specific. Recently, one
      review also supports even higher systemic steroid dose to ameliorate post-operative pain
      after hip and knee surgery. This is based on 3 RCTs using high dose steroid (125 mg
      methylpresnisolone and 40mg dexamethasone). However, large-scale safety and dose-finding
      studies are warranted before final recommendations. In view of these, it is essential to have
      more RCTs evaluating the optimal dose of steroid for pain management after hip and knee
      surgery.

      Chronic steroid use is known to be associated with infection and gastrointestinal bleeding.
      It is essential to evaluate the safety profile associated with the use of high dose steroid
      -- risk of infection, gastrointestinal bleeding and hyperglycaemia etc. Published reviews
      have not raised concerns with perioperative single-dose administration in surgical patients.
      For hyperglycemia, P. Hans et al have shown that after the use of 10 mg dexamethasone, blood
      glucose level was increased in non-diabetic and type 2 diabetic patients undergoing abdominal
      surgery, in which glucose level and percentage change of glucose level were significant
      higher in diabetic group with glucose level peaked at around 2 hours after injection. Recent
      study by Basem B. Abdelmalak et al have shown that there was a comparable
      dexamethasone-induced hyperglycemic response in the diabetic and non-diabetic groups.
      Nevertheless, there was dexamethasone-induced hyperglycaemia in both groups. Close monitoring
      of blood glucose and correction of hyperglycaemia in those patients are recommended.

      In previous studies, high-dose dexamethasone has shown to be effective and safe to be
      administered. The addition of dexamethasone to the multi-model analgesia is associated with
      anti-inflammatory response, thus extending the analgesic effect period for up to 72 hrs as
      purposed to 24-48 hrs. However, the recommended dose of dexamethasone is not surgery-specific
      and needs more studies to define the optimal dose. Therefore, it is essential to have more
      RCTs which evaluate the optimal dose of steroid for better pain management after hip and knee
      surgeries.

      Investigators have recently performed a study evaluating the effect of high-dose
      dexemathasone. It is shown that dexamethasone 16mg is effective in managing acute
      postoperative pain after total knee arthroplasty. Another study have been performed by
      investigators to show the effectiveness of local application of triamcinolone to surgical
      sites after total knee arthroplasty.

      In view of the above findings, the aim of this study is to compare the effect of intravenous
      dexamethasone, local application of triamcinolone and combined use of intravenous
      dexamethasone and local application of triamcinolone after total knee arthroplasty.

    <description>Knee society knee score is a total score which rates the knee joint and its function. Higher score represents better knee recovery. It ranges from 0 to 100. Total score is the sum of subscores. Subscales are pain, passive range of motion, stabilty, fixed flexion contracture, extension lag and alignment. Pain ranges from 0 to 50. Higher score represents milder pain. Passive range of motion ranges from 0 to 25. Higher score represents better recovery. Stability ranges from 0 to 25. Higher score represents better recovery. Fixed flexion contracture ranges from 0 to -15. Lower score represents worse recovery. Extension lag ranges from 0 to -15. Lower score represents worse recovery. Alignment ranges from 0 to -20. Lower score represents worse recovery.</description>
