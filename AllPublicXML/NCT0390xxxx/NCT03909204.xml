  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Effective treatment for constipation is a real clinical challenge especially in patients with
      severe symptoms. Dietary measures (bulking agents) and drugs (laxatives, stool softeners,
      suppositories and enemas etc.) have limited efficacy in severe cases. If conservative
      measures do not help, surgical therapies might be considered. Subsequently, antegrade enemas
      through percutaneous colonic catheter were introduced as a less invasive option for treating
      severe constipation. The cecostomy has been performed laparoscopically, percutaneously, and
      with the laparoscopic-assisted percutaneous endoscopic cecostomy (LAPEC) technique. This
      approach allows patients to deliver osmotic agents to the right colon.The procedure has been
      demonstrated to be safe and effective in young adults and pediatrics. To date, there are only
      few studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of the LAPEC procedure in adults and all have
      retrospective profile. The aim of this prospective study is to compare short and long-term
      efficacy and safety of LAPEC in patients with severe constipation. Symptoms of defecation
      will be the main outcome criteria.

    <time_frame>Exit data will be collected at 3 and 6 months after Intake data collection / PEC placement</time_frame>
    <description>Main outcome is the proportion of patients with treatment success at 3 and 6 months after the catheter placement. Treatment success is defined as a decrease of Quality of Life symptoms score at least 50% to a baseline values. To assess constipation severity the Knowles Eccersley Scott Symptom (KESS) before and throughout the study will be completed. The KESS is an 11-item tool for diagnosis of constipation. The KESS uses four- to five-point Likert scales that are scored on an unweighted linear integer scale. Total scores can range from 0 (no symptoms) to 39 (high symptom severity).</description>

    <measure>Frequency and Severity of Abdominal Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Data collection will start following consent and procedural training and will be collected daily from day 1 for the duration of the study, an expected average of 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Frequency and severity of abdominal pain will be recorded daily and measured using the Visual analog pain scale as the appropriate visual analog scale. Score is based on self-reported measures of symptoms that are recorded with a single handwritten mark placed at one point along the length of a 10-points line that represents a continuum between the two ends of the scaleâ€”&quot;no pain&quot; on the left end (0) of the scale and the &quot;worst pain&quot; on the right end of the scale (10).</description>

    <description>Administration time in minutes per flush will be defined as the time at which the tubing connected to the bag or syringe and the cecostomy fluid starts to infuse into the patient to the time the infusion is completed.</description>

    <description>Laparoscopic-Assisted Percutaneous Endoscopic Cecostomy: Initially, one to tree-laparoscopy port technique will be used, with hand placement of seroperitoneal sutures for cecal fixation. After than during colonoscopy a cecal position will be visualized and colonic lumen will be insuflated. After than the PEC tube will be introduced into the cecum using the dilators and sheath. Intravenous antibiotics will be given prior to the procedure and will continued parental temporary and later orally after catheter insertion. One weeks later, antegrade colonic enema will start during an out-patient visit including an educational training of the patient to the catheter manipulation. Antegrade enema solution will start at dose of 2ml/kg and will be increased up to 20ml/kg or a maximum dose of 2000 mL daily. Adjuvant of colonic motility stimulants are allowed during follow-up.</description>
