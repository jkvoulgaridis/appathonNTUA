      This is an open label, prospective study aimed to evaluate safety and efficacy of the Silk'n
      Tightra device.

      The study includes 12 treatment sessions 3 times a week, over a period of 4 weeks. Each
      subject will serve as her own control, while comparing results before and after treatment.
      Treatment will be performed on the internal volva for 20 min according to the device
      instructions, .

      Subjects that are interested in improving their labial appearance, and are willing to perform
      the external treatment twice a week in addition to the internal treatments, will be offered
      to conduct both treatments. The study will include one follow-up visit conducted one month
      following treatment end. During the second month of the study subjects will perform
      mainte-nance treatments and will gradually reduce the frequency of the treat-ments as
      follows:

        -  Week 5: 2 treatments

        -  Weeks 6-8: 1 treatment per week.
