  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of gastric cancer in local indigenous peoples is higher than the non-Indigenous
      counterpart in Taiwan. How to design an effective prevention strategy for gastric cancer is
      of importance. The present study aimed to identify the causes that may account for the health
      inequalities, allowing generation of a plan of action on the whole population scale.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Owing to the continuing gap in cancer burden between Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples,
      reducing health disparities has drawn worldwide attention. Evidence indicates that the
      gastric cancer incidence and mortality rates in Indigenous peoples are much higher than those
      of non-Indigenous counterparts living in the same areas. Exposure to more risk factors from
      social habits, lifestyle, and Helicobacter pylori infection has been considered the cause.
      However, even though gastric cancer has been repeatedly shown to be preventable by
      eliminating risk factors, eradication policies are rarely designed for Indigenous peoples.
      Possible obstacles may include the lack of Indigenous health statistics, inadequate access to
      care, difficulty in modifying social habits and lifestyles, and the presence of environmental
      and cultural barriers. Developing and implementing a preventive strategy following the
      evidence-based principle remains a challenge.

      In Taiwan, the number of Indigenous peoples has grown; however, their life expectancy remains
      substantially lower than that of the non-Indigenous population. Cancer is the most prevalent
      cause of death for Indigenous peoples and a disproportionate prevalence of certain kinds of
      cancer is noted for Indigenous peoples. These observations provide an opportunity to
      establish a plan of action, in which a specific intervention is developed to decrease the
      threat from each specific cancer so that the overall disparate burden can be reduced in a
      stepwise manner.
