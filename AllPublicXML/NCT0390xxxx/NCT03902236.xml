  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the reaction time and postural control and to
      investigate the relationship between reaction time, exercise capacity, muscle oxygenation and
      balance in children with cystic fibrosis (CF) and non-CF bronchiectasis. 40 patients
      including 20 CF patients and 20 non-CF bronchiectasis and 20 healthy individuals will be
      included in this study. Demographic and physical characteristics' will be recorded. Lung
      function testing will be performed. Balance will be assessed using functional reach test,
      exercise capacity was measured using the incremental shuttle walking test and reaction time
      will be assessed using ''Fitlight TrainerTM''. Heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen
      saturation, muscle oxygenation, dyspnea and fatigue perception will be measured before and
      after exercise test and reaction time measurement.

    <description>Reaction Time and Postural Control: With bunlar Fitlight TrainerTM mu≈ü, 6 led lights placed at certain points on the wall are randomly lit and expected to extinguish them as fast as possible. In the protocol, the leds will be placed according to the physical structure of the person, and the scores of 29 LEDs will be kept in seconds. The scores will be compared cystic fibrosis, bronciechtasis and healthy groups.</description>

    <description>Exercise capacity will be assessed with incremental shuttle walk test in cystic fibrosis, bronciechtasis and healthy groups.The patient is required to walk around two cones set 9 metres apart (so the final track is 10 metres) in time to a set of auditory beeps played on a CD. Initially, the walking speed is very slow, but each minute the required walking speed progressively increases.The patient walks for as long as they can until they are either too breathless or can no longer keep up with the beeps, at which time the test ends The number of shuttles is recorded. Each shuttle represents a distance of ten metres</description>

    <measure>Balance</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Balance will be assessed with functional reach test in cystic fibrosis, bronciechtasis and healthy groups Functional Reach measures the maximum distance a person can reach forward, the distance of the person standing at the edge of the wall with a 90-degree shoulder flexion and the maximum distance to the front of the thumb will be noted.</description>
