  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A coronectomy is often chosen over complete extraction of a lower third molar when the tooth
      appears to be in close proximity to the inferior dental (ID) canal, as assessed on a plain
      radiograph or a cone beam computer tomograph (CBCT). Following a coronectomy, the roots of
      the third molar may migrate in a coronal direction. This effect, along with the
      bone-preserving technique of a coronectomy over extraction, may provide increased bone height
      distal to the lower second molars, when compared to extraction. Partially erupted lower third
      molars, specifically those with mesio-angular impactions, are commonly associated with
      reduced bone height distal to lower second molars, and cause damage to the periodontal
      support of these neighboring teeth. It is assumed that maintenance of the impacted third
      molars or extraction of these teeth may compromise the periodontal status of the lower second
      molars. This study will investigate if coronectomy improves the bone levels, and therefore
      the periodontal status, of lower second molars, and may propose an indication for a
      coronectomy regardless of the proximity of the tooth to the ID canal.

      Coronectomies were first proposed as a treatment option just over thirty years ago, but there
      are very few long-term studies on the procedure reported in the literature. To the best of
      the investigator's knowledge, this will be the first randomised controlled trial comparing
      the bone height distal to the lower second molar following a coronectomy or extraction of the
      lower third molar.

    <masking_description>Patients will be initially masked to which treatment is performed on each side, but will be notified at the follow-up appointment. In addition, the outcomes assessor carrying out the periodontal measurements (clinical attachment level and probing depths), will be unaware which treatment will be performed. The same surgical flap designs will be used for the treatment of both the right and left third molars, regardless of whether a coronectomy or extraction is carried out, and therefore the patient and clinician should be unable to differentiate between the procedures performed. Intervention will only be revealed to care provider once surgical flaps have been raised.</masking_description>
