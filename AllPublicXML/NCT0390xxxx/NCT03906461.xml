    <textblock>
      This clinical study is a prospective, multicenter, post-market, single-arm, observational
      study designed to characterize the usage of the Lesion Index (LSI) with the market-released
      TactiCath Contact Force Ablation Catheter, Sensor Enabled (TactiCath SE) in subjects with
      Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation (PAF) in a real-word environment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to characterize LSI achieved values for durable lesion
      formation using the TactiCath SE catheter in the different anatomical regions around the
      pulmonary veins (PVs) of the heart during RF ablation for the treatment of drug-refractory
      paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF)

      Secondary objectives of this study are as follows:

        -  To characterize the use of EnSite Automap and AutoMark module software settings,
           including LSI threshold (OUS), contact force, time, power, flow, and AutoMark spacing
           using the TactiCath SE catheter for RF ablation for the treatment of drug-refractory
           PAF.

        -  To characterize LSI achieved values for lesions that reconnected versus those that were
           durable, both in an acute procedural setting as well as in patients who undergo
           additional ablations during the 12-month follow-up period after an index RF ablation
           procedure for the treatment of drug-refractory PAF.
