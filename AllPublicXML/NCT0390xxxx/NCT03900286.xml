  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the therapeutic efficacy and metabolic impact of a low energy diet (LED) in
      people with familial partial lipodystrophy and diabetes. Participants will be provided with a
      LED (total diet replacement) for 12 weeks, before the introduction of a stepped food
      transition. Metabolic effects will continue to be assessed for 1 year. In order to better
      understand why this intervention changes insulin sensitivity, we will also collect adipose
      and muscle tissue samples at baseline and 12 weeks into the intervention in participants
      willing to have these procedures performed. These samples will be used for histological,
      metabolite, gene expression and protein expression analyses.

    <description>Change in scores of EQ-5D-3L Quality of Life measurement from baseline. EQ-5D-3L is a standardized instrument developed by the EuroQol Group as a measure of health-related quality of life.
It comprises the following five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression.
Each dimension has 3 levels: no problems, some problems, and extreme problems. The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions.
This decision results into a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state.
The EQ VAS records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale where the endpoints are labelled 'Best imaginable health state' and 'Worst imaginable health state'.</description>

The Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD 7) Questionnaire is a 7 item measurement that is used to measure or assess the severity of generalised anxiety disorder (GAD)
The index scores are as follows:
0 - 4 No Anxiety 5 - 10 Mild Anxiety 11 - 15 Moderate Anxiety 15 - 21 Severe Anxiety</description>

1 - Several days
2 - More than half the day
3 - Nearly every day
The score ranges are:
0 - 4 None 5 - 9 Mild 10 - 14 Moderate 15 - 19 Moderately Severe 20 - 27 Severe</description>
