      The goal of this study is to assess the feasibility, accuracy and safety of performing
      fluoroless (or low fluoroscopy) permanent His Bundle Pacing utilizing electro-anatomic
      mapping (EAM) with the CARTO 3 mapping system (Biosense Webster Inc, Irvine, CA) in
      comparison to a group of patients undergoing conventional permanent His Bundle Pacing (HBP)
      Implants.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Success of achieving PHBP.</measure>
    <time_frame>Intra-procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Success will be measured by the ability to successfully implant the His Bundle Pacing lead at the His Bundle location and capture the His Bundle in a selective or non-selective fashion as described previously.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Total radiation exposure time during procedure</measure>
    <time_frame>Intra-procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Total radiation exposure during procedure time will be documented at the total time the patient is exposed to fluoroscopy during the procedure. This will will be tracked and documented as total fluoroscopy duration, His lead Fluoroscopy duration and DAP. The total amounts of procedural fluoroscopy exposure will be compared between the two treatment arms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Procedure-related complications</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days post procedure</time_frame>
    <description>The study team will review medical history of enrolled subjects for any adverse event experienced post-procedurally. All adverse events will be reviewed by PI for determination as to whether &quot;procedure-related&quot; or not.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Need for His Lead revisions</measure>
    <time_frame>for a period of 6 months post procedure</time_frame>
    <description>The study team will track the device follow-up data for a duration of 3 months post device implant. Any patients with &gt; 2V increase in His Lead capture threshold from baseline and need for ventricular pacing will undergo a lead revision.</description>
