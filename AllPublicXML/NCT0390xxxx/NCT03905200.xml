  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For a long time, it has been hoped that doctors could screen and diagnosis of coronary heart
      disease through non-invasive imaging techniques, so as to maximize the benefit/risk ratio of
      patients. This trial is to explore the screening and diagnostic value of three-dimensional
      speckle tracking technology for coronary heart disease, and the evaluation value of 3D
      speckle track image(3D-STI) technology for cardiac function improvement after coronary
      intervention, and to seek reliable, accurate and quantifiable non-invasive imaging
      examination for the diagnosis, follow-up and prognosis of coronary heart disease.

      In this study, coronary angiography is taken as the &quot;gold standard&quot;, and 3d-STI
      echocardiography technology is proposed to combine with clinical characteristics of subjects
      for joint diagnosis, so as to evaluate the value of 3d-sti technology in the diagnosis of
      coronary heart disease.

      Patients were followed up with echocardiography after interventional treatment to explore the
      feasibility of 3D-STI technology in evaluating cardiac function improvement.

    <measure>Left ventricular myocardial viability</measure>

    <description>By measuring the strain and time to peak, the left ventricular myocardial viability was finally evaluated. Left ventricular local ventricular viable myocardium was quantitatively analyzed in patients .Aimed to detect the myocardial ischaemia and viability. The data of strain and time to peak were measured using the three-dimensional speckle tracking model.
In apical four-chamber view, make sure the endocardium, mitral valve ring and apex imaging is clear, mark the left and right mitral valve ring and apex spot . After automatic ultrasonic echo spot tracked, software can delineate endocardial curve, and automaticaly calculate the left ventricular myocardial segments strain and time to peak.
The strain peaks of each segment (including 16 segments) of the myocardium of the left ventricle included four strain peaks: RS, CS, LS and AS</description>

    <description>During the 6-month follow-up, 3D-STI technique was used to evaluate the improvement of left ventricular myocardial function compared with conventional parameters like LVEF and NYHA. 3D-STI parameters are the same : strain and peak time .</description>

        According to reference, the area under the ROC curve of 3d-STI strain peak and strain
        peaking time for the diagnosis of coronary heart disease is about 0.65.In this study, it is
        expected that the combined diagnosis model can increase the area under the ROC curve to the
        level of 0.85, and the standard deviation of the area under the ROC curve is estimated to
        be 0.5. In order to get 85% assurance, we plan to include 827 subjects.
