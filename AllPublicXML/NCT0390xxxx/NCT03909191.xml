  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As an alternative biomarker of intrahepatic covalently closed circular DNA(cccDNA)
      transcriptional activity, hepatitis B virus(HBV)RNA may evolve during long-lasting virus-host
      interactionsduring chronic hepatitis B viral infection.The distribution pattern of serum HBV
      RNA levels in the natural course of chronic HBV infection remains unclear. Furthermore,serum
      HBV RNA was associated with response to NAs. So it may be another clinical surrogate marker
      for intrahepatic cccDNA level after long-term NAs treatment and be used to monitor NAs
      therapy. The aim of this study was to evaluate thelevels of HBV RNA during the natural
      courseof CHB and the role in distinguishingthe natural phases of HBV infection and to
      investigate whether serum HBV RNA level at the end of long-term NAs treatment had a similar
      or better predict effect on off-therapy relapse than serum HBsAg titer.
