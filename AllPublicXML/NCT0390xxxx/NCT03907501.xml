  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Normal aging can lead to loss of gut microbial biodiversity which is linked to inflammaging
      and immunosenescence or the loss of immunocompetence. Probiotics, such as VSL#3®, and certain
      herbal supplements such as Triphala are associated with restoration of gut community
      architecture, increased gut barrier function and decreased inflammation. The present project
      will examine the potential benefits of a synbiotic (which denotes a prebiotic plus probiotic,
      and in this study, is an herbal prebiotic plus probiotic) intervention (8 weeks of
      supplementation) on gut microbiome profiles assessed via stool, inflammatory blood markers,
      and questionnaires about gastrointestinal health and mood. In this exploratory study, the
      investigators will examine psychological and physical functioning at baseline and after 8
      weeks of supplementation with synbiotic, Triphala alone, or placebo.

      Primary Aim: In healthy, cognitively intact elderly subjects, determine the effects of an
      8-week synbiotic supplement intervention on the stool microbiome (pre- and post-intervention)
      as compared to Triphala alone and placebo.

      Secondary Aim: In healthy elderly subjects, examine the effects of an 8-week synbiotic
      supplementation intervention on inflammatory blood markers compared to herb alone or placebo.

      Exploratory Aim 1: In healthy elderly subjects, examine the effects of an 8-week synbiotic
      intervention on gastrointestinal and psychological health via questionnaires compared to herb
      alone or placebo.

    <intervention_model_description>Interested and eligible participants will be randomly assigned to either an 8-week synbiotic group, herb alone, or placebo control with a goal to obtain 60 patients who complete the study (20 in each group) after an estimated 20% attrition. Placebo control subjects will be given the option of having the 8-weeks of herbal synbiotic for directed personal use upon conclusion of the study.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>This study will employ double-blind masking and only the project manager will be aware if the participant is assigned to take the synbiotic, triphala alone, or placebo. At the end of the 8 weeks, participants will be made aware of their randomly assigned supplement.</masking_description>
