    <textblock>
      Background: Fun For Wellness is an online intervention designed to promote growth in
      well-being and physical activity by providing confidence-enhancing learning opportunities to
      participants.

      Objective: The objective of this feasibility study is to address uncertainties regarding the
      inclusion of accelerometer-based assessment of physical activity within the Fun For Wellness
      online intervention among free-living adults with obesity in the United States of America.

      Method: The study design is a prospective, double-blind, parallel group randomized pilot
      trial.

      Discussion: Results are intended to inform the preparation of a future definitive randomized
      controlled trial.

    <textblock>
      Fun For Wellness is an online intervention designed to promote growth in well-being and
      physical activity by providing confidence-enhancing learning opportunities to participants
      [1]. The conceptual framework for the Fun For Wellness intervention is guided by
      self-efficacy theory [2]. Evidence has been provided for the efficacy of Fun For Wellness to
      promote self-reported physical well-being actions in free-living adults who comply with the
      intervention [3]. The objective of this feasibility study is to address uncertainties
      regarding the inclusion of accelerometer-based assessment of physical activity within the Fun
      For Wellness online intervention among free-living adults with obesity in the United States
      of America.

      Four specific aims will be investigated. Aim 1. To determine if accelerometer-based
      assessment of physical activity can be used within the Fun For Wellness intervention.

      Aim 2. To determine if accelerometer-based assessment of physical activity should be used
      within the Fun For Wellness intervention.

      Aim 3. To determine how to implement accelerometer-based assessment of physical activity
      within the Fun For Wellness intervention.

      Aim 4. To provide a preliminary effect size estimate for each direct effect in the conceptual
      model for the Fun For Wellness online intervention.

      Pursuit of these four specific aims is based on a general conceptual framework for
      feasibility and pilot studies in preparation for a future definitive randomized controlled
      trial [4-6]. Within this conceptual framework, a randomized pilot trial is a type of a
      feasibility study and a feasibility study may include a focus on the acceptability of an
      intervention [4-6].

    <intervention_model_description>Participants will be randomly assigned to either the Fun For Wellness (FFW) group or the Usual Care (i.e., UC) group by the code programmed within the FFW website that is specified to achieve a 1:1 group (i.e., nFFW = 15, nUC = 15) assignment. Participants assigned to the UC group (i.e., UC participants) will proceed through the pre-operative weight management program provided by the center. Participants assigned to the FFW group (i.e., FFW participants) will proceed through the pre-operative program provided by the center and will be given 4 weeks (i.e., Week 3 through Week 6) of 24 hr access to the FFW online intervention during data collection for this study.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>FFW consists of videos, games, and content in the form of 152 BET I CAN challenges [1]. Behavior challenges are intended to increase a participant's capabilities to set a goal and to create positive habits. Emotion challenges are intended to increase a participant's capabilities to cope with negative emotions and to cultivate positive emotions. Thought challenges are intended to increase a participant's capabilities to challenge negative assumptions and to create a new narrative for their life. Interaction challenges are intended to increase a participant's capabilities to communicate and connect with others. Context challenges are intended to increase a participant's capabilities to read cues and to change cues in the environment. Awareness challenges are intended to increase a participant's capabilities to know herself/himself and to know the issue. Next steps challenges are intended to increase a participant's capabilities to make a plan and to stick with a plan.</description>
