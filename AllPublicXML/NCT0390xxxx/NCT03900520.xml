  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The leading cause of severe respiratory disease and death in young children is Streptococcus
      pneumoniae (pneumococcus). An estimated one-fifth of global childhood pneumococcal-related
      deaths occurred in India. The pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) is a primary prevention
      tool against pneumococcal disease that is safe and effective and has been in use in many
      countries. In alignment with the Government of India's rollout of PCV sub-nationally in
      selected districts and states, this four-year observational study will use a pre/post
      prospective study design to evaluate the impact of PCV in 13 sites in India (7 hospitals, 2
      community sites and 4 laboratories) by assessing clinical and serotype-specific outcomes that
      include childhood invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), hospitalized pneumonia, and community
      pneumococcal carriage. A sub-study to assess the cost of illness of IPD and pneumonia will
      also be conducted. This study is anticipated to provide data to support sustainability of PCV
      expansion and disease surveillance in India.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is the leading cause of severe respiratory disease
      and death in young children, and is also responsible for other serious diseases such as
      meningitis and sepsis. Global disease burden models for the year 2015, estimate that 20
      percent of global childhood pneumococcal deaths occurred in India. Data from India indicate
      that available pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV) include serotypes that account for 66 to
      74 percent of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in young children. The 2017 PCV launch into
      the national immunization schedule in selected high-burden states is poised to successfully
      combat the pneumococcal disease burden in the country once scale-up of vaccine coverage takes
      place. Following the Government of India's recommendation to conduct robust evaluation of PCV
      impact, this four-year multicenter study will provide a comprehensive portfolio of impact
      data, by identifying changes between the pre-PCV and post-PCV periods in the proportion of
      invasive pneumococcal disease and pneumonia hospital admissions among children 1-35 months
      old, and proportion of vaccine-type-colonized pneumonia among these children. This study will
      assess changes in pneumococcal serotype ecology through nasopharyngeal colonization community
      studies as a measure of vaccine effectiveness against community reservoirs and transmission.
      The health economic aims will consist of assessing the cost of illness of pneumococcal
      disease, and economic benefits of PCV when introduced into the national program. Active study
      sites will be located in Delhi; Agra and Bareilly in Uttar Pradesh state; Bhopal in Madhya
      Pradesh state; Jaipur in Rajasthan state; Shimla in Himachal Pradesh state and Rohtak in
      Haryana state. Community enrollment will take place in two demographic survey sites, and
      economic assessment will take place in three hospital sites. Sites will use a common protocol
      to identify and recruit children, obtain sterile body fluid specimens such as blood and
      cerebrospinal fluid; and nasopharyngeal swabs for colonization studies, and run validated
      laboratory tests. A reference laboratory will provide pneumococcal serotyping results,
      nasopharyngeal quantification of pneumococcus, and provide site laboratory oversight. The
      overall approach for analysis will take into consideration the staggered plan for PCV
      roll-out, and the inherent biases of observational studies with outcomes that are not
      specific for pneumococcal disease and that may be subject to secular trends and possible
      confounders. These data will provide robust evidence on changes in pneumococcal disease
      burden in young children, pneumococcal community transmission changes as a result of PCV
      introduction, and economic evidence that can help policy makers optimize the expansion of the
      PCV immunization program in India and in other countries.

      The primary objectives of INSPIRE are four-fold, and are evaluated in four different groups
      of individuals. The objectives are to quantify the change between the pre-PCV period compared
      with the post-PCV period in (1) the proportion of vaccine-type (VT)-IPD among hospitalized
      1-35 month old children; (2) the proportion of VT-colonized hospitalized pneumonia cases
      among 1-35 month old children; (3) the proportion of VT-colonized community children aged
      1-59 months; and to (4) estimate the direct and indirect costs of treatment and productivity
      losses for hospitalized pneumonia and IPD from the household and the healthcare system
      perspectives.

      Secondary objectives are evaluated within each of the four groups, and are; (1) to monitor
      pneumococcal antimicrobial susceptibility trends among children 1-35 months with IPD; (2) to
      monitor passive laboratory surveillance of pneumococcal serotypes causing IPD among children
      1-59 months in states that have made no decision to introduce PCV; (3) to assess mortality
      and occurrence of illnesses within 3 months of hospital discharge among children presenting
      with pneumonia and IPD; (4) to quantify the change in proportion of radiologically confirmed
      pneumonia, and of hypoxic pneumonia among hospitalized pneumonia cases 1-35 months old in the
      pre- versus post-PCV period; and (5) to estimate the proportion of households facing
      catastrophic health spending and medical impoverishment during the acute episode of pneumonia
      and IPD among families of children hospitalized with pneumonia or IPD.
