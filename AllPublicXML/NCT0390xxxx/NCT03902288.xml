  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fresh pomegranate juice at 1.5 mL/kg of body weight was administered by recruited healthy
      individuals and patients with type 2 diabetes of fasting serum glucose between 7.1 and 15.8
      mmol/L after approximately 12 hours fasting. Blood samples were collected in plain tubes
      before (-5 minutes) and at 1 and 3 hours after drinking pomegranate juice. Blood samples were
      centrifuged and serum was collected and stored for glucose and hormonal analysis. Patients
      were recruited from those of earlier stages of type 2 diabetes, and many of them already
      drink pomegranate juice as of its benefits for their health).

      The exclusion criteria included subjects with renal or hepatic disease, pregnancy, treatment
      with insulin, and hormone therapies. Participants who had either smoked cigarettes or taken
      antioxidant supplements, lipid-lowering drugs, and oral hypoglycemic agents, such as
      metformin (glucophage) or sulfonylureas, within the preceding 12 hours were also excluded.

      The study was explained to all of the recruited subjects by the clinical researchers, and
      written informed consent was obtained prior to enrollment. Approval for the study was
      provided by the IRB Committee at Jordan University of Science and Technology (Irbid, Jordan).

    <description>Pomegranate seeds (arils) were separated by hand, and fresh pomegranate juice was prepared by squeezing the seeds using a fruit squeezing machine. Fresh pomegranate juice was given at 1.5 mL/kg of body weight for the fasted recruited patient with type 2 diabetes (FSG &lt; 15.8 mmol/L). Blood was collected before and after 1 and 3 hours of ingesting the juice.</description>
