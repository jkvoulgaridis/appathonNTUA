  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that the efficacy and safety of
      Meditoxin® are not inferior to Botox®'s in the treatment of Cervical Dystonia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The allocated subject is injected Investigational Product(Meditoxin® or Botox®) 200~300U in
      cervical muscles. The efficacy and safety are evaluated for 12weeks through 4 follow up
      visits.
