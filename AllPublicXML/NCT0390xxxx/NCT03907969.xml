      This is a modular Phase I/IIa, open-label, multi-centre, study of AZD7648 administered
      orally, either as a monotherapy, or in combination with either cytotoxic chemotherapies or
      novel anti-cancer agents in participants with advanced malignancies. The modular design
      allows for an escalation of the dose of AZD7648 alone or in combination with either cytotoxic
      chemotherapies or novel anti-cancer agents, with intensive safety monitoring to ensure the
      safety of the participants.

      The study consists of 3 modules each evaluating the safety and tolerability of AZD7648
      monotherapy or with a specific combination partner. Core module of the study is study dose
      escalation (Part A) of AZD7648 monotherapy, administered orally, in participants with
      advanced solid tumours. The study may have up to 5 additional combination modules. Each
      combination module has 2 study parts: Part A consisting of dose escalation cohorts and Part
      B, a safety and proof of concept Phase IIa expansion. A Safety Review Committee will review
      evaluable participants at each cohort and assess if the study should progress to Part B.
