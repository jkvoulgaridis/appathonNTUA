  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate exercise therapy as a method for potentially
      improving radiation therapy treatment toxicities for metastatic cancer patients receiving
      radiation therapy.

      Study Objectives and Endpoints:

      Aim 1. To determine the acceptability, feasibility, and safety of an exercise intervention
      among cancer patients receiving radiation therapy. The investigators anticipate that &gt;25% of
      approached patients will consent to the protocol; &gt;33% of eligible radiation therapy patients
      who consent will perform the exercise prescribed (based on the response rate from EnACT); and
      &lt;25% of participants will experience a musculoskeletal impairment (without treatment
      alterations) and &lt;5% will experience a musculoskeletal injury with symptoms lasting â‰¥ week or
      requiring medical attention. The investigators' approach will be to include patients
      receiving definitive RT; excluding patients at high risk for side effects from combination
      therapy, including fracture or cardiovascular events.

      Aim 2. To discern the clinical outcomes of patients receiving RT+ET. The hypothesis is that
      adding ET to RT will improve patient reported outcomes and physical functioning. The
      investigators' approach will be to use standardized questionnaires and assessment tools:
      patient reported outcomes will be assessed using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
      Events - Patient Reported Outcomes (CTCAE-PROs), loaded onto tablets that patients use in the
      clinic. Questions will assess global PROs relevant to the ability to tolerate RT, including
      fatigue, pain, nausea, vomiting; and disease-site-specific PROs, including
      genitourinary/sexual symptoms for patients receiving pelvic RT. RT dose alterations will be
      documented. Scores will be compared pre- vs post- RT. The investigators will also use
      standardized measures already used in EnACT, including grip strength, 30-second chair stand,
      timed up-and-go, and 4-stage balance. Scores will be compared pre- vs post- RT.

    <description>The exercise intervention will utilize the &quot;Moving Through Cancer: A Guide to Exercise for Cancer Survivors&quot; framework. A certified cancer exercise physiologist will work through this guide at radiation therapy visits, with at least 1 visit per week, per the study schema. The cancer exercise physiologist will teach participants proper: warm ups, use of equipment, exercise form, modes of activity, intensity of exercise, flexibility exercises, and cool down. The cancer exercise physiologist will tailor the instruction to convey special considerations for exercise based on treatment and cancer type. The patient will perform supervised exercise in the Exercise Medicine Unit under the guidance of the cancer exercise specialist. The exercise done will be educational in nature (i.e. learning about proper walking form, proper intensity for a warmup/cool down, proper techniques for resistance exercises).</description>
