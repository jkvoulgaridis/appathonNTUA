  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effect of a cardiac rehabilitation (CR) programme on blood
      protein molecules that may improve the function of arteries in coronary artery disease (CAD)
      patients who have suffered a heart attack. CAD patients who have either agreed or disagreed
      to take part in a CR programme will be recruited. This will allow a comparison of the study
      measurements between a group of patients who complete a CR programme and a group of patients
      who do not.

      The other objective of this study is to perform interviews with the study participants and
      their significant others (i.e. spouse, family member, or a close friend) to listen to the
      reasons why patients agreed or disagreed to take part in a CR programme.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (CR) programme is an established method of secondary
      prevention of coronary artery disease (CAD). Moreover, there is a body of evidence that
      supports the ability of this intervention to reduce hospital readmissions and cardiovascular
      mortality. However, despite the proven benefit, CR programmes are underutilised worldwide.
      Moreover, the molecular mechanisms responsible for orchestrating the beneficial physiological
      adaptations induced by a CR programme are poorly understood.

      Therefore, this study will evaluate the effect of a CR programme on novel molecular
      mechanisms and endothelial function in post-myocardial infarction CAD patients. Additionally,
      semi-structured interviews will be conducted with study participants and their significant
      others (i.e. spouse, family member, or a close friend) to explore the reasons why patients
      may agree or disagree to take part in a CR programme. Altogether, this study will provide
      physiological and detailed qualitative information that may help to provoke an increased
      participation in CR programmes.
