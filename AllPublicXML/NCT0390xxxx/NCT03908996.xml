  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a 12-month
      comprehensive weight management program on weight change in overweight/obese patients
      following treatment for endometrial cancer. During the study period, subjects will be
      monitored for recurrence during routine clinic visits A secondary exploratory purpose of this
      study will be to evaluate the gut microbiome in this intervention group and the changes that
      may occur while participating in a weight loss and weight management program.

      All enrolled subjects will participate in the Profile weight loss and weight management
      program for a period of 12 months. They will work with a Profile lifestyle coach weekly to
      develop a personalized nutrition plan, discuss their activity, and lifestyle behavior as done
      with all Profile members. A comparison of similar retrospective chart reviews based on age,
      weight in pounds and stage of cancer will be conducted using the Electronic Medical Record
      (EMR). All enrolled subjects will collect and return a fecal specimen prior to beginning the
      weight management plan and again after 6 months of participation. The stool sample will be
      used to understand gut health.

    <description>The purpose of this study is to observe weight changes in patients who completed endometrial cancer treatment, are clinically overweight, and who participate in the Profile by Sanford weight management program. An exploratory purpose is to examine the bacterial content of the patient's gut by examining stool specimens before starting the Profile by Sanford weight management program and after 6 months of participation in the Profile by Sanford weight management program.</description>
