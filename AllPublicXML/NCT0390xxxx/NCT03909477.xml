    <textblock>
      This is a longitudinal study of the long-term health impact of cannabis smoking on the lungs.
      Participants will be followed over a period of 10 years, and impacts of cannabis smoking on
      the lungs will be measured with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using hyperpolarized
      xenon-129 gas, pulmonary function tests, exercise capacity, computed tomography images and
      questionnaires.

    <textblock>
      This is a longitudinal study of the long-term lung health impact of cannabis smoking in
      adults using xenon-129 (129Xe) MRI over ten years.

      Males and females between the ages of 18 to 85 years with a history of cannabis smoking will
      be screened, and those who satisfy all inclusion and exclusion criteria will undergo study
      visits for up to 10 years, with visits every 24 Â± 6 months, for a total of up to six study
      visits. Each study visit will include collection of patient smoking history and vital signs.
      129Xe MRI, spirometry, plethysmography for airways resistance (Raw) and lung volumes, forced
      oscillation technique (FOT) and multiple breath nitrogen washout (MBNW) for the lung
      clearance index (LCI) will all be performed pre- and post-bronchodilator. Blood will be drawn
      for blood eosinophil count, and sputum induction will be done to measure sputum eosinophils.
      At baseline, 6 year follow-up and 10 year follow-up, a CT will also be done at University
      Hospital, London Health Sciences Centre.

      Participants 35 years of age or older will complete a six minute walk test (6MWT) for the
      distance walked (6MWD), pre and post oxygen saturation, perceived dyspnea (Modified Borg
      Scale) and perceived exertion (Borg's rating of perceived exertion). These participants will
      complete the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ).

      Participants under the age of 35 will complete Cardio Pulmonary Exercise Testing to assess
      exercise capacity, and the American Thoracic Society Questionnaire (ATSQ).
