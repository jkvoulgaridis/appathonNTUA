    <description>Patients receive the combined treatment of chiauranib plus etoposide, 28 days for a cycle, 6 cycles at most. In the pilot trial, Chiauranib is given orally, 25mg once daily. After patients finish the blood collection for pharmacokinetics(PK), and if the efficacy and safety are acceptable, Chiauranib is given orally, 50mg once daily. Etoposide is given orally, 50mg once daily for 21 days, 7 days off, in the pilot and formal study. After 6 cycles combined treatment, patients enter the single agent therapy of chiauranib.</description>
