  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, parallel-group, open-label, multicenter study of patients with active
      axSpA. The aim is to demonstrate that the efficacy of a Treat-to-Target (T2T) approach (with
      secukinumab as first-line biologic) is superior to a Standard-Of-Care (SOC) approach in terms
      of achieving strong clinical efficacy in patients with active axial Spondyloarthritis (axSpA)
      who are naïve to biological therapy and who have had an inadequate response to non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs. The study will include an 8-week Screening period, a 36-week
      treatment period according to previous randomization, and a safety follow-up period of 20
      weeks. The primary endpoint is the percentage of patients achieving an Assessment in
      SpondyloArthritis international Society response 40 (ASAS40) at Week 24.

    <measure>Percentage of patients achieving an Assessment of responders for the SpondyloArthritis International Society (ASAS) 40 response</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The ASAS response measures consist of the following Domains:
Patient's global assessment of disease activity measured on a visual analog scale (VAS).
Patient's assessment of back pain, represented by either total or nocturnal pain scores, both measured on a VAS scale.
Function represented by Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI) average of 10 questions regarding ability to perform specific tasks as measured by VAS.
Inflammation represented by mean duration and severity of morning stiffness, represented by the average of the last 2 questions on the 6-question BASDAI (Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index) as measured by VAS scale.
Spinal mobility represented by the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Metrology Index (BASMI) lateral spinal flexion assessment
C-Reactive Protein (CRP)
ASAS40 response is defined as an improvement of ≥ 40% and ≥ 2 units on a scale of 10 in at least 3 of the 4 domains and no worsening at all in the remaining domain.</description>

    <description>ASAS40 response is defined as an improvement of ≥ 40% and ≥ 2 units on a scale of 10 in at least 3 of the 4 domains and no worsening at all in the remaining domain.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of patients achieving ASAS20, ASAS partial response</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12 and week 24</time_frame>
    <description>ASAS20 response is defined as an improvement of ≥ 20% and ≥ 1 unit on a scale of 0 to 10 in at least 3 of the 4 domains, and no worsening at all in the remaining domain.
ASAS partial remission is a composite assessment, reflecting the proportion of treated patients who achieve within a defined time frame a value not above 2 units in each of the 4 ASAS domains on a scale of 10.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The proportion of patients meeting the Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) definition of inactive disease, ASDAS clinically important and major improvement and ASDAS low disease activity</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12 and week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Parameters used for the ASDAS include spinal pain (Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index, BASDAI question 2), the patient's global assessment of disease activity, peripheral pain/swelling (BASDAI question 3), duration of morning stiffness (BASDAI question 6) and C-reactive Protein or Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate).
The 3 values selected to separate disease activity states were &lt; 1.3 between inactive disease and low disease activity, &lt; 2.1 between low disease activity and high disease activity, and &gt; 3.5 between high disease activity and very high disease activity. Selected cutoffs for improvement scores were a change of ≥ 1.1 unit for &quot;minimal clinically important improvement&quot; and a change of ≥ 2.0 units for &quot;major improvement&quot;.</description>

    <measure>The proportion of patients achieving the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index response 50% (BASDAI 50) at Week 12 and Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12 and week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The BASDAI consists of a 0 through 10 scale (0 being no problem and 10 being the worst problem, captured as a continuous VAS), which is used to answer 6 questions pertaining to the 5 major symptoms of the disease</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The between-treatment difference in change from Baseline in Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12 and week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI) is a set of 10 questions designed to determine the degree of functional limitation in those patients with AS. The 10 questions were chosen with major input from patients with AS. The first 8 questions consider activities related to functional anatomy. The final 2 questions assess the patients' ability to cope with everyday life. A 0 through 10 scale (captured as a continuous VAS) is used to answer the questions. The mean of the 10 scales gives the BASFI score - a value between 0 and 10.</description>

    <measure>The between-treatment difference in change from Baseline in Bath ankylosing spondylitis metrology index (BASMI) and chest expansion</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12 and week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The BASMI is a validated instrument that uses the minimum number of clinically appropriate measurements that accurately assess axial status, with the goal to define clinically significant changes in spinal movement. Parameters include:
Lateral spinal flexion
Tragus-to-wall distance
Lumbar flexion (modified Schoeber)
Maximal intermalleolar distance
Cervical rotation angle
Additionally, the following assessments should be taken:
Chest expansion
Occiput-to-wall distance</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in the ASQoL (Ankylosing Spondylitis Quality of Life instrument)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12 and week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The ASQoL is a self-administered questionnaire designed to assess health-related quality of life in adult patients with Ankylosing Spondylitis. The ASQoL contains 18 items with a dichotomous yes/no response option. A single point is assigned for each &quot;yes&quot; response and no points for each &quot;no&quot; response resulting in overall scores that range from 0 (least severity) to 18 (highest severity). As such, lower scores indicate better quality of life. Items include an assessment of mobility/energy, self-care and mood/emotion. The recall period is &quot;at the moment,&quot; and the questionnaire requires approximately 6 minutes to complete. The purpose of the ASQoL is to assess the disease specific QoL of patients in this study.</description>

    <measure>The between-treatment difference in change from baseline in ASAS-HI (Ankylosing Spondyloarthritis International Society Health Index)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12 and week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The ASAS-HI is a disease-specific questionnaire that was developed based on the comprehensive International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health Core Set (also known as the ICF Core Set) for AS. The ASAS HI is a linear composite measure and contains 17 items (dichotomous response option: &quot;I agree&quot; and &quot;I do not agree&quot;), which cover most of the ICF Core Set. The ASAS HI contains items addressing categories of pain, emotional functions, sleep, sexual function, mobility, self-care, and community life. The total sum of the ASAS HI ranges from 0 to 17, with a lower score indicating a better health status. In addition, the Environmental Factor (EF) Item Set contains items addressing categories of support/relationships, attitudes and health services. The EF Item Set contains 9 dichotomous items with an identical response option but without a sum score because of its multidimensional nature .</description>
