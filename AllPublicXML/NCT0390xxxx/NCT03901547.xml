  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-institution cohort study with two tiers. All participants receive the
      interventions in Tier 1. Tier 1 is an education study where participants can complete
      electronic surveys on their pre and post intervention confidence, perform two simulated
      patient encounters and have their documentation of electronic template monitored
      longitudinally over 12 months. Participants are free to opt out of any activity related to
      education assessment or system-based interventions to promote the use of learned skills (e.g.
      priming or profile feedback). Signed informed consent will Not be required for this tier.
      Tier 2 includes additional measurements to the Tier 1 activities, and a priming intervention
      (e.g. provided the names of patients they have have). Participants in Tier 2 complete
      psychological inventories at three time points to measure emotion regulation and burnout, and
      participate in a semi-structured interview. after completing the training, they will complete
      a &quot;priming&quot; intervention. The investigators will require signed informed consent to
      participate in Tier 2.

    <textblock>
      Before Communication Training Activities Tier 1 (education-only subjects): Three to four
      weeks prior to the subject's two-week palliative care elective they will be sent an email to
      complete an online confidence survey. They will receive email reminders to complete the
      survey until survey is completed.

      Tier 2 (education + psychological measurements of subjects): Subjects will have reviewed and
      signed consent documentation. In addition to the above online confidence survey, they will
      also receive email to complete electronic ERSQ and MBI.

      Two week palliative care elective Tier 1 - Integrated into the two-week elective with the
      palliative care department, subjects undergo a 1) four-hour training focused on the SICGÂ©; 2)
      two simulated patient encounters with trained actors and feedback provided after training, 3)
      participant sent electronic notification to take post intervention survey of confidence Tier
      2 - In addition to above, these subjects will also complete a Priming intervention. They will
      receive a list of patients whom 1) the study subjected documented at least one note on in the
      past and 2) have a high likelihood of serious illness as determined by an electronic process.
      This list will be shared securely through Dartmouth secure file electronically, and
      participants will be asked four &quot;yes or no&quot; questions for each patient: 1) do they believe
      the patient has serious illness?; 2) would you be surprised if the patient died within the
      next year?, 3) Is this patient an appropriate patient to use the serious illness conversation
      guide? and 4) If you saw this patient again, would you use the serious illness conversation
      guide with him/ her? Subjects will be asked to review no more than 30 patients. Subjects will
      be asked to return the completed email via Dartmouth secure file share.

      Electronic communication every two months following completion of elective Tier 1 - Every two
      months after completing the training, participants will receive email compare his or her own
      documentation of the taught template to top and average performers (comparison results given
      are anonymous). Non-top and top performers will receive different messages, customized
      through pre-testing with non-study residents and fellows. For example: &quot;Talking to patients
      about their values is important but can take some pre-visit planning. Choose a patient you
      will see in the next two weeks to use the SICG&quot; (non top-performers) or &quot;Good job! Talking to
      patients about their values is important. The way we continue to improve is by having more
      conversations. Choose a patient you will see in the next two weeks to use the SICG.&quot;
      (top-performers). At four months, subjects will be asked electronically to complete their
      final confidence survey.

      Tier 2 - For this part of the study, identical to Tier 1

      Semi-structured interviews Tier 2 only - Planned to occur about three months following
      training. Subjects are asked a series of questions designed to assess subject perception of
      serious illness communication, obstacles to implementing the training in practice, barriers
      to documentation and coaching sessions in real patient encounters with trained faculty.
      Interviews will be recorded, and expected duration is 20-40 minutes.

      Simulated Patient encounter at six months Tier 1 - Subject is contacted to arrange one-hour
      for simulated patient encounter, about 20-30 minutes for skill practice and the remainder for
      debrief. Subject has permission from program to have this hour to be away from their clinical
      duties.

      Tier 2 - identical to Tier 1.

      Six and 12 month ERSQ and MBI assessment Tier 2 only - emails will be sent to subject to take
      ERSQ and MBI at month six and 12 following training

    <description>Using a 5 point Likert scale (i.e. 1=strongly disagree, 2=disagree, 3=neutral, 4=agree 5=strongly agree) participants were asked to rate their confidence in various communication skills domains pre- and post-intervention via online survey.

    <measure>performance in simulated patient encounters</measure>
    <time_frame>Intervention start, 2 weeks and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Performance is measured by an internally developed checklist. A single independent observer, during simulated patient encounters, will evaluate trainees. One point is assigned for each item used by the trainee. The checklist contains three scores: conversation guide specific items (16 points), global communication skills (9 points), and a combined score (25 points). This checklist was developed internally and based on the experience training residents in the Serious Illness Conversation Guide (SICG).</description>

    <measure>semi-structured interview responses</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Interviewer uses a semi-structured interview guide to ask open ended questions to participants. The current verison of the interview guide assesses participant experience in 3 broad areas: experience using training in clinical practice, most recent encounter with a patient with serious illness and experience receiving faculty coaching in communication skills. Interviews generally range from 15 to 40 minutes in length. Conversations will be recorded, transcribed, and analyzed qualitative for theme and content.</description>

    <measure>emotion regulation skills</measure>
    <time_frame>start, 6 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The emotion regulation skills questionnaire (ERSQ) is a validated instrument consists of 27 items, and includes subscales related to nine competencies of coping with negative emotion (awareness, sensations, clarity, understanding, acceptance, tolerance, readiness to confront, compassionate self-support and modification) which can be summed to a total score (TOTAL). The ERSQ assesses each skill by means of three items introduced by the phrase &quot;In the last weekâ¦&quot; and answered on a 5-point Likert-scale. Higher scores indicate stronger emotion regulation skills. The investigators will administer the ERSQ via online survey</description>

    <measure>Change in Burnout</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The responses to the Maslach Burnout Inventory tool will be evaluated to measure change in burnout. This validated, psychological inventory consists of 22 items related to occupational burnout, and includes subscales related to Emotional exhaustion (EE; 9 items), Depersonalization (DP; 5-items), and Personal Accomplishment (PA; 8 items). The MBI assesses each item on a 7-point Likert-scale. Higher scores indicated greater burnout. The investigators will use the MBI / Human Services Survey for Medical Personnel administered via online survey</description>
