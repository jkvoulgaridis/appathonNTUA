      This is a phase I dose escalation study to identify the best dose and side effects of
      modified immune cells PRGN-3005 (autologous chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells developed
      by Precigen, Inc) in treating patients with ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal
      cancer that has spread to other places in the body, that has come back, and is resistant to
      platinum chemotherapy. Autologous CAR T cells are modified immune cells that have been
      engineered in the laboratory to specifically target a protein found on tumor cells and kill
      them.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosed with recurrent, advanced, platinum resistant ovarian, fallopian tube, and
             primary peritoneal cancer that have progressed after receiving standard of care
             therapies or are not eligible to receive available therapies with known clinical
             benefit will be eligible for the study. Patients must have measurable disease that can
             be accurately measured in at least one dimension as &gt;= 1.0 cm or &gt; 1.5 cm lymph node
             with computed tomography (CT), ultrasound, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
             techniques.

               -  Platinum resistant is defined as progression of disease within six months of
                  platinum regimen.

               -  Patients with BRCA mutations who have completed standard therapies (including
                  PARP inhibitors) are allowed on this study.

          -  Patients must be capable of understanding and providing a written informed consent.

          -  Patients must be at least 14 days from previous cytotoxic chemotherapy at time of cell
             collection.

          -  Laboratory values must indicate adequate organ function.

          -  Patients must be at least 28 days post systemic steroids prior to enrollment except as
             premedication for contrast allergy.

          -  Patients must have Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score
             of =&lt; 2.

             concurrent medical illnesses precluding protocol treatment.

          -  Negative serum pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential. Women of
             childbearing potential are those who have not been surgically sterilized, are &lt; 60
