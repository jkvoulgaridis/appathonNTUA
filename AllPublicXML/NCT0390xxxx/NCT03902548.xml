        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History or presence of a significant neurological diagnosis (other than AD) that may
             influence the outcome or analysis of the scan results; examples include but are not
             limited to stroke, traumatic brain injury, space occupying lesions, major head trauma,
             and Parkinson's disease.

          2. History or presence of any clinically relevant hematological, hepatic, respiratory,
             cardiovascular, renal, metabolic, endocrine, or CNS disease or other medical
             conditions that are not well controlled, may put the subject at risk, could interfere
             with the objectives of the study, or make the subject unsuitable for participation in
             the study for any other reason in the opinion of the principal investigator.

          3. The patient has a history of seizures, with the exception of childhood febrile
             seizures.

          4. History of positive HIV, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), or hepatitis C virus /
             antibodies (anti-HCV)

          5. Clinically relevant pathological findings in physical examination, ECG, vital signs,
             or laboratory values at the screening assessment that could interfere with the
             objectives of the study.

          6. Have current clinically significant cardiovascular disease. The patient has, at the
             Screening Visit: an abnormal ECG that is, in the investigator's opinion, clinically
             significant, a QTcF &gt; 470 ms.

          7. Has had or is planning to have exposure to ionizing radiation that in combination with
             the study-related tracer administrations and scanning procedures would result in a
             cumulative exposure that exceeds recommended exposure limits.

          8. Contraindications of MRI. Incidental findings on MRI scans that are pathognomonic for
             an active disease or pathological process which requires medical intervention will be
             exclusionary.

          9. History of, or suffers from, claustrophobia or feels that he or she will be unable to
             lie still on their back in the MRI or PET scanner.

         10. Patients who have received an investigational medication within the last 30 days.

          6. History of any clinically relevant hematological, hepatic, respiratory,
             cardiovascular, renal or CNS disease or other medical condition that is capable of
