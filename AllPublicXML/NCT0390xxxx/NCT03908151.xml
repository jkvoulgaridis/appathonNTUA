    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to collect long term retrospective and prospective clinical and
      radiological data to evaluate the safety of revision rate and adverse events, and efficacy of
      clinical and patient assessment of the CMK21 hip stem in primary total hip arthroplasty.

    <description>The EuroQoL Five Dimensions Questionnaire is a subject self-assessment of quality of life and consists of five questions covering the dimensions of mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. The EQ-5D questionnaire also includes a Visual Analog Scale (VAS), by which subjects can report their perceived health status with a grade ranging from 0 (the worst possible health status) to 100 (the best possible health status).</description>
