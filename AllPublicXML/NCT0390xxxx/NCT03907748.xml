  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This international study evaluates the impact of home-based caregiver-delivered music and
      reading interventions for people with dementia. The project aims to address the need for
      improved informal dementia care by training family caregivers to utilise a music or reading
      intervention with the person they are caring for. The interventions aim to decrease
      behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia as well as improve quality of life and
      well being of both people living with dementia and their caregivers. Participants will be
      allocated into a music intervention group, a reading intervention group or standard care
      group. In addition, the researchers will seek to determine the cost-effectiveness of using
      the music intervention.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This three-arm parallel-group randomised controlled trial will involve 495 couples
      (cohabiting caregivers and people with dementia) across 5 countries. Caregivers allocated to
      the music or reading intervention groups will be given three 2-hour training sessions in the
      allocated intervention. They will be asked to deliver the intervention to the person they are
      caring for 5x weekly for 3 months. Data will be collected prior to implementing the
      intervention, during the intervention (via diaries kept by the caregivers), after the last
      week of implementing the intervention and 3-months after implementing the intervention.

      The investigators will explore whether caregiver-delivered music or reading activities
      improve behavioural and psychological symptoms for people living with dementia. The
      researchers will also seek to find out the impact on other aspects of both the person with
      dementia and their caregiver's quality of life and well being. Additionally, costs associated
      with the care of the person with dementia will be evaluated to determine cost-effectiveness
      of delivering a music intervention.

    <description>After training, caregivers will deliver the music intervention to the person with dementia whom they care for. The music intervention will include: a) singing familiar/preferred music followed by discussions facilitated by the caregiver about any associated meanings or memories; b) movement to music (e.g. upper body and arms imitating familiar dance movements to music); c) instrument playing; and d) listening to familiar/preferred relaxing or enlivening music (dependent upon symptoms present in the moment). These methods are known to assist in emotion regulation and increase cognitive reserve (e.g. attention and perceptual-motor function).</description>

Strategies to engage the person with dementia and to create opportunities for meaningful dialogue will be provided, as well as guidance on selecting reading material that is accessible to the person's level of cognitive impairment.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Dyads (cohabiting) who are close in relationship and where one member has a diagnosis
             of dementia according to ICD-10 criteria (Alzheimer's Disease [AD], Frontotemporal
             Dementia, Vascular Dementia [VD], Lewy Body Disease, or mixed dementia) as determined
             by a clinician experienced in diagnosing dementia. Close in relationship refers to a
             caregiver who may be a sibling, spouse, adult child, friend, niece or nephew or any
             person who has a close relationship to the person with dementia, that is, anyone who
             is not a formal paid caregiver.

          -  Dyads where the person with dementia has a Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Questionnaire
             (NPI-Q) Score of ≥6 (from a maximum score of 36) and MMSE scores ≤24 as research
             indicates that NPI-Q scores ≥6 occur in people with dementia who have high Mini Mental
             State Examination Scores.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Dyads where either or both the caregiver or person with dementia have significant
             hearing impairments that are not resolved through the use of a hearing aid device and
             limit their capacity to enjoy musical experiences

          -  There will be no further exclusions
