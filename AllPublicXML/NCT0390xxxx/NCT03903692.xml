  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Venous leg ulcers are lower extremity ulcers that develop due to sustained venous
      hypertension resulting from chronic venous insufficiency. Varicose veins, deep vein
      thrombosis, poor calf muscle function, arterio-venous fistulae, obesity and history of leg
      fracture are some of the risk factors for venous ulceration. Numerous dressing types exist to
      treat these ulcers. This study will compare a marine polysaccharide (MPS) dressing to a
      carboxymethylcellulose dressing to determine which dressing better manages these wounds with
      regard to wound size and periwound skin condition. Subjects will be randomized to receive
      either MPS-Ag dressing or CMC-Ag dressing.

    <description>The peri-ulcer skin assessment scale will be used to assess the peri-ulcer skin. There are 9 systemically quoted items including oedema, erythema, white atrophy, venous pigmentation, papulovesicular erythema, hyperkeratosis, purpuric patches, telengiectasis, and itching lesions. Each item will be measured for an extension score from 0-4 and as severity score from 0-3. The global score is the extension score multiplied by the severity score. All global scores are added together to encompass a total global score. For all sub-score values, a value of 0 is the lowest value.</description>

    <description>The MPS-Ag dressing used in this study has a unique gelling action which helps to remove dead, damaged, and infected tissues from the wound by trapping and removing them later at dressing changes. It is designed to provide intimate contact with the wound for gentle healing. It also contains ionic silver.</description>

    <description>The CMC-Ag dressing used in this study incorporates two technologies to help eliminate the key barriers to healing that are exudate, infection, and bioburden. It can be used on chronic and acute wounds that are infected or at risk of infection with varying exudate levels.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is able and willing to comply with requirements of this trial protocol

          -  Voluntarily signed informed consent before any trial related procedures are performed

          -  Subjects must be able to communicate effectively with study personnel

          -  Subject has lower extremity venous ulcer wound, as determined by site PI.

          -  Subject has adequate circulation as determined by biphasic or triphasic Doppler
             waveform, consistent with adequate blood flow, within three months prior to study
             enrollment. If monophasic on exam, then non-invasive tests must display Ankle Brachial
             Index over 0.8 and no worse than mild disease on segmental pressures.

          -  Subjects should not be allergic to silver (Ag).

          -  Size of subject's wound is between 1 squared centimeter and 100 squared centimeters.

          -  Duration of subject's wound is less than 52 weeks.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who are pregnant, nursing, or planning to become pregnant during the course
             of the study.

          -  Subjects who have known allergies to any ingredient(s) in the clinical products used
             in this study.

          -  Subjects who do not wish to use products derived from shellfish.

          -  Subjects with substance use disorder.

          -  Subjects with active infection or currently receiving antibiotic treatment.

             investigational treatment and/or medication.

          -  Subjects judged by the investigator or sub-investigator to be inappropriate as a
             subject of this study.

          -  Subject has previous or current systemic disease(s) which, in the judgement of the
             site PI, is likely to interfere with the study. However, subjects with well-controlled
             diabetes mellitus (HbA1C &lt; 8.5) shall be permitted.
