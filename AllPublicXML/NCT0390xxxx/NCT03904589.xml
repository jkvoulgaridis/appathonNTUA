  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death in Europe and worldwide. In 2014,
      they led to more than 4 million deaths in Europe, and coronary heart disease alone accounts
      for nearly 1.8 million deaths, or 20% of all deaths in Europe. However, mortality from
      cardiovascular disease and, especially, coronary heart disease has declined in recent
      decades. This has been made possible by improving the quality of care provided to patients.
      Several studies have been conducted to demonstrate this improvement in the quality of care,
      but they mainly measure the functional results of treatment, morbidity and mortality,
      survival and prolongation of life.

      However, patient-centered outcomes such as health-related quality of life outcomes (such as
      mental function, ability to resume activities of daily living, social relationship) are also
      considered important outcomes in the management and monitoring of these diseases. Some
      studies have shown that, even when other risks factors are controlled, a poor quality of life
      related to health is a prediction factor for morbidity and mortality in patients with
      coronary artery disease.

      Some studies have suggested that health-related quality of life should be strongly associated
      with lifestyle, co-morbidities, and mental function.

      Some factors have been identified as factors that may affect the quality of life in patients
      with coronary artery disease, including depression, anxiety, dyspnea and angina pectoris.
      Depression and anxiety were negatively associated with health-related quality of life in
      patients with cardiovascular disease. As for dyspnea, it has been shown that in stable
      patients who have had a myocardial infarction, its increase at 1 month after initiation of
      treatment is strongly associated with a decrease in the quality of life and with an increased
      risk of re-hospitalization and death. It is therefore important to measure these factors when
      the quality of life is assessed in patients with coronary heart disease.

      The importance of assessing quality of life is that the clinician and the patient often have
      different concerns: what the clinician considers to be a &quot;successful procedure&quot; is not always
      considered as such by the patient. Results related to quality of life (results rarely
      evaluated) are among the results that really interest the patient. Indeed, many patients
      consider the quality of additional years of life acquired as important as the lifespan, so
      the goal of today's medicine is to improve the quantity and quality of life of the additional
      years of life acquired. To ensure this improvement, the assessment of health-related quality
      of life should be integrated into the daily clinical practice of coronary heart disease
      management.

      The objective of our study is to evaluate the feasibility of this practice throughout the
      traject of care, by using several standardized questionnaires.
