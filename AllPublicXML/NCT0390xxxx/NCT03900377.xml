  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For SyB L-0501RI administered by an intravenous rapid infusion in combination with rituximab,
      the safety will be investigated in previously untreated patients with low-grade B-cell
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (Lg-B-NHL) or mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), and the safety and
      tolerability will be investigated in patients with recurrent/refractory diffuse large B-cell
      lymphoma (DLBCL).
