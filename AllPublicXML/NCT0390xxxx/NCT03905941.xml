    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine the relative desirability of metformin vs. oral
      combined hormonal contraceptives (OCs) in treating Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) in women
      of later reproductive age. Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Questionnaire (PCOSQ) score will be used
      as a proxy for patient satisfaction. In light of their respective effects on the classic and
      metabolic facets of PCOS, metformin will provide non-inferior patient satisfaction compared
      to OCs in later reproductive age women with PCOS.

      This is a randomized, controlled, double-blinded, crossover study. The investigators will
      recruit women with PCOS in ages 40-49 yo. Subjects will be randomized to either receive
      metformin (2000 mg daily) or low dose oral contraceptives (OCs: 20 mcg ethinyl
      estradiol/norethindrone acetate 1mg) for a total of 6 months, and they will crossover to the
      other treatment for the following 6 months. Subjects will have the following assessed at
      baseline and 6 months after each study medication: blood pressure, weight, waist-to-hip ratio
      (WHR), average intermenstrual cycle length (in the previous 3 months), Ferriman-Gallwey score
      (as a measure of hirsutism), total testosterone (T), sex hormone binding globulin, calculated
      free T, fasting insulin, fasting glucose, 2-h glucose (during oral glucose tolerance test),
      Matsuda index, HgA1c, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, estimated
      cardiovascular risk (Framingham risk score), health-related quality of life using both PCOS
      questionnaire (PCOSQ) and the Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36), and severity of anxiety using
      Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) questionnaire. For safety surveillance, the
      investigators will measure electrolyte levels, renal function, liver function, and pregnancy
      tests immediately before study mediation initiation and every 3 months. For statistical
      analysis, per PCOSQ domain, the post-treatment QoL scores will be analyzed via a linear mixed
      model (LMM), in which the LMM will be specified in accordance with a 2 treatment by 2 period
      crossover design. The investigators determined that if 73 subjects complete the study, the
      investigators expect to have at least an 80% chance of rejecting the null hypothesis that QoL
      is inferior with metformin therapy vs. OCs.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women with PCOS aged 40-49 years. Subject is considered to have PCOS if she has
             current or verifiable history of: a) clinical and/or biochemical evidence of
             hyperandrogenism plus b) oligomenorrhea or irregular menstruation (substantially
             inconsistent menstrual cycle length). Subjects with fewer than 10 menses/year or
             average menstrual cycle length &gt;35 days are allowed to participate if they have a
             compelling past history of oligomenorrhea (average menstrual cycle length &gt;45 days or
             fewer than 9 menses/year) or irregular menstruation.

          -  Screening safety labs within normal reference ranges although mild abnormalities that
             are common in obesity and/or hyperandrogenism will not be grounds for exclusion (see
             exclusion criteria).

          -  Subjects must be willing and able to provide written informed consent.

          -  Willingness to strictly avoid pregnancy (using non-hormonal methods) during the time
             of the study

          -  Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits and study procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Postmenopausal status (i.e., absence of periods for previous year plus elevated
             follicle stimulating hormone [FSH] level)

          -  Biochemical evidence for perimenopause as defined by an anti-Mullerian hormone &lt;0.5
             ng/mL. As an alternative, cycle day 3 FSH &gt; 9 IU/L (with concomitant estradiol level
             &gt;80 pg/mL), if this testing is available, will serve as evidence of perimenopause
             status. NOTE: If FSH &gt;9 IU/L on screening (but it is not cycle day 3), FSH and
             estradiol will be repeated on cycle day 3

          -  History of hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy

          -  BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2

          -  Inability to comprehend what will be done during the study or why it will be done.

          -  Being a study of older women with PCOS, children and men will be excluded.

          -  Pregnancy or lactation within the past 6 months. Subjects with a positive pregnancy
             test will be informed of the result by the screening physician.

          -  Prisoners.

          -  History of (or clinical evidence for) Cushing's syndrome or adrenal insufficiency.

          -  History of congenital adrenal hyperplasia or 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) &gt;200
             ng/dL, which suggest the possibility of congenital adrenal hyperplasia. 17-OHP will be
             collected during follicular phase. NOTE: if a 17-OHP &gt;200 ng/dL and is confirmed on
             repeat testing, an ACTH-stimulated 17-OHP &lt;1000 ng/dL will be required for study
             participation.

          -  Total testosterone &gt;150 ng/dL, which suggests the possibility of virilizing neoplasm.

          -  DHEA-S greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal range (mild elevations may be
             seen in PCOS, so elevations &lt; 1.5 times the upper limit of normal will be accepted in
             these groups).

          -  Virilization

          -  Diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (DM), fasting glucose ≥ 126 mg/dL, or a hemoglobin A1c
             of ≥ 6.5%.

          -  Abnormal thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Subjects with stable and
             adequately-treated hypothyroidism, reflected by normal TSH values, will not be
             excluded.

          -  Moderate to severe hyperprolactinemia. Mild prolactin elevations may be seen in PCOS,
             and elevations &lt; 1.5 times the upper limit of normal will be accepted in this group.

          -  Persistent liver abnormalities, with the exception that mild bilirubin elevations will
             be accepted in the setting of known Gilbert's syndrome. Mild transaminase elevations
             may be seen in women with obesity, so elevations &lt;1.5 times the upper limit of normal
             will be accepted in this group.

          -  Persistent hematocrit &lt;36% and hemoglobin &lt;12 g/dL.

          -  Abnormal sodium, potassium, or bicarbonate concentrations or elevated creatinine
             concentration.

          -  Significant history of pulmonary dysfunction (e.g., asthma or COPD requiring
             intermittent systemic corticosteroid, pulmonary hypertension, etc.).

          -  History of known or suspected congestive heart failure.

          -  History of known or suspected ischemic heart disease or cerebrovascular disease.

          -  History of hypertension.

          -  History of uncontrolled/untreated dyslipidemia. Subjects with stable and adequately
             treated dyslipidemia reflected by normal lipid panel values will not be excluded.

          -  History of complicated valvular heart disease (e.g. pulmonary hypertension, risk of
             atrial fibrillation, history of subacute bacterial endocarditis)

          -  History of stroke

          -  History of smoking

          -  History of severe cirrhosis or liver tumor (e.g. hepatocellular adenoma or malignant
             hepatoma).

          -  Use of anticonvulsants, rifampicin or rifabutin therapy. The interaction of these
             drugs with OCs will not be harmful to the subjects, but it will reduce the
             effectiveness of OCs.

          -  History of venous thromboembolism (e.g. deep venous thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary
             embolism (PE)).

          -  Personal history of blood clotting disorders (e.g., protein C, protein S, positive
             antiphospholipid antibodies).

          -  First-degree relative history of blood clotting disorder, unless the same disorder has
             been formally excluded for the study subject.

          -  History of migraine headaches.

          -  History of breast, ovarian, or endometrial cancer.

          -  Note: If endometrial thickness on transvaginal ultrasound is &gt;8 mm in the
             proliferative (follicular) phase or &gt;14 mm in the secretory (luteal) phase, the
             subject will be referred to a gynecologist for further evaluation (38). These
             particular subjects will be required to obtain a clearance from their gynecologist to
             participate in this study.

          -  Note: Any abnormal labs may be repeated to exclude a lab error.

          -  No medications known to affect the reproductive system can be taken in the 2 months
             prior to screening and in the 3 months prior to the study. Such medications include
             oral contraceptive pills, metformin, progestins, glucocorticoids, anti-psychotics,
             and/or mood stabilizers that are known to cause hormone abnormalities.
