    <measure>Target lesion revascularization</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 20 years</time_frame>
    <description>Defined as any repeat percutaneous intervention of the target lesion or bypass surgery of the target vessel performed for restenosis or other complication of the target lesion. All TLRs should be classified prospectively as clinically indicated or not clinically indicated by the investigator prior to repeat angiography. Clinically indicated revascularization: A revascularization is considered clinically indicated if angiography at followup shows a percent diameter stenosis ≥ 50% and if one of the following occurs:
A positive history of recurrent angina pectoris, presumably related to the target vessel;
Objective signs of ischemia at rest (ECG changes) or during exercise test (or equivalent), presumably related to the target vessel;
Abnormal results of any invasive functional diagnostic test (eg, Doppler flow velocity reserve, fractional flow reserve);
A TLR or TVR with a diameter stenosis ≥ 70% even in the absence of the above-mentioned ischemic signs or symptoms.</description>
