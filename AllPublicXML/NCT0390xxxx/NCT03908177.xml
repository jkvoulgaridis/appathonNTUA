    <description>The local language version of the OPHIP-14 is a self-reported questionnaire that measures dysfunction, discomfort and disability attributed to oral conditions. The questionnaire focuses on seven dimensions of impact: Functional limitation; Pain; Psychological discomfort; Physical disability; Psychological disability; Social disability; Handicap. The patients will be asked to respond according to frequency of impact on a 5-point Likert scale coded never (score 0), hardly ever (score 1), occasionally (score 2), fairly often (score 3) and very often (score 4).</description>

    <description>The ceramic implant will be placed in healed extraction sockets in the premolar-to-premolar area in the mandible and maxilla for single tooth replacement followed by prosthetic loading after 4 months healing time. Type 4 surgery will be performed as defined by the ITI Consensus Statements for Implant Placement in Extraction Sockets: healed sites, typically around 16 weeks after tooth was extracted or after tooth was lost to allow complete healing of the ridge as well as soft- and hard tissue maturation. Both SG and CG receive routine treatment, only the choice of the implant material is defined by the study protocol.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have voluntarily signed the Informed Consent Form before any study
             related procedures are performed, are willing and able to attend scheduled follow-up
             visits and agree that the pseudonymized data will be collected, analysed, and
             published.

          -  Patients must be males or females who are a minimum of 18 years of age.

          -  Patients, who are in need of a single tooth replacement with a dental implant in the
             premolar-to-premolar area in the mandible or maxilla (excluding lower incisors).

          -  Presence of natural teeth on both sides of the study implant position and opposing
             dentition (single tooth gap).

          -  Patients with healed extraction sockets, which means that at implant surgery:

               -  Soft tissue coverage of the socket is complete; and

               -  Alveolar bone is reconsolidated (around 16 weeks after tooth extraction).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with inadequate bone volume where major bone augmentation would be required
             at implant location.

          -  Inadequate anatomic situation that would prevent prosthetic-driven planning based on
             CBCT.

          -  Presence of implants neighbouring the study implant.

          -  Patients with inadequate oral hygiene (FMPS ≥ 20%).

          -  Patients with local root remnants.

          -  Patients with inadequate wound healing capacity.

          -  Patients with incomplete maxillary and mandibular growth.

          -  Patients with medical contraindications to implant surgery (uncontrolled bleeding
             disorders, psychoses, prolonged therapy-resistant functional disorders, xerostomia,
             weakened immune system, illnesses requiring periodic use of steroids or uncontrollable
             endocrine disorders.

          -  Patients with drug or alcohol abuse.

          -  Patients with allergies or hypersensitivity to zirconium oxide (ZrO2), yttrium oxide
             (Y2O3), hafnium dioxide (HfO2), aluminium oxide (Al2O3), and titanium (Grade 4).

          -  Patients with medical contraindications to implant surgery (uncontrolled bleeding
             disorders, psychoses, prolonged therapy-resistant functional disorders, xerostomia,
             weakened immune system, illnesses requiring periodic use of steroids or uncontrollable
             endocrine disorders).

          -  Patients with conditions or circumstances, in the opinion of the Investigator, which
             would prevent completion of study participation or interfere with analysis of study
             results, such as history of non-compliance or unreliability.

          -  Pregnancy or intention to become pregnant at any point during the study duration.

        Furthermore, patients with uncontrolled periodontitis and less than 3 mm of keratinized
        mucosa at the day of surgery will be excluded from the study. Controlled periodontitis is
        defined as treated periodontitis with two or less pockets that are &lt; 4 mm in depth or the
        existence of ≤ 20% bleeding on probing.

        If the planned implant position is the second premolar, the adjacent molar must be present.
        Shortened arches with missing molars are not eligible in such a case.
