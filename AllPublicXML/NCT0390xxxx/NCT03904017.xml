  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to evaluate the potential therapeutic role of hyperoxia when
      applied in the immediate ischemic period following a stroke in the controlled Emergency
      Department setting. The study will evaluate the effects of hyperoxia in stroke patients on
      the production of markers of free radical damage and inflammatory markers associated with
      hyperoxic lung injury.

    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Patient arrival to the emergency department will be documented and recorded. They will be screened for participation by study personnel. Once consented and randomized, the time of initiation of intervention will be recorded. The mean time from emergency department presentation to initiation of therapy will be determined.</description>

    <measure>Mean ratio of the volume of initial hypoperfused tissue to final infarct volume</measure>
    <time_frame>one week</time_frame>
    <description>The total area of hypoperfused brain tissue on initial imaging will be compared to the final infarct volume. This ratio of hypoperfused to final infarct volume will be compared between treatment groups.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in mean NIHSS</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 24-hours</time_frame>
    <description>National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score will be measured at presentation, 4-hours after intervention and 24-hours after intervention. The change in NIHSS over time will be compared between groups. The NIHSS score is a range of scores from 0-42 with higher scores indicating a more severe stroke and disability.</description>
