  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      EPICA-1 is a multicenter, open label, interventional study which will involve about 30
      Internal Medicine Units throughout Italy, enrolling globally at least 100 hospitalised
      patients with suspicion of invasive candidiasis. These patients will be treated with an
      echinocandin (micafungin) as timely as possible, and they will continue the antifungal
      treatment according to international guidelines when diagnosis is confirmed by positive
      1,3-β-D-glucan test: this will allow collection of information on patients outcome. At the
      same time, patients will be also evaluated by means of blood culture, so that comparison will
      be possible between the two diagnostic tests (primary end-point of the study).
