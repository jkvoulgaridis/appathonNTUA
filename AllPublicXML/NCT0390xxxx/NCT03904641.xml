  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Molar Incisor Hypomineralization (MIH) is a change in the formation of dental enamel of
      systemic origin that affects at least one of the first four permanent molars and usually
      affects incisors. During the eruption, the affected surfaces tend to fracture, exposing the
      dentin, which causes excessive sensitivity in addition to making the region very susceptible
      to the appearance of carious lesions. The objective of this research will be to evaluate the
      clinical effect of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) in permanent teeth with severe
      and sensitive MIH. The methodology will be based on the selection of patients from 6 to 12
      years of age with permanent molar teeth, randomly divided in two groups. The selected teeth
      should have MIH on the occlusal surface, indicated for clinical restorative treatment. In
      Group 1, aPDT will be applied for the treatment of infected dentin. Afterwards, the teeth
      will be restored with high viscosity glass ionomer cement. In Group 2, the removal of the
      softened dentin around the side walls of the cavity with sharp dentine curettes and posterior
      restoration with high viscosity glass ionomer cement will be carried out. All patients will
      have clinical and radiographic follow-up with a time interval of 6 and 12 months. The data
      obtained will be submitted to descriptive statistical analysis to evaluate the association of
      categorical variables. Chi-square test and Fisher's Exact test will be used, and to analyze
      the correlation between the continuous variables, Pearson correlation test will be applied.
      For the analysis of dentin density in the scanned radiographic images and the microbiological
      results for colony forming units, ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis will be applied.

    <description>Prior to removal of carious tissue, the volunteers will respond to the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), following this protocol: gauze isolation of neighboring teeth and air jet in the tooth with MIH for 3 to 5 seconds. The evaluation of the sensitivity through the VAS will be repeated at the end of the procedure, after Atraumatic Restorative Treatment (ART).</description>

    <description>Microbiological specimens will be collected from the surface of the dentin before and immediately after the treatment, for later counting of colony forming units.</description>

    <time_frame>6 and 12 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The objective is to quantitatively determine the gray tones of the affected dentin region just below the glass ionomer restoration, whose radiographic control for visualization of the healthy dentin allows the clinical evaluator of the study to compare the treated groups with the density of the remaining dentin in discussion. The statistical analysis of the optical density will be made according to the mixed effects model.</description>

    <description>For aPDT, PapacarieMblue (Fórmula e Ação) will be used. It will be left for 5 minutes in the cavity. The carious tissue will be removed and the application of the PapacarieMblue will be repeated. The tissue will then be irradiated in a single spot with a red laser, of wavelength of 660 nm, for 300 s, with the energy of 500mJ.</description>
