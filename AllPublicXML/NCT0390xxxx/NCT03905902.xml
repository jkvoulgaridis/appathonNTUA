  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multi-center, phase III trial of DCVAC/OvCa added to standard of care treatments for relapsed
      ovarian cancer. Patients will receive study treatment until all doses are administered, or
      other criteria are met.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients who meet entry criteria will be randomized, and will undergo a leukapheresis
      procedure. During the Induction period, all patients will receive DCVAC/OvCa or placebo
      (study treatment) with concurrent standard-of-care platinum-based chemotherapy, with or
      without use of bevacizumab. In the Maintenance period, patients will continue treatment with
      study treatment in combination with bevacizumab, a poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor
      (PARPi) or best supportive care only. Study treatment will continue irrespective of disease
      progression
