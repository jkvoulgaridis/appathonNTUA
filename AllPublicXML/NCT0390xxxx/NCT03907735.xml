      This study aims to determine when during gestation oxytocin receptor (OXTR) expression
      increases in the myometrium, which will contribute new insight to the management of obstetric
      hemorrhage and our understanding of normal and abnormal labor.

      In this descriptive study, we will obtain myometrial tissue samples by core needle biopsy
      under ultrasound guidance in anesthetized women immediately following surgical abortion and
      from controls, all of whom are undergoing a separate planned obstetric/gynecologic surgery.
      Tissue studies will be performed on these biopsy samples to examine oxytocin receptor
      expression and function.

        This is a study of reproductive age women over 18 years of age being performed at Oregon
        Health &amp; Science University (OHSU) in Portland, OR. It will include subjects who present
        for pre-operative appointments in our outpatient Center for Women's Health Family Planning
        Clinic and OHSU Labor and Delivery.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women age 18-50

          -  Gestational age 14-26 weeks; or 6-13 weeks, 37-42 weeks, or non-pregnant (controls)

          -  Undergoing another planned surgical procedure with anesthesia (suction D&amp;C, D&amp;E,
             gravid hysterectomy, cesarean section, or laparoscopic tubal ligation)

          -  Able to give informed consent in English or Spanish

        Exclusion Criteria:

        To optimize biopsy safety, we will exclude patients with anticipated difficult cases, that
        have additional risks of hemorrhage, or those with features that limit ultrasound
        visualization.

        Increased risk of hemorrhage:

          -  Anemia (Hgb &lt; 9)

          -  Anticoagulation, bleeding disorder, or coagulopathy

          -  Multiple gestation

          -  Infection or sepsis

        For ultrasound-guided procedures:

          -  Obese, BMI ≥ 40

          -  History of ≥2 cesarean sections

          -  Large fibroids or uterine anomalies obstructing view

          -  Other poor visualization

          -  Thin myometrium &lt; 1cm
