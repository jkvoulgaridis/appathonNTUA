  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The role of a single-dose of intraoperative methadone on postoperative pain and opioid
      consumption in patients undergoing hysterectomy remains scarcely explored. A prospective
      double-blind, randomised controlled trial investigating the effect of a single-dose of
      intraoperative methadone in patients scheduled for same day hysterectomy is therefore
      conducted.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background with aim: Hysterectomy is the most common major gynaecological procedure in the
      world and hysterectomy on benign indications are increasingly being performed as same-day
      surgery. Therefore, perioperative anaesthesia has moved towards the use of very short-acting
      opioids with the incitement to speed up extubation and facilitate hospital discharge.
      However, the potential consequence is that more patients experience pain and discomfort.

      Methadone has several desirable pharmacological features, and a single intraoperative dose of
      the long acting opioid could therefore theoretically expand the analgesic window and reduce
      postoperative opioid consumption compared to the more conventional use of short-acting
      opioids. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of a single-dose of intravenous
      intraoperative methadone on postoperative opioid consumption, pain and side effects in
      patients scheduled for hysterectomy for benign indications. Our primary hypothesis is that
      intravenous perioperative methadone reduces opioid consumption (oral cumulative equivalent
      dose) by 30% during the first 24 postoperative hours compared to intravenous morphine.

      Methods: 126 patients will be included in an investigator-initiated, prospective, randomised,
      double-blind, controlled trial with two arms: an intervention arm (methadone 0.2 mg/kg ideal
      body weight) and a control arm (morphine 0.2 mg/kg ideal body weight). The study will be
      GCP-monitored, and is approved by the Danish Health and Medicines Authority (2018-004351-20)
      and the Central Denmark Region Committees on Health Research Ethics (1-10-72-365-18).

      Hypothesis: The results will probably be applicable to other types of surgery involving
      visceral pain, and thus the present study has the potential to improve the pain management
      for a large number of patients undergoing surgery.
