    <description>Flortaucipir F 18 PET imaging will be classified by each reader as either neocortical uptake not consistent with AD (τAD-), neocortical uptake consistent with AD (τAD+), or neocortical uptake consistent with AD and likely to progress (τAD++).

    <description>Twenty scans will be randomly selected from the 143 cases included for this study, and the 5 readers will read them in random sequence along with other scans. Cohen's Kappa will be calculated for each of these 5 readers, based on these 20 scans read twice to assess the intra-reader reliability of flortaucipir F 18 PET scan visual interpretation.</description>
