  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, parallel-arm, multicenter study to compare the safety and efficacy
      profiles of SEL-212 and KRYSTEXXA®. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive treatment with
      SEL-212 or KRYSTEXXA® for 6 months. Efficacy assessments, as measured by serum uric acid
      (SUA) levels, will be conducted at intervals that are appropriate to determine treatment
      effect differences. Safety will be monitored throughout the study.

      This is a randomized, parallel-arm, multicenter study to compare the safety and efficacy
      profiles of SEL-212 and KRYSTEXXA®. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive treatment with
      SEL-212 [a combination of pegadricase (SEL-037) and ImmTOR (SEL-110)] or KRYSTEXXA® for 6
      months.

      Study patients in the SEL-212 arm will receive study drug every 28 days for a total of up to
      6 infusions of SEL-212. Study patients in the KRYSTEXXA® arm will receive study drug
      according to the manufacturer's prescribing information, i.e., every 14 days for a total of
      up to 12 infusions of KRYSTEXXA®.

      Efficacy assessments, as measured by SUA levels, will be conducted at intervals that are
      appropriate to determine treatment effect differences. Safety will be monitored throughout
      the study.
