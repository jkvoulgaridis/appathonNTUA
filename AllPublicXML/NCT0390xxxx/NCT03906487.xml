  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A recent report by the World Health Organization demonstrated that 30 % of women worldwide
      have been victims of intimate-partner violence (IPV). IPV is a public health problem thus it
      seems important to propose relevant care. It is difficult to carry out an effective therapy.
      Psychological care is based on cognitive abilities but these women have cognitive impairment.
      Few studies investigated their cognitive dysfunction. Investigators suggest in this study an
      exploration of the Self Defining Memories (SDM) which can highlight the loss of identity of
      these women and a new target of therapy.

    <textblock>
      Intimate partner violence among women is associated to identity problems. Indeed, the victims
      have a poor self esteem and difficulties to express their own wishes. In this study
      investigators suggest an analysis of a type of memory, that is known to be essential, to
      profile an identity functioning: self-defining memories. To date, no study has explored SDM
      in women with IPV. The characteristics of the SDM in women victims of IPV will be compared to
      a group of women who has never been diagnosed in this situation. Those memories could be used
      in therapy. A French adaptation of the questionnaire proposed by Singer &amp; Moffitt (1992) will
      be used (Berna et al., 2011a, 2011b) for the assessment of SDM.

      Four elements will be study: specificity, meaning, content, affect.

      The two groups will have two visits:

        -  the first to verify inclusion criteria and assessed psychotraumatic and depressive
           symptoms;

        -  the last to characterize the SDM.

    <measure>Description of five Self Defining Memories.</measure>
    <time_frame>7 to 10 days after inclusion visit</time_frame>
    <description>These memories are declined in four dimensions: specificity, content, meaning and emotional valence. Investigator will get a proportion of memories which are specific, which are negative, positive or neutral, which have an integrative meaning and which are associated to violence for IPV victims. The results of Self Defining Memories will be compared between a group of IPV victims and a control group.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Relationships between the 4 dimensions of SDM and psychotraumatic symptoms in IPV victims.</measure>
    <time_frame>7 to 10 days after inclusion visit</time_frame>
    <description>These symptoms will be measured via the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL-5 scale).This is a self-questionnaire to assess the main symptoms of Post traumatic stress disorder. It has 20 items that evaluate the intensity and frequency of symptoms in the previous month using scores from 1 to 4.The higher the score, the more important the trauma.</description>

    <measure>Relationships between the 4 dimensions of SDM and depressive symptoms in IPV victims.</measure>
    <time_frame>7 to 10 days after inclusion visit</time_frame>
    <description>These symptoms will be measured via the Beck Depressin Inventory (BDI) scale: this is a self-questionnaire to assess the severity of depressive symptoms using 21 items. Once the test is completed, a score is made by decounting, then compared according to the score, thus determining the severity of the depression:
0 - 9: indicates a minor depression 10 - 18: indicates slight depression 19 - 29: indicates moderate depression 30 - 63: indicates severe depression</description>
