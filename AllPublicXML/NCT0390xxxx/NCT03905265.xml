  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effective dose of moxidectin to treat human scabies is not known. This study aims to
      provide proof of concept that a single dose of moxidectin is effective in eliminating the
      scabies parasite in humans and to enable the determination of an optimal dose of moxidectin
      for treatment of scabies for further clinical studies.
