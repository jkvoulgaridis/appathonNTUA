    <textblock>
      This is an open label, Phase 1b pre-operative window of opportunity biomarker trial to
      analyze the combination of intravenous (IV) anti-PD-1 inhibitor, nivolumab, given along with
      toll-like receptor 8 (TLR 8) agonist motolimod delivered either subcutaneously (SC) or by
      intratumoral injection (IT) in subjects with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck
      (SCCHN). Subjects with previously untreated, resectable SCCHN, will be recruited onto this
      trial and will initially undergo pre-treatment diagnostic imaging and biological sample
      collection. These subjects will undergo pre-operative study treatment for a 3 to 4-week
      period prior to a scheduled surgical resection.

    <description>Subject will be monitored for AEs both during treatment and for a specified period after last dose of study treatment. AE is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may appear or worsen in a subject during the course of a study. It may be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening concomitant illness, an injury, or any concomitant impairment of the subject's health, including laboratory test values, regardless of etiology. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in the frequency or intensity of a preexisting condition) should be considered an AE.</description>
