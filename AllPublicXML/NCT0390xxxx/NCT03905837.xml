  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to analyze the impact of the intravenous (IV) or paravertebral
      (PV) lidocaine administration during the intraoperative period of lung resection surgery on
      the appearance of postoperative complications. We design a randomized, controlled and blinded
      study to be performed in 153 patients with 3 arms: 1) Lidocaine IV + PV saline 2) saline IV +
      PV lidocaine, 3) remifentanil IV + PV saline. Perioperative analysis of inflammatory
      biomarkers in bronchoalveolar lavage and serum. Follow-up of the postoperative course,
      especially the appearance of postoperative complications according to the revised
      Clavien-Dindo classification for thoracic surgery, as well as other relevant clinical
      results.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative pulmonary complications continue to be one of the main causes of morbidity,
      mortality and increase in hospital stay in patients undergoing surgical procedures requiring
      anesthesia. Its incidence in lung resection surgery is greater than in other non-cardiac
      major surgeries due to damage of structures related to respiratory function.

      Furthermore, during lung resection surgery there is an exaggerated pulmonary inflammatory
      response related to the use of one-lung ventilation and / or the lung damage produced by the
      collapse of the operated lung as well as the surgical manipulation itself.

      Recently, in a clinical trial on 180 patients (NCT 02168751), our researcher group observed
      that the attenuation of the pulmonary inflammatory response through the use of halogenated
      anesthetic agents, was related to a decrease in the appearance of postoperative pulmonary
      complications after lung resection surgery. In addition, the presence, in bronchoalveolar
      lavages, of elevated levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukine(IL)-6 and the IL-6 /
      IL10 ratio were independent predictors of the risk of developing postoperative pulmonary
      complications.

      Lidocaine is a local anesthetic that blocks nerve conduction by blocking sodium channels. In
      addition it has been known for experimental and clinical studies of its immunomodulatory
      properties.

      Clinical studies performed in different surgeries show that a continuous intravenous infusion
      of lidocaine during surgery is associated with a lower inflammatory response assessed by
      monitoring plasma cytokines, as well as less postoperative pain, a shorter duration of
      postoperative paralytic ileus and a early hospital discharge.

      Currently, there is no clinical study that has evaluated the role of intravenous lidocaine on
      the pulmonary inflammatory response and the subsequent lung damage that inevitably occurs
      during lung resection surgery with periods of one lung ventilation.

      Currently, some experts are proposing the replacement of thoracic epidural and paravertebral
      analgesia by the intravenous infusion of lidocaine and minor analgesics, for fast-track
      programs, based on their analgesic and anti-inflammatory capacity and on avoiding the risks
      inherent in the insertion of an epidural or paravertebral catheter.

      Hypothesis: The administration of intravenous or paravertebral lidocaine during lung
      resection surgery attenuates the exaggerated inflammatory response that inevitably occurs in
      this surgical intervention. The lower expression of pro-inflammatory mediators will be
      associated with a lower rate of postoperative complications that are related to the
      perioperative inflammatory process.

    <intervention_model_description>Unicentric, randomized, blind and controlled phase IV Clinical trial of three parallel groups.
Randomization: Patients will be randomized into three groups (ratio 1: 1: 1): intravenous lidocaine and paravertebral saline (group 1), intravenous and paravertebral saline solution with lidocaine (group 2) and intravenous remifentanil and paravertebral saline solution (group 3) ). The randomization will be carried out through the EPIDAT 3.1 program prior to the recruitment of the first patient and the randomization codes will be kept in a sealed envelope with the number on the outside of the envelope. Patients will be followed from the day of hospital admission until hospital discharge and after 30 days of surgery.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>The randomization will be carried out through the EPIDAT 3.1 program. Randomization codes will be obtained prior to the recruitment of the first patient and will be kept in a sealed envelope with numbering on the outside of the envelope. The operating room anesthesiologist will receive the assigned medication from the corresponding group with the only identification of intravenous perfusion and paravertebral perfusion, without having knowledge of the group to which the patient belongs.
Bias control: The anesthesiologist responsible for the intraoperative management of the patient, the physician responsible for postoperative control in the postoperative care unit and the guard physician who will perform the cognitive dysfunction test preoperative and postoperative and the follow up until the month of surgery will be blind to the technique used, as well as those responsible for the analysis of the biological samples.</masking_description>
