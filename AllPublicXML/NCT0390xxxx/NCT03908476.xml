  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has been shown to be effective for relieving intractable
      chronic pain. However, a portion of patients who initially succeed with SCS will eventually
      lose their therapeutic benefit. Reliable methods have not been identified for restoring
      neuromodulation benefit to this underserved population, so additional research is required.
      This study will prospectively observe subjects who utilize Abbott neurostimulation devices
      after failing to sustain pain relief with their previous SCS system. The effectiveness of
      Abbott systems in restoring neuromodulation benefit will be evaluated over the course of a
      two-year follow-up.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the utility of Abbott neurostimulation devices for restoring
      therapeutic benefit from neuromodulation therapy. These devices include programming the
      BurstDR waveform in an enabled implantable pulse generator (IPG), and dorsal root ganglion
      stimulation (Proclaim DRG). The BurstDR waveform offers a unique mechanism of action that may
      explain why it can restore efficacy where tonic stimulation has failed. While all forms of
      SCS activate the lateral pain pathway, which is responsible for the sensory aspects of pain,
      only BurstDR has been shown to activate the medial pain pathway which is responsible for the
      affective components. It is this medial activation that may allow BurstDR to succeed despite
      psychological factors such as catastrophizing and depression. Additionally, it is possible
      that BurstDR may be less susceptible to habituation because it more closely mimics natural
      thalamic firing.

      Several different methods of implementing BurstDR may be included in this investigation to
      account for a range of possible existing systems and patient needs. It can be implemented by
      reprogramming a BurstDR-capable device, connecting a BurstDR-capable IPG to existing leads
      with an adapter or compatible header, or through full system replacement.

      While traditional SCS applies stimulation to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, DRG
      stimulation targets a bundle of sensory nerve cell bodies just outside of the spinal cord
      known as the dorsal root ganglion. This form of stimulation has been shown to make it easier
      to achieve pain-paresthesia overlap, provide consistent stimulation irrespective of body
      position, and produce paresthesia with a lower current than traditional SCS. Using DRG
      stimulation as a replacement or supplement to SCS may ensure reliable coverage of the entire
      painful area and improve pain outcomes.

      This is the first prospective investigation designed to evaluate the effectiveness of Abbott
      neurostimulation devices for restoring pain relief in patients with waning or failed therapy.

    <description>Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Adult Profile The PROMIS-29 is a 29-item profile instrument that covers 7 health domains (depression, anxiety, physical function, pain interference, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and social function) with 4 questions each. The final item is an 11-point pain intensity numerical rating scale (NRS). Subjects should read each item and check the one box that most closely represents their response.
Each item is scored on a scale from 1-5 with total scores for each domain ranging from 4-20. Greater scores represent more of whatever concept is being measured (e.g., depression or physical function). The scoring tables have been provided in the measure manual. Raw domain scores are converted to t-scores with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. The t-scores were validated on a sample from the general population and all items must be answered to utilize the scoring tables.</description>

Subjects rate how often they have the given thought from 0 &quot;not at all&quot; to 4 &quot;all the time&quot;. The total score is a sum of all responses, ranging from 0-52. Each domain has a sub-scale score calculated as a sum of the constituent responses with ranges of 0-16 for rumination, 0-12 for magnification, and 0-24 for helplessness.</description>
