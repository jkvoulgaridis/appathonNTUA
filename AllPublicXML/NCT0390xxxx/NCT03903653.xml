      The investigators will be studying the effects of Chemodenervation (Botulinum Toxin A) and
      Serial Casting vs Botulinum Toxin A and without serial casting in Lower Limb Spasticity
      following ABI.

      patients are randomly divided into two groups: group 1 will undergo botox injection with
      weekly serial casting group 2 will undergo botox injection with physiotherapy The primary
      outcome is the effects of the proposed treatment with respect to passive dorsiflexion.

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Patients with Acquired Brain Injury (ABI) including but not limited to stroke,
             traumatic and anoxic brain injury in ABI unit of RRC

          -  Dorsiflexion limitation of &lt; 10 degrees from neutral and Modified Ashworth Score (MAS)
             of 2 or 3

          -  Patients that are on Oral Medication for Spasticity Tx are still allowed to
             participate (ie. Baclofen)

          -  Patients both with Bilateral or Unilateral Lower Limb Spasticity are included

          -  There will be no sex or age restrictions

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Patients cannot have had Botulinum Toxin A Injections in their Lower Extremities
             within the past 6 months

          -  Patients cannot have had any sort of custom bracing or serial casting previously

          -  Patients with MAS of 4

          -  Patients with generalized spasticity that require other alternative treatment such as
             intra-thecal baclofen or surgical intervention

          -  Patients need to be medically stable (all co-morbidities under control via
             medical/pharmacological therapy), patients with ongoing co-morbid medical condition
             that are unmanaged will be excluded.

          -  Patients whom have skin breakdown in their lower extremities prior to the study will
             be excluded

          -  Patients who develop Skin breakdown (Grade 2 or higher) during the course of the study
             will be removed automatically
