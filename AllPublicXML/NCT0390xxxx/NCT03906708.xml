  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine if infants are more likely to suffer from respiratory
      complications during their first year of life due to being born premature.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this study is to determine if infant respiratory morbidities after
      preterm birth are highly variable due to differential impairment of airway, parenchymal and
      vascular development that can be characterized as distinct physiologic phenotypes. If the
      nature and severity of these specific impairments of lung function are strongly associated
      with increased respiratory morbidities during infancy and that proteomic biomarkers can
      enhance the physiologic characterization of phenotype and prediction of late respiratory
      outcomes.
