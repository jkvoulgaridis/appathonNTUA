  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study aims to explore the feasibility, safety and effectiveness of two different
      extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) protocols for patients receiving nerve-sparing
      radical prostatectomy (RP).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized, 2-parallel-arm trial (n=94). All patients will receive (A)
      sham (n=47) or (B) active ESWT (n=47) twice/week for 6 weeks (12 sessions total).
      Concurrently, all patients will receive daily tadalafil 5mg for 24 weeks. Patients will then
      undergo a 4 week washout period without erectogenic aids, and return for a 28-week
      evaluation. Subsequently, patients requiring further erectogenic aids after 28 weeks will be
      offered intracavernosal injections (ICI) of prostaglandin E1 (PGE1).

      Random assignment will be performed by computer program (eg. randomizer.org), in a design
      that obtains equal sample size per group.

      All patients will be followed for a period of 24 months post-RP. Follow-up protocol includes
      evaluation of the IIEF, EHS, GAQ, ICI usage and tolerability, stretched flaccid penile
      length, urinary incontinence, and oncologic status.

    <description>The Erection Hardness Score (EHS) is a single-item Likert scale to assess erectile dysfunction.

    <description>Patients who are unsatisfied with their erectile function at the 28 week visit, will be offered intracavernosal injections (10mg PGE1, 2x/week) for the remaining duration of the study. During each in-office ICI, patients will report pain tolerability (Visual Analog Scale for Pain), and maximum EHS achieved. Patients will be allowed to stop ICI if they report satisfactory erections without any erectogenic aids for 2 weeks. Patients will be allowed to resume ICI if erectile function decreases, and they report unsatisfactory erections with erectogenic aids for 2 weeks. Dates of stopping and/or resuming ICI will be recorded. At the 52 weeks, 18 and 24 months post-RP follow-up sessions, All patients will self-administer ICI of 10mg PGE1 during the visit, and report pain tolerability (Visual Analog Scale for Pain), and maximum EHS achieved.</description>
