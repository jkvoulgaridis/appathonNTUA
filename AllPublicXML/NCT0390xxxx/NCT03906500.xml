      High schools High on life' intervention is a high school-based, multi-component intervention
      guided by theory, evidence, and empirical findings to reduce excessive drinking among Danish
      high school students. The study will employ a cluster-randomized controlled study design:
      investigators plan to include a random sample of at least 12 high schools randomly 1:1
      allocated to either intervention or control group. Timeline: Baseline data will be obtained
      from the Danish National Youth Study 2019, collected in January to March 2019. Delivery of
      intervention: August 2019 to January 2020. Follow-up survey: April to May 2020. Primary
      outcome measure: mean number of binge-drinking episodes within the last 30 days. Secondary
      outcome measures: weekly alcohol consumption, alcohol intake at last school party, alcohol
      intake at the school during last school party, number of students that agrees that they are
      able to have fun at a party without drinking, and the proportion of students that think
      alcohol plays a too dominant part at the school. Implementation will be monitored thorough
      process evaluation.
