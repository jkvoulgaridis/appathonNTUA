  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Wearable technology is increasingly being used to promote healthy behaviour. In this study,
      the investigators propose the development and evaluation of Move for Surgery, which utilizes
      a wearable activity bracelet (Fitbit) and proven behavioural change techniques, for
      preconditioning of patients prior to lung cancer surgery. The primary outcome of this study
      will be compliance with Move for Surgery, as a surrogate measure for feasibility. Secondary
      outcomes, including accrual rates, perioperative pulmonary complications, cost per patient,
      and patient satisfaction, will also be collected. The investigators have partnered with the
      Canadian Partnership Against Cancer (CPAC) and Lung Cancer Canada (LCC) to develop Move for
      Surgery. The ultimate goal of this preliminary study is to lay the groundwork for a
      subsequent comparative trial to evaluate the impact of Move for Surgery on postoperative
      complications in the thoracic surgery population.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Eligible participants include patients with NSCLC set to undergo pulmonary resection.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  There will be no exclusion based on functional status in this feasibility study;
             rather, a subsequent analysis of participant demographics will be performed to inform
             future phases of this study.
