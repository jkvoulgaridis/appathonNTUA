  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sympathetic nerve activity can be measured transcutaneously in awake patients by
      computer-based filtering of raw signal obtained via skin leads attached on the chest and the
      right arm. Electrocardiogram can be removed by applying a high-pass filter setting of 150 Hz.
      Electromyogram can be filtered by applying a high-pass filter setting of 500 Hz or a
      band-pass filter setting of 500-1000 Hz.

      Currently, the therapeutic effect of stellate, thoracic, and lumbar sympathetic ganglia block
      (SGB, TSGB, and LSGB, respectively) in patients with chronic pain is generally evaluated by
      using thermogram/thermography (change in temperature of the upper or lower extremeties) or
      questionnaire-based scoring.

      However, it is not known whether the skin sympathetic nerve activity (SKNA) can be measured
      in patients undergoing SGB/TSGB/LSGB and used as an alternative tool for assessing the
      therapeutic effect of SGB/TSGB/LSGB.

      Therefore, we planned this pilot study to observe whether the SKNA can be obtained in
      patients undergoing SGB/TSGB/LSGB and whether it is well correlated to thermogram or
      questionnaire-based scoring. If the SKNA is observed and decreases after SGB/TSGB/LSGB, it
      will be presented in milivolt (uV) and compared to that of pre-block values.

    <description>A few studies reported that skin sympathetic nerve activity (SKNA) signal could be potentially observed by applying a high-pass filter of 500 Hz or a band-pass filter of 500~1000 Hz to electric signal from skin leads attached on the skin of the chest in awake volunteers. However, it is not known if it would be also possible to observe the SKNA signal in patients undergoing stellate, thoracic, and lumbar sympathetic block. Also, there is no established, objective tool for quantitative or qualitative assessment of the effect of stellate, thoracic, and lumbar sympathetic block.</description>
