  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Advances in technology has meant that domiciliary non-invasive (NIV) devices can be remotely
      monitored via modems in patients' homes. Possible benefits and challenges of modem technology
      have yet to be established. This study explored the perspectives and experiences of patients,
      their carers' and health care professionals (HCPs) on the addition of modem technology in
      managing home NIV patients.

      The aim of this study is to consider the opinions of patients, their carers' and health care
      providers on the addition of using modem technology in the management of patients with
      hypercapnic respiratory failure receiving domiciliary NIV.

      Objectives

        1. To investigate the experience of patients receiving domiciliary NIV with modem
           technology and how this compares to NIV treatment without a modem

        2. To investigate the experience of carers' of patients receiving domiciliary NIV with
           modem technology and how this compares to NIV treatment without a modem

        3. To gain opinions of health care providers on the use of modem technology in caring for
           patient with ventilatory failure and how this compares to delivering home NIV treatment
           without a modem 4.2 Outcome The outcome of this study will inform future service
           development of home NIV services to ensure they are designed with service users'
           preferences in mind.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients and carers •Patients and their carers who received treatment from the Royal Free
        London (RFL) domiciliary NIV service both pre and post modem installation will be eligible
        to be included in the study.

        HCPs

        •Staff who have experience of looking after patients with NIV both with and without modems
        will be able to take part in the study. Staff recruited will be currently working at RFL.
        We have been using modems for all of our patients with NIV since December 2014. Therefore
        rotational staff (e.g. registrars) working RFL will only have experience of looking after
        patients with modems on their NIV. To allow for this factor staff will be allowed to join
        the study even if their experience of looking after patients with NIV without modems is at
        other hospitals.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients under the care of the RFL domiciliary NIV service who have only had
             experience of treatment with a modem in situ will be excluded from the study.

          -  Patients who are unable to verbally communicate

          -  Patients who cannot have an &quot;everyday&quot; level conversation in English
