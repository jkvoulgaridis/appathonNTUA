      The purpose of this study is to develop cervical elastography nomograms using Samsung's novel
      technology &quot;E-cervix&quot; and determine its ability to predict preterm birth.

      During each sonogram in which cervical lengths are measured, 5 additional cervical indices
      will be collected using Samsung's E-cervix technology. Each index will then be separated
      based on characteristics to create a nomogram for singletons, twins, and those with
      interventions already in place (i.e. cerclage and/or progesterone) at the time of their
      E-cervix assessment.

    <description>While patients are having their routine cervical ultrasound assessments which requires a 5 minute time period, we will use the built-in software to obtain additional E-cervix measurements to evaluate the consistency of the cervical os. This will be done within the standard 5 minute period which is typically done to observe for dynamic changes. The measurements will be obtained with the same sonogram machine, using updated software.</description>
