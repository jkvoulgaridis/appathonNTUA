      observational monocentric study

      Primary objective :

      Describe post-cancer supportive care needs, assessed by questionnaire in patients treated for
      breast cancer after completion of treatment and 2 years later.

      Secondary objective :

        -  Correlation between needs after cancer and the fear of recidivism assessed by the scale
           of the inventory of fear.

        -  Compare the need for supportive care between the end of treatment and 2 years after.

        -  Assess needs after cancer according to the stage of the disease

        -  Evaluate the needs after cancer according to the treatments received:
           surgery-radiotherapy versus surgery-chemotherapy-radiotherapy.

        -  Assess needs after cancer according to age and socio-professional category.

      Schedule :

      The selected patients then received a letter including an information and non-objection note,
      the post-cancer needs questionnaire, the Fear Inventory severity subscale questionnaire, and
      the QLQ-C30 questionnaire. A delay of 1 month was chosen to return the questionnaire with a
      phone call after 15 days for an analysis of responses in February 2019.
