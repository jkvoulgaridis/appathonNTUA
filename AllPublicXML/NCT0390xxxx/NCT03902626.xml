      This is longitudinal study with the data collected from 2009-2014 from medical students and
      physiotherapy students at two different Scottish universities measuring attitudes towards
      patients with chronic low back pain and their functionality. The outcome measure used was
      HC-PAIRS the original 15 point Likert Scale. Data was analysed using SPSS (version 25). All
      data was found to be normally distributed. Descriptive statistics were presented as mean
      (Standard Deviation). Inferential statistics were carried out using a two-way ANOVA with year
      of study and discipline of degree as independent variables with post hoc analysis. A p-value
      of &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.
