      The aim of this study is to compare the total morphine consumption in the first 24 hour
      postoperative between combined modified pectoralis block (PECS II) and transversus plane
      block versus erector spinae block in modified radical mastectomy.

      Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women in the United States and is second only
      to lung cancer as a cause of cancer death. Breast surgery is commonly performed as a part of
      the management of breast cancer, is associated with considerable acute postoperative pain.
      Ultrasound guided Regional anesthesia is recommended to be a part of multimodal analgesia in
      order to manage the acute post-operative pain. New techniques are proposed to give adequate
      control of postoperative analgesia with less opioid needs in the first day postoperative.
      They include pectoralis nerve modified pectoralis, and erector spinae blocks.

      The investigators will compare Modified pectoralis nerve block (Pecs II) plus transversus
      thoracic muscle plane (TTP) block versus Erector spinae block on morphine consumption during
      first 24 h following modified radical mastectomy.

    <description>Modified Pectoralis block (PECS II) : Using ultrasound we proceed to inject 10 ml of bupivacaine 0.25% between the pectoral muscles and 10 ml under Pmm above the serratus muscle.
Transversus Thoracic Plane block : 10 mL bupivacaine (0.25%) is injected between the transversus thoracic muscle and the internal intercostal muscle between the third and fourth left ribs connecting at the sternum.</description>

    <description>Using ultrasound an echogenic 22-G block needle is inserted in-plane in a cranial-to-caudal direction until contact is made with the T5 transverse process. A total of 30 bupivacaine 0.25% is then injected while seeing the fluid lifting the erector spinae muscle off.</description>

    <description>Modified pectoralis nerve block (Pecs II) aims to block at least the pectoral nerves, the intercostobrachial, intercostals III-IV-V-VI. This will cover dermatomes T2, T3 and T4. The probe is positioned under the lateral third of the clavicle .After locating the subclavian muscle, the axillary artery and the axillary vein we move the probe distally towards the axilla, until the pectoralis minor is identified. We start counting the ribs , from r1 under the axillary artery, we move distally and laterally until the lateral border of pectoralis minor is reached. The serratus anterior muscle which covers r2, r3, r4 is the point of entrance into the axilla.
Blocking of multiple anterior branches of intercostal nerves (Th2-6) using a transversus thoracic muscle plane (TTP) block is used as an additive to pecs II to cover the internal mammary region</description>

    <description>The patient is placed in a sitting position and The T5 spinous process is located by palpating and counting down from the C7 spinous process. Under complete aseptic conditions a linear ultrasound probe is then placed in a transverse orientation at the level of the T5 transverse process. The tip of the transverse process is centred on the ultrasound screen and the probe is then rotated into a longitudinal orientation to produce a parasagittal view. From T1 to T5 the erector spinae, rhomboid major and trapezius muscles are visible posterior and superficial to the transverse processes.</description>
