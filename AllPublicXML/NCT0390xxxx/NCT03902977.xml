  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most frequent type of cancer among Swiss women (5'700 cases diagnosed
      every year). Mastectomy is indicated when breast conservative surgery is not possible or by
      patient wish. Axillary lymph nodes dissection (ALND) is indicated primarily for node-positive
      breast cancer.

      Postoperative seroma after mastectomy and axillary clearance is a common complication,
      occurring in 25 to more than 60% of patients with breast cancer. After mastectomy and/or ALND
      conventional wound closure commonly uses suction drain to prevent seroma. However, seroma
      frequently occurs after drain removal. Excessive fluid accumulation in seroma stretches the
      skin, resulting in patient discomfort, impaired ipsilateral shoulder function and higher risk
      of surgical site infection and prolongs the hospitalization. In rare cases, a fibrous
      encapsulated seroma is resistant to conservative treatment and requires surgical resection.
      Thus, seroma may also impact health care costs requiring longer hospital stay or unplanned
      outpatient visits and may delay adjuvant therapy.

      Recent data suggest that quilting suture through flap fixation reduces the incidence of
      seroma. Therefore, quilting suture has the potential to increase patients' quality of life,
      as well as to shorten the length of hospital stay and to reduce hospital costs, providing the
      rationale for this study.The aim of our project is to compare the efficacy of quilting suture
      with that of conventional closure without quilting in reducing the drainage quantity, the
      length of hospitalisation and the prevalence of seroma following mastectomy and/or axilla for
      breast cancer, as well as the patient reported pain increasing patient quality of life.

      The final goal is the omission of axillary drainage in the future. All randomised patients
      will be followed for 12 weeks. Patients will fill in 2 questionnaires (EQ5-D: European
      Quality of Life and Brief Pain Inventory: BPI). The Health Economic Analysis form (HEA) will
      be completed by the investigator collecting the patient data.

      Total duration of study: 2.5 years. There are 2 treatments groups 50% of the study
      participants will be treated with quilting suture and 50% with conventional closure. Patients
      are randomly divided into the 2 groups. All patients are blinded to the surgical
      treatment.This means that they do not know which surgical treatment they have received
      (quilting suture or conventional closure), The operating surgeon will not see the after the
      operation. Seroma assessment will be performed by other medical personnel, that do not know
      which surgical treatment has been given. In case of seroma a physician (not the operating
      surgeon) will perform the aspiration of seroma if needed.

      Breast cancer is the most frequent type of cancer among Swiss women (5'700 cases diagnosed
      every year). Mastectomy is indicated when breast conservative surgery is not possible or by
      patient wish. Axillary lymph nodes dissection (ALND) is indicated primarily for node-positive
      breast cancer.

      Postoperative seroma after mastectomy and axillary clearance is a common complication,
      occurring in 25 to more than 60% of patients with breast cancer. After mastectomy and/or ALND
      conventional wound closure commonly uses suction drain to prevent seroma. However, seroma
      frequently occurs after drain removal. Excessive fluid accumulation in seroma stretches the
      skin, resulting in patient discomfort, impaired ipsilateral shoulder function and higher risk
      of surgical site infection and prolongs the hospitalisation. In rare cases, a fibrous
      encapsulated seroma is resistant to conservative treatment and requires surgical resection.
      Thus, seroma may also impact health care costs requiring longer hospital stay or unplanned
      outpatient visits and may delay adjuvant therapy.

      Recent data suggest that quilting suture through flap fixation reduces the incidence of
      seroma. Therefore, quilting suture has the potential to increase patients' quality of life,
      as well as to shorten the length of hospital stay and to reduce hospital costs The aim of
      this trial is to compare the efficacy of quilting suture of the dead space at the pectoral
      area and/or axilla with that of conventional suture in reducing the total volume of
      post-mastectomy and/or axillary drainage and seroma in female patients after surgical
      treatment of breast cancer.The study seeks primarily to determine if quilting suture compared
      to conventional suture after mastectomy/ALND reduces the total volume of axillary drainage
      until drain removal.

      This single blind randomised phase III controlled superiority trial compares 2 surgical
      techniques: quilting suture and conventional suture. Patients will be assigned to one of 2
      parallel groups: Arm A: quilting suture and Arm B: (no quilting suture): conventional wound
      closure.

      Duration of accrual: 2 years - Duration of trial treatment: 1 day (surgery). Surgery
      procedure: Mastectomies or ALND dissections using a standardized technique, with multiple
      quilting sutures in the site of the mastectomy/in the dissected axilla or conventional
      closure without quilting. In both procedures placement of one drain into the breast and
      axilla or in the axillary cavity.

      All randomised patients will be followed for 12 weeks. Patients will fill in 2 questionnaires
      (Quality of Life: EQ5-D and Brief Pain Inventory: BPI). The Health Economic Analysis form
      (HEA) will be completed by the investigator collecting the patient data.

      At the study visits the following examinations will be performed: physical examination,
      blinded assessment of seroma, axillary drain volume, adverse events and surgical site
      infections.

      The sample size is based on the primary endpoint, the total volume of axillary drainage. We
      assume a reduction in the total volume of axillary drainage of 200 ml in the intervention arm
      (application of quilting sutures) compared to the control arm (no application of sutures),
      which is based on literature and actual measurements in 14 patients. A total of 106 patients
      (53 in each group) will yield a power of 80% to detect this difference at a two-sided
      significance level of 0.05.

    <description>This questionnaire is a well validated and commonly used self-report measure to assess the severity of pain and the interference of pain with daily activities as well as the quality of life, patient's subjective experience of disease and treatment. The BPI assesses pain at its &quot;worst,&quot; &quot;least,&quot; &quot;average,&quot; and &quot;now&quot; (current pain) on a scale from 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain as bad as you can imagine) during the past 24 hours A clinically meaningful change in worst pain is defined as a change from baseline of at least 2 points in either direction. The BPI measures how much pain has interfered general activity, walking, work, mood, enjoyment of life, relations with others, and sleep. BPI pain interference is typically scored as the mean of the seven interference items. This mean can be used if more than 50% or four of seven of the total items have been completed on a given administration.</description>

    <description>EuroQol Group developed the questionnaire to describe and value health-related quality of life patient's subjective experience of disease and treatment. This includes 5 assessments: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression. Each assessment has 5 levels: no problems (1), slight problems (2), moderate problems (3), severe problems (4) and extreme problems (5). The patient ticks the box against the most appropriate statement in each of the 5 dimensions, which are summed in a 5-digit number describing the respondent's health state: having no problems for 1, slight problems for 2, moderate problems for 3, severe problems for 4 and extreme problems for 5.
On the form there is also a scale with numbers from 0 to 100. 100 is the best health and 0 the worst health the patient can imagine. The patient has to tick the appropriate number.</description>
