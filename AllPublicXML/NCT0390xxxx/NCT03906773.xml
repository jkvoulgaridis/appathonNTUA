  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      this project seeks to: validate results of ACP framework pilot study in a larger randomized
      controlled trial (rates and quality of ACP documentation) prior to using participatory design
      to develop an Electronic Health Record (EHR)-tethered patient portal delivered ACP
      communication guide, tailored for use in busy primary care settings, incorporating patients,
      caregivers, and primary care providers

    <description>The investigators seek to conduct a pragmatic trial including 2 sister clinical sites to test an innovation using a patient portal framework for Advance Care Planning. The intervention site implemented the intervention (secure patient portal delivered pre-visit planning framework for Advance Care Planning communication). The presence of ACP and the quality of documentation will be assessed through post-intervention chart review. Practice level enrollment was sought for the trial, and the framework will be delivered to all patients during a period of roll out. About 250 patients will receive the intervention.</description>

    <description>The intervention tested a pre-visit ACP workflow centered around a framework sent via secure Electronic Health Record (EHR)-linked patient portal in a real world clinical setting. The primary objectives were to determine its impact on frequency and quality of ACP documentation.</description>
