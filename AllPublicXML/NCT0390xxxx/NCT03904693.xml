  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Combination therapy in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) has been the subject of active
      investigation for more than a decade, with the benefit of targeting different pathways known
      to be involved in the pathogenesis of the disease. Adherence to prescribed therapy has an
      impact on clinical outcomes. Reducing the pill/tablet count and frequency has a major impact
      on patients' adherence to therapies and therefore the observed clinical outcomes. One way to
      simplify treatment is to use fixed-dose combination (FDC) products that combine multiple
      treatments targeting different pathways into a single tablet.

      This study aims to demonstrate that the FDC of macitentan and tadalafil is more effective
      that therapy with 10 mg of macitentan alone or 40 mg of tadalafil alone. This phase 3 study
      will evaluate the efficacy and safety at 16 weeks of an FDC (macitentan 10 mg and tadalafil
      40 mg) against these two PAH-approved therapies given as monotherapy to further confirm the
      added value of the FDC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PAH is characterized by a progressive increase in pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) and in
      pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) potentially leading to right heart failure and death.
      Current PAH-specific therapeutic options include treatments that target the three pathways
      (endothelin, nitric oxide, and prostacyclin pathways). While combination treatment is common,
      FDC pills or tablets that combine two or more PAH-specific therapies are not available,
      thereby requiring participants to take multiple pills/tablets daily. An FDC is an attractive
      option for PAH participants because it simplifies the treatment regimen by combining two
      therapies (which would otherwise involve a total of three tablets: one macitentan 10 mg
      tablet and two tadalafil 20 mg tablets) into a single tablet. Macitentan is an orally active,
      non-peptide, potent dual endothelin receptor A and B antagonist. Tadalafil is a selective
      inhibitor of phosphodiesterase type-5 (PDE-5), the enzyme responsible for the degradation of
      cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). This study comprises the following consecutive
      periods: Screening period (lasts up to 30 days), Double-blind treatment period (consists of
      the titration phase [the first 2 weeks] and the maintenance phase [Week 3 through Week 16]),
      Open-label treatment period, End-of-Treatment (EOT), Safety follow-up (S-FU) period, and End
      of Study (EOS). The total study duration for a participant will be up to 30 months. Study
      assessments like physical examinations, vital signs, right heart catheterization, 6-minute
      walk test will be performed. Safety will be assessed throughout the study.

    <intervention_model_description>In total, approximately 170 subjects are planned to be randomized into study to receive either FDC macitentan/tadalafil or macitentan 10 mg or tadalafil 40 mg given once daily (o.d.). Subjects will also receive matching placebos for the two other study treatments to maintain the masking ('blind'). Treatment allocation will be stratified based on prior PAH therapy ( i.e., treatment-naïve or treated by an Endothelin receptor antagonist [ERA] or a Phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitor [PDE-5i] as a monotherapy) at baseline. Sample size will be re-estimated at interim analysis if study is not terminated early for efficacy/futility up to sample size of 120 to 250. After completion of double-blind treatment period, subjects will continue the study in an open-label treatment period for 24 months, during which all subjects will receive FDC macitentan/tadalafil. All assessments at end of double-blind treatment (EDBT) must be completed before subject enters open-label treatment (OLT) period.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>PVR is the resistance in the pulmonary vasculature that has to be overcome to push blood from the right side of the heart to the lungs. PVR measured by Right Heart Catheterization (RHC) has diagnostic and prognostic value as well as offers an objective judgement on treatment response and efficacy.</description>

    <description>The purpose of the six-minute walk test (6MWT) is to quantify exercise tolerance and capacity. This standardized test measures the distance an individual is able to walk over a total of six minutes on a hard, flat surface. The goal is for the individual to walk as far as possible in six minutes. This endpoint is associated with prognosis and clinical outcomes such as improvement of hemodynamics.</description>
