    <textblock>
      This study is composed of dose escalation stage and dose expansion stage. In dose escalation
      stage, patients with advanced solid tumor will be enrolled and administrated with
      Fruquintinib in combination with Sintilimab. The MTD ( maximum tolerated dose) or RP2D (
      Recommended Phase 2 Dose) will be determined in this stage. In dose expansion stage,
      additional patients will be enrolled and be treated at RP2D to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability and efficacy.

      This study is composed of dose escalation stage and dose expansion stage. In dose escalation
      stage, 9-12 patients with advance solid tumor will be sequentially enrolled in Cohort A
      (Fruquintinib 3 mg QD (once a day), oral dosing, 3 weeks on/1 weeks off+Sintilimab 200mg
      Q4W(4 times a week), intravenous dosing) and Cohort B (Fruquintinib 4 mg QD, oral dosing, 3
      weeks on/1 week off+Sintilimab 200mg Q4W, intravenous dosing). The MTD or RP2D will be
      determined in this stage. In dose expansion stage, 75 patients with advanced solid tumor will
      be enrolled and treated with RP2D. Efficacy, safety and tolerability will be assessed and PK
      (Pharmacokinetics) analysis will be performed in this study.
