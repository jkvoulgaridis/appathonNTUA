    <textblock>
      While the scientific understanding of pharmacogenomics is quickly accelerating, its
      translation to clinical decision-making (especially in psychiatric practice) has progressed
      more slowly. In an effort to begin to bridge this translational gap, genetic testing has been
      developed for various and commonly existing psychiatric disorders, such as major depression,
      schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and pain syndromes to improve the safety of prescribing
      psychotropic medications for these disorders. This genetic testing incudes several
      pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetic genetic factors, such as the cytochrome P450 1A2 gene
      (CYP1A2); the cytochrome P450 2B6 (CYP2B6) gene; P450 2D6 gene (CYP2D6); the cytochrome P450
      2C9 gene (CYP2C9); the cytochrome P450 2C19 gene (CYP2C19); uridine-glucoronyl-transferase
      2B15 (UGT2B15) gene; the serotonin transporter gene (Solute Carrier Family 6 Member; SLC6A4);
      p-glycoprotein ( ATP-binding cassette sub-family B member 1; ABCB1) transporter gene; the
      serotonin 2A receptor gene (HTR2A); the serotonin 2C receptor (HTR2C) gene; serotonin 1a
      receptor (5HT1a) gene; dopamine 1 receptor (DRD1) gene; dopamine 2 receptor (DRD2) gene;
      adrenergic alpha-2A receptor (alpha-2A) gene; opioid mu (opioid receptor mu 1; OPRM1)
      receptor gene; dopamine synthesis gene (ankyrin repeat and kinase domain containing 1;
      ANKK1); dopamine metabolizing enzyme [Catechol-o-methyltransferase (COMT]) gene; kainite
      receptor gene (glutamate ionotropic receptor kainate type subunit 4; GRIK4); folate
      (methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase; MTHFR) gene; sodium channels (sodium voltage-gated
      channel alpha subunit 2; SCN2A) gene.

      The interpretive report is based on copies of these multiple informative genes. The
      investigators are proposing to utilize comprehensive genetic testing to select more
      genetically-informed psychotropic medications to enhance their effectiveness in real-world
      patients with psychiatric illnesses such as schizophrenia, major depression, bipolar
      affective disorder as well as pain in a state hospital setting. The investigators plan to use
      genetic testing offered by Admera® for major classes of psychotropic medications. The
      investigators hypothesize that genetic testing will demonstrate clinical benefits by
      improving state hospital patients' response and decreasing their adverse effects. The
      proposed study will be conducted in a total sample of 60 subjects diagnosed with
      schizophrenia, major depression, bipolar affective disorder as well as pain at the Oregon
      State Hospital, Salem Oregon over a total period of 24 months

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is considerable inter-individual variability in therapeutic drug response, required
      dosage and adverse effects in psychotropic treatment. Few patients experience a remission of
      their illness when initially treated with any medications.1,2 In those who remain
      symptomatic, less than half will experience a significant improvement with a change in
      medication or with the addition of an alternative psychotropic medication.2 Variation in drug
      response is complex and is dependent on a number of factors, including diagnostic accuracy,
      the potential for drug-drug interactions, age, gender, renal and hepatic functioning, medical
      and psychiatric comorbidity, nutritional status, coincident substance use, genomic and
      related downstream translational factors and patient compliance. In recent studies examining
      the use of antidepressants, antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, and pain medications
      substantial proportions of study patients discontinue treatment as a consequence of adverse
      effects or symptom relapse.3-5 Similarly in community practice settings, nearly half of the
      patients make no follow-up visits, and only a fourth return to pursue regular primary
      treatment.6,7 Prolonged times to response whether caused by adverse effects or by other
      factors are associated with substantial increased risk for morbidity or mortality.
      Pharmacogenomic testing is expected to improve response, as well as minimize the likelihood
      of adverse effects associated with patient nonadherence and extended morbidity.8-10 While the
      scientific understanding of pharmacogenomics is quickly accelerating, its translation to
      clinical decision-making in practice has progressed more slowly.11,12 In an effort to begin
      to bridge this translational gap, a pharmacogenomic/pharmacogenetic testing has been
      developed for various and commonly existing psychiatric disorders to improve the safety of
      prescribing medications. This pharmacogenomic-based interpretive report is based on
      genotyping both copies of multiple informative genes, which are: the cytochrome P450 1A2 gene
      (CYP1A2); the cytochrome P450 2B6 (CYP2B6) gene; P450 2D6 gene (CYP2D6); the cytochrome P450
      2C9 gene (CYP2C9); the cytochrome P450 2C19 gene (CYP2C19); uridine-glucoronyl-transferase
      2B15 (UGT2B15) gene; the serotonin transporter gene (Solute Carrier Family 6 Member; SLC6A4);
      p-glycoprotein ( ATP-binding cassette sub-family B member 1; ABCB1) transporter gene; the
      serotonin 2A receptor gene (HTR2A); the serotonin 2C receptor (HTR2C) gene; serotonin 1a
      receptor (5HT1a) gene; dopamine 1 receptor (DRD1) gene; dopamine 2 receptor (DRD2) gene;
      adrenergic alpha-2A receptor (alpha-2A) gene; opioid mu (opioid receptor mu 1; OPRM1)
      receptor gene; dopamine synthesis gene (ankyrin repeat and kinase domain containing 1;
      ANKK1); dopamine metabolizing enzyme [Catechol-o-methyltransferase (COMT]) gene; kainite
      receptor gene (glutamate ionotropic receptor kainate type subunit 4; GRIK4); folate
      (methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase; MTHFR) gene; sodium channels (sodium voltage-gated
      channel alpha subunit 2; SCN2A) gene.

      The cytochrome P450 enzymes' genes code for the enzymes that are responsible for metabolism
      of most antipsychotic, antidepressant and pain medications. The UGT2B15 is for benzodiazepine
      metabolism. The COMT gene is for dopamine metabolism and is relevant for cognitive function,
      depression and smoking. The SLC6A4 and the 5HT2A have been associated with differential
      treatment response to specific medications. The 5HT2C is for weight gain; the ABCB1 gene is
      for pain; some psychotropics such as risperidone; the dopamine 2 (D2) receptor gene for
      psychotropic medications, weight gain and pain medications; and the opioid mu (OPRM1)
      receptor gene for weight and pain; Sodium channels (SCN2A) gene for autism, seizures and
      bipolar disorder; GRIK4 gene is for kainite receptor involvement with rapidly acting
      antidepressants, pain, dysphoria, and potentially psychotropic medications' ANKK1 is for
      smoking, weight management, and bipolar disorder. The MHTFR is for antidepressants; D1 is for
      psychotropic response.

      Such genetic testing has a significant potential to reduce healthcare costs through increased
      efficacy and tolerability of antidepressant medications as well as medication adherence.
      However, there is a relative lack of such efforts with psychotropic medications (APMs) in the
      treatment of various psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, major depression, or
      bipolar disorder. This is despite significant room for improvement in efficacy and
      tolerability of currently available drugs in such patients. Consequently, the investigators
      are proposing to utilize genetic testing to select more genetically-informed medications to
      enhance their effectiveness in real-world patients with psychiatric illnesses such as
      schizophrenia, major depression, and bipolar affective disorder as well as medical problem
      with chronic pain in a large state hospital setting. The investigators plan to use genetic
      testing offered by Admera® for medications. The investigators hypothesize that utilizing such
      pharmacogenomic testing as a treatment decision support tool will demonstrate clinical
      benefits by improving patient response and decreasing adverse effects to the psychotropic
      medications. The proposed study will be conducted at the Oregon State Hospital, Salem Oregon
      over a total period of 12 months.

    <measure>Positive Subscale of Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>PANSS is one of the most widely clinical scales to monitor positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. The scores range from 30 to 210. A score of 58 is considered mildly ill; 75 is moderately ill and 95 is markedly ill; and 116 is severely ill. This study will only use the scores from positive subscale (range 7 to 49) and the eligibility criteria will require a moderate score on 4 positive sub-scale items, including hallucinations, delusions, suspiciousness and conceptual disorganization to qualify for the study.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Behavioral Assessment of Pain Screening Instrument (BAPSI)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>This scale assesses level of pain-related disability, psychological distress, and pain intensity. 0 - 3 = minimal levels of average pain intensity; 4 - 6 = moderate levels of average pain intensity; 7 - 10 = severe levels of average pain intensity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>This is a scale to assess severity of anxiety symptoms. Total score=21; 5-9 = Mild; 10-14 = Moderate; &gt;15 = Severe
*For Panic Disorder, Social Phobia, &amp; PTSD, cutoff score of 8 may be used for optimal sensitivity/specificity (see Evidence section).
Critical Actions
This tool should be used for screening and monitoring symptom severity and cannot replace a clinical assessment and diagnosis.
Do not forget to rule out medical causes of anxiety before diagnosing an anxiety disorder (for example, EKG for arrhythmias, TSH for thyroid disease).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Public Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>This is a commonly used scale in clinical practice to assess depressive symptoms. The total score is 36. Score of 0-4 = Minimal or no depressive symptoms; 5-9 = Mild symptoms; 10-14 = moderate symptoms; 15-19 = Moderately severe symptoms; 20-27 = severe symptoms.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) and Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>CGI-S will be used to assess severity o illness at baseline. The total score ranges from 0 to 7, where 0 is not assessed; 3 is mildly ill; 5 is markedly ill; and 7 is most extensively ill. While CGI-I is is scored from 0 to 7, where 0 is not assessed; 1 is very much improved; 3 is minimally improved; 5 is minimally worse and 7 is very much worse.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-Report Quality of Life Scale (SQLS)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>This is a 30-item questionnaire, comprising three scales ('psychosocial', 'motivation and energy', and 'symptoms and side-effects') addressing different SQLS dimensions. Each quality of life item is scored from 0 to 4, where 0 is not assessed, 1 is rare; 2 is sometimes, 3 is often and 4 is frequently. The score can range from 0 to 120, where higher scores reflect lower quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Social &amp; Occupational Functional Assessment Scale (SOFAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>7 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>SOFAS focuses exclusively on the individual's level of social and occupational functioning and is not directly influenced by the overall severity of the individual's psychological symptoms. It is scored from 0 to 100, where 100 = Superior functioning in a wide range of activities; 80 = No more than a slight impairment in social, occupational, or school functioning (e.g., infrequent interpersonal conflict, temporarily falling behind in schoolwork); 60 is Moderate difficulty in social, occupational, or school functioning (e.g., few friends, conflicts with peers or co-workers); 40 = Major impairment in several areas, such as work or school, family relations; and 20 = Occasionally fails to maintain minimal personal hygiene; unable to function independently.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS)</measure>
    <time_frame>7 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The AIMS is a 12-item clinician-rated scale to assess severity of EPS, especially dyskinesias in patients taking neuroleptic medications. It also assesses overall severity, incapacitation, and the patient's level of awareness of the movements, and distress associated with them. Items are scored on a 0 (none) to 4 (severe) basis; the scale provides a total score (items 1 through 7) or item 8 can be used in isolation as an indication of overall severity of symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>UKU Side Effect Rating Scale (USERS)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>USERS is a comprehensive scale to assess side effects from medications. It is composed of several sub-scales but in this study we will only use the sub-scales that are frequently associated with neuroleptic medications i.e., psychic (10 items), neurologic (8 items) and autonomic (11 items). Each item is scores as 9, 0, 1, 2 and 3, the higher number represents a subjectively reported increase in frequency of respective side effect.</description>
