  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether allowing ingestion of
      sub-threshold amounts of peanut in those with a high threshold (tolerate at least 143 mg
      peanut protein on supervised double-blind, placebo-controlled oral food challenge [DBPCFC])
      will be associated with attaining even higher thresholds over time in children with high
      threshold peanut allergy compared to those avoiding peanut. The secondary clinical objectives
      include assessing the development of sustained unresponsiveness (SU, a surrogate term for
      tolerance without daily ingestion), effects on quality of life, and safety compared to those
      avoiding peanut. Additionally, this study will phenotype the allergic response to peanut
      based on threshold and response to exposure. Mechanistic study objectives will determine the
      immune and molecular basis of the high threshold endotype, identify predictors of response to
      exposure, and determine mechanisms and biomarkers of remission.

    <description>The Food Allergy Quality of Lifeâ€”Parental Burden (FAQL-PB) Scale is a 17-item instrument. It utilizes a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not troubled) to 6 (extremely troubled). The number circled for each question is summed to provide a total continuous score with a higher score indicating greater burden on the family. Scores can range from 0 to 102 or can be divided by 17 to obtain a mean total score from 0 to 6.</description>
