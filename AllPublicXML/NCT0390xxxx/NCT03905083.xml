      The overall objective of this study is to fulfill the Pilot study (miRNA and Myokines
      Acutely-expressed During Exercise) goal to Investigate the excretion of skeletal
      muscle-derived miRNA and myokines in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension during
      acute exercise that are biologically active and modulate skeletal muscle function during
      exercise.

      Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), is characterized by the proliferation of endothelial
      and smooth muscle cells within the precapillary pulmonary vasculature, if untreated results
      in increased pulmonary vascular resistance and death. The hallmark perivascular infiltrates
      in PAH contain inflammatory macrophages and lymphocytes resulting in endothelial dysfunction
      and involves the dysregulation of distinct inflammatory mechanisms. Idiopathic PAH (iPAH) and
      scleroderma-associated PAH (SSc-PAH), are related by similar clinical and pathophysiologic
      features. Patients with PAH experience a central cardiovascular limitation to exercise.
      Despite effective treatment with pulmonary vasodilators, many resting PAH (rPAH) patients
      continue to experience exercise intolerance. PAH is increasingly acknowledged as a systemic
      disease, beyond abnormalities of the pulmonary vasculature. Although other contributions to
      exercise intolerance in PAH exist, skeletal muscle dysfunction significantly impacts exercise
      tolerance. The molecular mechanisms behind skeletal muscle dysfunction in PAH remain unclear.
      Provocative testing with invasive cardiopulmonary exercise testing challenges the
      cardio-pulmonary-vascular and skeletal muscle systems and elicits a cascade of physiologic
      events not measurable at rest. Myokines are circulating mediators released from skeletal
      muscle in an endocrine-like fashion in disease and health influencing many factors but not
      limited to systemic inflammation, immunity and endothelial function. Myokines have not been
      well described in PAH. Preliminary data indicate that myokines play important, yet still
      undescribed, roles in this disease. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA molecules,
      which negatively regulate gene expression via repressing translation and degrading messenger
      RNAs through sequence-specific binding. There is a growing literature regarding the
      biological activity of extracellular miRNAs in PAH and in aerobic exercise. miR-126 has been
      implicated in skeletal muscle dysfunction in PAH, while miR-133 is skeletal muscle-specific
      but unlike miR-126 it is not yet implicated in skeletal muscle dysfunction in PAH.

    <description>Muscle biopsy for miRNA and myokine assessment will be performed for this outcome. Total RNA and protein extracted from quadriceps muscle biopsies will be used to measure RNA and protein expression. We will perform a secretome analysis utilizing the Mass Spectrometry Lab at the University of Pittsburgh for an unbiased assessment of muscle-secreted myokines in our subjects.

    <description>This will be done by measuring hemodynamics during invasive cardiopulmonary exercise test. We will correlate miRNA and myokines released from the skeletal muscle with measures of oxygen delivery and extraction in the muscle and oxygen consumption - calculated from arterial and pulmonary artery blood gasses and invasive hemodynamics. Oxygen delivery to peripheral tissues is determined by (Q ) ̇x CaO2. Oxygen extraction is Ca-vO2. Oxygen consumption is continuously measured by iCPET as( V) ̇O2. Systemic oxygen extraction ratio is determined by (Ca-vO2)/ CaO2</description>
