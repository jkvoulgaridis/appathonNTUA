      Assessment of cognitive function in patients undergoing elective carotid endarterectomy

      Classical treatment for ICA stenosis is carotid endarterectomy (CEA), which has been proven
      effective in preventing future stroke as well as improving cerebral perfusion. However, the
      influence of CEA on cognition is less defined, it remains unclear whether CEA can improve
      cognitive function. A change in cognition is one of the most threatening diseases of recent
      years, cognitive impairment significantly impacts patients, families, and healthcare system.

      The difference in the cognitive outcome may be accounted for microembolic events and adverse
      changes in haemodynamic circumstances.

      The aim of our study is to identify those factors what may have role in the postoperative
      cognitive decline.

      The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the university ( SE RKEB: 17/2019) and
      written informed consent will be obtained from all patients.

      The investigators intend to enroll patient aged more than 18 years undergoing elective
      carotid endarterectomy at our hospital ( Semmelweis University Heart and Vascular Center).
      Exclusion criterion included young age (less than 18 years), incapacity and urgent surgery.
      The investigators would like to register at least 100-150 patients in our study.

      Most relevant anamnestic dates, the results of the laboratory and radiological reports will
      be recorded. Cognitive functions will be assessed one day before, one day and six month after
      the surgery using MMSE and a questionnaire called Frailty to characterize beside cognitive
      function the physiological reserve of the patients too.

      The investigators manage patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy with general anaesthesia,
      using inhaled or total intravenous agents.

      During the operation the investigators record beside the routine monitoring (intraarterial
      blood pressure, ECG, oxygen saturation, EtCO2, MAC) the cerebral tissue oxygen saturation
      using a near-infrared cerebral oximeter (Invos Cerebral/Somatic Oximeter) and the activity of
      the brain using GE Entropy Module.

      The investigators would like to register the changes in the haemodynamic and cerebral
      condition and compare these results against the clinical outcome and the changes of the
      questionnaires.

      Statistical analyses will be performed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences.
