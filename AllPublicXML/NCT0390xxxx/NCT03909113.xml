  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cow's milk protein allergy is defined as an immunological reaction to one or more milk
      proteins. A variety of symptoms can be suggestive for cow's milk protein allergy . Cow's milk
      protein allergy is suspected clinically in 5-15% of infants, while most estimates of
      prevalence of cow's milk protein allergy vary from only 2 to 5 %. Confusion regarding cow's
      milk protein allergy prevalence is often due to differences in study populations, study
      design and a lack of defined diagnostic criteria. The importance of defined diagnostic
      criteria needs to be emphasised. It precludes infants from an unnecessary diet and avoids
      delay in diagnosis, which can lead to malnutrition. The treatment of cow's milk protein
      allergy is the dietary elimination of cow's milk proteins. In non-breastfed infants and
      children less than 2 years of age, a substitute formula is mandatory as prescribed by several
      international scientific societies. Extensively hydrolyzed formulas are used as therapeutic
      formulas. An extensively hydrolysed formula is often a whey or casein based formula in which
      the protein has been chopped up in smaller pieces that are less allergenic. Because of high
      cross-reactivity (up to 80%) and nutritional inadequacy, the use of any other animal milk or
      soy-based formula is precluded.The infant should be maintained on an elimination diet until
      the child is between 9-12 months of age or at least for 6 months, whichever occurs first. In
      most cases, symptoms will improve substantially within 2-4 weeks if diagnosis is correct.
      According to consensus in literature, a therapeutic formula is a formula tolerated by at
      least 90% (with 95% confidence) of cow's milk protein allergy infants. The primary study
      outcome will be the evaluation of the hypoallergenicity of a new aminoacid based formula in
      children with confirmed immunoglobulin (Ig)E- mediated CMA. According to the American Academy
      of Pediatrics (AAP) Subcommittee on Nutrition and Allergic Diseases a hypoallergenic formula
      must be tested in infants and children with hypersensitivity to cow's milk proteins, with
      findings verified by elimination-challenge tests under double-blind, placebo-controlled
      conditions (DBPCFC).
