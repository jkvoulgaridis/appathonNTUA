  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is associated with progressive decreases in arterial health and function. It is
      crucial to prevent or reduce the negative effects of aging on the vasculature by implementing
      appropriate lifestyle interventions, such as exercise training. We examined the effects of a
      Mat Pilates training (MPT) regimen on arterial stiffness (pulse wave velocity, PWV), blood
      pressure (BP), wave reflection (AIx) and endothelial function in obese premenopausal women
      with elevated BP.

      Using a parallel experimental design, participants were randomly assigned to either MPT
      (n=14) or non-exercising control group (n=14) for 12 weeks. Participant in the MPT group
      trained 3 days/week . Participants' brachial to ankle PWV (baPWV), systolic and diastolic BP,
      AIx, plasma NO levels were measured at baseline and after 20 weeks of their assigned
      intervention.

    <description>The MPT group participated in 3-one hour supervised training sessions per week for 12 weeks. All MP sessions were performed in nonconsecutive days. The MP sessions were divided into the following stages: initial warm up and stretching (10 min), general conditioning consisting of MP exercises (40 min) and stretching and cooling down (10 min). The participants performed 12 basic MP exercises (one set of 6-10 repetitions was performed per exercise). Breathing, a core principle of MP, was performed by forced but controlled inspirations and exhalations, while relaxing and contracting the abdomen, respectively. All sessions were supervised by a certified MP instructor.</description>
