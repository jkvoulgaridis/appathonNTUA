    <textblock>
      This Phase II study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a CD19-targeting humanized
      selective CAR-T (CD19 hsCAR-T) in refractory/relapsed CD19+ B-ALL leukemia patients who have
      no available curative treatment options, have a limited prognosis with currently available
      treatments, and were previously treated with a B cell directed cell therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CD19+ B-ALL patients who have relapsed after murine-based CD19 CAR-T (CD19mCAR-T) treatment
      and/or have limited clinical response to CD19mCAR-T will be enrolled to receive CD19 hsCAR-T
      treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects with refractory/relapse B-cell ALL with no available curative treatment
             options (such as autologous or allogeneic SCT);

          2. Subjects previously treated with B cell-directed engineered cell therapy are eligible
             if they meet the following criteria:

               1. relapsed and/or MRD-positive after prior cell therapy;

               2. partial response to prior cell therapy;

               3. Clinical and laboratory data are available;

          3. Documented CD19 expression after previous B cell-directed therapies;

          4. Aged 1 to 75 years;

          5. KPS＞40；

          6. At least 2 weeks or 5 drug half-lives, whichever is shorter must have elapsed since
             any prior systemic therapy at the time the subject is planned for leukapheresis,
             except for systemic inhibitory/stimulatory immune checkpoint therapy;

          7. Women of childbearing potential must have a urine pregnancy test taken and proven
             negative prior to the treatment. All patients agree to use reliable methods of
             contraception during the trial period and throughout the last follow-up visit;

          8. Subjects with relapsed disease after prior allogeneic SCT (myeloablative or
             non-myeloablative) will be eligible if the patients do not present with active GVHD
             and are not undergoing immunosuppressive regimes;

          9. Patients with CNS3 (WCB ≥5/mL in CSF with presence of lymphoblasts) disease will be
             eligible if the CNS disease is responsive to therapy;

         10. Participation in the clinical trials should be voluntary with signed informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with hypervolemia (white blood cell count&gt; 50 x 10^9 / L) or rapidly
             progressive disease that in the estimation of the investigators and sponsors would
             compromise the patient's ability to complete the study;

          2. History of melanoma skin cancer or other primary tumors (eg, cervical cancer, bladder
             cancer, breast cancer) (except for those with 3 years or longer of cure);

          3. Patients with fungal, bacterial, viral, or other uncontrollable infections or
             infections requiring Level 4 isolation (UTI or inoculation assays may be performed if
             necessary);

          4. Patients with positive results for HIV, HBV, HCV tests;

          5. With CNS disorders such as cerebrovascular ischemia/hemorrhage, dementia, cerebellar
             disease, or autoimmune disease with CNS involvement;

          6. History of myocardial infarction, cardiac angioplasty or stenting, unstable angina, or
             other clinically significant cardiac diseases within 12 months of enrollment, or with
             cardiac atrial or cardiac ventricular lymphoma;

          7. Patients that are receiving anticoagulant therapy or have ever coagulation disorders;

          8. Any medical condition that in the judgment of the sponsors/investigators is likely to
             interfere with assessment of safety or efficacy of study;

          9. History of severe immediate hypersensitivity reaction to any of the agents used in
             this study;

         10. Female patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding;

         11. Feasibility assessment during screening demonstrates &lt;30% transduction of target
             lymphocytes, or insufficient expansion (&lt; 5-fold) in response to CD3/CD28
             co-stimulation;

         12. Patients with any uncontrolled diseases that are unsuitable for enrollment;

         13. CNS3 disease that is progressive on therapy, or with CNS parenchymal lesions that
             might increase the risk of CNS toxicity;

         14. Any situation that is considered to potentially increase the risk of the subject or
             interfere with the outcome of the study;

         15. Patients who have been enrolled in other clinical studies.
