  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Little is known about the exact role of feedback in cortical processing. Hypotheses on its
      function range from attentional control to the transmission of Bayesian priors in the
      interpretation of sensory events, such as in the theory of Predictive Coding. Recent advances
      in identification of functional signatures of feedback and feedforward signal, as well as
      additional techniques based on causal relations in signal processing open a unique
      methodology for probing such processes in awake and behaving organisms and testing these
      theories and more generally the hierarchical processing between cortical areas.

      The objective of this project is to study feedback and feedforward relations and localization
      in the well established pathways between cortical areas V1 and Medial Temporal (MT) that have
      been implicated in early integration processes in motion perception.

    <description>Blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) imaging is the standard technique used to generate images in fMRI studies, and relies on regional differences in cerebral blood flow to delineate regional activity. This non-invasive technic is not inducing any particular risk. The non invasive BOLD fMRI activity will be recorded in healthy subjects during a task of visual perception.</description>
