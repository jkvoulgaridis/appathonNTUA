  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diagnosis of fibromyalgia is complex and treatment options are limited. Pharmacological
      management of fibromyalgia is mainly centered on the central nervous system. In particular
      there is robust evidence for the use of tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., amitriptyline),
      anti-convulsants such as gabapentin or pregabalin and agents from the serotonin
      norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) family such as milnacipran. Aim of the work: To
      compare the efficacy of pregabalin agent (averopreg) alone versus combined pregabalin and
      serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (milnacipran) in the management of fibromyalgia.

      Subjects: The study will include 50 patients diagnosed as having fibromyalgia according to
      the ACR 2010 Fibromyalgia diagnostic criteria.

      Methods: Patients will be classified into two groups:

      1) Group 1: Patients will receive pregabalin as a monotherapy and the doses will be
      administered according to the treatment recommendations for fibromyalgia in the package
      insert, starting by 50mg twice daily increasing to 100 mg twice daily within 1 week based on
      efficacy and tolerability.

      7) Group 2: Patients will receive combined pregabalin and milnacipran and the doses will be
      administered according to the treatment recommendations for fibromyalgia in the package
      insert, starting by 50mg twice daily increasing to 100 mg twice daily within 1 week for the
      pregabalin and starting by 12.5 mg increasing gradually to reach 100 mg daily of milnacipran
      based on efficacy and tolerability.

    <description>assesses the overall functional ability and the impact of fibromyalgia on the patients life, with a range from 0-100, 0 indicating no functional impairment or effect of the disease on the patients life and 100 indicating a very bad and tremendous effect of fibromyalgia on the patients life</description>

    <measure>Leeds sleep evaluation questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The four aspects of sleep around which the questionnaire is devised (Getting to sleep, GTS; Quality of sleep, QOS; Awakening from sleep, AFS; Behaviour following wakefulness, BFW), and assessing the effect of medication on the quality of sleep each question is a 100 mm line that the patient marks, 0 meaning very bad effect or worsening in sleep pattern, 50 meaning no improvement what so ever with no deterioration and 100 meaning excellent improvement in the sleep pattern</description>
