  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Flying phobia (FP) is one of the most prevalent phobias in our society. However, not all
      patients benefit from in vivo exposure, given that an important amount of them do not accept
      the intervention, drop out when they are informed about the intervention procedure, or they
      have problems to access these therapies.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of a computer-aided self-help
      treatment for flying phobia using two procedures to carry out the exposure component: still
      images versus navigable images, compared to a waiting list control group.

      The principal hypothesis is that the two intervention groups will improve significantly
      compared to the waiting list control group. On the other hand, it will be also explored
      whether the sense of presence and the reality judgment are important factors in the efficacy
      and effectiveness of treatment efficacy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Flying phobia (FP) is one of the most prevalent phobias in our society. Around 25% of the
      population that flies experiences intense distress during the flight; around 10% of the
      general population does not fly due to intense fear and 20% of people depend on alcohol or
      tranquilizers to overcome the fear of flying.

      In vivo exposure is the most effective psychological treatment for specific phobias. However,
      not all patients benefit from in vivo exposure, given that an important amount of them do not
      accept the intervention, drop out when they are informed about the intervention procedure, or
      they have problems to access these therapies.

      Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) can improve treatment adherence and
      acceptance. Particularly, computerized programs offer remarkable advantages such as a
      reduction in direct therapeutic contact time, the possibility of standardizing treatment as
      much as possible with a steep exposure gradient, the low cost and, maybe most importantly,
      access to patients who would not be very willing to subject themselves to in vivo exposure.
      The application of cognitive-behavioural procedures such as exposure through interactive
      computer programs is especially recommended.

      On the other hand, it is important to explore the role of the degree of immersion and sense
      of presence in the psychological treatments with ICTs due to the contradictory conclusions
      that had been found in the literature. Therefore, it is expected that the present work
      advances in the knowledge in this field exploring these factors in an Internet-based
      self-applied treatment program for FP.

    <measure>The Fear of Flying Questionnaire (FFQ-II; Bornas, Tortella-Feliu, García de la Banda, Fullana, &amp; Llabrés, 1999)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The FFQ is a 30-item self-report instrument describing situations related to flying: anxiety during flight, anxiety experienced getting on the plane, and anxiety experienced by the observation of neutral or unpleasant flying related situations. For each item, respondents rate their degree of discomfort associated with the situation on a scale of 1 to 9 (1 = not at all, 9 = very much). Scores ranged from 30 to 270. As reported by Bornas et al. (1999), internal consistency was α = .97 and retest reliability (15-day retest period) was r = .92.</description>

    <measure>Fear of Flyng Scale (FFS; Haug, Brenne, Johnsen, Brentzen, Götestam &amp; Hughdal, 1987).</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The FFS is a 21-item self-report measure to assess fear related with different flying situations. Fear elicited by each situation was rated on a 5-point scale (0 = not at all, 4 = very much), with scores ranging from 0 to 84. The original FFS reported a Cronbach's alpha of .94, and retest reliability (after a three months period) was .86 (Haug et al., 1987).</description>

    <measure>Fear and Avoidance Scales (adapted from Marks &amp; Mathews, 1979)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants assessed their fear and avoidance on a scale ranging from 0 (&quot;No fear at all,&quot; &quot;I never avoid&quot;) to 10 (&quot;Severe fear,&quot; &quot;I always avoid&quot;) for situations related with flying.
The degree of belief in catastrophic thought was also assessed on a scale of 0 to 10.
Participants assessed their fear and avoidance on a scale ranging from 0 (&quot;No fear at all,&quot; &quot;I never avoid&quot;) to 10 (&quot;Severe fear,&quot; &quot;I always avoid&quot;) for situations related with flying.

    <measure>Patient's Improvement Scale (Adapted from the Clinical Global Impression scale, CGI; Guy, 1976).</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>One item on the CGI scale was adapted in order to assess the level of improvement achieved by the patient (compared to the baseline) on a 7-point scale (1 &quot;much worse&quot; to 7 &quot;much better&quot;). This scale is answered by the patient.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Expectations Scale and Treatment's Opinion (adapted from Borkovec &amp; Nau, 1972)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The patients are given a brief explanation of the intervention and this self-report inventory measures their expectations before they start the treatment. The satisfaction is assessed when they complete the treatment. The 6 items are rated from 1 (&quot;Not at all&quot;) to 10 (&quot;Highly&quot;) and provide information about the extent to which: 1) the treatment is perceived as logic; 2) patients are satisfied with the treatment; 3) the treatment would be recommended to a friend with the same problem; 4) the treatment would be useful to treat other psychological problems; 5) patients perceive the treatment as useful for their particular problem; and 6) the treatment is perceived as aversive.</description>

    <description>&quot;NO-FEAR Airlines&quot; is an Internet-based self-applied treatment program that allows people with Flying Phobia the exposure to images and sounds related to their phobic fears on a standard personal computer. The treatment can be totally self-applied.
&quot;NO-FEAR Airlines&quot; contains 6 scenarios related to the flight process: (1) flight preparation, (2) airport, (3) boarding and taking off, (4) the central part of the flight, (5) the airplane's descent, approach to the runway, and landing, (6) sequences with images and auditory stimuli related to plane crashes.</description>
