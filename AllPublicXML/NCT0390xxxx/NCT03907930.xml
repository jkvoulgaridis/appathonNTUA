      prospective randomized study measuring the safety and efficacy of tubeless PNL in patients at

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PNL) is considered to be the procedure of choice for the
      treatment of upper urinary tract calculi. It was first introduced in 1976, and since that the
      operative technique and the endoscopic equipments underwent many modifications to increase
      the success rates and to decrease complications.

      Because of high success rate, low morbidity and complication rate, this minimally invasive
      modality has replaced the open surgical approach. the standard procedure is to place
      nephrostomy tubes within the tract of varying caliber and types.

      This was done to facilitate maximal collecting system drainage, to tamponade the access tract
      and also securing the access in case of 2nd look PNL was needed. multiple studies demonstrate
      significant morbidity associated with nephrostomy tube following PNL, mainly postoperative
      pain that requires significant narcotic and also long hospital stay. the idea of the
      &quot;tubeless&quot; PCNL was born, whereby a nephrostomy tube is not left in place following the
      percutaneous procedure, but rather renal drainage is established with an indwelling ureteral
      stent. Tubeless PNL has been challenged by certain problems as regard the selection of the
      patients. Another problem that is facing the tubeless PNL may be is the question regarding
      the access tract and how to deal with?. Finally, Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) has
      become the standard treatment for kidney stones and/or upper ureter, but Whether nephrostomy
      tube placement is necessary after PCNL is still a matter of debate
