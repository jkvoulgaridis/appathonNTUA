      Prospective, multicenter, randomized, open-label study of standard of care plus the PMX
      cartridge versus standard of care alone in patients with endotoxemic septic shock

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, open-label trial of standard medical care
      plus the PMX cartridge versus standard medical care alone, in subjects with endotoxemia and
      septic shock. Subjects in critical care areas will be assessed for septic shock using known
      or suspected infection, multiple organ failure, fluid resuscitation and hypotension requiring
      vasopressor support as primary criteria. Subjects will meet all entry criteria for study if
      endotoxin activity is within the range of ≥ 0.60 to &lt;0.90.

      Eligible and consented subjects will be randomized to receive either the PMX cartridge
      (administered twice for 1½ to 2 hours per treatment session approximately 24 hours apart)
      plus standard medical care or standard medical care alone. For all randomized subjects, a
      follow-up visit (if they are still in the hospital) or a telephone call will be completed at
      Day 28 (or later) to determine their mortality status. In surviving subjects, a follow-up
      visit or telephone call to determine their mortality status will also take place at
      approximately three months (i.e. Day 90) and 12 months after the subject was randomized.

    <description>TORAYMYXIN PMX-20R (PMX) is an extracorporeal hemoperfusion cartridge intended for the selective removal of endotoxin from circulating blood through direct hemoperfusion (DHP). Each treatment will target 2 hours with a minimum of 1 ½ hours, at a flow rate of approximately 100 mL/minute, (range of 80 to 120 mL/minute).</description>
