  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this study is to prospectively characterize social health disparities in a
      cross-sectional cohort of glioma patients with attention to exploring and thematically
      categorizing the patient-specific and community-level factors. This will be conducted in two
      parts.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Part 1:

      Primary Objectives

      1. To describe the social determinants of health in a cross-section of patients with WHO
      Grade 2-4 gliomas using a group of validated instruments including the PRAPARE instrument,
      the Accountable Health Communities Health-Related Social Needs Screening Tool (AHC HRSN), and
      supplementary questions.

      Secondary Objectives

        1. To compare social determinants of health between patients residing in economically
           disadvantaged and advantaged communities as defined in our prior study (low income
           communities vs high income county communities, by zip code).

        2. To compare social determinants of health between patients residing in economically
           disadvantaged and advantaged communities as defined by other means including county (low
           income communities vs high income communities, by county), by urban vs rural (urban vs
           rural, by city), and by area deprivation index (see Section 5.2).

        3. To quantify and compare the patient- and community-level social determinants of health
           present in the cohort and by community (low income community vs high income community).

        4. To compare the time to presentation, time to treatment initiation, and extent of surgery
           for patients from economically disadvantaged and advantaged communities as described
           above.

      Part 2:

      Data from our preliminary study revealed differences in survival for patients from low income
      communities compared to high income community zip codes. The overarching goal of Part 2 is to
      further characterize the social factors that characterize low income community and high
      income communities and may contribute to the differences in outcome.

      Primary Aim

        1. To identify, compare, contrast, and contextualize the patient- and community-specific
           social determinants for patients residing in (1) low income communities and high income
           community zip codes and (2) urban and rural communities.

        2. To explore how patients perceive communication with their providers about social and
           community factors that contribute to health outcomes and understand the barriers,
           challenges, and opportunities to improve patient-provider communication.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>PRAPARE Instrument Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>A 21 question questionnaire to collect data based on five main social determinants of health (education, economic status, neighborhood/surrounding environment, health and healthcare, community involvement). The questionnaire is comprised of Yes or No answers, multiple choice questions and Likert scale questions (not at all to quite a bit). This will be completed in Part 1 of the study.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Accountable Health Communities Health-Related Social Needs Screening Tool</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>An 18 question screening tool to help find out participants' needs in areas of housing instability, food insecurity, utility help needs, financial status, family and community support and physical activity. The questionnaire is comprised of Yes or No answers, multiple choice questions and Likert scale questions (Not hard at all to very hard; never to often). This will be completed in Part 1 of the study.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Social Determinants of Health Supplementary Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The questionnaire is composed of 5 sections (economic status, social and community context, neighborhood and environment, health and healthcare and education) and has a combination of Yes or No questions, multiple choice questions, and Likert questions (never to always). This will be completed in Part 1 of the study.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of Social Determinants Based on Two Communities</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 90 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Social determinants of health between participants residing in economically disadvantaged and advantaged communities (defined by zip codes) will be compared by comparing responses to questionnaires for these two populations based on the residential zip codes. This will be conducted during Part 2 of the study.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Social Determinants of Health in Participants</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 90 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Patient-specific factors will be quantified using the PRAPARE instrument, the Accountable Health Communities Health-Related Social Needs Screening Tool, and supplemental questions data collected from Part 1 of the study to compare social determinants of health among participants. This will be conducted during Part 2 of the study.</description>
