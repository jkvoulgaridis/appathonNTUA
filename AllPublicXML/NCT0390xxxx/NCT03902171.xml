      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of use of Soberlink on treatment
      experience for individuals with alcohol use disorder while enrolled in an In-Home Addiction
      Treatment program. Treatment engagement, feelings related to autonomy and empowerment, and
      overall quality of life will be evaluated. Although not the primary focus, recidivism and
      relapse will be measured.

      The study will include 30 Clients with a primary or secondary diagnosis of alcohol use
      disorder (AUD) and who are enrolled in Aware Recovery Care's In-Home Addiction Treatment
      program where Care Teams will monitor cloud-based breathalyzer results. Soberlink's
      cloud-based breathalyzer system will provide data to Care Team if the Client has relapsed or
      is not compliant with testing through the Soberlink System. Clients will use Soberlink for
      180 days within context of routine alcohol use disorder treatment at Aware Recovery Care.
