  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Among all cancers, lung cancer (PC) is the most common disease on the planet, accounting for
      13% of the cases, and leading the number of deaths from malignant diseases. In Brazil, it is
      estimated that its incidence between 2018 and 2019 could be 18,704 new cases in men and
      12,503,000 new cases in women. These data take into account an estimated risk of 18.16 new
      cases for 100,000 men and 11.81 for 100,000 women, respectively occupying the second and
      fourth most frequent cases of the disease according to gender (INCA, 2017) .

      Surgeries, however aggressive they may be, are one of the most viable alternatives for
      patients with PC, provided it is performed in the milder or early phase of the disease, since
      after such period this procedure may have a period degree greater than the other forms of
      treatment (TANOUE, ONN, 2002).

      As a consequence, the injuries that the surgical procedure can cause to patients, pain is one
      of the most influential in the patient's quality of life. It can lead the individual to a
      marked state of disability both functional and psychological, thus being determinant for the
      suffering related to the disease, thus comprising its multifactorial character, involving
      physical, emotional, socio-cultural and environmental aspects (RANGEL, TELLES, 2012) .

      For the control of pain, physiotherapy appears with features such as transcutaneous nerve
      electrostimulation (TENS), where its use for the suppression of pain has become quite
      feasible due mainly to the ease of its handling, to be noninvasive and to serve to reduce
      acute pain and chronic (PENA, BARBOSA, ISHIKAWA, 2008, GLARE et al, 2014).

      The use of conventional TENS to support the use of analgesics reduced the intensity of pain
      in patients of the second day of thoracotomy, but for a longer extension of their effects, it
      would take a longer time to apply the resource, something around 24 -48 hours (FERREIRA et
      al, 2011). In a systematic review and meta-analysis, Sbruzzi et al. (2012) states that the
      use of TENS in postoperative thoracic surgery (thoracotomy or sternotomy), presents an
      additional effect next to pharmacological analgesia for the treatment of pain, but this
      effect will only be valid with more studies and number of larger samples.

    <description>Visual analogue scale - EVA: consists of checking the intensity of pain in patients at the moment it is being evaluated. Such a tool consists of a line with the ends numbered from 0 to 10, and from 0 to 2 it is considered light pain; 3 to 7 moderate pain; and 8 to 10 severe pain</description>

    <description>Functional capacity scale Performance Status- PS: aims to monitor the clinical evolution of a disease by joining the Karnofsky scale and the Zubrod or ECOG scale. Karnofsky's scale or index describes increasing levels of activities and independence of the individual stipulated values between 0 and 100, zero meaning no functionality or death and 100 representing the maximum degree of physical ability to perform activities. The Zubrod or ECOG scale quantified between 0 and 4, where 0 means 0 indicates that the individual is fully active for the performance of his activities and 4 assigning to the dead patient. Such scales are widely used for the evaluation of oncological patients, being somewhat complementary, therefore used together</description>
