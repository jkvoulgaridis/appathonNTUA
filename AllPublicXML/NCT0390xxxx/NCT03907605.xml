      Anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) is a marker for ovarian reserve. There are many studies about
      AMH changes in ovarian surgery, but little is known for other surgeries. We seek to
      investigate the hormone variations before and after uterine artey ligation for postpartum
      hemorrage (PPH)

      All patients belong to the same group. The blood samples will be collected at the time of
      surgery and 3 months after surgery from the patients who need uterine artery ligation for
      PPH. The blood samples will be centrifuged within 2 hours after being obtained and assessed
      on the same day. AMH concentrations will be measured with an enzymatically amplified
      two-sided immunoassay
