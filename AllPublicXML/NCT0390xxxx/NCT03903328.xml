  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of age-related progressive
      decline in muscle mass and strength (Sarcopenia) among Malaysian elderly residing in
      long-term care facilities. It is a very important condition to study as it is associated with
      high incidence of fall, hospitalization and mortality.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over the past few decades, one condition that prominently affects the muscular system, known
      as sarcopenia, has captured the attention of healthcare experts and researchers. Sarcopenia
      is a geriatric syndrome characterized by the involuntary, gradual and generalized
      deterioration of skeletal muscle mass and strength with advancing age. It is to be noted that
      while sarcopenia is predominantly a syndrome of the elderly, its development may also be
      observed in various conditions such as disuse, malnutrition and cachexia, all of which are
      not exclusive only to the elderly. As of now, there are still ongoing research on an
      international scale with regards to its epidemiology, risk factors, causative factors,
      adverse clinical complications, prevention and treatment.

      Beginning in 1st of October, 2016, Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has
      finally officialised an International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical
      Modification (ICD-10- CM) code for sarcopenia after its final proposal since April 2015. This
      establishment has enabled comprehensible clinical guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of
      sarcopenia, as well as separate reporting and data collection for sarcopenia in the medical
      community.

      In essence, sarcopenia appears to be one of the most important causes of functional
      impairment, physical disability and loss of independence in older adults and a prevalence
      study will help to estimate the deleterious effects of this condition on the elderly living
      in the care facility, who happen to be the less privileged group as compared to their
      counterparts dwelling in the community.

    <description>Measurement of muscle strength was done using a Jamar hydraulic handheld dynamometer, only one maximal effort was allowed. However, for erroneous performance another attempt was provided after 10 minutes of rest. The measure was recorded in Kgf.</description>
