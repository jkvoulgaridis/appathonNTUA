      This is a phase I, open-label, multiple-dose, dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics and anti-tumor activity of LDP in subjects with advanced
      malignant tumors.

      This trial is an open, dose escalation phase I clinical trial study of patients with advanced
      cancer who have failed standard treatment. The trial is divided into a dose escalation phase
      and an expansion phase.

      Approximately 130 patients will be enrolled in this trial. The dose-increasing phase is about
      30 cases, and the expansion stage is about 100 cases.
