  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      Pegol-Sihematide, as compared with recombinant human erythropoietin injection (CHO Cell),
      ESPO, in anemia treatment in patients with non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 3, randomized, multicenter, open-label, active-controlled, non-inferiority
      trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Pegol-Sihematide versus ESPO. Study included a
      period of 4 weeks for screening, 16 weeks for dose adjustment, 8 weeks for evaluation, and 28
      weeks for extensional treatment period. Eligible patients were centrally allocated in a 2:1
      ratio to receive Pegol-Sihematide subcutaneously once every 4 weeks, starting at 0.04 mg per
      kilogram of body weight, or ESPO once every 1 week or 2 weeks, starting dose of 6000 IU per
      week. Doses of both drugs were adjusted to achieve and maintain hemoglobin levels between
      10.0 and 12.0 g per deciliter for 52 weeks or more. The primary efficacy end point was the
      mean change from the baseline hemoglobin level to the mean level during the evaluation
      period; non-inferiority was established if the lower limit of the two-sided 95% confidence
      interval was -1.0 g per deciliter or higher. Cardiovascular safety was evaluated on the basis
      of an adjudicated composite end point.

    <description>The primary efficacy end point is the mean change from the baseline hemoglobin level to the mean level during the evaluation period. The baseline hemoglobin value is the value on the day of randomization. The mean hemoglobin during the evaluation period was calculated as the mean of all available hemoglobin values during that period. Hemoglobin measurements will be performed at baseline and thereafter every 2 weeks (for the dose adjustment and the evaluation periods). Efficacy will be also assessed as the mean change from baseline in hemoglobin levels during 4-week intervals.</description>
