    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the side effects of durvalumab when given together with
      chemotherapy in treating patients with solid tumors that have spread to others places in the
      body (advanced). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as durvalumab, may help the
      body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to
      grow and spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine hydrochloride, pegylated
      liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride, capecitabine, carboplatin, paclitaxel, and
      nab-paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing
      the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving
      chemotherapy with durvalumab may improve how immune cells respond and attack tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the safety of adding MEDI4736 (durvalumab) to standard chemotherapy regimens.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the changes that occur in the immune microenvironment in response to
      chemotherapy and assess how these changes alter the pharmacodynamic effects of a checkpoint
      inhibitor.

      II. Investigate whether the response to immunotherapy correlates with patients' genetic
      aberrations and/or the activation status of tumor-infiltrating and circulating T cells.

      III. Explore the relationship between immune status of the tumor and overall tumor mutational
      load.

      IV. Assess preliminary antitumor activity of the MEDI4736 (durvalumab) and chemotherapy
      combinations.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 7 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive durvalumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15 of
      cycles 1 and 2 and day 1 of subsequent cycles. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15
      and durvalumab IV over 60 minutes on days 8 and 22 of cycles 1 and 2 and day 8 of subsequent
      cycles. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      ARM III: Patients receive pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 60 minutes on
      day 1 and durvalumab IV over 60 minutes on days 8 and 22 of cycles 1 and 2 and day 1 of
      subsequent cycles. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM IV: Patients receive capecitabine orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-14 and 22-36,
      and durvalumab IV over 60 minutes on days 8, 22, and 36 of cycle 1, days 8 and 22 of cycle 2,
      and days 1 and 22 of subsequent cycles. Cycles repeat every 42 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM V: Patients receive carboplatin IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1 and 22 and durvalumab IV
      over 60 minutes on days 8, 22, and 36 of cycle 1, days 8 and 22 of cycle 2, and days 1 and 22
      of subsequent cycles. Cycles repeat every 42 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM VI: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 60 minutes on days 1 and 22 and durvalumab IV
      over 60 minutes on days 8, 22, and 36 of cycle 1, days 8 and 22 of cycle 2, and days 1 and 22
      of subsequent cycles. Cycles repeat every 42 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM VII: Patients receive nab-paclitaxel IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 22 and durvalumab
      IV over 60 minutes on days 8, 22, and 36 of cycle 1, days 8 and 22 of cycle 2, and days 1 and
      22 of subsequent cycles. Cycles repeat every 42 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up monthly for 3 months.

                  months.

               -  Monitoring for HIV-infected patients should include:

                    -  Viral load and CD4 count every 8 weeks (q8w).

          -  The effects of targeted agents on the developing human fetus are unknown. The
             cytotoxic agents chosen for combination with MEDI4736 adversely affect human fertility
             and gestation. For these reasons, women of childbearing potential and men must agree
             to use highly effective contraception prior to study entry for the duration of study
             participation and for 6 months following the last dose of a study drug.

          -  Because there may be a risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with these agents, breastfeeding should be discontinued while
             the patient is on this trial and for 6 months following the last dose of study drug.

          -  Patients should be willing not to donate blood while participating in this study or
             for at least 90 days following the last dose of study drug.

          -  Left ventricular ejection fraction greater than 50% or the institutional lower limit
             of normal by echocardiography (ECHO) at entry (patients enrolling on Arm 3 only).

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who received prior therapy with a checkpoint inhibitor and were taken off
             drug for serious adverse events are excluded. Patients who had prior CTLA-4 inhibitor
             treatment and did not experience serious adverse events are eligible for all arms.
             Patients who had prior PD-L1/PD-1 inhibitor treatment and did not experience serious
             adverse events are excluded from the MEDI4736 (durvalumab) monotherapy arm but are
             eligible for the chemotherapy combinations.

          -  Patients with pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, or microsatellite stable (MSS)
             colorectal cancer will not receive single-agent MEDI4736 (durvalumab) but may be
             eligible to receive this agent with chemotherapy (Arms 2-7).

          -  Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.

          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents. Patients on other trials
             will be eligible as long as they are no longer receiving study treatment.

          -  Active or prior documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorders (including
             inflammatory bowel disease [e.g., colitis or Crohn's disease], diverticulitis (with
             the exception of diverticulosis), systemic lupus erythematosus, sarcoidosis syndrome,
             or Wegener syndrome [granulomatosis with polyangiitis, Graves' disease, rheumatoid
             arthritis, hypophysitis, uveitis, etc.]. The following are exceptions:

               -  Patients with vitiligo or alopecia

               -  Patients with hypothyroidism (e.g., following Hashimoto syndrome) stable on
                  hormone replacement

               -  Any chronic skin condition that does not require systemic therapy

               -  Patients without active disease in the last 5 years may be included but only
                  after consultation with the study physician

               -  Patients with celiac disease controlled by diet alone

          -  History of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, pneumonitis (including drug induced),
             organizing pneumonia (e.g. bronchiolitis obliterans, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia,
             etc.), or evidence of active pneumonitis on screening chest computed tomography (CT)
             scan. Patients with active tuberculosis (TB) are also excluded.

          -  Current or prior use of immunosuppressive medication within 14 days before the first
             dose of MEDI4736 (durvalumab). The following are exceptions:

               -  Intranasal, inhaled, topical steroids, or local steroid injections (e.g., intra
                  articular injection)

               -  Systemic corticosteroids at physiologic doses not to exceed 10 mg/day of
                  prednisone or glucocorticoid equivalent dose of another steroid

               -  Steroids as premedication for hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., CT scan
                  premedication)

          -  Patients should not be vaccinated with live attenuated vaccines within 30 days before
             starting or after completing MEDI4736 (durvalumab) treatment.

          -  Patients who have a history of seizures will not be eligible, unless they have either
             not had seizures or have been on stable doses of anti-seizure medicine and had no
             seizures for 4 weeks, in which case they will be eligible. Patients taking
             enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants (i.e., carbamazepine, fosphenytoin, oxcarbazepine,
             phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone) will only be eligible for Arm 1 (durvalumab
             monotherapy) and Arm 2 (durvalumab + gemcitabine).

          -  Patients receiving warfarin are not eligible for Arm 4 (capecitabine) due to the
             potential for life-threatening interactions. Patients on warfarin are eligible to
             enroll in one of the other arms provided there is increased vigilance with respect to
             monitoring international normalised ratio (INR)

          -  Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to
             psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
             requirements, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, myocardial infarction in the past 6 months, invasive fungal infections, or
             active (acute or chronic) or uncontrolled severe infection, liver disease such as
             cirrhosis, decompensated liver disease, and active and chronic hepatitis (i.e.,
             quantifiable hepatitis B virus [HBV]-deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA] and/or positive
             hepatitis B surface antigen [HbsAg], quantifiable HCV-ribonucleic acid [RNA]), are not
             eligible to participate. Testing for HBV-DNA and HCV-RNA will be mandatory for
             patients with HCC only; testing for hepatitis B or other infections for eligibility
             will be performed only if clinically indicated

          -  History of grade &gt;= 2 infusion reactions or allergic reactions to humanized monoclonal
             antibodies.

          -  History of primary immunodeficiency.
