    <textblock>
      Current pharmacological treatments for chronic hypersomnia (narcolepsy, idiopathic
      hypersomnia) can effectively reduce excessive daytime sleepiness but a high proportion of
      patients experience depressive symptoms and poor health-related quality of life.
      Unfortunately, there are currently no psychosocial interventions that directly addresses this
      issue. Therefore, the overall goal of this project is to gather initial outcome data and work
      out methodological issues to determine if a future pragmatic clinical trial is warranted.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic hypersomnia (CH) is a serious and debilitating condition involving persistent
      excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and includes narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia (IH).
      Currently, pharmacotherapy is the only empirically-validated treatment for reducing EDS in
      this patient population but the burden of long-term management and adverse effects of the
      medication lead to poor health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and elevations in depressive
      symptoms

      Evidence-based psychosocial interventions have been developed in other areas to improve HRQoL
      related to chronic illnesses, such as cancer and chronic pain. These interventions typically
      involve a package of cognitive and behavioral techniques teaching coping skills (e.g.,
      emotion-focused and problem-focused coping), behavioral management of the chronic illness
      symptoms (e.g., relaxation for pain management), and other strategies to improve psychosocial
      functioning (e.g., mindfulness). However, no such interventions have been developed or used
      for people with CH. Therefore, a major research gap exists for an empirically-validated
      psychosocial intervention which is aimed directly at improving emotional functioning and
      HRQoL for people with CH.

      The purpose of this project is to develop a cognitive-behavioral treatment for hypersomnia
      (CBT-H) and conducting a feasibility trial of CBT-H. The specific aims for this project are
      to: 1) develop and refine a treatment protocol for CBT-H; 2) identify the optimal delivery
      format of CBT-H; and 3) gather feasibility data on recruitment, retention, and selection
      criteria for a future clinical trial. The overall significance of this project is to improve
      the quality of care for people with CH by using a psychosocial intervention with medical
      management of hypersomnia.

    <description>The CBT-H intervention consists of 6 weekly sessions that are conducted either individually or in small groups. Each session is expected to last about 45 to 60 minutes and will be delivered a study therapist using live videoconferencing or in-person. The treatment package consists of cognitive and behavioral modules that include education about hypersomnia, coping skills training, emotion regulation regarding the perceived limitations of living with chronic hypersomnia (e.g., &quot;I cannot live a full life because of my illness&quot;), and behavioral techniques using scheduled naps, sleep hygiene, and regularizing sleep schedules at night which are on the current optional recommendations for hypersomnia.</description>
