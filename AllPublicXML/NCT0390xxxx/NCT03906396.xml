      This study aims to investigate the feasibility and the potential efficacy of using Xbox 360
      Kinect game among healthcare undergraduate students. Thirty-six participants will be
      recruited and randomly allocated into the intervention and control group. The session will be
      30 minutes per session for three times per week. Two outcome measures will be used at pre and
      post intervention.

      Sleep deprivation and emotional problems such as stress, anxiety and depression commonly
      occur in university students. Exercise is beneficial to ameliorate those problems however
      university students are not serious to uptake physical activity. Commercially available
      exergame such as Xbox 360 Kinect is one of the alternatives. This study aims to investigate
      the feasibility and the potential efficacy of using Xbox 360 Kinect game among healthcare
      undergraduate students. A pilot two-armed parallel randomized controlled trial was
      implemented. A total of 36 undergraduate students was recruited and randomly allocated into
      the intervention group (playing Xbox 360 Kinect) or the control group (continue with normal
      daily routine). The intervention group received 30 minutes of Xbox Kinect activity, three
      times per week for six weeks. Information on psychology (DASS-21) and sleep (FOSQ-30) status
      were collected at pre- and post-experiment. The researcher-developed feasibility
      questionnaire was given to the participants in the intervention group at post-experiment.
      Repeated-measures ANOVA analysis was used to investigate within-between group comparison and
      significant value was set at pâ‰¤0.05. The analysis found potential improvement on sleep
      (p=0.039) and psychological health (p=0.002-0.067). The intervention protocol is feasible and
      highly accepted by the participants. Required optimum amount of dosage, sample size and used
      of outcome measures are suggested from the findings. This pilot and feasibility study support
      the use of Xbox 360 Kinect games in practice and to be implemented for future research.

    <masking_description>i) A number of assessors from occupational therapy students will be recruited. This is to allow for randomization possibility on assessment responsibility.
Pre-evaluation is conducted randomly by accident by an independent assessor with an occupational therapy background without knowing which participant in which group. There is no specific client on specific assessor.
The post-evaluation is conducted randomly by accident by an independent assessor with an occupational therapy background. There is no specific client on specific assessor.
ii) Information among participants is kept confidential and blinding from each other. No cross-over is allowed to reduce bias.</masking_description>

    <measure>Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales Questionnaire (DASS-21)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>The Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale -21 Items (DASS-21) is a set of three self-report scales designed to measure the emotional states of depression, anxiety and stress. Each of the three DASS-21 scales contains 7 items, divided into subscales with similar content. Scores for depression, anxiety and stress are calculated by summing the scores for the relevant items. Scoring for each scale is from 0 to 3 (Never:0; Sometimes:1; Often:2; Almost Always:3). Overall score is summed to indicate if the person has depression, anxiety or stress. For depression total score indicators (Normal:0-4; Mild:5-6; Moderate:7-10; Severe:11-13; Extremely Severe:14+). For anxiety total score indicators (Normal: 0-3; Mild:4-5; Moderate:6-7; Severe: 8-9; Extremely Severe: 10+). For stress total score indicators (Normal:0-7; Mild: 8-9; Moderate: 10-12; Severe: 13-16; Extremely Severe: 17+)</description>

    <measure>Functional Outcome of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ-30)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>Consisting of 30 questions related to the effects of fatigue on daily activities, the instrument was designed to evaluate the respondent's quality of life as it relates to disorders of excessive sleepiness. In 30 items, the FOSQ then assesses difficulty, due to sleepiness, in performing activities of daily living and recreational activities, which are categorized into the following 5 subscales: 1) activity level (9 items), 2) vigilance (7 items), 3) intimacy and sexual relationships (4 items), 4) general productivity (8 items), and 5) social outcomes (2 items). Scoring is from 0-4 (0: I don't do this activity for other reasons; 1: Yes, Extremely Difficult; 2: Yes, Moderate Difficulty; 3: Yes, Little Difficulty: 4: No Difficulty. The potential range of scores for the Total Score is 5 -20. Lower Score indicates more difficulty performing everyday activities when tired or sleepy, while higher score indicates less difficulty performing everyday activities when tired or sleepy.</description>
