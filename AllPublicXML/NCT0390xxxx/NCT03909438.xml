    <textblock>
      This study aims to build a database for patients with acute ischemic stroke who receive
      endovascular therapy and analyze the current situation, effectiveness, safety and
      cost-effectiveness of endovascular therapy for acute ischemic stroke in China.

      Study design is a registry, prospective, multicenter study of acute ischemic stroke patients
      with endovascular treatment. A database will be established including age, gender, smoking
      history, blood pressure, blood glucose, previous history (such as coronary heart disease,
      atrial fibrillation, hypertension, diabetes, stroke history, etc.), history of antiplatelet
      drugs, onset to treatment time, National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score
      before treatment.

      Indications for endovascular therapy refer to the current guidelines. All patients will
      receive endovascular therapy, including direct endovascular therapy or intravenous
      thrombolysis with endovascular therapy. The effectiveness, safety and cost-effectiveness of
      endovascular therapy for acute ischemic stroke will be analyzed.

      This study will enroll up at least 1,000 patients in 70 centers in China. The primary end
      point are proportion of patients with good prognosis after 90 days and intracranial
      hemorrhage transformation type after 24 hours.

Hemorrhagic infarction 1 (HI1) was defined as small petechiae along the margins of the infarct;
Hemorrhagic infarction 2 (HI2) as confluent petechiae within the infarcted area but no space-occupying effect;
Parenchymal hemorrhage (PH1) as blood clots in 30% or less of the infarcted area with some slight space- occupying effect; and
Parenchymal hemorrhage (PH2) as blood clots in more than 30% of the infarcted area with substantial space- occupying effect.
Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage was defined as blood at any site in the brain on the CT scan.</description>
