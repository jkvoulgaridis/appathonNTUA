      The purpose of this study is to determine which treatment option is better for patients who
      have isolated coronary artery disease (blockages of one vessel supplying blood to the heart
      muscle). The treatment options compared in this study are:

        1. Endoscopic coronary arterial bypass

        2. Percutaneous Coronary Intervention. This study is aimed to determine the best treatment
           for patients with coronary artery disease.

      Coronary artery disease (CAD), also known as coronary heart disease (CHD) involves the
      progressive narrowing of the arteries that nourish the heart muscle. CAD is the main cause of
      death in Russia.

      Patients with LAD disease have worse coronary flow outcomes Currently established types of
      myocardial revascularization are coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and percutaneous
      coronary interventions (PCI). High effectiveness of CABG was proved by multiple studies. PCI
      is a first line therapy in the treatment of one vessel disease due to the less invasive
      approach and current technological possibilities of this revascularization method.

      However, the established gold standard of multivessel coronary blockage treatment is CABG. It
      was reflected in the latest ESC/EACTS Guidelines on Myocardial Revascularization, due to the
      better early and late outcomes associated with the graft specifics.

      On the other hand, standard CABD operation has a high injury and morbidity rate, which were
      factors for development of less invasive techniques of CABG.

      According to the latest ESC/EACTS guidelines there are no advantages between PCI and CABG in
      the LAD disease treatment, both methods are Class I; level of evidence A.

      The choice between myocardial revascularization methods in patients with LAD disease is the
      critical task.
