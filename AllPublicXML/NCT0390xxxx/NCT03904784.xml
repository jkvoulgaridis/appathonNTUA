      This research project concerns adolescent patients aged 12 to 17, a period of life towards
      psychic individualization and autonomy. It is part of an outpatient child psychiatry sector
      that is concerned with the multidisciplinary and institutional dimension of the care
      provided. These are part of a long-term patient care dynamic. It is a therapeutic
      accompaniment of the young person and his entourage, especially parents.

      The care is integrative and multidisciplinary (psychiatrist, psychologist, educator,
      psychomotor, nurse). The care project is done after team discussion, several points are taken
      into account (clinical evaluation, demand analysis, transfer, study of different psychic
      movements, family dynamics). The eyes are crossed and the various references (psychodynamic,
      psychoanalytic, systemic). The family consultations that are always present can be associated
      with the individual care of the young person, and always link with the analysis of the
      different institutional movements. This takes place especially at the time of the weekly
      clinical summaries where the clinical situations of concern are evoked to allow a cross
      reading and multidisciplinary.

      The reflection, the exchange between the various stakeholders allow to weave an institutional
      mesh containing. Thanks to this system, young people and their families can experience a
      continuous and solid relationship.

      The sector is also part of a very valuable network work with the various partners involved in
      the daily life of the young person and their family (school institution, social services
      ...).

      This research is intended to be as close as possible to the care we provide and is integrated
      into a global work whose main interest is that of the patient.
