    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in compliance with the International Council for Harmonisation
      (ICH) of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use/Good
      Clinical Practice (GCP) and applicable regulatory requirements.

      This is a Phase 2, multicenter, single-arm study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and
      Pharmacokinetics (PK) of luspatercept (ACE-536) for the treatment of anemia due to
      International prognostic scoring system-Revised (IPSS-R) very low, low or intermediate risk
      Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)in Japanese subjects who are not requiring Red blood cell
      (RBC) transfusion.

      The study is divided into the Screening Period, a Treatment Period and a Post-Treatment
      Follow up Period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anemia is considered to be one of the most prevalent cytopenias in patients who have
      myelodysplastic syndromes, an umbrella term used to describe disorders relating to the
      ineffective production of red blood cells, white blood cells, and/or platelets. Ranging in
      severity from mild (asymptomatic) to severe, anemia can result in patients requiring regular
      red blood cell (RBC) transfusions, which can lead to further complications from iron
      overload. The goal of this study is to assess the efficacy, safety and PK of luspatercept in
      anemic patients who are categorized as International Prognostic Scoring System-Revised
      (IPSS-R) very low, low, or intermediate risk Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and not
      requiring RBC transfusion. Subjects deemed eligible for the study will be enrolled and
      treated with luspatercept. Best supportive care (BSC) may be used in combination with study
      treatment when clinically indicated per investigator. Best supportive care includes, but is
      not limited to, treatment with transfusions, antibiotic, antiviral and/or antifungal therapy,
      and nutritional support as needed. Best supportive care for this study excludes the use of
      ESAs. Patients should receive treatment up to a minimum of 24 weeks after which an MDS
      Disease assessment visit is scheduled to assess the response to treatment. Patients who are
      determined to be experiencing clinical benefit may continue treatment. Continued clinical
      benefit will be re-assessed every 24 weeks. Once patients are discontinued from study
      treatment, they will enter a post treatment follow-up period.
