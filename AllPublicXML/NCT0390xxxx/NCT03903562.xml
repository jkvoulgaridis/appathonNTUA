  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the immunogenicity and safety of the 9vHPV vaccine in healthy
      Chinese females 9 to 45 years of age. The study consists of Stage I (Day 1 to Month 7) and
      Stage II (post Month 7 to Month 60). Stage II will report the long-term immunogenicity and
      safety in the 9-19 year-old age group only. The dual-primary hypotheses of Stage I are that
      9vHPV vaccine induces non-inferior immune responses in females 9 to 19 years of age who are
      seronegative at Day 1 to the relevant HPV type compared to females 20 to 26 years of age who
      are seronegative at Day 1 to the relevant HPV type, as measured by anti-HPV 6, 11, 16, 18,
      31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 GMTs at 1 month post Dose 3, and 9vHPV vaccine induces non-inferior
      immune responses in females 27 to 45 years of age who are seronegative at Day 1 to the
      relevant HPV type compared to females 20 to 26 years of age who are seronegative at Day 1 to
      the relevant HPV type, as measured by the seroconversion percentages to each of HPV types 6,
      11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 at 1 month post Dose 3. (Each vaccine component will be
      analyzed separately.)
