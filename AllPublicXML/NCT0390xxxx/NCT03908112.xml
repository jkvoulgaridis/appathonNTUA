  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ICONICC Study is a randomized controlled clinical trial designed to compare the
      proportion of successful treatment outcomes between children assigned to standard concussion
      care only, standard concussion care plus simple convergence procedures, or standard
      concussion care plus office-based vergence/accommodative therapy in children aged 11 to 17
      years with symptomatic post-concussion syndrome. Children with post-concussion syndrome (4-12
      weeks post-concussion injury) and symptomatic CI will be randomized to a 12-week treatment
      program of either standard concussion care (SC), SC plus simple convergence procedures (SC+),
      or SC plus office-based vergence/accommodative therapy SC+OBVAT (1:1:1 ratio).

      The study will also compare the effect of treatment on clinical measures of both
      accommodation and vergence, symptom level/burden, health-related quality of life, clinical
      measures of saccadic eye movement, and objective eye movement measurements of disparity
      vergence, saccadic function, and accommodative function. The attainment of objective eye
      movement measures provides an opportunity to understand the underlying neurophysiology of the
      vergence and accommodative systems. Objective eye movement recordings are powerful because of
      the rich foundation from primate single-cell recordings that show a direct correlation with
      vergence and accommodative parameters in the supraoculomotor area of midbrain2, 3 and the
      oculomotor vermis of the cerebellum.4, 5 Thus, a combined approach of acquiring both clinical
      vision function measures and objective eye movement recordings in children with PCS-CI may
      lead to better characterization of the oculomotor phenotype with subsequent improved and
      personalized therapeutic interventions.

      Objectives:

      A group of 264 diverse children, ages 11 to 17 years, with post-concussion syndrome (4-12
      weeks post-concussion injury) and symptomatic CI will be enrolled from 6 sites from across
      the United States, will be randomized to 12 weeks of: 1) standard care (SC), 2) SC plus
      simple convergence exercises (SC+), and 3) SC plus office-based vergence/ accommodative
      therapy (SC+OBVAT).

      Primary Objective: To compare the effectiveness of SC, SC+, SC plus office-based
      vergence/accommodative therapy for improving a composite outcome measure of clinical findings
      (near point of convergence and positive fusional vergence at near) in children 11-17 years of
      age with concussion-related CI after 12 weeks of treatment.

        -  Secondary outcome measures

        -  Objective measures of disparity vergence, accommodation, saccades, and smooth pursuit

        -  Quality of life measures

        -  Convergence Insufficiency Symptom Survey Concussion Version (CISS-CON)

        -  PedsQL Version 4 For participants in any treatment group who not &quot;successful&quot; based on
           the composite score described above, additional/different treatment will be offered as
           an option after the primary outcome examination

    <ipd_description>A number assigned centrally by the CC will identify all enrolled participants. Participant data will be secured, all clinical sites, the CC, and the Resource Center in a manner to protect participant confidentiality. Only the PI, Clinic Coordinator, and Therapist will have access to the data at the clinical site. Data will be transmitted to the CC via a secure website, with the participant identified by his/her study ID number only. The informed consent document will inform all participants that their data will be sent to the Coordinating Center. Although results of the study will be presented at scientific meetings and reported in medical journals, at no time will any of the study participants be identified. The study will be monitored by the DSMC (see below) to ensure the safety of participants.</ipd_description>
