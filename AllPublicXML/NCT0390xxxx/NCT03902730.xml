  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to see how different forms of the squat exercise change my body's
      leg muscle activity. Four forms of the traditional back squat will be used: traditional back
      squat, barefoot squat, box squat, and traditional back squat with chains.

    <textblock>
      Resistance exercise has various benefits that promote health and reduce the chance of chronic
      disease, but the biggest benefit may be found in the effects on maintaining muscle mass
      throughout the aging process. The implications resistance training has on an individual's
      ability to function throughout the day with less fatigue whilst performing tasks at an easier
      level can all be related to improved strength and endurance that comes with resistance
      training. Furthermore, how the nervous system adapts and sends signals to the working muscles
      are of great interest as neuromuscular adaptations help in coordination, balance, and
      agility. Variations of the same style of exercise have been theorized to improve and/or
      change the adaptations that can occur. Thus, the purpose of this study would be to assess
      surface electromyography (sEMG) activations on 4 anatomical sites simultaneously during the
      squat exercise under varying conditions.

    <measure>Change from Baseline Mean Peak Muscle Activity Between Four Back Squat Variations</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete 5 sets of 10 repetitions at 70% of their 1 repetition maximum with 1-minute rest in between each set under different variations of the back squat. Each week, participants will be randomly assigned to complete a variation of back squat. Under each variation, surface electromyography recordings will consist of mean peak muscle activity as measured via BIOPAC BSL for the first and last sets of the training protocol. Thus, changes between first and last sets of the training protocol will be assessed for changes as well as comparisons between each variation of back squat to assess changes.</description>
