      The aim of the study is to assess the ideal bearing surfaces in hip replacement by comparing
      4 different combinations. In a hip replacement this means what the head and the socket liner
      are made of.

      In hip replacements, arguably the most important thing for survivorship is what rubs against
      what.

      Traditionally surgeons used metal (Cobalt-Chrome) against a conventional polyethylene
      (plastic). More recently (around 15 years ago) a newer more dense type of polyethylene
      (called XLPE) had been developed and a new type of head called Oxidized Zirconium was also
      developed.

      In this trial, adults who were undergoing hip replacements were randomized assigned into one
      of the four groups:

      Group 1: old plastic vs metal head Group 2: Old plastic against Oxidized Zirconium Group 3:
      New plastic versus metal head Group 4 New plastic vs Oxidized Zirconium

      All patients were followed up for a minimum of 10 years to assess which group wore the most
      amount of polyethylene and which group had the best survival rate.
