  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this investigation is to verify that ColdZyme® is deposited onto the throat
      and estimate the half-life of the ColdZyme® solution in the oropharynx of human volunteers
      using a log-linear mixed-effects model (LMM).

      The study is an Open Label, Non-Comparative study intended to verify the method used to
      measure the duration of ColdZyme®. Each participant will be his own control as samples are
      taken before application of ColdZyme and used as an internal control. Samples will be taken
      from the oropharyngeal membrane using a cotton swab before application, and 1, 3, 5, 10, 20,
      and 60 minutes after application. Glycerol will then be extracted from the swabs using water
      and the concentration of glycerol will be measured.

          -  Participation is based upon written informed consent by the participant following
             written and oral information by the investigator regarding nature, purpose,
             consequences and possible risks of the clinical study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             outcome, or concomitant medication with pharmaceuticals that might cause dry mouth
             (xerostomia), e.g. but not restricted to, morphine or morphine derivates, diuretics,
             antidepressants or other drugs with anticholinergic effect.
