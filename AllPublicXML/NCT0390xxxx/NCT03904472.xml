      This study will enroll patients with persistent reflux symptoms despite proton-pump inhibitor
      therapy and chronic insomnia. Participants that are eligible for the study and agree to
      participate will receive cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI) delivered by a
      web-based approach. The goal of the treatment is to improve the participants insomnia and

    <measure>Reflux Symptom Questionnaire-7-day recall (RESQ-7)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 8 weeks post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>RESQ-7 contains 13 items which are aggregated to 4 frequency and 4 intensity domain scores: heartburn (5 items), regurgitation (4 items), cough, hoarseness, difficulty swallowing (3 items), burping (1 item).
Frequency questions are scored from 0-7 and intensity questions are scored from 0-5. The range of scores are 0-156 (0 meaning no symptoms, 156 being the worst).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease Quality of Life (GERD-QoL)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 8 weeks post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The questionnaire is composed of 6 items, 4 of which assess symptoms and situations considered positive predictors for GERD diagnosis: heartburn, regurgitations, disorders related to sleep and use of over the counter products. Other 2 items assess 2 nausea and epigastric pain. Participants answer each question about symptoms frequency during last week using a Likert like scale from 0 to 3 for positive predictors and from 3 to 0 for negative predictors. The maximum score that can be obtained is 18.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Insomnia severity index (ISI)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 8 weeks post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>ISI is a 7-item psychometrically validated measure used to rate insomnia.The total score ranges from 0-28 where higher values indicate increased severity of insomnia.</description>
