  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is following up on previous studies that have demonstrated that geriatric subjects
      respond different to ultraviolet B (UVB) light than young subjects. The treatment of
      geriatric skin with dermal rejuvenation therapies (dermabrasion, fractionated laser
      resurfacing) restores the appropriate UVB response. Ongoing studies have tested the ability
      of fractionated laser resurfacing (FLR) to assess how long this wounding effect lastsâ€”and
      have found that this appears to be a durable response which lasts for at least two years. The
      findings that FLR protects geriatric skin at two years is the impetus for this study.

      This study is an interventional study to assess if FLR treatment of one forearm of geriatic
      subjects with multiple actinic keratosis will result in the short-term removal of actinic
      keratosis, and the long-term decrease in levels of future actinic keratosis and other
      non-melanoma skin cancers in comparison to the untreated arm.

      Study length and visit: The first part of the study is completed in 1 day then there are
      follow up visits at 90 days and every 6 months for 5 years.
