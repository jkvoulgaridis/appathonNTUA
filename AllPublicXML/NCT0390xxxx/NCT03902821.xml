  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the ROAR project is to evaluate an Oregon Department of Corrections
      (ODOC) pilot program that combines the use of extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) and
      Certified Recovery Mentors pre-release with linkage to community substance use disorder
      treatment to prevent fatal and non-fatal opioid overdoses among female adults released from
      prison.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ROAR examines implementation of a novel overdose prevention strategy for justice-involved
      women as they re-enter community treatment settings after incarceration. The ODOC pilot
      project offers initiation of opioid antagonist treatment prior to release (extended-release
      naltrexone [XR-NTX]), ongoing support from a Certified Recovery Mentor (CRM), and facilitated
      entry into community treatment for substance use disorders. Community treatment may include
      continuation of XR-NTX,or transition to agonist therapy including buprenorphine or methadone,
      or no medication for opioid use disorder.
