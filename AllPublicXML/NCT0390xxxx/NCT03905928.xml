  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study aims to establish proof-of-concept that neural cue-reactivity can serve as
      an early, objective marker of electronic cigarette (ECIG) addictive potential. Further, this
      study will examine the effect of flavor and nicotine concentration on the addictive potential
      of ECIGs to aid research informing U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) flavor regulations
      and smoking cessation.

    <description>Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) will be used to measure blood oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signal in response to tobacco vs. strawberry-vanilla ECIG flavors at baseline. BOLD signal in functional circuits involved in reward processing, expectancies, and craving are of primary interest, including the ventral striatum, ACC, amygdala, lateral and medial PFC, OFC, and insula.</description>

    <description>Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) will be used to measure changes in blood oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signal in response to 18 mg/ml vs. 0 mg/ml nicotine concentrations from baseline to 4-weeks post-randomization. BOLD signal in functional circuits involved in reward processing, expectancies, and craving are of primary interest, including the ventral striatum, ACC, amygdala, lateral and medial PFC, OFC, and insula.</description>

    <description>Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) will be used to measure changes in blood oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signal in response to assigned vs. un-assigned flavors from baseline to 4-weeks post-randomization.

    <measure>ECIG dependence</measure>
    <time_frame>2-weeks post-randomization to 4-weeks post-randomization</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in self-reported ECIG dependence will be measured using the Penn State Electronic Cigarette Dependence Index. Total scores on this 10-item measure range from 0 to 20, with higher scores indicating higher levels of dependence.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>ECIG liking and satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 4-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in subjective experiences of ECIG use related to liking and satisfaction will be collected via a self-report survey. The survey consists of 21-items (7-reversed scored) with response options on a 7-point likert scale and total scores ranging from 0 to 126. Higher scores indicate more ECIG liking and satisfaction.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>ECIG craving</measure>
    <time_frame>2-weeks post-randomization to 4-weeks post-randomization</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in self-reported ECIG craving will be measured with 3 questions on amount, intensity, and self-control during a state of nicotine withdrawal using visual analogue scales ranging from 0 to 10. Total scores range from 0 to 30 and higher scores indicate more craving.</description>
