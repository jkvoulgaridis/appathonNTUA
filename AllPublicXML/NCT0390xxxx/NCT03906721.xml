  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of conditioning open-label placebo (COLP) will be studied as a dose extension method
      to lower opioid dosage in patients with spinal cord injuries. The goal is to provide the same
      level of pain relief with a reduced opioid dose to diminish adverse effects as well as the
      risk of addiction associated with narcotic treatment.

    <measure>Morphine Equivalent Dose Conversion (MEDC)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 days</time_frame>
    <description>The opioid morphine equivalent conversion factor is used to standardized opioid usage having as a reference morphine as the main indicator for analgesic potency. For drug utilization, there is a need to present usage data consistently, considering dosing requirements. One method of representing opioid use at the population level is through the application of Defined Daily Doses (DDD), however, this represents a problem partly because opioids require highly individualized dosing and need to be titrated to pain response, rather than having standard therapeutic dose ranges. Oral morphine equivalents are based on the idea that different doses of different opioids may give a similar analgesic effect. Where the doses of two different opioids are considered to give a comparable analgesic effect, they are deemed to be equianalgesic doses.</description>

    <measure>Modified Brief Pain Inventory (BPI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 and Day 10</time_frame>
    <description>The BPI is a short self-assessment questionnaire that provides information on various dimensions of pain including how pain developed, the types of pain a patient experiences, and time of day pain is experienced, as well as current ways of alleviating pain. The BPI also consists of the VAS Pain scale, a simple 10- point scale (0 = ''no pain'', 10 = ''pain as bad as you can imagine'') measuring a patient' worst pain and least pain, on average and at present time. The Brief Pain Inventory provides information on the intensity of pain (the sensory dimension) as well as the degree to which pain interferes with function (the reactive dimension).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Spinal Cord Injury - Quality of Life measurement system (SCI-QOL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 and Day 10</time_frame>
    <description>This measurement system was developed to address the shortage of relevant and psychometrically sound patient reported outcome measures available for clinical care and research in spinal cord injury (SCI) rehabilitation. For the purpose of this research, the Pain Behavior subdomain will be the primary component of this scale to be used. This 7-item fixed-length scale measures manifestations of pain. These actions or reactions can be verbal or non-verbal and involuntary or deliberate. They include observable displays, and verbal reports of pain. This scale includes a small subset of the PROMIS (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System) Pain Behavior item bank (i = 4) and three new items.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Numerical Opioid Side Effects (NOSE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 and Day 10</time_frame>
    <description>Opioid therapy may be associated with adverse effectsâ€”which may affect the patient's perception of the overall satisfaction with opioid therapy. The Numerical Opioid Side Effect (NOSE) assessment tool is a simple, rapid, self-administered instrument which has the potential to be utilized in a busy pain clinic setting in efforts to document and longitudinally follow trends of opioid adverse effects.</description>
