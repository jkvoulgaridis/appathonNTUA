      The investigators will conduct an observational cohort study in 1200 pregnant women who will
      be recruited at the first antenatal care (ANC) visit from the Gugulethu and one additional
      facility in the Klipfontein-Mitchell's Plain subdistrict of the Metro Region (to be
      identified in conjunction with provincial and local health authorities) Midwife Obstetric
      Units in Cape Town (n=600 pregnant women per site). The enrolled women will be followed
      through 12-months post-delivery.

      The objectives of the study are to:

      1. Determine the distribution of women across the PrEP cascade:

        1. Evaluate the proportion of pregnant and breastfeeding women who initiate PrEP out of all
           women offered PrEP

        2. Evaluate the proportion of pregnant and breastfeeding women who are retained in the PrEP
           cohort

        3. Evaluate the proportion of pregnant and breastfeeding women who initiate PrEP who adhere
           to PrEP using objective dried blood spot measures and subjective measures of
           self-reported pill count and adherence

        4. Evaluate the proportion of pregnant and breastfeeding women on PrEP (and not on PrEP)
           who acquire HIV, who transmit HIV to their infant, and who report adverse events 2.
           Evaluate patient and provider-level factors associated with the PrEP cascade using
           quantitative and qualitative approaches (including in-depth interviews) 3. Apply an
           established mathematical model to simulate the impact of improvement in the PrEP cascade
           on HIV infections averted (maternal and perinatal)
