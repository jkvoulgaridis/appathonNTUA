  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ANCA vasculitis is a pauci-immune systemic small vessel vasculitis. The anti-neutrophilic
      cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) are pathogenic and cause disease by activating neutrophils
      which damage blood vessels. CD means &quot;cluster of differentiation&quot; . CD5 is a type I
      transmembrane protein found on T cells, thymocytes, and some B cells. CD20 is a type III
      transmembrane protein found on B cells. The investigators previously detected an association
      between recovery of Interleukin 10 (IL-10)-secreting CD20+ and CD5+ regulatory B cells after
      immunotherapy (with rituximab and corticosteroids) and decreased risk of subsequent relapse
      in patients with ANCA-vasculitis. The investigators hypothesize that patients with complete
      reconstitution of a functional regulatory B cell repertoire after induction therapy are at
      low risk of relapse and may be monitored conservatively without further immunotherapy. The
      investigators will test this hypothesis through a proof of concept randomized controlled
      study. Patients with normalization of CD5+ regulatory B cells will be randomized to
      maintenance therapy with rituximab vs. close observation without immunosuppression. Patients
      whose peripheral CD5+ regulatory B cells remain low after induction therapy (who are at
      higher risk of relapse), will receive maintenance immunosuppression with rituximab. Patients
      needing or randomized to maintenance therapy who are unable to receive rituximab will receive
      azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil, two standard alternative medications for maintenance
      immunosuppression.

      The goal of this study is to test the hypothesis that, in ANCA vasculitis, use of CD5+ B
      cells at the time of B cell reconstitution in the peripheral blood can be used to stratify
      patients between those with low % CD5+ B cells at greater risk of relapse who would need
      maintenance immunosuppression and those with normalized CD5+ B cells who would be at lower
      risk and relapse, and therefore may not need maintenance immunosuppression. The latter group
      will be randomized to either maintenance immunosuppression vs close clinical observation
      without maintenance immunosuppression. This study is not designed to evaluate the efficacy of
      new therapies in ANCA vasculitis. The treatment regimen used in the proposed study are
      routinely used in the treatment of patients with ANCA vasculitis and considered
      standard-of-care.

    <description>The primary outcome measure is time to first relapse defined as recurrence of any signs or symptoms attributable to active vasculitis after a period of complete remission, with at least 2 minor or 1 major item on the BVAS score (BVAS≥2). Per protocol, complete remission is defined as a BVAS score = 0. Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score for Wegener's Granulomatosis(BVAS, range 0-64). The total score is composed of 34 predefined items, units on a scale, grouped into 9 organ systems. Each item carries a weight from 1-3, depending on disease severity. A score of 0 indicates no disease activity; a higher score indicates worsening disease.</description>
