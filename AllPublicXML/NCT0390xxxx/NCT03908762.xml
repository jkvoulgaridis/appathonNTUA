  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The principal objective of this application is to improve glycemic control of diabetic
      patients treated with basal insulin through use of an innovative, FDA-cleared
      smartphone-based insulin titration application connected to Bluetooth enabled glucose meters.
      iSage Rx (isageapp.com) allows providers to prescribe basal insulin treatment plans to
      patients and manages basal insulin doses utilizing clinically proven algorithms. In this
      pilot study, we hypothesize that this user-friendly application and seamless data capture
      will improve glycemic control (achieve HgbA1c &lt;7%) and reduce the frequency and severity of
      hypoglycemia. Exploratory measures will include healthcare resource utilization and patient
      and provider satisfaction. The basal insulin titration algorithms used in iSage have had
      thousands of user-years' experience in FDA-mandated, closely supervised clinical trials, both
      for long-acting insulins (e.g., Lantus, Levemir) that have been available for a long time and
      for the newer ultra-long-acting ones (e.g., Tresiba, Toujeo). However, the effectiveness of
      iSage with a connected glucose meter has not been studied in a &quot;real world&quot; clinical
      environment. Broad use of such an application and connected devices will, we believe, prove
      to be cost-effective, favor early and appropriate prescription of insulin, reduce provider
      effort, shorten time to achieve glycemic goals, and simplify the transition to basal insulin
      therapy.

    <description>The provider will choose a treatment algorithm embedded within the app and set the parameters to make insulin dose adjustments no less frequently than every 7 days. The app is downloaded by the patient while in the examination room, and the patient is instructed to perform daily fasting glucose fingerstick measurements and follow the app's recommendations for insulin adjustment. Data on telephone or visit contact with a healthcare provider will be collected via the EMR. Hypoglycemic events (defined as blood glucose &lt;70 mg/dl, measured or perceived) are recorded in the iSage application as well as patient report. Providers are asked to review the patients transmitted blood sugar logs as necessary, and those reviews are recorded. Return visits are managed by the HCP and will be logged as resource utilization.</description>

    <description>Our clinic uses a modified treat-to-target algorithm which is summarized on a 3 x 5 refrigerator magnet. In the case of glargine or detemir (Basaglar, Lantus, Levemir) adjustments of 1 unit of insulin/day are made until the fasting blood sugars (2 of 3 consecutive values) are 80-130 mg/dl. In the instance of Toujeo or Tresiba, adjustments of 2 units are made every 5 days. Volunteers will have meters downloaded (or interviewed where necessary) to obtain data on fasting blood sugar and episodes of hypoglycemia (perceived or measured &lt;70 mg/dl). The PCP is free to request glucose logs and set return appointments as needed to manage the patient.</description>
