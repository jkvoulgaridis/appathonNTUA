  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was a phase I/II trial initiated by the investigator to evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (anti-PD1) antibody-activated autologous
      tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) combined with adjuvant chemotherapy in participants
      with stage III colon cancer. Twenty participants were enrolled and anti-PD1
      antibody-activated TILs was infused into participants after the final of adjuvant
      chemotherapy to assess the safety and 3-year disease-free survival.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative colon cancer participants received 4 to 8 cycles of XELOX regimen adjuvant
      chemotherapy and received anti-PD1 antibody-activated TILs on the day 15 of the final cycle
      of chemotherapy.

      Fresh tumor tissues or sentinel lymph nodes were collected from participants with
      postoperative colon cancer, and the tumor tissues were digested with type IV collagenase at
      37 °C for 2 to 4 hours. The cell pellet was washed, suspended in medium containing 10% AB
      serum, planted in a 24-well cell culture plate, and periodically changed according to the
      growth of the cells. After culturing for 2 to 3 weeks, TILs were co-stimulated with
      radioactively irradiated allogeneic peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and were
      expanded in 100 ml of Interleukin-2 (IL-2) medium in a cell culture flask. After rapid
      expansion for 15 days, the number of cells reached 0.1-1*10^10 cells. Before cell transfer,
      TILs were incubated with anti-PD-1 antibody, and a fraction of the TILs were collected to
      assess their number, phenotype, and viability of cells, and to test for possible
      contamination by bacteria, fungi, or endotoxins. Then, autologous TILs (0.1-1*10^10 cells)
      were transferred to participants via intravenous infusion.

             this protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who have decreased immune
             competence may be less responsive to the experimental treatment and more susceptible
             to its toxicities).
