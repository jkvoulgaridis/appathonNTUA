  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a fetal, rare neurodegenerative disease presenting with
      parksinonism, autonomic dysfunction, and cerebellar ataxia. Numerous anti-parkinsonism agents
      have been developed. However, no medication has yet been proven effective for the symptomatic
      or even causative treatment in cerebellar ataxia. To our knowledge, cerebellar N-methyl-D-
      aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors play a special role in the modulation of motor learning and
      coordination. Tllsh2910, a NMDA modulator, has been found to attenuate the ataxic gait in the
      mouse model. Here, we designed a large-scale double-blind randomized controlled, cross-over
      phase III trial to investigate the efficacy of Tllsh2910 in neurodegenerative ataxic patients
      and the association of gut microbiota change.

    <measure>=Scale for the assessment and rating of ataxia (SARA) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks, 24 weeks, 36 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>SARA is an 8-item performance based scale with gait, stance, sitting, speech disturbance, finger chase, nose-finger test, fast alternative hand movements, and heel-shin slide, yielding a total score of 0 (no ataxia) to 40 (most severe ataxia). The change in the SARA score will be recorded from period-level baseline to the end of the 12-week, 24-week, 36-week treatment period.</description>

    <measure>International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks, 24 weeks, 36 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>ICARS is an 19-item performance based scale with 4 subscales of postural and gait disturbances, kinetic function, speech disorders, and oculomotor disorders, yielding a total score of 0 (no ataxia) to 100 (most severe ataxia). The change in the ICARS score will be measured from period-level baseline to the end of the 12-week, 24-week, 36-week treatment period.</description>

    <description>UMSARS is an validated 26-items scale for multiple system atrophy with 4 subscales of historical review, motor examination scale, autonomic examination, and global disability scale. The Part II is a performance based subscale, yield a total score of 0 (no motor impairment) to 56 (most severe motor impairment). The change in the UMSARS Part-II score will be measured from period-level baseline to the end of the 12-week, 24-week, 36-week treatment period.</description>
