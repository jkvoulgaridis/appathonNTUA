    <textblock>
      This phase II study will evaluate the safety of combining intermediate frequency electric
      field (TT Field) with immunotherapy in melanoma patients with brain metastasis. The data of
      this study will also inform whether this combination will offer advantage in progression free
      survival (PFS) and overall survival.

    <description>The PFS time will be calculated as the duration of time from the date of first dose of study treatment to the date of earliest intracranial progression or death, whichever occurs first. Patients who neither progress nor die by the data cutoff date will be censored at the last follow up.
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions).</description>

             dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as ≥ 10 mm with CT scan or MRI, as ≥ 20 mm
             by chest x-ray, or ≥ 10 mm with calipers by clinical exam.

          -  Candidate for treatment with immunotherapy.

          -  At least 18 years of age.

          -  Normal bone marrow and organ function as defined below:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mcl

               -  Platelets ≥ 100,000/mcl

               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x IULN

             study, she must inform her treating physician immediately.

          -  History of pre-existing immunodeficiency disorder or autoimmune condition requiring
             immunosuppressive therapy. This includes inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative
             colitis, Crohn's disease, systemic vasculitis, scleroderma, psoriasis, multiple
             sclerosis, hemolytic anemia, immune-mediated thrombocytopenia, rheumatoid arthritis,
             systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren's syndrome, sarcoidosis, or other rheumatologic
             disease or any other medical condition or use of medication which might make it
             difficult for the patient to complete the full course of treatments or to generate an
             immune response to vaccines.

          -  Known sensitivity to conductive hydrogels.

          -  Skull defects such as missing bone or bullet fragments.

             nerve stimulator, and other implanted electronic devices in the brain or spinal cord.

          -  Pregnant and/or breastfeeding. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative
             pregnancy test within 14 days of study entry.

          -  Known HIV-positivity on combination antiretroviral therapy because of the potential
             for pharmacokinetic interactions with nivolumab and/or ipilimumab. In addition, these
             patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with
