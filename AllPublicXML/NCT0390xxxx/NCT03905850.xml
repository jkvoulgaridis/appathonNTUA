  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare two strengths of the new long-acting growth hormone somapacitan. The
      aim of this study is to test if both strengths are taken up in the blood in the same way.
      During three separate dosing visits participants will get a total of 3 injections of the
      study medicine. Somapacitan is not yet approved and therefore cannot be prescribed by a
      doctor outside of this study. The study duration is between 10 and 15 weeks. Participants
      will have 17 visits with the study doctor. Three visits will each comprise 6 in-house days
      with overnight stays. In total, at least 15 overnight stays at the clinic. There will be
      blood samplings during the study. Participants must come to the clinic regularly for these
      blood samplings. People who have already received growth hormones in the past or who are
      growth hormone deficient cannot be in the study. People cannot be in the study if the study
      doctor thinks that there are risks for their health. Women cannot take part if pregnant,
      breast-feeding or planning to become pregnant during the study period.
