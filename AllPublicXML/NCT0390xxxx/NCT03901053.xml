  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed effort is designed to support evidence-based practice and optimal care by
      evaluating how the form, fit and function of two commercially available carbon fiber custom
      fit braces (Orthoses) influences outcomes following extremity injury. Early data suggests
      that custom fit carbon fiber braces can significantly improve function following severe lower
      leg injuries. The proposed study will provide evidence that can be used by clinicians to
      guide their practice, including care for service members, veterans and civilians who have
      experienced a high-energy traumatic injury to their lower leg.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this research study, adult participants who have sustained a below-the-knee traumatic
      injury greater than two years ago and are still experiencing deficits including weakness
      and/or immobility will be assigned to one of two brace sequences (AB or BA). Participants
      will be randomized to a particular sequence, with an equal chance of getting either order.
      Participants will be evaluated under 4 conditions: no device, standard of care, and 2 carbon
      fiber custom dynamic orthoses (CDO), the Reaktiv device from FabTech Systems and the
      PhatBrace by Bio-Mechanical Composites Inc. Participants will be tested with no device and
      standard of care at baseline, after 3 months of accommodation to the Reaktiv, and 3 months of
      accommodation to the PhatBrace. A series of study measures will be performed. The physical
      performance measures will incorporate tests of agility, balance, speed and lower limb power.
      Questionnaires will be used to evaluate participant's perceived comfort and smoothness, pain,
      preference, and semi-structured interviews will be used to fully capture the perspective of
      the participant. A motion capture system will be used to evaluate walking mechanics, allowing
      comparisons between conditions. Lower limb forces and body motion will be assessed using
      computerized motion capture and force plates in the floor, as individuals walk over-ground.
      Small reflective markers placed on the participant's skin and force measuring plates in the
      floor will be used. The investigators will also complete mechanical testing of the devices
      and collect demographic and descriptive data.

Participants will be randomized to one of two arms (AB or BA) to maximize the likelihood of similarity between groups with respect to a range of anthropometric, demographic and injury related factors. We will use block randomization in groups of 10 to achieve equal randomization between groups over time.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>This device is a carbon fiber ankle foot orthosis (brace) that contacts the foot and lower leg. It consists of a foot plate that is designed to protect the foot, a carbon fiber strut on the back that stores and returns energy, and a cuff that goes below the knee. It has a custom geometry and alignment that is specific to the individual.</description>
