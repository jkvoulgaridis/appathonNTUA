    <textblock>
      Patients who were operated by Department of Pediatric Surgery between the 1 September 2017
      and 28 February 2019 and who received erector spinae plane blocks as a part of postoperative
      analgesia management will be scanned.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are a few randomized prospective studies of ESPB for its clinical effectiveness and all
      of them are in adults, except one. Also pediatric case reports are limited when compared to
      adults. We have been applying ESPB to our patients almost since from its first definition.
      But ESPB applications for pediatric patients, in our clinic, have started after a learning
      curve. Patients who were operated by Department of Pediatric Surgery between the 1 September
      2017 and 28 February 2019 and who received erector spinae plane blocks as a part of
      postoperative analgesia management will be scanned.

      Demographical data of the patient, patient position for the block, indication/surgery type,
      level of ESPB, unilateral or bilateral application, total volume applied, additional
      analgesic use, type of the analgesic if used will be investigated.
