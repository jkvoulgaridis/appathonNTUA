  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Seasonal influenza epidemics are important causes of morbidity and mortality. Cytokine
      dysregulation, with high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, occurs in patients with severe
      influenza. Early therapy with a neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI) is associated with better
      outcome in patients hospitalized with influenza, but significant mortality occurs despite use
      of antivirals. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is a modified form of the amino acid cysteine, with
      anti-oxidant properties. NAC was shown to inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory
      molecules in lung epithelial cells infected with influenza viruses. Previous case report
      showed that high dose NAC, administered as continuous intravenous infusion, was effective and
      safe in improving the clinical outcomes. We aim to perform a randomized controlled trial to
      evaluate the therapeutic role of adjunctive NAC in the clinical management of patients with
      influenza complicated by lower respiratory tract involvement and abnormal respiratory status.
      Such information when available may reveal the potential of NAC for optimization of
      management of severe influenza, and provide important insights into future adjunctive therapy
      research.
