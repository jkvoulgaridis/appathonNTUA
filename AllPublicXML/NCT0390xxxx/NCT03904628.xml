  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study was to explore the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and the maximum
      tolerable dose (MTD) of oral administration of TG02 capsules twice a week for 4 weeks.

      Using the traditional 3 +3 design, 150 mg as the initial dose and 50 mg as the increasing
      interval of up to 250 mg, and oral administration on the 1st, 4th, 8th, 11th, 15th, 18th,
      22nd and 25th day of each 28-day cycle. Phase I clinical study to evaluate the tolerance and
