  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compares aerobic exercise training performed before breakfast (i.e., in the fasted
      state) to similar training performed after breakfast in people with type 2 diabetes. Training
      will take place over 16 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People with type 2 diabetes (T2D) are encouraged to increase their physical activity (PA).
      Sometimes, increasing the amount of PA can be difficult. Therefore, simply recommending that
      individuals preform more exercise may not be effective in the long term. Recent short-term
      studies have started to explore how to maximize the effect of a single bout of exercise. For
      example, short term studies suggest that exercise performed after a meal may decrease blood
      sugars more than exercise performed after a meal. However, research in people without
      diabetes shows this may not be the best approach in the long-term. To date, no long-term
      study has compared the effects of exercise performed at different times of the day in people
      with T2D.

      This study will compare the effects of 16 weeks of regular exercise before breakfast compared
      to 16 weeks of regular exercise after breakfast. It is expected that exercise before
      breakfast (i.e., in the fasted state) will lead to greater improvements in blood sugar
      control, without the addition of more exercise. It could be very motivating for people with
      diabetes to know that they can get more benefits from exercise by changing when exercise is
      performed, rather than trying to increase the amount of exercise.
