      Purpose: This is a pilot randomized double-blind placebo controlled trial of anticholinergic
      or beta-3 agonist medication with or without concomitant probiotic therapy in women
      initiating medication therapy for overactive bladder (OAB). The aims of this study are to:

        1. Explore how concomitant probiotic therapy influences response to medication for OAB in a
           randomized controlled trial

        2. Investigate whether 4 weeks of probiotic therapy alters the urinary microbiome

        3. Assess for predictors of response to therapy

      Participants: Women 18 years of age or older presenting to the Division of Urogynecology and
      Reconstructive Pelvic Surgery clinic with OAB/UUI or UUI-predominant mixed incontinence who
      desire nonsurgical therapy will be eligible for participation.

      Procedures (methods): The study will be conducted over a two-year time frame and the primary
      outcome will be subjective improvement in symptoms as assessed by the Patient Global
      Impression of Improvement (PGI-I) validated questionnaire at 4 weeks after initiating
      anticholinergic or beta-3 agonist medication and study drug. The study aims to recruit up to
      140 participants randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either concomitant probiotic or placebo
      medication.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Overactive bladder (OAB) is a highly prevalent condition that negatively impacts the lives of
      millions of adults in the United States. Anticholinergic and beta-3 agonist medications are
      commonly used to treat OAB but compliance is low due to variable efficacy and bothersome side
      effects. The existence of a urinary microbiome was recently discovered and early
      investigations have revealed that lower Lactobacillus load is correlated with the presence of
      OAB symptoms and a poorer response to anticholinergic therapy.

      This proposed pilot study is a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial (RCT) of
      concomitant probiotic therapy in women initiating medication therapy for OAB to explore how
      probiotics influence response to anticholinergic and beta-3 agonist medications, investigate
      whether probiotic therapy alters the urinary microbiome, and assess for predictors of
      response to therapy.

      Primary Aim: To explore how concomitant probiotic therapy influences response to medication
      for OAB in a RCT

      Secondary Aims:

        1. To investigate whether 4 weeks of probiotic therapy alters the urinary microbiome.

        2. To assess for predictors of response to therapy

    <measure>Number of Participants with Treatment Success Based on the PGI-I Validated Questionnaire Response</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment success at 4 weeks after initiation of anticholinergic of beta-3 agonist therapy. Treatment success will be defined as a response of &quot;very much better&quot; or &quot;much better&quot; on the Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I), which is a single item questionnaire that asks respondents to rate their improvement after undergoing treatment on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from &quot;very much worse&quot; to &quot;very much better.&quot; Statistical analysis will be by intention-to-treat for the primary outcome. A chi-square test will be utilized to determine if there is a statistically significant difference between the two cohorts and sensitivity analyses will be performed using logistic regression analysis.</description>

    <measure>Change in participant's urinary microbiome from baseline to week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Each participants' urinary microbiome composition will be analyzed at baseline and at week 4 to determine changes in the microbiome that occur over the study period. The correlation between changes in the urinary microbiome over 4 weeks and study drug allocation (probiotic vs placebo) will be assessed via Chi-square testing.</description>

    <measure>Urinary microbiome Lactobacillus correlation with treatment success as defined by PGI-I Validated Questionnaire Response</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The correlation between the presence of Lactobacillus in the urine at baseline and treatment success at week 4 will be analyzed via Chi-Square testing to assess for predictors of response to therapy in women (i.e. treatment success or lack of treatment success based on the primary outcome definition of treatment success as above).</description>

    <measure>OAB-Q SF Change Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Individual participant change score on the Overactive Bladder Questionnaire short-form (OAB-q SF) will be compared between the two cohorts by student's t-test. The OAB-q SF is utilized to assess the impact of OAB symptoms on the patient's life, and has been shown to be responsive to reductions in urinary urgency, frequency and incontinence during anticholinergic therapy. The OAB-q SF questionnaire consists of 19 items divided into a 6-item symptom severity (SS) scale and a 13-item health-related quality of life (HRQL) scale, with both scales ranging from 0 to 100. For the OAB-q SS scale a higher score indicates worse symptom severity while for the OAB-q HRQL scale a higher score indicates better quality of life.</description>

    <measure>TQSM-II Validated Questionnaire Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4 Visit</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication version 2 (TQSM-II) score, the TQSM-II is comprised of 12 questions assessing treatment satisfaction with medication intended for use with a wide variety of medications and illness conditions that specifically assesses the three most common dimensions on which patients evaluate their medication: effectiveness, side effects of use, and convenience of use. TSQM Scale scores range from 0 to 100 with a higher score indicating better satisfaction with treatment. The TQSM-II score at the week 4 visit will be compared between the two cohorts by student's t-test.</description>
