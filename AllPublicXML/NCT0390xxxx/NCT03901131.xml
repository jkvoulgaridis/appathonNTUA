      Clinical study in which researchers want to learn more about the safety profile of MESIGYNA
      used as a medication in routine clinical practice to prevent pregnancy. In order to find this
      out researchers will collect historic and treatment related data during initial visit and
      follow-up visits of adult women in reproductive age in the Peruvian population at the
      outpatient clinic. Mesigyna is a combined injectable birth control medication (norethindrone
      ethanate (50 mg) and estradiol valerate (5 mg)) for women given monthly.
