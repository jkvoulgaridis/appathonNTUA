  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate conversion rate to minimal residual disease (MRD)
      negativity following the addition of daratumumab to lenalidomide relative to lenalidomide
      alone, when administered as maintenance treatment to anti-cluster of differentiation 38
      (CD38) treatment naive participants with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who are MRD
      positive as determined by next generation sequencing (NGS) following high-dose therapy (HDT)
      and autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT), with or without consolidation therapy.

    <measure>Change in Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) as Measured by European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaires (QLQ)-C30</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>EORTC QLQ-C30 has been widely used among participants with multiple myeloma. It includes 30 items resulting in 5 functional scales (physical functioning, role functioning, emotional functioning, cognitive functioning, and social functioning), 1 Global Health Status scale, 3 symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, and pain), and 6 single items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties). The recall period is 1 week (&quot;past week item&quot;) and responses are reported using a verbal rating scale. The item and scale scores are transformed to a 0 to 100 scale. A higher score represents greater HRQoL, better functioning, and more (worse) symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in HRQoL as Measured by European Quality of Life Five Dimensions Questionnaire-5-level (EQ-5D-5L)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a 5-item questionnaire that assesses 5 domains including mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression plus a visual analog scale rating &quot;health today&quot; with anchors ranging from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in HRQoL as Measured by EORTC QLQ-Multiple Myeloma Module (MY20)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The EORTC QLQ-MY20 has been designed to be used alongside the EORTC QLQ-C30 to address issues of more relevance to myeloma participants. The EORTC QLQ-MY20 20-items make up 4 scales: disease symptoms, side effects of treatment, future perspective, and body image. Item and scale scores are transformed to a 0 to 100 scale. A higher score represents greater HRQoL, better functioning, and more (worse) symptoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants with Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4.1 years</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant participating in a clinical study that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the pharmaceutical/biological agent under study. TEAEs are AEs with onset during the Treatment Phase or that are a consequence of a pre-existing condition that has worsened since baseline.</description>

             induction with or without consolidation therapy and have received high-dose therapy
             (HDT) and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT): (a) for participants who have
             not received consolidation therapy, the participant must be within 180 days
             post-transplant at the time of randomization; and (b) for participants treated with
             consolidation therapy, the participant must be within 90 days of the last dose of
             consolidation therapy at the time of randomization

          -  Must have a very good partial response (VGPR) or better response assessed per
             International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) 2016 criteria at the time of randomization

          -  Have archived bone marrow samples collected before induction treatment (that is, at
             diagnosis) or before transplant (for example, at the end of induction) or have

             Biotechnologies' next generation sequencing (NGS)-based minimal residual disease (MRD)
             assay. Archived bone marrow samples will be used for calibration of myeloma clonal
             cells to facilitate assessment of primary end point by NGS. If an existing result on
             index myeloma clone is available from Adaptive Biotechnologies' NGS-based MRD assay,
             as part of institutional procedures, an archived bone marrow sample is not required as
             long as Adaptive Biotechnologies is able to retrieve historical results on the index
             myeloma clone form the clinical database. Any one of the following archived samples
             are required: (a) Greater than 1 milliliter (mL) viable frozen bone marrow aspirated
             aliquot (preferred) collected in an ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid (EDTA) tube,
             frozen, and stored at a temperature of −80 centigrade (°C), or; (b) Non-decalcified

             1, or 2

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A history of malignancy (other than multiple myeloma) unless all treatment of that
             malignancy was completed at least 2 years before consent and the participant has no
             evidence of disease before the of date of randomization. Exceptions are squamous and
             basal cell carcinomas of the skin, carcinoma in situ of the cervix or breast, or other
             non-invasive lesion that in the opinion of the investigator, with concurrence with the

             3 years

          -  Have had prior treatment/therapy with: (a) Daratumumab or any other anti-cluster of

             management but not on measurable extramedullary plasmacytoma. Radiotherapy within 14
             days prior to randomization on measurable extramedullary plasmacytoma is not permitted
             even in the setting of palliation for symptomatic management, or (c) Plasmapheresis
             within 28 days of randomization

             (anti-HBs positivity as the only serologic marker) AND a known history of prior HBV
             vaccination, do not need to be tested for HBV DNA by PCR; (c) Seropositive for
             hepatitis C (anti-hepatitis C virus [HCV] antibody positive or HCV-RNA quantitation
