      Purpose: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial aims to evaluate
      the therapeutic effects of donepezil in radiotherapy-related cognitive impairment.

      Further study details as provided by Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University /
      Yameitang.

      Primary outcome measure: cognitive improvement, which is determined by the difference value
      of ADAS-cog score before and after the treatment of donepezil.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Application of radiotherapy to patients with head and neck cancer is a mainstay treatment in
      contemporary oncology practice. However, patients who received radiation are vulnerable to
      development of cognitive impairment. There is no acknowledged and effective standard
      treatment for radiotherapy-related cognitive impairment. The investigators supposed that
      donepezil, as a cholinesterase inhibitor, would relieve radiotherapy-related cognitive
      impairment after head and neck cancer, and would improve the life quality for these patients
      and their families.

      Primary objectives: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial aims to
      evaluate the efficacy of donepezil on cognition in radiotherapy-related cognitive impairment.

      Secondary objectives:

      To evaluate the effect of donepezil on sleep disorder, mood disorder, activities of daily
      living, and safety in patients with radiotherapy-related cognitive impairment.

      OUTLINE: This is randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Patients will
      be enrolled and administrated with donepezil or placebo. Donepezil will be supplied as 10 mg
      per pill to be taken by mouth. Placebo will be supplied as substitute of 10 mg donepezil per
      pill to be taken by mouth.

      Patients will be screened, consented, enrolled and have a washout period for 6 weeks. Then
      these patients will be randomized to two arms.

      Arm І: Patients receive donepezil with a dosage of 5 milligram at 8 am for one week (Week 1),
      then 10 milligram at 8 am for 23 weeks (Week 2-24), in the absence of unacceptable toxicity
      or severe deterioration.

      Arm ІI: Patients receive placebo with a dosage of one half pill at 8 am for one week (Week
      1), then one pill at 8 am for 23 weeks (Week 2-24), in the absence of unacceptable toxicity
      or severe deterioration.

    <description>Cognitive change, which is determined by the difference value of ADAS-cog (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale) before and after the treatment of donepezil. The rating of ADAS-cog is made on 6-point scale rating from 0 to 5 in 12 domains.</description>
