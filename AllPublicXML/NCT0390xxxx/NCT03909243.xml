  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the most prevalent chronic diseases worldwide is mental disorder, including social,
      emotional, and behavioral problems, and it is the fifth main cause of global disability . In
      Egypt, it is estimated that 20.6% of children aged from 6-12 years had behavioral problems

      Behavioral and emotional problems may affect deeply child's quality of life, such as
      impairment of school life (high absence), They may cause nutritional imbalance and even
      suicidal thoughts. Therefore, both the dentist and the family should be adequately prepared
      to deal with those children who come seeking dental treatment.

      Recently, studies proved the association between the psychological characteristics and the
      behavior of children in dental setting. There was a study that showed that there is a
      relation between psychological functioning of the child, dental anxiety and his/her behaviour
      during dental appointment. Furthermore, it was found that there is a correlation between the
      temperamental difficulties or emotional problems of the child and the non‚Äêcooperative
      behavior during the process of injection of the local anesethia.

      These studies ensures the importance of understanding the effect of mental disorders on the
      behavior of children during dental treatment, as it would help the professionals to properly
      plan the clinic appointments without any delay or cancellation of the appointment and allows
      him to render effective and efficient dental treatment.
