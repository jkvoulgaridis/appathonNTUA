  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Myomectomy operation due to myoma uteri is an operation that can cause serious blood loss.
      For some anatomical reasons, fundal myomas were removed, while a group of investigators
      recommended the initiation of a longitudinal incision and some surgeons preferred a
      transverse incision. the authors aim to show some surgical differences, intraoperative blood
      loss, and difficulties and ease of removal of myoma in patients with these approaches without
      consensus. It is also noted that the incision made with the same energy modality is recorded;
      The effect of energy modality on blood loss and surgical comfort will be examined. Different
      approaches are used for laparoscopic surgical operations in order to remove myoma from the
      abdomen. It can be removed from the vagina by colpotomy and can also be minimized in the
      abdomen by a morselator. In particular, patients with vaginal myoma removed, such as
      complaints of postoperative dyspareunia will be followed. In this way, the investigators aim
      to evaluate the methods which have not yet gained clarity in the literature or have not
      proven superiority to each other.
