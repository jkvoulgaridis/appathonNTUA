        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are receiving a NucleusÂ® CI512, CI522, or CI532 electrodes

          -  18 years and older

          -  Postlingual onset of hearing loss (onset of hearing loss &gt;two years of age)

          -  Individuals who qualify for cochlear implantation using the clinics current CI
             candidacy criteria

          -  Individuals who have recently been implanted but not yet had their external device

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Ossification or any other cochlear anomaly that might prevent insertion of less than
             10 electrodes of the electrode array

          -  Diagnosis of retro-cochlear pathology

          -  Diagnosis of auditory neuropathy

          -  Subject considering an acoustic component in the implanted ear

          -  Unrealistic expectations on the part of the subject regarding the possible benefits,
             risks, and limitations that are inherent to the surgical procedure and use of the
             prosthetic device

          -  Unwillingness or inability to comply with all investigational requirements

          -  Severe-profound sensorineural hearing loss &gt;30 years

          -  Previous cochlear implant in the contralateral ear. Additional cognitive, medical or
             social handicaps that would prevent completion of all study requirements as determined
             by the investigator
