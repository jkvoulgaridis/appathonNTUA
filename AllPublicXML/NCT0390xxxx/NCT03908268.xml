    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of Family Nurture Intervention in a
      mother-child group setting with a Standard Children's Learning Center (CLC) Program for
      preschool-aged children (ages 2-4.5). This approach is based on creating emotional connection
      and establishing mother-child two-way regulation, which the investigators hypothesize affects
      early child development. Mothers and children will be engaged by Nurture Specialists in
      comforting and calming interactions to regulate each other physicallyâ€”leading to an automatic
      calming response to contact with each other.

      This study tests a group model of Family Nurture Intervention (FNI), a novel family-based
      intervention that facilitates mother-child emotional connectedness and co-regulation. Many
      current interventions aim at helping the child to self-regulate with or without the mother's
      help. However, according to the investigators' Calming Cycle Theory, the ability of the
      mother-child dyad to promote optimal development is dependent on the dyad's ability to
      co-regulate. The interactive co-regulation between the mother and the child shapes the
      behavior of both. This study aims to investigate the short and long term effects of FNI in a
      multiple family group setting for preschool aged children to prevent and/or treat
      developmental/behavioral problems.

      Previously, FNI implemented in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) for premature infants
      and their mothers at Columbia University Medical Center demonstrated that FNI positively
      alters neurodevelopment of premature infants. Infants who received FNI in the NICU
      demonstrated increased brain activity in the prefrontal cortex at term age, improved
      cognitive and language development at 18 months as measured by the Bayley Scales of Infant
      Development, improved behavior on the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and reduced risk for
      autism as indicated by the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT) at 18 months.
      The pilot study of FNI with preschool aged children and their mothers shows a 40% reduction
      in behavioral problems on the CBCL. Accordingly, the investigators hypothesize that the
      Family Nurture Intervention will alter physiological regulatory capacities and will result in
      improved indices of mother-child emotional connection and other outcomes in the preschool
      population similar to the results in the preterm population.

    <description>Mother-child interactions will be assessed for social engagement and emotional connection via the Welch Emotional Connection Screen (WECS).
The Welch Emotional Connection Scale (WECS) construct is emotional connection between mother and child, which the investigators hypothesize predicts optimal development. There are four items on the WECS: Mutual Attraction, Mutual Vocal Exchange, Mutual Facial Engagement, and Mutual Sensitivity/Reciprocity. Each item is rated on a scale from 1 to 3 in 0.25 increments with a score of 3 considered optimal. There is also a binary question to the rater asking if the pair is emotionally connected - yes or no. The mother and child are scored as a pair, not individually.</description>

    <measure>Change in Maternal Symptoms of Anxiety and Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, after 8 sessions/weeks and at 6-months post-accrual</time_frame>
    <description>Measured via self-report on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), which measures symptoms of depression in nine different groups as defined by the American Psychiatric Association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual - Fifth Edition (DSM-V). Mothers are asked to respond to questions such as &quot;I felt hopeful about the future.&quot; Responses range from &quot;rarely or none of the time&quot; to &quot;most or all of the time.&quot; &quot;Rarely...&quot; earns a 0 while &quot;most...&quot; earns a 3, with the two responses in the middle earning a 1 and a 2. Each item in the CES-D is weighted equally. Scores are summed to equal a total score. A lower total score indicates the individual is minimally depressed (better outcome), whereas a higher total score indicates the individual is more severely depressed (worse outcome).</description>

    <measure>Change in Maternal Symptoms of Anxiety and Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, after 8 sessions/weeks and at 6-months post-accrual</time_frame>
    <description>Measured via self-report on the Resilience/Stress (R/S) Questionnaire, a metric of the stress and resilience the mother experienced and developed during her childhood. The R/S Questionnaire is presented in a Likert scale format, asking the mother to respond to statements such as &quot;I believe that my mother loved me when I was little.&quot; Potential answers range from &quot;definitely true&quot; to &quot;definitely not true,&quot; where &quot;definitely true&quot; earns 1 point while &quot;definitely not true&quot; earns 5. Total scores are calculated by summing the points attributed to each response. A lower total score indicates that the mother had a healthy support system and experienced situations benefiting her psychological health. In contrast, multiple statements answered &quot;definitely not true&quot; or &quot;probably not true,&quot; indicates a worse outcome, a lack of social support or psychological well-being during the mother's childhood.</description>
