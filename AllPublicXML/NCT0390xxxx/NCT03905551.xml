  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the tremendous advances in dialysis technology, hemodialysis (HD) is a significant
      challenge for dialysis patients and quality of their lives[2]. Research has shown for years
      that dialysate fluid temperature and especially the typical dialysis (TD) temperature at
      (37°C) are complicated by hemodynamic instability which leading to an increased risk of
      heat‐induced hypotension causing patient discomfort and increased mortality.

      Cold dialysis (CD) is defined as the reduction of dialysis fluid temperature to 35-36°C,
      approximately 1°C below the typical dialysate temperature which ranges between 37-38°C. A
      number of studies have reported beneficial effects of CD on maintaining hemodynamic
      stability, minimizes hypotension and exerts a protective effect over major organs including
      the heart and brain. In addition, current evidence showed the protective effect of CD in
      cardiac performance during the dialysis session. As the investigators know until today
      cardiovascular mortality is an important issue for nephrologists that care for ESRD patients,
      however, many other benefits have been observed on patients' overall health and quality of
      life levels by used of CD.

      The above-mentioned benefits of CD in the hemodynamic stability and the general quality of
      life of the patients are highlighted even further due to the ever-increasing adoption of
      intradialytic exercise programs. It has been well established that intradialytic exercise
      leads to benefits of physiological, functional, and psychological deterioration, which
      commonly accrues as a consequence of biological aging, catabolic illness, and a sedentary
      lifestyle, factors that may all contribute to the progressive decline of vitality and quality
      of life commonly observed in ESRD patients.

      However, despite a strong rationale for the implementation of intradialytic exercise programs
      and the aforementioned benefits of CD, the separate and combined effects of these protocols
      in aspects related to quality of life and health in ESRD patients have not been investigated
      to date.

      The aim of the current clinical study was to assess the effect of exercise rehabilitation
      regimes in combination with changes in dialysate temperature in aspects related to quality of
      life and health in end-stage renal disease patients receiving hemodialysis.

      The primary aim of the clinical study was to investigate the combined effect of cold dialysis
      and aerobic exercise in aspects related to health. More specific:

        1. To investigate the thermoregulatory responses of hemodialysis patients under four
           different hemodialysis protocols.

        2. To assess the changes in muscular architecture and functional capacity in dialysis
           patients after 7 months of intradialytic exercise training.

        3. To assess the impact on insulin sensitivity and glucose disposal.

    <intervention_model_description>The current study is a randomized clinical trial lasting for 7 months. Hemodialysis patients, which fulfilled the inclusion criteria, randomly divided into two groups: a) typical dialysis with dialysate temperature at 37°C (TD+EX) in combination with aerobic intradialytic exercise training, b) cold dialysis with dialysate temperature at 35°C (CD) in combination with aerobic intradialytic exercise training (CD+ET).
Patients enrolled by a research assistant assigned into the study while the order that the patients assigned to the first scenario was randomly using a computer random number generator.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>Changes from baseline at 7 months</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life will be assessed using the Sort Form 36 questionnaire. The Short Form (36) Health Survey is a 36-item, patient-reported survey of patient health. The SF-36 is a measure of health status and is consisted of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.
The eight sections are:
vitality
physical functioning
bodily pain
general health perceptions
physical role functioning
emotional role functioning
social role functioning
mental health</description>
