In this format, scores represent the achieved percentage of the total possible score, e.g. a score of 50 represents 50% of the highest possible score.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient diagnosed with macular edema due to RVO (either BRVO or CRVO, non-ischemic)

          -  Retinal thickness ≥ 300 μm by SD-OCT in the central 1 mm macular subfield of the study
             eye at the Screening visit

          -  BCVA score of 19 to 73 letters (approximately 20/400 to 20/40 Snellen equivalent) in
             the study eye measured by ETDRS method at Screening

          -  &lt; 3 months of macular edema duration

          -  Treatment-naive patients (ie, have not previously received any treatment for macular
             edema secondary to RVO)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of/history of any ocular condition other than macular edema that affects
             visual acuity (eg, cataract, severe macular ischemia, foveal atrophy, age-related
             macular degeneration, uveitis or other ocular inflammatory disease, neovascular
             glaucoma, Irvine-Gass syndrome, prior macular detachment)

          -  History of marked IOP elevation in response to steroid treatment that (a) required
             IOP-lowering treatment, (b) resulted in a &gt;10 mm Hg increase in IOP from predose, or
             (c) resulted in IOP &gt;25 mm Hg

          -  History of glaucoma or ocular hypertension (IOP &gt; 21 mm Hg), or optic nerve head

             study eye (patients with a history of previous angle closure that has been
             successfully treated with either a laser or surgical peripheral iridotomy [PI] are
             allowed as long as the visual fields have been stable for &gt; 1 year prior to study
             entry and the patient has been and can be safely dilated).

          -  Any active ocular infection (i.e., bacterial, viral, parasitic, or fungal) in either
             eye at the Screening visit

             extensive dermal) within 1 month prior to Baseline or anticipated use at any time
             during the study (inhaled, intranasal, and intra-articular/intrabursal corticosteroids
             are allowed)

          -  Use of immunosuppressants, immunomodulators, antimetabolites, and/or alkylating agents
             within 3 months prior to Baseline or anticipated use at any time during the study

          -  Use of warfarin or heparin within 2 weeks prior to Baseline or anticipated use within
             the study period

          -  Known allergy, hypersensitivity or contraindication to the study medication, its
             components, fluorescein or povidone iodine
