  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study aims to better understand how the plantar temperature data collected by
      the Podimetrics RTM System corresponds to physical activity level in subjects.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with prescription for monitoring with Podimetrics RTM System will be assigned
      activity monitors to track physical activity. Data from the Podimetrics RTM System and the
      activity monitor will be assessed after one month of use to determine any correlation between
      the two data sets and adherence to the use of activity monitor.
