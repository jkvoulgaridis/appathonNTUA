      Background: Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) is a chronic, inflammatory rheumatic disease that
      effects primarily axial-spine. Reduction of flexibility and mobility is important factors
      that can cause muscle weakness, impairment quality of life, reduction of exercise tolerance
      and pulmonary capacity with the progression of AS. The purpose of this study is to
      investigate the effects of pilates exercises on mobility, quality of life and respiratory
      muscle strength in patients with AS.

      Methods: Forty patients will be included who are aged between 18-55 years and got diagnosed
      according to Modified New York criterias.Patients will be divided into two groups randomly.
      Pilates training will be performed to the treatment group and conventional exercises will be
      performed to the control group during 8 weeks. Respiratory muscle strength, quality of life,
      spinal mobility, thorax expansion, respiratory functions, physical activity level, exercise
      capasity and disease activity will be evaluated at first session and at the end of the 8th
      week in this study.

      Objective: Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) is a chronic, inflammatory rheumatic disease that
      effects primarily axial-spine. With progression of disease, flexibility of thorax and spine
      will be get lost. It is reported that mobility, function, respiratory muscle strength and
      endurance get worse in AS patients. Reduction of flexibility and mobility is important
      factors that can cause muscle weakness, impairment quality of life, reduction of exercise
      tolerance and pulmonary capacity with the progression of AS. To writer's knowledge, there has
      been no study examining the effects of pilates exercises on mobility, function and
      respiratory muscle strength in AS patients. The purpose of this study is to investigate the
      effects of pilates exercises on mobility, function and respiratory muscle strength in
      patients with AS.

      Methods: Forty patients were included who are aged between 18-65 years and got diagnosed
      according to Modified New York criterias. Patients who have incooperation, malignancy and
      pregnancy will be excluded from the study. Patients will be divided into two groups randomly.
      Pilates training will be performed to the treatment group and conventional exercises will be
      performed to the control group during 8 weeks Respiratory muscle strength will be assessed by
      maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressures. Thorax expansion will be measured from regions
      of axillar, subcostal and epigastric by tape measure. To evaluate disease activity and spinal
      mobility, we will use Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) and Bath
      Ankylosing Spondylitis Metrology Index (BASMI), respectively. Quality of life will be
      evaluated with Ankylosing Spondylitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (ASQoL). Exercise
      capacity will be assessed by 6 minutes walk test. Pilates exercises will be performed 3 days
      in a week for 8 weeks. Conventional exercise programme will be taugt to the control group and
      requested to perform them at home. The assessments will be repeated in before and after
      treatment.

    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Respiratory muscle strength will be assessed by digital mouth-pressure meter (Micro Medical MicroRM, Rochester, England). Maksimal inspiratory pressure (MIP) and Maksimal Expiratory Pressure (MEP) will be measured with the subject sitting and breathing through a mouthpiece by encouraged verbally, after clamping the nose (cmH2O). To measure MIP, the patient will be requested to breath in quickly and deeply until total lung capacity, just after breath out maximally until residual volume. To measure MEP, the patient will be requested to breath until total lung capacity and then breath out quickly until residual volume. Leaks around the mouthpiece will be avoided. The best of five attempts will be selected and stated as percent of expected values according to sex and age</description>

    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Spinal mobility will assessed and scored by Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Metrology Index (BASMI). There are five measurements including lateral lumbar flexion, tragus-to-wall distance, lumbar flexion (Modified Schober), maximal intermalleolar distance and cervical rotation according to the index. Each subscale is scored between 0 and 10. All points are then averaged to calculate total score. Higher values represent worse outcomes.</description>

    <measure>Aerobic capacity</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Aerobic capacity will be assessed with 6 minute walk test (6MWT) which is a submaximal effort test. 6MWT is a distance required to fast-paced walk on flat floor in length 30 meters. The aim of the 6MWT is to walk as long as the patient can walk in 6 minutes. Dyspnoea and fatigue level are recorded at the end of the test. Distance covered by the patient is calculated at the of 6 minutes</description>

    <measure>Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index</measure>
    <time_frame>1 minute</time_frame>
    <description>Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index which consists of 6 questions will be used to evaluate disease activity. BASDAI is a composite index, consisting of an assessment on a 10 cm horizontal visual analog scale of fatigue, axial pain, peripheral pain, enthesopathy and stiffness. Fifth and sixth questions are averaged. Addition to this score, other questions are averaged. Total score is between 0 and 10. Higher score represent worse outcome.</description>

    <measure>International Physical Activity Questionnaire- Short Form</measure>
    <time_frame>1 minute</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire obtains information about how much time is spent while walking and in moderate and vigorous activities and sitting duration in the last 7 days. The questionnaire records the activity of four intensity levels: 1) vigorous-intensity activity, 2) moderate-intensity activity, 3) walking, and 4) sitting. Durations are multiplied by known METs per activity and the results for all items are summed for the overall physical activity score. Scores for walking and for moderate and vigorous activities are sums of corresponding item scores. A sitting question is not included in physical activity score. The questionnaire is scored as: those who score high on the IPAQ engage in vigorous intensity activity of at least 1500 MET minutes a week, those who score modarete on the IPAQ of at least 600 MET minutes a week, those who score a low level of physical activity on the IPAQ means that not meeting any of the criteria for either moderate or high levels of physical activity</description>
