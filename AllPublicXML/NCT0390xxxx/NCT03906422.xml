  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Three different types of 'archwires' can be used in Orthodontic treatment, wire choice is
      decided by treating Orthodontist based on professional preference since research shows that
      all types are equally effective.

      It is possible that one type of wire engenders more patient discomfort. This study will
      compare the discomfort levels engendered by the three wire types to determine if there is one
      that induces the least amount.

      Orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances has the potential to induce pain in patients. At
      the beginning of treatment, the orthodontist must determine which initial orthodontic
      archwire to insert. Among the more popular choices for initial leveling and aligning of the
      dental arches are small-sized, round-diameter nickel-titanium archwires. Various types of
      nickel-titanium (NiTi) archwires exist including stabilized martensitic wires (ie classic
      Nitinol), active austenitic wires (superelastic NiTi) and active martensitic wires
      (thermoelastic NiTi). The efficacy of these wire types has been heavily researched with no
      significant differences in the alignment timing of the dentition (treatment time to reach the
      final archwire). Pain differences from these wires has been inconclusive from conflicting
      past studies. It is of critical importance to determine whether one or more of these
      archwires leads to more discomfort for the patient than the others.

    <masking_description>The investigator will assemble the opaque, sealed envelopes containing the archwires. The envelopes will be labeled &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot; or &quot;C&quot; corresponding to 0.016&quot; Nitinol (3M Unitek, Monrovia, CA), 0.016&quot; 27o CuNiTi (Ormco, Glendora, CA) or 0.016&quot; 35o CuNiTi (Ormco, Glendora, CA) respectively. Randomization sequences will be created by using Research Randomizer online software. The investigator will enroll patients into the study. This trial will be completed with two blocks of 63 subjects each, one block per year, with subject randomization within each block.
An independent third party will maintain possession of all envelopes and distribute as needed once a subject is enrolled and ready to receive fixed orthodontic appliances. The same independent third party will maintain a log with subject identification and consent forms.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain score via Visual Analogue Score</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour, 4 hour, 24 hour, 4 day and 7 day</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome is the change in pain experienced by the study participant over the first week of therapy after insertion of the archwire.
Pain is assessed by asking the study participant to place a mark on a horizontal 100 mm line to indicate the level of pain being experienced. The left end of the line is no pain where the right end is maximum (unimaginable) pain. The specific pain indicated is in the number of millimeters from the left end of the line. This is called the Visual Analogue Score (VAS) where the higher the number the more intense the pain.
The difference in VAS pain scores from the initial VAS after archwire insertion (1 hour) to each measurement time (4 hour, 24 hour, 4 day and 7 day) over 7 days will indicate the change pain experience for each study participant.
For each time point the mean and standard deviation of the change in VAS pain scores for the experimental groups will be calculated and compared for statistically significant differences.</description>
