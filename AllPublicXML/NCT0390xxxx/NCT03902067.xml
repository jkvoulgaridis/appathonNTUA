    <textblock>
      A pilot study to evaluate the safety and feasibility of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells
      in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction by catheter transplantation
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, 40 patients with cardiac insufficiency after acute myocardial infarction were
      selected and randomly divided into umbilical cord MSCs transplantation treatment group and
      non-intervention control group to preliminarily observe the safety and effectiveness of MSCs
      cell transplantation treatment.
