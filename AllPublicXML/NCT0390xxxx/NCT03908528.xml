      Fifty breast cancer patients with stage from stage I to stage III will be involved in this
      study. Staging is done according to the American joint committee on cancer: TNM staging of
      breast cancer.

        -  All participants will be recruited from Ayadi AL-Mostakbal Oncology Center. The study
           will be approved by Research Ethics Committee of Damanhour University. All participants
           will give their consent.

        -  All 50 patients will be scheduled to receive 4 cycles of AC: cycled every 21 days
           followed by weekly cycle of taxol for 12 weeks.

      Patients will be classified as follow:

        -  Group one: 25 patients will receive four cycles of AC followed by weekly taxol for 12
           weeks.

        -  Group two: 25 patients will receive the same regimen as group 1 in addition to oral 600
           mg alpha lipoic acid (ALA) once daily.

      All patients will be submitted to:

        1. Full patient history and clinical examination.

        2. Venous blood will be collected before the first cycle of chemotherapy and after the last
           cycle of chemotherapy.

      1- Cardio-toxcity assessment: i. Echo-cardiogram. ii. Troponin I. iii. The Brain Natriuretic
      Peptide (BNP). 2- Neurotoxicity assessment: i. National Cancer Institute common Terminology
      criteria for Adverse Effect grading: NCI-CTCAE version 4.0.

      ii. Neurotoxicity questionnaire from the validated Functional Assessment of cancer
      therapy/gynecologic oncology group taxane specific neurotoxicity questionnaire: FACT-Taxane.

      iii. MMP 3 a marker for neuropathic pain. iv. Neurotensin 3- Oxidative stress and
      inflammatory markers: i. Malondialdehyde (MDA). ii. TNF-alpha
