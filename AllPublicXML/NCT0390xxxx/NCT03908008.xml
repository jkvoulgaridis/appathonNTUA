      This study design is a parallel, active drug controlled, double blind, randomized,
      multi-centered, phase III clinical trial to compare the efficacy and safety of MT10107 versus
      BOTOX® in treatment of glabella line. Subjects who voluntarily signed the informed consent
      and are judged to be eligible for this study will be intramuscularly injected with the study
      drug or the comparator at a total of 20U (4U/0.1ml each) in five sites of the glabella line.
      Thereafter, follow-up visits will be made at 4 weeks, 10 weeks, 16 weeks and the efficacy and
      safety assessments will be conducted for a total of 16 weeks.
