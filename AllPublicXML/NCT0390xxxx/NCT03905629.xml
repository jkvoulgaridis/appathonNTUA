  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Older people are increasing users of health care globally. Constraints in bed capacity and
      resources raise important challenges with regards to management of older people with complex
      needs, which usually require assertive and holistic assessment. It is important, therefore,
      to identify aged patients most likely to benefit from such frailty-attuned approaches of
      care. A previous study using national Hospital Episodes Statistics conducted in the United
      Kingdom (UK) showed that patients aged over 75 years with characteristics of frailty and at
      risk of adverse health-care outcomes can be identified using routinely collected data
      (Gilbert T et al., Lancet 2018). This study lead to the development of the Hospital Frailty
      Risk Score (HFRS), which is based on International Statistical Classification of Diseases and
      Related Health Problems 10 (ICD-10) diagnosis codes and has the potential to be used in other
      countries worldwide, using the ICD-10 coding framework, to identify patients at risk of
      frailty at the hospital and commissioners levels, as well as for database research purposes.
      This score has successfully been validated in Canada, Australia and Switzerland. The aim of
      the present study is to evaluate the ability of the HFRS to predict 30-day in-patient
      mortality of patients aged 75 years and older admitted to French hospitals as an emergency.

    <description>This multi-centric retrospective observational cohort study is conducted using the PMSI. Predictive ability of HFRS estimated on the basis of 3 binary outcomes: 30-day in-patient mortality (main outcome), 30-day emergency and potentially avoidable readmission, length of stay &gt;15 days. Odds ratios (ORs) and c-statistics calculated and compared to the original UK results in order to validate the use of the HFRS in France. Other secondary objectives include:
Evaluate agreement between HFRS and Charlson or Elixhauser comorbidity indices
Evaluate ability of HFRS combined with comorbidity indices (Charlson on one hand, and Elixhauser on other hand), to predict 30-day in-patient mortality, 30-day emergency and potentially avoidable readmissions, and long length of stay
Identify specific risk associations in France of a high risk of frailty (as assessed by the HFRS) with individual, organizational and territorial factors</description>

        Patients considered will be all patients aged 75 years and older hospitalized as an
        emergency over a one year period ranging from January to December 2017.

        According to a preliminary extraction, we expect to include approximately one million
        patients.
