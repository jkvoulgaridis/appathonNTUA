      The purpose of this retrospective study is to evaluate the effects of in-home addiction
      treatment on first responders with substance use disorder. Treatment engagement,
      hospitalizations, detox and residential addiction treatment admissions, and lethal overdoses
      will be measured. Although not the primary focus, recidivism and relapse will be measured.
