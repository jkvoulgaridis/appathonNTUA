    <textblock>
      The purpose of this post-approval study is to further evaluate the long-term safety and
      effectiveness of Medtronic DBS therapy for epilepsy on seizure reduction in newly implanted
      participants through 3 years of follow-up in different geographic populations.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Focal (partial) onset seizures that may or may not evolve to a bilateral tonic-clonic
             seizure (secondary generalization). The final determination shall be made by the
             Investigator based on a clinical description of the seizures and previous diagnostic
             testing that includes, at a minimum, video electroencephalogram (EEG) that captured at
             least one ictal event

          -  Anticipated average of 6 or more focal (partial) onset seizures per month during CMM
             phase, with no more than 30 consecutive seizure-free days during the CMM phase

          -  Refractory to at least 3 antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) due to lack of effectiveness

          -  Age 18 or older at the time of enrollment

          -  If female, have a negative pregnancy test at the Enrollment Visit and, if sexually
             active, must be using a reliable form of birth control, be surgically sterile, or be
             at least 2 years post-menopausal

          -  Willing and able to complete the diary, with or without the assistance of a caregiver,
             in a reliable way as assessed by the clinical staff

          -  Able to use the Patient Programmer with or without the assistance of a caregiver

          -  Ability of the subject or legal representative to understand and provide signed
             consent for participating in the study

          -  Willing and available to attend visits as scheduled and to comply with the study
             protocol

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Generalized onset epilepsy type (based on International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE)
             2017 classification)

          -  Seizure frequency is too frequent that subject is unable to provide daily count in
             order to maintain a reliable seizure diary

          -  Any episode of convulsive status epilepticus within the 12 months prior to the
             Enrollment Visit

             allowed if the subject agrees to have the device turned off for at least 30 days after
             signing the informed consent and prior to the Enrollment Visit assessments. The VNS
             generator needs to be explanted prior to or at the time of the DBS neurostimulator
             implant

             postoperative bleeding. This includes administration of any antiplatelet or
             anticoagulant medication in the 7 days prior to surgery, chronic anticoagulant use,
             chronic aspirin use of greater than 325 mg/day, and any participant with a history of
             hemorrhagic stroke

          -  History of drug or alcohol abuse within the past year

          -  Condition or disease that is known to require repeat magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs)

        Implant Criteria

          -  Experienced an average of 6 or more focal (partial) onset seizures per month during
             CMM phase, with no more than 30 days between seizures

          -  Completed 3-month CMM visit

          -  Has Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II) score &lt;20 at 3-month CMM visit and no
             suicide attempt or other self-harm behaviors within past year (assessed by
             Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) at 3-month CMM visit)

          -  If female, has a negative pregnancy test and if sexually active continues using a
