  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the Personalized Support for Progress (PSP)
      intervention in a Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Women's Wellness Clinic. PSP uses a
      peer support provider to help women identify their primary concern, develop a personalized
      plan to help address that concern, and provide practical and emotional support to implement
      the plan. The primary aim is to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and utility of PSP
      and the research protocol.
