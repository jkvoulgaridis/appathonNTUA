      This study will be conducted at Research Institute of Traumatology and Orthopedics (NRITO)
      n.a. Ya.L.Tsivyan, Novosibirsk, Russia.

      The current study is prospective pilot clinical study to demonstrate the possibility and
      effectiveness of performing modified technique of MIS TLIF, supplemented by segmental
      vertebrotomy, to correct segmental deformity of lumbar spine.

      It is expected to enroll 10 patients aged 18-70 with segmental deformity of lumbar spine,
      caused by degenerative spondylolisthesis and/or degenerative stenosis.
