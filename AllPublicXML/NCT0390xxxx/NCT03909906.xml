    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the chronic effects (14 days) of Euphytose速 on
      psychological state, physiological stress responses and any resulting changes in gut
      microflora communities as compared to placebo.

      The aim of the proposed study is to assess the effects of chronic (14 days) supplementation
      with Euphytose速 on psychological state with regards perceived stress and overall mood as well
      as psychological and physiological stress responses during a laboratory stressor. The trial
      will employ the Observed Multitasking Stressor (OMS), with psychological state and
      physiological responses assessed before and after its completion. The main mood/psychological
      stressor assessment will take place pre-treatment and following 14 days of treatment. Stool
      samples will also be collected from participants in order to assess changes in gut microflora
      communities at visits 1 and 2.
