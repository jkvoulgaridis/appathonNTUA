  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators' preliminary data from a phase I pilot study of short course radiation
      therapy followed by chemotherapy showed nearly 80% complete clinical response (cCR) (final
      analysis still pending). Given the promising response rate, the investigators are evaluating
      short course total neoadjuvant therapy (SC-TNT) in a multi-institution phase II trial to
      validate the cCR rate of this treatment paradigm.
