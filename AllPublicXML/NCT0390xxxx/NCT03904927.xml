      The aim of the study is to determine if intervening with combined local therapy and
      chemotherapy prior to chemotherapy alone in patients with oligorecurrent and oligometastatic
      esophageal squamous cell carcinoma led to significant improvements in progression-free
      survival (PFS).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with oligorecurrent and oligometastatic diseases and pathologically confirmed
             esophageal squamous cell carcinoma after initial radical treatment (including R0
             resection, radical radiotherapy or CRT with efficacy more than SD), the primary
             esophageal lesions are controlled, and the number of metastases Less than or equal to
             4.

             Note:

               1. Number of metastases per organ ≤ 2

               2. Patients may be enrolled in the following cases: patients with only distant organ
                  metastases; or patients with distant organs and regional lymph nodes as defined
                  in the eighth edition of the AJCC metastases or anastomotic recurrence. Patients
                  with only regional lymph node metastasis or anastomotic recurrence are not
                  eligible for enrollment.

          2. All metastases after diagnosis of recurrence and metastasis did not receive local
             treatment such as radiotherapy, surgery, radiofrequency ablation. Previous
             chemotherapy was allowed, but no anti-tumor medication was received within 4 weeks

          4. The measurable lesion was determined by the investigator based on the RECIST 1.1

             target lesion if it is confirmed to progress and is considered to be measurable
             according to RECIST 1.1.

          5. The patient is over 18 years old and has an ECOG score of 0-1. According to the
             investigator's judgment, the patient is expected to be resistant to chemotherapy and
             local treatment.

          6. Estimated survival time &gt;12 weeks.

          7. The function of vital organs meets the following requirements:

               2. platelets ≥ 100 × 10^9 / L;

               3. Hemoglobin ≥ 9g / dL;

               4. serum albumin ≥ 2.8g / dL;

                  metastasis AKP ≤ 5 × ULN ;

               6. serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 × ULN or creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL / min;

               7. For patients with pulmonary lesions who are known or suspected to have impaired
                  lung function, the forced expiratory volume (FEV1) for 1 second of lung function
                  must be above 1L.

          8. Female subjects of childbearing age must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test
             within 72 hours prior to randomization. Subjects agreed to adequate contraception
             during the trial.
