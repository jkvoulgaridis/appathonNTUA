  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is investigating the combination of palbociclib, letrozole and venetoclax in ER
      and BCL-2 positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer.

      It is hypothesised that venetoclax may augment the actions of palbociclib and letrozole in
      these patient groups. The primary objective of the study is to determine the maximum
      tolerated dose of the combination treatment, which can be used in subsequent studies. The
      study will also investigate disease response and survival.

      Participants will receive palbociclib (daily, on days 1-21 of each 28 day cycle), letrozole
      (daily, on days 1-28 of each 28 day cycle) and venetoclax (daily, on days 1-21 of each 28 day
      cycle) until the last patient has completed 18 months treatment on the study.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a Phase 1b, open-label, multicentre dose escalation study of venetoclax in combination with palbociclib and letrozole in patients with ER positive and BCL-2 positive metastatic breast cancer. The study will enrol up to 36 patients with metastatic breast cancer, with the objective of defining the MTD of venetoclax in combination with palbociclib and letrozole. There will be up to a total of 6 dose levels. Three 'step-down' levels will also be included to incorporate the options of reducing the dose of palbociclib if required. The MTD will be the RP2D of palbociclib, letrozole and venetoclax.</intervention_model_description>
