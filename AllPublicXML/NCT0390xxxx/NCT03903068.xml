  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-stroke depression (PSD) is one of the most common complications after stroke, with a
      high prevalence. PSD can affect prognosis and rehabilitation of stroke, increase risks of
      mortality and suicide, and escalate the economic burden on individuals and society. Studies
      have shown that transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) can also be used to treat
      depression, insomnia and anxiety. So far, this stimulator has been approved by FDA. However,
      there have not been any reports on the use of tACS in the treatment of depression and PSD in
      China. In this trial, the efficacy and safety of the tACS will be assessed with the rigor
      methodology manner.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with post-stroke depression (PSD) have more dysfunction, poorer recovery outcomes,
      and higher morbidity and mortality in the first year after stroke onset than those patients
      without stroke. Some therapeutic methods have shown to be effective for PSD, including
      antidepressants, non-drug interventions, and combination therapies. However, pharmacological
      agents not only show unwanted side effects, including nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, and
      dizziness, but also produce high risk of hemorrhagic complications and stroke. Therefore, in
      addition to antidepressants treating PSD, non-drug interventions have been proposed to treat
      PSD. Until now, there are various physical techniques, including transcranial magnetic
      stimulation, vagus nerve stimulation, transcranial direct current stimulation, transcranial
      ultrasonic stimulation, etc. Previous studies have shown that transcranial alternating
      current stimulation (tACS) is commonly used to relieve pain, and has also been used to treat
      conditions such as transient tic disorder and cluster headaches. In the brain, there are
      specific opioid receptors which are not independent, and they work together with the electro
      analgesic system. Patients treated for chronic pain had lower levels of endorphins in their
      cerebrospinal fluid. Theoretically, using tACS can alleviate pain was caused by electrical
      stimulation to activate the brain's pain system (anti-nociceptive system), led to the
      beta-endorphin, serotonin and norepinephrine release.

      Therefore, the study is expected to verify the effect of Transcranial Alternating Current
      Stimulation on patients with PSD in China and preliminarily explore the variations of gamma
      and beta-oscillations and cognitive function for the intervention of PSD utilized by it.

The three electrodes are placed in this way to enhance the performance of the Nexalin ADI device. When the device is activated, there will be a weak current passing through the forehead electrode and each mastoid electrode. The current intensity of Nexalin ADI treatment defaults to 15.00 mA and the duration defaults to 40 minutes. Both are preset to default parameters and cannot be changed.</description>
