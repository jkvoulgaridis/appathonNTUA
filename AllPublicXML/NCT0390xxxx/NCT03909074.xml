      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the non-inferiority of experimental EV71 vaccine
      compared to the control EV71 vaccine in children aged 36-71 months, to evaluate the
      non-inferiority of EV71 vaccine used in children aged 36-71 months compared to 6-35 months.
      The experimental vaccine was manufactured by Sinovac Biotech Co., Ltd, and the control
      vaccine was manufactured by Institute of Medical Biology Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.

      This study is a randomized, double-blind, single-center, controlled phase III clinical trial
      in children aged 36-71 months, and bridging trial between agegroup of 6-35 and 36-71 months.
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of the experimental
      EV71 vaccine in children aged 36-71 months. The primary objective of this study is to
      evaluate the non-inferiority of experimental EV71 vaccine compared to the control EV71
      vaccine in children aged 36-71 months, and the non-inferiority of EV71 vaccine used in
      children aged 36-71 months compared to 6-35 months. The secondary objective is to evaluate
      the safety of the experimental vaccine used in children aged 36-71 months. The experimental
      vaccine is manufactured by Sinovac Biotech Co., Ltd, and the control vaccine is manufactured
      by Institute of Medical Biology Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. 600 children aged 36-71
      months will be randomly assigned in to receive the experimental vaccine or control vaccine,
      and 300 children aged 6-35 months will receive the experimental vaccine.

    <measure>The overall incidence of adverse reactions</measure>
    <time_frame>0-30 days after each dose</time_frame>
    <description>After each dose, a 30-minute safety observation will be conducted immediately. The body temperature, solicited local and general adverse events (AE) on day 0-7 were reported. The solicited local symptoms include pain, induration, redness, swelling, rash, and pruritus. The solicited general adverse symptoms include allergy, fatigue, irritability, inappetence, vomiting, diarrhea, and fever. Unsolicited adverse events on day 0-30 were also reported, which include the unsolicited symptoms happened within 0-7 days, and any symptoms happened within the 8-28 days. Each AE case will be reviewed by the investigator to determine whether it was an adverse reaction (The vaccination-related AE). The incidence of adverse reactions=Number of subjects who have adverse reactions of any symptoms/number of all the subjects whose safety information are collected.</description>
