    <textblock>
      A prospective non-interventional single-centre study aimed to assess the current practice of
      non-pharmacological treatment and pharmacological therapy of overweight and obesity in
      patients with cardiovascular diseases (CVD) or with a high risk of CVD according to the
      patients' survey data
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To interview 300 patients with a body mass index (BMI) ≥25 kg / m² of the outpatient
      register, who come for a primary or secondary visit to the Center. The specifically designed
      questionnaire contains topics about patients' self-concept of their body mass; doctors'
      prescriptions of therapy for obesity, patients' adherence to recommendations.

      A repeated short telephone interview of these patients will be conducted in 1-1.5 years after
      visit inclusion to clarify the dynamics of weight and methods of its correction.
