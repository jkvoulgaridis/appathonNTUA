      This is a randomized crossover trial to evaluate acute cardiovascular responses after a Beach
      Tennis training session in hypertensive participants. The current hypothesis is that Beach
      Tennis training session will reduce ambulatory blood pressure, if compared to an usual day
      without any exercise (control session).

      Although exercise is widely recommended as a non-pharmacological therapy to reduce blood
      pressure (BP), the efficacy of sports practice in reduce BP is poorly investigated. In this
      regard, the potential anti-hypertensive effects of a Beach Tennis (BT) training session in
      reduce BP remain unclear, particularly in individuals with hypertension.

      This is a randomized crossover trial to evaluate acute cardiovascular responses after a Beach
      Tennis training session in hypertensive participants. The current hypothesis is that Beach
      Tennis training session will reduce ambulatory blood pressure, if compared to an usual day
      without any exercise (control session).

      Men and women aged between 35 and 65 years with the medical diagnosis of hypertension will
      composed the sample of this study. The primary outcome variable (i.e., 24h, daytime and
      nighttime systolic and diastolic blood pressure) will be assessed through outpatient blood
      pressure monitoring.

      The participants will perform two experimental sessions in a randomized order: a 45 min BT
      session and a 45 min control session without any exercise. A washout period of 48h-96h
      between experimental sessions will be adopted.

    <description>The Beach Tennis training session will be composed by a warm up of 5 min of BT in which technical exercises (i.e., serve, volley, forehand and backhand) will be performed After that, 3 BT small games of 12 min with a 2 minute interval between games using the conventional rules of sport will be performed. Before the session and after each small game, data regarding heart rate, blood pressure and rate perceived exertion will be recorded.</description>
