  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Smokers living with HIV represent a major health disparity population in the United States
      and the world more generally. Major contributing factors to the maintenance and relapse of
      smoking among smokers living with HIV include increased exposure to multiple stressors
      associated with HIV, which often exacerbates anxiety/depression. In a previous project, the
      feasibility, acceptability, and initial efficacy of a 9-session, cognitive-behavioral-based
      intervention to address smoking cessation by reducing anxiety and depression via specific
      emotional vulnerabilities (anxiety sensitivity, distress tolerance, and anhedonia) was tested
      against an enhanced standard of care in a pilot randomized controlled trial (NCT01393301). It
      was found that when compared to a brief enhanced treatment as usual control, patients in the
      intervention achieved higher short-term and long-term smoking abstinence rates. In this
      project, the investigators seek to test this same intervention in a fully powered, 3-arm
      efficacy/effectiveness trial. The goal of this study is to randomize 180 smokers across three
      sites to test the efficacy/effectiveness of the intervention at increasing point prevalence
      abstinence by reducing anxiety and depression at a 1-month follow-up (the end of treatment
      timepoint/ approximately 1-month post quit day) and a 6-month follow-up (approximately
      6-months post quit day).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although the prevalence of smoking has declined over the past 50 years, large disparities in
      tobacco use remain across several subgroups, particularly disadvantaged and health
      compromised populations. In fact, the initiation and maintenance of smoking is twice as
      likely for individuals living with HIV than individuals not living with HIV. Smokers living
      with HIV represent a major health disparity population in the United States (US) and the
      world more generally, and their unique healthcare needs are not being adequately addressed.
      For people living with HIV, smoking is related to poorer survival, and among those who are
      adherent to their antiretroviral treatment regimens, smoking reduces life expectancy more
      than HIV. A major contributing factor to the maintenance and relapse of smoking among smokers
      living with HIV is the increased exposure to multiple stressors associated with HIV (e.g.,
      compromised health status, stigma, cognitive impairment), which in turn, contributes to
      heightened anxiety/depression. Further, smokers living with HIV tend to rely on smoking to
      regulate their negative mood. As a result, smokers living with HIV require specialty care
      options that address their unique 'affective needs.' The proposed intervention is informed by
      the success of a recently completed research project (NCT01393301) in which the feasibility
      and acceptability of a 9-session, cognitive-behavioral therapy-based intervention to address
      smoking cessation and symptoms of anxiety and depression by targeting common processes
      underlying anxiety/depression (distress intolerance, anxiety sensitivity, anhedonia) was
      tested in a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) against an enhanced treatment as usual
      condition. Investigators named this intervention &quot;QUIT&quot;. In the pilot RCT, smoking abstinence
      was significantly higher in the intervention than in the standard of care control at both the
      1-month follow-up (the end-of-treatment timepoint) and the 6-month follow-up, and anxiety and
      depressive symptom severity was lower in the intervention condition than the control
      condition at the same timepoints. The present study seeks to conduct a fully powered, 3-arm
      hybrid efficacy/effectiveness trial, integrating resource utilization and cost-effectiveness
      analyses. The investigators propose to randomize 180 smokers living with HIV across three
      implementation sites. Two-fifths of the sample (n = 72) will be randomized to the QUIT
      intervention; two-fifths (n = 72) to an active, credible time-matched control (TM) and
      one-fifth (n = 36) to a standard-of-care (SOC) control. The primary outcomes of this study
      will be point prevalence abstinence at the 1-Month Follow-Up (end of treatment timepoint/
      approximately 1-month post quit day) and 6-Month Follow-Up (approximately 6-months post quit
      day). Changes in anxiety/depressive symptom severity will also be examined, and
      cost-effectiveness analyses will be conducted.

    <description>At each clinic, routine assessment of smoking status occurs at least annually for patients receiving care, but prescription for pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation and referral for behavioral smoking cessation services are rare. Patients will receive the standard of care at the clinic they attend. SOC patients will also attend the first session that participants in the other sessions receive (pre-randomization), will come to the clinic for assessment only during the weeks lining up with sessions 6-10 for the other conditions, and receive the transdermal nicotine patch for 8 weeks.</description>

    <description>QUIT is a transdiagnostic Cognitive Behavioral Therapy-based smoking cessation protocol designed to address distress intolerance, anxiety sensitivity, and anhedonia in people living with HIV who smoke. QUIT is delivered in 9 60-minute individual weekly sessions over a 10-week period. Sessions are active, with treatment components practiced within and outside of the session. Participants will also receive the transdermal nicotine patch for 8 weeks, starting when they attempt to quit smoking during week 7 of the study.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive a standard smoking cessation treatment, based on the clinical practice guidelines from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence. Treatment will be delivered in nine, 60-minute sessions over a ten-week period. The treatment is based on a treatment protocol developed and used previously by Dr. Zvolensky. Because clinical guidelines recommend that all smokers attempting to quit smoking receive pharmacotherapy, participants will also receive the transdermal nicotine patch for 8 weeks.</description>
