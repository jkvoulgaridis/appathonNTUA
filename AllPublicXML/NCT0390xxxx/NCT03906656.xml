  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, international, multi-center, open-labeled, randomized, controlled cross-over
      trial to evaluate effectiveness and benefits in patients with lower limb impairment in
      activities of daily living comparing the C-Brace microprocessor-controlled stance and swing
      orthosis to standard of care use of knee ankle foot orthosis/stance control orthoses
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After obtaining informed consent, patients will be screened. For subjects fulfilling
      inclusion/exclusion criteria, a first baseline assessment will be conducted. Within one to
      two days, a second set of baseline data will be collected for performance measures. Subjects
      will then be randomly assigned to be fitted with C-Brace or to continue wearing the current
      KAFO/SCO. After fitting, an accommodation period follows that will last up to 14 days prior
      to the initial home use. The first follow-up data collection will occur after three months of
      the initial home use period. Afterwards, the patients will cross over to KAFO/SCO or C-Brace,
      respectively. The participants who were fitted with C-Brace will cross over to KAFO/SCO and
      vice versa. Another accommodation phase will be offered for both C-Brace and KAFO/SCO wearers
      to ensure that subjects can properly use both devices before the cross-over home use period.
      The second follow-up data collection will occur after 3-months of the cross-over home use
      period. At the end of the study, the patients can choose to keep the C-Brace for up to 24
      months until reimbursement or to return to their original KAFO/SCO.

The range in score for the BBS is 0 to 56, with higher scores indicating better balance. Points for each item are deducted if the time or distance requirements are not met, the patient's performance requires supervision, or the patient requires assistance from support or examiner.</description>

    <intervention_name>C-Brace</intervention_name>
    <description>The C-Brace consists of individually fabricated thigh, calf and foot components. An ankle joint, unilateral or bilateral fitting, or an individual spring element connects the foot and calf components. The sensor system continuously measures the flexion of the knee joint and its angular acceleration. This allows the C-Brace to detect the user's current walking phase, so it can regulate the hydraulic resistances as well as control the flexion and extension of the knee joint.</description>
