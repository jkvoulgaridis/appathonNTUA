      This research study is studying endostar in combination with chemotherapy as a possible
      treatment for HER-2 negative advanced breast cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center phase II open label single-arm study to assess the safety and efficacy
      of endostar in combination with chemotherapy for patients with locoregionally recurrent or
      metastatic HER-2 negative breast cancer.

      Endostar is an anti-angiogenesis drug. It is prepared by adding 9 amino acids to the
      N-terminal of the peptide chain on the basis of endostatin. Studies have shown that there may
      be a synergistic effect between endostar and chemotherapeutic agents.
