  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Evidence-based interventions using cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and self-management
      education have been demonstrated to effectively treat symptoms of depression and improve the
      quality of life in populations with chronic illness. Research indicates that CBT is the most
      effective psychosocial treatment for depression; as effective as pharmacotherapy and as
      effective as adding another medication for patients who do not respond to one antidepressant
      alone. Despite the existence of proven efficacious treatments for depression, however, fewer
      than half of patients for whom depression treatment is indicated receive the services they
      need. Access barriers (i.e., transportation, insurance coverage), limited clinician
      availability (i.e., long waitlists, difficulty finding a provider), and competing (and
      time-consuming) medical priorities contribute to inadequate depression treatment for
      individuals with serious chronic illness. In this research the investigators will conduct a
      pilot randomized trial to compare results from implementation of two CBT strategies iHope and
      Sophie.

      A pre-implementation pilot study will be conducted with 20 adult patients diagnosed with
      advanced (Stage 3 or 4) cancer who screen positive for moderate depression and are receiving
      care at the Solomont Center for Hematology and Medical Oncology at Boston Medical Center
      (BMC) with the following specific aims:

        1. Using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) as a guide, design a
           pilot implementation strategy for introducing the Sophie CBT system and iHope system
           into the clinical context of care (Months 1-4)

        2. Conduct a pre-implementation pilot study with randomization of 20 cancer patients who
           screen positive for depression and/or anxiety into two arms with Sophie CBT or iHope
           telemedicine (10 participants each) to: a) assess the feasibility, acceptability, and
           appropriateness of implementing the Sophie CBT and iHope interventions in an ambulatory
           cancer treatment center and b) evaluate the potential impact of the Sophie CBT and iHope
           interventions on measures of depression, anxiety, coping, and quality of life for cancer
           patients with comorbid depression (Months 5-10)

    <time_frame>baseline, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in depressive symptoms will be measured using the PHQ-8, which is an 8-item scale with scores ranging from 0 to 24, with higher scores indicative of more depressive symptoms</description>

    <description>The Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7) will be used to assess changes in anxiety. The GAD-7 is a 7-item questionnaire that asks how often an individual has been bothered by a given item over the last 2 weeks. Scores range from 0 (&quot;not at all&quot;) to 3 (&quot;nearly every day.&quot;) A higher overall score indicates a greater level of anxiety.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in coping will be assessed using the Ways of Coping scale which is a 66 item scale with potential responses from 1 to 4, with higher scores indicative of more frequent use of a particular strategy.</description>
