      This randomized trial will evaluate the effect of adding auriculotherapy (i.e. acupuncture
      applied to the ear) using either gold beads or Pyonex needles in addition to usual care for
      the relief of pain and anxiety during medication abortion. The control group will receive
      placebo auriculotherapy plus usual care. Participants will receive the assigned treatment
      immediately after they receive their initial abortion medication. The investigators will
      assess pain and anxiety via text message once daily for four days, and in person at a
      one-week follow-up visit.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most women undergoing medication abortion with mifepristone and misoprostol report moderate
      to severe pain, despite treatment with ibuprofen or opioids. In 2018 National Academies of
      Sciences, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM) recommended research to improve pain relief.
      Limited data indicate that acupuncture is valuable for dysmenorrhea and for labor pain,
      conditions in which pain may be similar to that experienced during medication abortion. This
      randomized trial will recruit women seeking medication abortion after they have completed
      their routine clinical assessment and after they have received mifepristone. This study will
      evaluate two types of auriculotherapy applied to selected acupoints on the external ear. The
      study treatments are acupuncture using Pyonex needles and acupressure using gold pellets;
      both are applied to the ear using adhesive disks. A control group will receive the adhesive
      disks alone. All participants will receive usual medication abortion care, including taking
      misoprostol 1-3 days after mifepristone and ibuprofen for pain management. The investigators
      will query the participants regarding pain and anxiety. Follow-up will end at the time of the
      usual clinical follow-up about one week after mifepristone administration.

    <primary_purpose>Supportive Care</primary_purpose>
    <masking>Quadruple (Participant, Care Provider, Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>A separate investigator will apply the intervention after the initial usual care is complete and participants will go home using the intervention; thus the care provider will not be aware of the treatment. The adhesive disks appear similar for the treatments and the placebo arm; thus the participants will be unaware of their treatment assignment. The research assistant collecting the outcomes data will not know which treatment arm the participant belongs to. Finally, treatment assignment will be coded in the study database until analysis is complete, so that the investigator will be unaware of the treatment assignment until analysis is complete and then un-blinding will occur.</masking_description>
