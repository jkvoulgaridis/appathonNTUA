  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dialysis methods applied at the bedside and dialysis methods applied in hemodialysis unit are
      widely applied in patients with renal insufficiency. Especially hemodynamically affected
      patients are less affected by hemodynamics as a result of using dialysis methods. It is a
      completely non-invasive method by bioreactance method and it can be done to measure the
      intra-body fluid status with the help of the glued probes. The aim of this study is to
      investigate the effects of continuous venous dialysis and hemodialysis on the fluid dynamics
      applied at the bedside with bioreactance method. In this way, the patient can develop more
      comfortable hemodynamic changes. Patients in the Surgery, Reanimation and Postoperative
      Intensive Care Unit with more than 24 hours of hospitalization and bedside dialysis or
      hemodialysis will be included in the study. Before the dialysis, body fluid measurements will
      be made with bioreactance, and after dialysis in patients receiving hemodialysis, and in
      dialysis patients 6, 12, 24 and 36 hours.

      Dialysis methods applied at the bedside and dialysis methods applied in hemodialysis unit are
      widely applied in patients with renal insufficiency. Especially hemodynamically affected
      patients are less affected by hemodynamics as a result of using dialysis methods. Dialysis in
      the hemodialysis unit is a method used in intensive care patients and is preferred especially
      in patients with stable hemodynamics. In dialysis methods, changes occur frequently in the
      body fluids of the patient. It is a completely non-invasive method by bioreactance method and
      it can be done to measure the intra-body fluid status with the help of the glued probes. The
      aim of this study is to investigate the effects of continuous venous dialysis and
      hemodialysis on the fluid dynamics applied at the bedside with bioreactance method. As a
      result of measurements with buioreactans method, fluid balance in patients will be understood
      more easily. In this way, the patient can develop more comfortable hemodynamic changes.
      Patients in the Surgery, Reanimation and Postoperative Intensive Care Unit with more than 24
      hours of hospitalization and bedside dialysis or hemodialysis will be included in the study.
      Before the dialysis, body fluid measurements will be made with bioreactance, and after
      dialysis in patients receiving hemodialysis, and in dialysis patients 6, 12, 24 and 36 hours.
