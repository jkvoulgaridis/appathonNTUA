  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will analyze the germline and somatic mutations underlying the development of
      ADPKD in order to better understand the genetic mechanism responsible for the cystic
      transformation. Once identified, these mutations could help us understand better the
      mechanism leading to the development of this disease and may explain at least in part the
      phenotypic variability.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The presentation of ADPKD renal and extrarenal manifestations varies widely, even within
      families, and has been attributed to numerous genetic factors. One principal explanation came
      with the discovery that renal cyst lining cells from ADPKD patients undergo secondary somatic
      mutations, selective loss of the second copy of a respective normal polycystic kidney disease
      (PKD) gene. These somatic mutations can occur in either polycystic kidney disease 1 (PKD1) or
      polycystic kidney disease 2 (PKD2). Furthermore, various cysts in the same patient have been
      reported to harbor different somatic mutations. These findings implicated a cellular
      recessive mechanism for cyst formation in ADPKD, suggesting the possibility that the observed
      intra-familial variation in disease phenotype may, at least in part, be explained by
      variation in mutation type, the timing and number of somatic &quot;second-hit&quot; mutations in
      individual family members affected with the disease. However, there is currently very little
      known about the cellular genetic mechanism leading to cysts development and very few studies,
      addressing this issue.

      Dr. Rennert's Molecular Genetic Research laboratory personnel at the Pathology and Laboratory
      Medicine Department of Weill Cornell Medicine (WCM) will coordinate the process of sample
      handling with the surgeon.

      This study will be using native kidney tissue from ADPKD subjects received in the Surgical
      Pathology Laboratory (Starr 10), at the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine. The
      kidney tissue will be collected on the day of the native nephrectomy, following examination
      and clearance by the surgical pathologist. Immediately after the ADPKD kidney is removed, it
      will be collected in the Operating Room (OR) using a sterile container and a co-investigator
      will deliver the specimen to Surgical Pathology.

  <eligibility>
    <study_pop>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria include patients with a diagnosis of end-stage renal disease caused by
        ADPKD who are scheduled for native nephrectomy. The clinical indications for native
        nephrectomy will be determined by the surgeon prior to enrollment of the subject. These
        patients will be identified during the pre-operative evaluation that occurs prior to the
        surgery. At the time of this evaluation, subject eligibility will be assessed by a
        co-investigator and their willingness to participate will be evaluated. Subjects who agree
        to participate will provide informed consent, and blood samples (30 mL) will be obtained
        for extraction of nucleic acids, in addition to the routine preoperative blood tests.
