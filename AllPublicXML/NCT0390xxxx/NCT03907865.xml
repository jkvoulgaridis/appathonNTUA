  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dry eye disease (DED) is a highly prevalent ocular condition and induces a significant burden
      to the affected patients. Regardless of the underlying etiology, DED is associated with
      increased inflammation of the entire ocular surface including the adnexa, conjunctiva and
      cornea. As such, there is evidence from in vitro, animal and clinical studies that this
      inflammatory response of the ocular surface plays a pathophysiological key role in the
      development of DED. The Dry Eye Workshop 2007 (DEWS) therefore suggests the use of
      anti-inflammatory drugs such as corticosteroids, cyclosporine or others when topical
      lubricants alone are not sufficient. Recently, Softacort® eye drops containing 0.335%
      hydrocortisone have gained marketing authorization for the treatment of ocular surface
      inflammation. This formulation offers several advantages that make them potentially
      interesting for the treatment of DED. First, the formulation is preservative-free, which is
      of special importance in patients with DED, since it has been shown that preservatives are
      detrimental for the ocular surface. Further, hydrocortisone has the advantage that in
      comparison to other glucocorticoid derivatives, it features poor solubility. This means that
      corneal penetration is low, which is a desired effect in the treatment of ocular surface
      inflammation. Because of the poor penetration through thecornea, elevation of intraocular
      pressure and cataract formation, which are common side effect of corticosteroid treatment,
      have not been observed with Softacort® to date, also favoring the use of this agent in DED.
      The aim of the present study is to investigate whether treatment with Softacort® improves
      ocular surface inflammation as well as clinical signs and symptoms associated with DED in
      patients who are already taking topical lubricants for at least three months.

    <measure>Conjunctival hyperemia</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Conjunctival hyperemia will be graded according to the Efron Scale: 0=none, 1=trace, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, 4 = severe</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Corneal fluorescein staining according to the Oxford Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Minims-Fluorescein Sodium 2.0% eye drops will be used to detect corneal epithelial defects. As grading scale for corneal damage, the NEI/Industry Workshop guidelines will be used 1. The cornea will be divided into five sectors (central, superior, inferior, nasal and temporal), each of which is scored on a scale of 0-3, whereas 0 means no staining and 3 means maximum staining, with a maximal score of 15.
Corneal staining will also be graded according to the Oxford Scale (Annex II).</description>

    <measure>Tear osmolarity</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Tear film osmolarity will be measured non-invasive with a commercially available instrument (TearLab®, OcuSens Inc, San Diego, USA). The TearLab® technology uses an approach that concentrates laboratory functions on a single chip that requires less than 50 nL of tear fluid in order to measure tear osmolarity.
The system uses a handheld pen on which the ophthalmologist places the noninvasive laboratory chip test card. Then the tear sample is collected by pressing the tip of the pen towards the conjunctiva adjacent to the lower lid margin. The collection of the tear sample takes usually less than 30 seconds and is painless for the subject.</description>

    <measure>HLA-DR expression</measure>
    <time_frame>20 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>2 samples will be taken from the upper conjunctiva of the study eye using EYEPRIM™ (Opia Technologies S.A.S., Paris, France). The subject will be instructed to look down. The device will be positioned upon the conjunctiva. Then, the push-button will be pressed until the stop position is reached and then be held in this position for 2-3 seconds. Afterwards, the pressure will be released and the device will be removed from the eye. The sampling membrane will be ejected in a storage container by pressing the push-button once again. The samples will be stored according to the manufacturer's instructions and will be sent under observer blinded conditions to an independent laboratory (Iris Pharma, La Gaude, France) for analysis and assessment of HLA-DR levels.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Ocular surface disease index (OSDI©)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Symptoms of dry eye will be assessed using the Ocular Surface Disease Index© (OSDI©) which was developed by the Outcomes Research Group at Allergan Inc (Irvine, Calif)27. The questionnaire that underlies the OSDI© is specifically designed for patients with dry eye syndrome and asks patients about the frequency of specific symptoms and their impact on vision-related functioning. A sample of the OSDI© in German is given in Annex III.</description>

    <description>Intraocular pressure will be measured with a slit-lamp mounted Goldmann Applanation Tonometer.
Before each measurement one drop of oxybuprocainhydrochloride combined with sodium fluorescein will be used for local anesthesia of the cornea.</description>

    <measure>Visual analogue scale (VAS) for patient satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Patient satisfaction assessed by a VAS will be determined using a 100 mm VAS on which 0 means &quot;I do not agree&quot; and 100 means &quot;I totally agree&quot;. The following questions will be assessed using VAS: &quot;I feel satisfied using this treatment&quot; &quot;With these eye drops, I have a feeling of freshness&quot; &quot;With these eye drops, I have a feeling of relief&quot; &quot;This product contributed to reduce my pain due to eye dryness&quot; &quot;This product is comfortable&quot;</description>
