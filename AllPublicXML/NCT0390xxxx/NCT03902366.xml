  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this research project is to compare neuropsychiatric functioning,
      cortical activity, white matter integrity, and immune response among Veterans with and
      without alcohol use disorder (AUD), before and after direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy [a
      new treatment for chronic infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV)].
      Demographically-matched comparison groups of Veterans without HCV (HCV-, with and without
      AUD) will similarly be evaluated to determine the relative contribution of HCV and an HCV
      &quot;cure&quot; to outcomes putatively affected by alcohol abuse.

      Two specific aims are proposed.

      Aim 1: Determine the impact of DAA therapy and a sustained viral response on central nervous
      system (CNS) function.

      Aim 2: Evaluate the effects of AUD and unhealthy alcohol drinking on DAA therapy outcomes and
      CNS function.

      The information learned will address a critical gap in knowledge concerning the effects of
      alcohol use on DAA therapy outcomes and will help inform treatment guidelines that could be
      translated to clinical practice, such as targeted interventions to treat AUD in conjunction
      with HCV infection and follow-up strategies for patients who successfully complete DAA
      therapy but then need care for other potential CNS-related outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aim 1 will evaluate the impact of DAA therapy on CNS function in Veterans with HCV and will
      test the hypotheses that following DAA therapy and obtaining a sustained viral response [SVR;
      i.e., when the virus continues to be undetectable in blood 12 weeks (or more) after
      completing therapy], participants will show: i) improved neuropsychiatric outcomes (e.g.,
      cognitive function, fatigue, mood), as compared to baseline (pre-DAA therapy), ii) restored
      functional connectivity and disintegrity within white matter tracks that had been observed at
      baseline, and iii) reduced immune activation profiles (e.g., decreased expression of
      inflammatory biomarkers and restored T cell balance), as compared to baseline. Aim 2 will
      determine the impact of an active AUD on the neuropsychiatric, neuroimaging, and
      immunological outcomes observed in aim 1. Participants will be evaluated at two time points
      [i.e., baseline and 12 weeks post-therapy (week 24)]. Evaluations will incorporate brain
      imaging methods [i.e., resting state magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional MRI, and
      diffusion tensor imaging] along with clinical and laboratory methods to assess the
      interactive effects of alcohol use and HCV on brain function. Clinical and laboratory data
      will include: i) demographic and medical information, ii) neuropsychological measures of
      attention, memory, and executive function, iii) neuropsychiatric symptom questionnaires
      (e.g., depression and anxiety), iv) urine and oral fluid collection for medical laboratory
      tests, and v) blood sample collection for planned experiments (e.g., flow cytometry, qPCR,
      and multiplex immunoassays) and for contribution to the VA Liver Disease Repository.

      Evidence-based guidelines for the new DAA therapies are needed (e.g., How much alcohol is too
      much?). The VA is at the forefront of treating HCV and is now offering DAA therapy to all
      Veterans with HCV treated within VA health care systems. The proposed studies will address a
      critical gap in our knowledge concerning the effects of co-morbid HCV and AUD on antiviral
      therapy outcomes, particularly CNS function and neuropsychiatric symptoms that contribute to
      addiction and relapse.

      Blood specimens are collected from human subjects by study personnel or the VA phlebotomy lab
      specifically for research purposes. Research staff centrifuges the blood samples so that
      components [e.g., plasma, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)] can be collected,
      frozen, cryopreserved, and contributed to the VA Liver Disease Repository (Director: Dr.
      Lissi Hansen).

        Adult Veterans (&gt; 21 years old) who are about to initiate DAA therapy for HCV are recruited
        into two demographically matched (i.e., similar in terms of age, gender, race, and years of
        education) groups (n = 30/group): 1) adults with current alcohol use disorder (AUD+/HCV+)
        and 2) adults without current AUDs (AUD-/HCV+). Two additional groups of
        demographically-matched adults: 1) without AUD or HCV (AUD-/HCV-) (n = 30), and 2) with AUD
        and no HCV (AUD+/HCV-) will be recruited as a comparison groups to determine the relative
        contribution of a history of HCV infection to alcohol-induced brain pathology.
