  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is intended to be a single-site, prospective, randomized, double-blinded study
      that intends to enroll a total of 60 patients with severe renal impairment undergoing surgery
      with general endotracheal anesthesia at Parkland Hospital. Patients will be randomized to
      receive either neostigmine (for reversal of cisatracurium) or sugammadex (for reversal of
      rocuronium). A standardized anesthetic protocol that is usual and customary for the type of
      operation the patient is having will be provided to the anesthesia teams of enrolled
      subjects. The remainder of the anesthetic care of the subject will not deviate from the
      standard of care. All patients will be monitored with continuous pulse oximetry
      postoperatively for 24 hours.

      This will be a prospective, randomized, double-blinded study of surgical patients with severe
      renal impairment that seeks to address the following:

      Specific Aim:

      To determine whether rocuronium-induced moderate neuromuscular blockade and reversal with
      sugammadex achieves recovery of neuromuscular function (TOF ≥ 0.9) faster than reversal of
      cisatracurium-induced moderate neuromuscular blockade and reversal with neostigmine in
      patients with severe renal impairment.

      Primary Hypothesis:

      Patients with severe renal impairment who are reversed with sugammadex after rocuronium will
      achieve a TOF ≥0.9 within a time frame that is one-third of the time it takes for reversal
      with neostigmine after cisatracurium.
