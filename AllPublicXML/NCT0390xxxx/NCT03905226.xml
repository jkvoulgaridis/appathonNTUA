  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure is a chronic disease whose prevalence, due to the aging of the population, is
      increasing. In France, the prevalence of this pathology is 2.3% (it reaches 10% in the over
      75 years) and affects nearly a million patients.

      The rehospitalization of patients with heart failure affects 25% of patients within 1-3
      months of hospital discharge, and 66% at 1 year while 75% of hospitalizations are
      preventable. These readmissions result in decreased quality of life and increased mortality;
      from an economic point of view, hospitalization accounts for 70% of expenses related to the
      management of heart failure. Avoiding rehospitalization is therefore a major public health
      issue. The current predictive scores remain perfectible, even though risk factors for
      readmission have already been the subject of numerous studies. The identification of patients
      at risk of rehospitalization is still an issue, especially for patients with preserved left
      ventricular ejection fraction. Targeting patients requiring appropriate care remains an
      issue.

      The rise of innovative statistical techniques around Big Data in health opens new
      perspectives for the scientific exploitation of data available in electronic medical records,
      for example in the field of prediction. This study aims to explore the risk of
      rehospitalization in heart failure patients by analyzing routine data collected in medical
      records and by mobilizing artificial intelligence algorithms. A review of the literature
      confirms the innovative nature of such an approach: the majority of the studies identified
      implemented a prospective collection of data; only 20% of the studies mobilized the medical
      file; no French study used the new machine learning algorithms.
