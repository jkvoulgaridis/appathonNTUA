  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Among enterobacteria, the production of ESBL is the first cause of multidrug resistance. The
      first cases of ESBL-producing enterobacteriaceae (EBLSE) infections were described during the
      1980s and subsequently experienced global spread. Since the beginning of the century, the
      prevalence of EBLSE infections, especially among E. coli and K. pneumoniae, has increased
      dramatically. The emergence of multidrug-resistant enterobacteria is currently posing a real
      public health problem. The European antimicrobial resistance surveillance network evaluated,
      among clinical strains, the resistance rate for 3rd generation cephalosporins (C3G) at 9.5%
      for Escherichia coli and 28% for Klebsiella pneumoniae. The consequences of
      multidrug-resistant enterobacterial infections, which are mainly represented by ESBLs, are
      currently well known, both from the individual point of view (increase in mortality and
      length of hospital stay) and collective (increase of costs of care).

      Data from the literature reveal an increased risk of ESBL bacteremia in patients with rectal
      carriage of ESBL-producing enterobacteria. The study by Goulenok et al. found as a risk
      factor for EBLSE bacteremia in patients known to be carriers at the rectal level the
      existence of antibiotic selection pressure and the presence of a urinary catheter. Woerther
      et al. have explained in their work that the digestive microbiota confers resistance to
      colonization by BMR. The impact of antibiotics on the latter leads to a probable rupture of
      this barrier and a loss of this resistance to colonization. In addition, each antibiotherapy
      does not impact the digestive microbiota equally and it seems that antibiotics with high
      anti-anaerobic activity or high biliary elimination are the most impacting. It is therefore
      essential, at a time of multidrug resistance, to focus on the influence of antibiotics on the
      digestive microbiota and the emergence and carriage of BMR.

      Ceftriaxone and cefotaxime are two injectable injectable third-generation cephalosporins
      (C3G) commonly used in clinical practice. Despite their similar spectrum of action, it should
      be noted that they have substantially different pharmacokinetic properties, especially with
      regard to their half-life and their elimination routes (mainly urinary for cefotaxime, mixed:
      biliary and urinary for ceftriaxone). Some works have already been interested in this topic.
      Grohs et al. carried out a comparative study between ceftriaxone and cefotaxime on the
      emergence of AmpC hyperproducing enterobacteria (HL-CASE). This single-site study
      demonstrated that, at a hospital level, the preferential use of cefotaxime rather than
      ceftriaxone had collective and ecological benefits at the service level. Indeed, their
      results conclude that resistance development is weaker, as well as more limited carriage of
      HL-CASE Enterobacterial strains by replacing ceftriaxone with cefotaxime. It should be noted,
      however, that the modification of prescribing practices of C3G has been coupled with various
      measures to limit the emergence of AmpC hyperproductive enterobacteria (reinforcement of
      hygiene rules, awareness of the health care team at EBLSE, control of antibiotic ...).

      In a context where the emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria continues to increase, it
      seems appropriate to conduct a study to compare the impact of the use of ceftriaxone or
      cefotaxime on the emergence of BMR at the individual level. In the absence of a study clearly
      establishing the link between C3G types (ceftriaxone, cefotaxime) and the emergence of BMR
      and in line with the above research, this study aims to compare the microbiological impact of
      the use of either of these two C3Gs (in terms of emergence of bacterial resistance and impact
      on the diversity and quantity of digestive digestive bacteria). The study will have two
      periods: Period 1 during which patients hospitalized in the emergency department or in
      internal medicine and receiving C3G antibiotics will receive ceftriaxone, and the period 2
      during which cefotaxime is cephalosporin used in first intention in these same patients.

      Thus, this research project, by focusing on these 5 parameters in patients treated with
      ceftriaxone or cefotaxime, should make it possible to prove the influence of these
      antibiotherapies on the carriage of BMR (deleterious action on the diversity and the quantity
      of the intestinal bacterial flora, resulting in an increase in the relative fecal abundance
      of these BMRs promoting their carriage). In addition, the hypothesis is that, contrary to
      current data, cefotaxime is found at sufficiently high concentrations in the feces to have an
      impact on the microbiota equivalent to that of ceftriaxone, despite less significant biliary
      elimination.

      This study therefore aims to compare their impacts on the microbiota and in particular on the
      emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria (BMR) and enteropathogens such as Clostridium
      difficile.

    <description>Patients with C3G antibiotic therapy will receive cefotaxime. On the day of inclusion (T0, + 24 hours), a stool culture is performed on the first stool issued after the start of antibiotic therapy to detect BMR carriage and to evaluate the initial flora and fecal abundance initial relative in culturable multiresistant bacteria. In the absence of stool emission by the patient, an eswab rectal swab will be performed.
72 hours (± 24 hours, T1) after the start of antibiotic therapy, a stool sample will be taken and at the end of antibiotic therapy (+ 24 hours, T2) or during the oral relay to evaluate the modification of the initial flora and the relative fecal abundance of culturable multiresistant bacteria. In the case of &quot;normal&quot; transit (daily bowel movement), the bowel movement 72 hours after the start of antibiotic therapy will be analyzed. In the absence of stool emission by the patient, an eswab rectal swab will be performed.</description>
