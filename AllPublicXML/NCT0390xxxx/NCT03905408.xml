      The investigators will define the most appropriate safe dose of D50 to heal air leaks in
      patients that have undergone lung resection surgery (Phase I study). Air leaks from unhealed
      lung tissue are one of the most common complications after lung surgery including wedge
      resection, segmentectomy and lobectomy. Air leaks can lead to a delay in chest tube removal,
      prolonged pain, increased infections, prolonged hospital stay, and increased costs to the
      health care system. Different agents have been used to heal air leaks by creating a
      pleurodesis (adhesions to obliterate the pleural space between the visceral and parietal
      pleura). The success with these agents has been variable and come with the cost of
      complications that have restricted their use the post-operative period. There has been recent
      interest in the use of 50% hypertonic glucose (D50) to create pleurodesis with encouraging
      reports coming mostly from Asia. The investigators have performed a pilot study using 180 mL
      of D50 instilled through the chest tube for the management of post lobectomy air leak with
      very encouraging results. This preliminary study used strict inclusion criteria of only
      lobectomy patients and excluded all patients with known diabetes or any postoperative
      hyperglycemia. It is unknown if these patients would have benefitted from D50. Also, the
      optimal dose of D50 was chosen empirically and never clearly defined by previous work. It has
      been reported that high doses of D50 have been associated with acute lung injury. It is
      therefore critical that the optimal safe dose is clarified.
