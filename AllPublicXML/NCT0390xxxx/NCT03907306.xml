      This study will include patients with 3-4 stage hemorrhoids. They will undergo an operation
      of open hemorrhoidectomy. Patients will be divided into a study group and a control group.
      Study group patients during a post-operation period except a standard treatment (antiseptic
      solutions and antibacterial and wound healing ointments) of a post-operation wound will be
      treated with cold argon plasma. Control group patients will be treated with a standard
      treatment. Wound healing speed will be researched.

    <description>Total wound healing will be assessed with the help of cytological and macroscopic methods.In the cytological method the presence of fibroblasts, mature epithelial cells, scar tissue formation and the absence of inflammation will be the criterion of wound healing, as well as the presence of macroscopic features of wound epithelialization.</description>

    <description>The measurement of a wound area is committed on the 2nd, 8th, 14th, 21nd and 30th day after operation. By means of the mathematical formulas the wound healing speed will be defined. The wound process will be researched with the help of cytological method. The wound prints will be taken on the 2nd, 8th, 14th, 21nd and 30th day after operation. Microbiological research of a wound will be held on the 2nd, 8th, 14th, 21nd and 30th day after operation (in study groups before and after the usage of CAP, in control groups once). The pain assessment will be measured by a visual analogue scale on the 2nd, 3rd,4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 14th, 21nd and 30th day after operation. The life quality will be researched by means of Health Status Survey on the 8th and 30th day before operation.</description>
