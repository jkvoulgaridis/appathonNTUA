  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Uterine contraction has a negative impact on implantation and pregnancy rates. Inhibition of
      oxytocin receptors decreases uterine contraction frequency both on pregnant and non-pregnant
      women. Atosiban has been studied as an oxytocin antagonist to decrease uterine contraction
      frequency in order to increase implantation and pregnancy rates in assisted reproduction.
      Previous studies have studied 37,5mg total dose which was used both before and during embryo
      transfer, and found atosiban to be effective in increasing implantation and pregnancy rates.
      We aim to use a single dose of 6,75mg atosiban before embryo transfer, in order to decrease
      the dose and cost and possibly introduce a simpler protocol. Our study will also be the first
      randomized clinical study which investigates the effect of atosiban on frozen-thawed embryo
      transfer cycles.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inhibition of uterine contractions in order to increase implantation rates have been studied
      on several agents in the last two decades. Beta-adrenergic agonists and non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs have been shown to have no benefit on implantation rates. Vasopressin
      V1a and oxytocin receptor antagonist atosiban was first studied on premature labor patients
      and found to be effective.

      Endometrium-originated oxytocin can possibly stimulate myometrium and have a negative impact
      on embryo implantation. Inhibition of oxytocin receptors has been shown to reduce uterine
      contraction frequency in non-pregnant women. Atosiban has been studied on assisted
      reproductive technologies in the last decade and has been shown to be effective on increasing
      implantation and clinical pregnancy rates. However, previous studies have used a 37,5 mg
      total dose of atosiban which was used both before and during embryo transfer. We aim to use a
      single and low dose of 6,75mg atosiban only before embryo transfer, which is simpler and
      cheaper and the medication given to patient is significantly lower. If we can demostrate the
      positive effect of our protocol, it can be suggested to be used routinely in all in vitro
      fertilization cycles. Additionally, our study is an original study in terms of being the
      first randomized clinical trial studying the effect of atosiban on frozen-thawed embryo
      transfer cycles.
