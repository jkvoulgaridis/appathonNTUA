      Objective: the objective of the present randomized clinical trial is to compare changes in
      radiographic peri-implant bone defect fill after regeneration of peri-implant intrabony
      defects with a submerged versus a non-submerged protocol.

      Material and Methods: this project is a randomized controlled clinical trial, double blind,
      with a parallel groups design. Thirty-six patients presenting with peri-implantitis
      subsidiary of regenerative treatment will be recruited. After subjects have been given
      informed consent, they will be randomized to test or control group. All patients will undergo
      a session of non-surgical peri-implantitis therapy consisting on prostheses removal and
      implant debridement with ultrasounds, curettes and air-abrasive under local anaesthesia.
      Patients in test group will have their prostheses removed and the mucosa surrounding the
      affected implants will be let heal covering the implants, while patients in control group
      will have their prostheses installed again after the non-surgical therapy. Six to eight weeks
      later, all subjects will undergo regenerative treatment with the use of a bone substitute, a
      collagen membrane and fixation pins, and in control group tissues will heal following the
      non-submerged protocol, meanwhile subjects in test group will undergo submerged healing. Six
      months later, subjects in test group will have their prostheses reconnected to the
      regenerated implants. All patients will undergo periodontal and peri-implant maintenance
      therapy every three months during follow-up. Radiographic assessment of vertical bone level
      changes (primary outcome), clinical status of peri-implant tissues, changes in soft tissues
      margin, patient related outcomes and adverse events will be assessed at 3, 6 and 12 months
      after peri-implantitis regenerative surgery.
