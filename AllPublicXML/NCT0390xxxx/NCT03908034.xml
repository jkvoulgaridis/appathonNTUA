  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine (1) how the causal structure of a disease influences
      people's disease prevention decisions; and (2) how the causal structure of a disease
      interacts with people's regret anticipation in determining their disease prevention
      decisions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People sometimes have to deliberate on whether or not to remove a risk factor that may
      potentially cause a disease in the future. When a controllable risk factor (say, X) is the
      only factor that causes a disease, the decision to remove it may simply depend on the
      probabilistic relationship between X and an outcome, as well as the cost of removing X.
      However, little is known when other factors that are out of the decision-maker's control are
      also present. The main question being asked here is how does the presence of such
      uncontrollable factors change people's decision to remove X.

      Specifically, the investigators consider two cases: a disease caused by a single controllable
      risk factor (say X) and a disease caused by two risk factors -- a controllable factor (X) and
      an uncontrollable factor (Y). In both cases, the removal of X can result in a meaningful
      reduction in overall disease risk. It is hypothesized that even when the magnitude of overall
      risk reduction brought by the removal of X is the same in the two cases, people would have a
      lower motivation to remove X in the latter case.

      The investigators also examine how the presence of an uncontrollable risk factor interacts
      with the respondents' regret anticipation to influence their decision to remove X. In the
      context of the current research, regret anticipation could take one of the following forms:
      (a) feel regretful if one decides not to remove X and later develops the disease (b) feel
      regretful if one decides to remove X but still develops the disease. The investigators expect
      (a) to moderate the effect of uncontrollable risk factor on motivation to remove X.

    <intervention_model_description>The study has a 2 (presence of uncontrollable factor: yes vs. no) ✕ 2 (Anticipated regret induction: yes vs. no) between-subject design. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the 4 between-subject conditions.
There is also a within-subject variable. Each subject will respond to 10 rounds of decision task with 5 different levels of overall disease risk reduction brought by the removal of X. The 5 levels of risk reduction are: (i) Removal of X reduces disease risk from 60% to 50% ; (ii) 60% to 40%; (iii) 60% to 30%; (iv) 60% to 20%; (v) 60% to 10%.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The experiment comprises 10 rounds of decision tasks. For each round, the participant begins with having 130 points, each worth $0.5 (Hong Kong dollars). Different numbers of points are deducted depending on the outcome in each round. After the 10 rounds, the computer randomly selects 1 of the rounds and the points from this round is paid in cash.
There is a chance for the participant to develop a disease. Without prevention, the chance of getting the disease is 60%. A cause, X, is identified for the disease. The participant has to decide whether or not to remove X. Removal of X reduces disease chance; the reduced chance varies between 10% and 50% across the 10 rounds and the exact level is communicated at the beginning of each round. The removal of X costs 30 points. Whether s/he ends up developing the disease or not is determined by a computerized lottery based on these chances. If s/he develops the disease, s/he will lose 100 points.</description>
