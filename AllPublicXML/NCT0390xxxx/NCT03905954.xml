  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease leads to loss of employment on average within less than 10 years of
      disease onset and has been found to be associated with an increased absence from work. This
      combined with hospitalisation; use of secondary health services; drug usage; and caregivers
      needing to give up work contributed to the costs associated with the conditions. It has been
      estimated that early support for working age newly diagnosed would cost the government about
      1.5 million Euro in the UK but might lead to a potential cost saving of over half a billion
      over 5 years.

      The study will explore the impact of a Parkinson diagnosis on employment. The study will be
      survey based and will include demographic questions: age, age at diagnosis of PD, educational
      level, and Nationality; questions pertaining to employment type, history, and reasons for
      leaving if this happened; and also general health.
