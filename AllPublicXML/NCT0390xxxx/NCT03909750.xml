    <textblock>
      Pulmonary Disorders are often categorized as Obstructive or Restrictive disorders. This study
      will establish two channels of investigation, one group within each type of pulmonary
      dysfunction. State-of-the-Art Objective analytics will be employed to track patients from
      baseline and 6 month intervals for up to one year.

      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a lung-related disorder that is characterized
      by long-term, often progressive state of poor airflow. Primary symptoms include low oxygen
      tension, shortness of breath, productive cough, and broncho-pulmonary inflammation and
      interference with oxygen-carbon dioxide exchange. COPD is generally considered those who are
      able to better inspire air than to expel. Restrictive lung dysfunctions are generally
      considered those who are unable to achieve full inspiration function. Both can create some of
      the same symptoms, low Oxygen exchange, activity intolerance of exertion, shortness of breath
      (SOB), Pulmonary Hypertension, Loss of lung structure, Pneumothorax (in emphysema), may
      mandate supplemental Oxygen therapy, failure of airway mucus management (chronic bronchitis,
      bronchiectasis, etc), and other failure of lung function issues.

      Restrictive lung disorders represent a group of pulmonary function losses which are due to
      acquired fibrosis, congenital fibrotic disorders, functional airway damage (scarring),
      vascular abnormalities in arterial/venous supply,

      Air pollution and tobacco smoking, chemical inhalation damage, etc. are felt to be common
      contributor of these issues. Diagnostic testing is based on poor airflow measured by lung
      function studies and whose symptoms do not improve much with anti-asthma bronchodilators,
      steroids, and a variety of combination of topical medications.

      Study is an interventional study to document the safety and efficacy of use of cSVF in
      chronic broncho-pulmonary disease within both groups.

    <textblock>
      Pulmonary Disorders, including both COPD &amp; Restrictive Lung Disease (RLD) are often treated
      by limiting exposure to poor air quality, but there is no cure at this time. Most commonly,
      the patients are treated upon exacerbations, usually with some combination of inhalers,
      steroids, and medications which have proven to be ineffective other than addressing symptoms
      and trying to return to baseline symptom help. In addition, many attempted efforts are aimed
      at environmental changes, therapy include smoking cessation, vaccinations, respiratory
      rehabilitation, and attempts of use of bronchodilators and topical and systemic steroids.
      Many must resort to supplemental oxygen therapy, lung transplantation, and antibiotic
      supportive therapy during exacerbations.

      As of 2013, COPD involve approximately 5% of the global populations (approximately 330
      million). Most commonly it occurs approximately equally between men/women and result in about
      3 million deaths per year. Estimates of economic costs are estimated to be more than 2.1
      trillion dollars in 2010.

      This study includes microcannula harvesting of subdermal adipose tissues, incubation,
      digestion and isolation of AD-cSVF. This stromal cellular pellet (without actual
      extracellular matrix or stromal elements) is then suspended in 500 cc sterile Normal Saline
      (NS) and deployed via peripheral intravenous route. Evaluations of safety issues are measured
      at intervals (both severe and non-severe categories) and by repeated pulmonary function
      studies.

      Most pulmonary function tests are, at best some help, but there is now a remarkable testing
      that is substantially more informative than standard flow measurements, as they include
      extensive anatomical and functional insights using High Resolution Computerized Tomography
      (HRCT) Lung. This protocol allows for direct evidence of the air trapping, lung volume
      capabilities, and three dimensional imaging of the airways and lungs themselves. This
      modality will be the primary comparative between baseline and 6 month post-therapy in
      determination of the status and changes than can be demonstrated following use of cellular
      stromal vascular fraction (cSVF). After isolation and concentration of the stem/stromal cells
      via digestive processing, deployment of such cellular elements are believed to engraft within
      the lung capillary tissues. Engraftment is not currently believed to be the primary elements
      following parenteral (IV) placement. Rather, it is believed to represent the paracrine
      secretory and communication between cell-to-cell or cell-to-matrix which communicates via
      exosomal and microvesicular contents that are released to influence the local niche
      (microenvironment). Via transfer of microRNA (mRNA) or mitoRNA (miRNA), stem cells are able
      to help other pulmonary cells replace or repair damaged elements associated with lung
      disorders. Further, these secretions and growth factor/cytokines availability have a positive
      influence on the small capillaries within the lung parenchyma, thereby likely to improve the
      gas exchange function within the lungs.

      Tracking of oxygen saturation (at rest and activity), use of inhalers or other rescue effort
      reduction, reduction of oxygen supplement, and improved respiratory efforts will be
      performed.
