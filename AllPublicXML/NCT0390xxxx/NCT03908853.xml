  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to describe and quantify pain related to metastatic bone disease. The study
      will include 50 subjects with disseminated breast cancer and 20 healthy subjects. The pain
      will be described and quantified through (1) pain specific questionnaires, (2) quantitative
      sensory testing that assess sensory changes to cold, heat and mechanical stimulation of the
      skin overlying the metastatic site, and (3) conditioned pain modulation that investigates
      impairment of the endogenous inhibitory pain pathway in humans.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancer patients in palliative care point to pain as their most important and most feared
      symptom. Bone metastases are a common cause of cancer pain, and the patients are prone to
      transient severe pain exacerbations (breakthrough pain), which can occur spontaneously or be
      triggered by movement. Patients with bone metastases experience pain of such high intensity,
      that it affects not only physical activity, but also sleep, mood and social relations. This
      results in poor quality of life for the patients and poses an increasing clinical and
      socio-economical problem. The pain is difficult to treat and often requires high opioid doses
      which results in unacceptable adverse effects, and there is an unmet need of novel
      therapeutic options and treatment strategies.

      Animal models of cancer-induced bone pain have suggested that pain arising from metastatic
      bone disease involve neuropathic and nociceptive pain mechanisms and, importantly, mechanisms
      that are specific to cancer-induced bone pain. Significant neuronal sprouting can occur at
      the metastatic site, and the inherent pain control system is found altered in animal models
      of cancer-induced bone pain; a system that can be exploited for treatment strategies and in
      the development of new analgesia. Yet, it is not known how the pre-clinical findings
      translate to patients.

      Quantitative sensory testing is a psychophysical method that uses a battery of sensory
      stimuli with predetermined physical properties, thus allowing the capture and quantification
      of stimulus-evoked negative and positive sensory phenomena in humans. Conditioned pain
      modulation is a psychophysical experimental measure of the endogenous pain inhibitory pathway
      in humans, which can be used to detect an impairment of the descending inhibitory pain
      pathway.

      This study aims to perform pain phenotyping of patients suffering from cancer-induced bone
      pain, through pain specific questionnaires, quantitative sensory testing and conditioned pain
      modulation.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Conditioned pain modulation (CPM) determined by cuff pressure algometry</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>CPM will be determined by placing two inflatable cuffs around the lower legs; one providing a test stimulus and the other a conditioning stimulus. First, the pressure pain detection and tolerance thresholds (kPa) are determined on each lower leg using an increasing pressure of 1 kPa/s; next a constant conditioning stimulus is applied to the dominant lower leg and 10 seconds later the pain pressure detection and tolerance threshold (kPa) are simultaneously determined on the non-dominant leg. The CPM effect is assessed as the percent difference between the measured thresholds on the non-dominant lower leg.</description>

    <measure>Questionnaire - The Short Form Brief Pain Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The short form Brief Pain Inventory measures pain intensity, localization of pain and influence on daily activities and quality of life through 9 items. All items cover the last 24 hours.
Measurement of worst, least, average and current pain on a scale from 0-10, where 0 equals &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 equals &quot;pain as bad as you can imagine&quot;; the measures are used individually or combined into a mean severity score.
Determination of pain localization using a pain drawing (human figure); the information is used qualitatively.
Determination of pain relief on a scale from 0-100%. Measurement of how much pain interferes with daily activities, including general activity, walking, work, mood, enjoyment of life, relations with others, and sleep; the measurement is done on a scale from 0-10, where 0 equals &quot;does no interference&quot; and 10 equals &quot;completely interferes&quot;; the seven interference items are combined into a mean score.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Questionnaire - PainDETECT</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Screens for neuropathic pain components through 13 items. Measurement of current, strongest and average pain within the last 4 weeks on a scale from 0-10, 0 equals &quot;none&quot; and 10 equals &quot;maximal&quot;; the measures are used individually.
Marking of pain pattern (persistent, fluctuating) according to 4 pictures; a score from -1 to +1 is given depending on pain pattern.
Determination of pain localization using a pain drawing and indication of pain radiating to other body regions; radiating pain will give a score of +2.
Determination of the sensation of the pain (e.g. burning, prickling, numbness) using 7 items; the scale includes the following choices resulting in the indicated scores; never (0), hardly noticed (+1), slightly (+2), moderately (+3), strongly (+4), and very strongly (+5).
The total score is calculated (ranging from 0-38) and the number used to determine the likelihood of a neuropathic pain component with 0-12 resulting in negative, 13-18 unclear and 19-30 positive.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Questionnaire - The Breakthrough Pain Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The Breakthrough Pain Questionnaire is used to assess breakthrough pain intensity, frequency, duration, and triggering and relieving factors through 9 items. The obtained measures are used individually and some only qualitatively.
Measurement of average background and breakthrough pain within the last 24 hours on a scale from 0-10, where 0 equals &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 equals &quot;worst pain imaginable&quot;.
Indication of breakthrough pain episodes within the last 24 hours. Indication of average duration of breakthrough pain episodes using six time intervals ranging from &quot;less than one minute&quot; to &quot;more than 120 minutes&quot;; indication of the time from onset to peak pain using five time intervals ranging from &quot;less than 10 seconds&quot; to &quot;31-60 minutes&quot;; and indication of the predictability of breakthrough pain episodes ranging from &quot;never&quot; to &quot;always&quot;.

    <measure>Questionnaire - Pain Catastrophizing Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The Pain Catastrophizing Scale assess catastrophising related to pain experience through 13 items.
The subject evaluates 13 statements describing thoughts and feelings that may be associated to pain, e.g. &quot;I feel I can't go on&quot; and &quot;I keep thinking of other painful events&quot;, and indicates the degree to which she has these thoughts when experiencing pain. The scale for all items includes the following choices resulting in the scores indicated in brackets; not at all (0), to a slight degree (+1), to a moderate degree (+2), to a great degree (+3), and all the time (+4).
The total score is calculated (ranging from 0-52) with a score of 30 or more representing a clinically relevant level of catastrophizing. Three subscales can be calculated: rumination (sum of four items), magnification (sum of three items), and helplessness (sum of six items), with cut-off scores of for clinically relevant levels at 11, 5 and 13, respectively.</description>
