      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability, and maximal tolerated
      dose (MTD) of the combination of Abemaciclib and Sunitinib administered orally in patients
      with advanced and metastatic renal cell carcinoma. This study consists of two parts: Dose
      Escalation and Dose Expansion. During the dose escalation phase, participants will be
      sequentially enrolled in a standard 3 x 3 dose escalation study design to receive oral
      Abemaciclib in Combination with Sunitinib. The purpose of this dose escalation is to
      determine the maximal tolerated dose based on assessment of any dose limiting toxicity. The
      Dose Expansion Phase will enroll additional participants at the established maximal tolerated
      dose to further evaluate safety, tolerability, as well as the pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics of this combination drug regimen.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) accounted for about 64, 000 new cancer diagnoses in the USA in
      2018. Up to 30% of those diagnoses will be patients with metastatic disease. Additionally, up
      to 50% of patients who undergo partial or radical nephrectomy will develop metastatic
      disease.. There is no cure for metastatic RCC, thus, metastatic RCC represents a significant
      cancer burden. Numerous directed therapies are available to improve overall survival but
      these do not result in durable complete responses. However, recent pre-clinical studies of
      RCC have demonstrated that Abemaciclib, a CDK4/6 and PIM1 kinase inhibitor, induces rapid,
      dramatic, and sustained tumor regression when used in combination with Sunitinib.

      Our objectives for this study are as follows:

      Primary Objectives:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of
           the combination of Abemaciclib with Sunitinib for patients with metastatic renal cell
           carcinoma. Additionally, determine pharmacokinetics (serum trough levels) of Abemaciclib
           and Sunitinib at steady state.

        -  Continued safety assessment of the combination of Abemaciclib and Sunitinib at the
           established maximum tolerated dose (i.e. the recommended Phase II dose)

      Secondary Objectives:

      Determine any anti-tumor activity in the dose expansion phase of the study. Tumor related
      activity will be assessed by:

        -  Length of progression free survival

        -  Disease response rate

        -  Time to disease response

        -  Disease control rate

        -  Duration of response

        -  Overall survival and progression free survival

    <intervention_model_description>This is a single-arm, non-randomized prospective phase Ib study with expansion. The goal is to determine the maximal tolerated dose by assessing dose limiting toxicities. A classic &quot;3+3&quot; design is used. There are a total of 3 dose levels (level -1, 1, and 2) with dose level 1 as the starting dose. Once the maximum tolerated dose is established, a cohort of an additional 10 subjects will be enrolled at the established dose.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>For the dose escalation phase, Subjects will receive a 21-day cycle of continuous oral daily Sunitinib in combination with Abemaciclib every 12 hours for 14 days followed by 7 days off. Using a traditional 3 x 3 study design assessing dose limiting toxicity, if the initial prescribed dosing of these 2 medications (Dose Level 1) is tolerated by the first 3 subjects, the study will pause for a 30 day time period between cohorts to assess toxicity. If no dose limiting toxicity is identified, the next cohort of 3 new subjects will be treated at the next higher dose level (Dose Level 2). If the original cohort treated at Dose Level 1 do not tolerate the combination of medications, the medication regimen will be modified to a lower dose (Dose Level - 1). A dose expansion phase is included which will evaluate the combination of Abemaciclib in combination with Sunitinib when given at the maximum tolerated dose as determined from the from dose escalation phase.</description>
