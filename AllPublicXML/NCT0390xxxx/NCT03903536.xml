    <textblock>
      The primary aim of the current study is to evaluate and compare 6-month complication rates
      after thrombectomy and local excision treatments.

      The investigators aim to compare thrombectomy and local excision treatments in many different
      aspects:

        -  The investigators will follow these patients for 6 months by scheduling follow-up visits
           (or by phone if the patient cannot attend) 4 times during this period (1st week, 1st
           month, 3rd month, 6th month).

        -  The investigators will examine bleeding, pain, anal stricture/stenosis, infection, time
           until return to normal daily activity, relapse and incontinence after treatment

        -  To assess quality of life outcomes, the investigators use the 36-Item Short Form Health
           Survey (SF-36). These measures rely upon patient self-reporting and are utilized for
           routine monitoring and assessment of care outcomes in patients.

        -  The investigators will use the Wexner incontinence score for assessment of incontinence.

      In each hospital, medical students, residents and surgeons can be involved in the study. In
      the following 6-month period, all collaborators will be collecting the data of the patients
      who have been operated for external hemorrhoids via the thrombectomy or local excision
      procedures.

    <description>The investigators will follow these patients for 6 months by scheduling follow-up visits (or by phone if the patient cannot attend) 4 times during this period (1st week, 1st month, 3rd month, 6th month).
The investigators will examine anal bleeding(exist or not), pain(exist or not), anal stricture/stenosis(exist or not, its severity), infection(exist or not), time until return to normal daily activity, relapse and incontinence after treatment.
The investigators will use the Wexner incontinence score for assessment of incontinence.
The investigators will measure the internal diameter of anal canal for the assessment of anal stenosis and its severity. When the internal diameter of anal canal is less than 0.5 cm, it is severe stenosis and when the diameter is 0.5-1 cm stenosis is moderate and 1-1.5 cm diameter is known as mild stenosis.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>6-month quality of life outcomes</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months from operation</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life outcomes within 6 months of surgical procedure. To assess quality of life outcomes, the investigators use the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36). The SF-36 has eight scaled scores; the scores are weighted sums of the questions in each section. Scores range from 0 - 100. Lower scores = more disability, higher scores = less disability.
Sections:
Vitality
Physical functioning
Bodily pain
General health perceptions
Physical role functioning
Emotional role functioning
Social role functioning
