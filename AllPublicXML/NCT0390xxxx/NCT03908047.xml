  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The lower urinary tract is innervated by the autonomous (sympathetic, parasympathetic) and
      the somatic nervous system. Afferent information from the lower urinary tract (LUT) (e.g.
      filling state and volume of the urinary bladder) is conducted via the dorsal roots to the
      sacral spinal cord and from there to the pontine micturition center (PMC) in the brain stem.
      The PMC has several connections to other cortical areas. These complex interactions with the
      cortex enable voluntary control of the LUT and are crucial for urinary continence. The
      integrity of this neuronal circuit is crucial for an undisturbed function. Deterioration of
      the nerve fibers due to a systemic neurological disease (e.g. spinal cord injury) can affect
      LUT function. Neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction can lead to urgency, urge
      incontinence, reduced bladder capacity and secondary deterioration of the upper urinary tract
      (i.e. kidneys). First-line therapy of neurogenic detrusor overactivity contains
      antimuscarinic treatment. In case of side effects or remaining detrusor overactivity, nerve
      stimulation (e.g. sacral neuromodulation and in effect nerve tibialis stimulation) is an
      accepted therapy option. The precise mechanism of action of these neuro-modulatory procedures
      is still unknown. Utilizing state-of-the-art neuroimaging techniques, we intend to
      investigate the functional activation pattern after afferent tibialis nerve stimulation as
      well as the association with the architecture of the sacral roots. We aime to get a better
      insight into functional neuromodulation and central nervous processing. The study aim is to
      evaluate the feasibility in healthy subjects as a pilot study for the application of these
      method in patients with chronic, incomplete spinal cord injury.
