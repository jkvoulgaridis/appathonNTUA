      The present project is to identify the relationship between ADHD and the metabolites of
      tryptophan.

      Because attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is an early onset and long-term
      impairing disorder with tremendous impact on individuals, families, and societies, detection
      and diagnosis are very important for ADHD. According to investigators previous work,
      participants with ADHD have executive dysfunction. Previous studies show that tryptophan is
      associated with cognitive problems in participants. Analyzing differences in tryptophan
      metabolites (Indolepropionic acid [IPA], indoleacetic acid [IAA], and kynurenic acid [KYNA])
      between participants with ADHD and healthy controls could provide insight into underlying
      disease pathology of cognitive deficits. In this one-year project, investigators will perform
      an analysis of tryptophan metabolites in serum to identify potential biomarkers for the
      executive dysfunction of ADHD.

As in the DSM-IV criteria, to describe psychopathology, the word &quot;often&quot; is included at the beginning of each item, so the precise interpretation of the 4-point rating scale (0 = &quot;not at all&quot;, 2 = &quot;just a little&quot;, 3 = &quot;quite a bit&quot;, and 4 = &quot;very much&quot;) reflects the degree that the behavior is abnormally frequent and severe compared to normal childhood behavior.</description>

    <description>The CGI-ADHD-S (120) is a single item clinician rating of the assessment of the global severity of the ADHD symptoms in relation to the clinician's total experience with ADHD patients. Severity is rated on a 7-point scale (1=normal, not at all ill; 7=among the most extremely ill patients). The CGI-ADHD-S will be administered on each visit, from visit 1 through visit 10.</description>

    <description>The SAICA is a 77-item semi-structured interview scale that was designed for administration to school-aged children aged 6-18 about themselves, or to their parents about their children (121). The SAICA provides an evaluation of children's current functioning in the domains of (1) school, (2) spare time, (3) peer relations, and (4) home behaviors. A higher mean score (items rated on 4-point Likert scale from 1 to 4) indicates either poorer social function or a more severe social problem (121). (We delete the Spare time relationship in the Overall relationship) The score for each item ranges from 1 to 4. An increased score indicates either a decreased social function or an increased severity of social problem.</description>

        The ADHD group

          1. Inclusion Criteria

             Patients with ADHD are eligible to be included in this study only if they meet all of
             the following criteria:

               1. Patients will be outpatients who are between 7 and 18 years of age.

               2. Patients must have ADHD that meet the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
                  disorders, 5th edition (DSM-V) disease diagnostic criteria assessed by the
                  investigator's clinical evaluation, as well as confirmed by the Chinese version
                  of the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age
                  Children-Epidemiological Version (K-SADS-E).

               3. Patients must have a Clinical Global Impressions-ADHD-Severity (CGI-ADHD-S) score
                  &gt; 4 at baseline.

               4. Patients must be psychotropic drug-naïve. Patients will be considered to be
                  drug-naïve if they have never received medications specifically to treat ADHD.

               5. Patients and parents (or legal representative) must have a degree of
                  understanding sufficient to be able to communicate suitably with the
                  investigator.

               6. Patients must be of normal intelligence in the judgment of the investigator.
                  Normal intelligence is defined as achieving a score of 80 or more when IQ testing
                  is administrated.

               7. Patients must have been judged by the investigator to be reliable to keep
                  appointments for clinic visits and all tests, including neuropsychological
                  testing and venipunctures.

          2. Exclusion Criteria

        Patients will be excluded from the study if they meet any of the following criteria:

          1. Patients with current or past history of schizophrenia, schizoaffective Disorder,
             organic psychosis, bipolar I or II disorder, autism, or autism spectrum disorder.
             Other comorbid psychiatric disorders are not excluded if the ADHD symptoms are the
             primary source of impairment for the patient.

          2. Patients with a history of any seizure disorder (other than febrile convulsion) or
             patients who are taking anticonvulsants for seizure control.

          3. Patients have been at serious suicidal risk, determined by the investigator.

          4. Patients with a history of alcohol or drug abuse within the past 3 months, or who are
             currently using alcohol, drugs of abuse, or any described or over-the-counter
             medication in a manner that the investigator considers indicative of abuse.

          5. Patients with cardiovascular disease or other conditions that could be aggravated by
             an increased heart rate or increased blood pressure.

          6. Patients who are likely to need Chinese medicine or health-food supplements that have
             central nervous system activity.
