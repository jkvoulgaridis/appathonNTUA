  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Point-of-care ultrasound in patients with dyspnoea has been shown to alter patient treatment
      and the time to correct treatment when performed in emergency departments. In Denmark,
      physician-staffed ambulances are sent to citizens with severe ABCD symptoms including
      dyspnoea. Hence, there is a potential for correct diagnostics and appropriate treatment
      already in the citizens' own home or en route to the hospital. This study aims to evaluate
      the clinical performance of prehospital point-of-care ultrasound in patients with dyspnoea.
