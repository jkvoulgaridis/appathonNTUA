      Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by low platelet count
      and mucocutaneous bleeding. Approximately one-third of ITP patients fail to respond to
      first-line therapies. In addition, a certain amount of the patients relapse and require
      further therapy after one or more treatment strategies (e.g., thrombopoietin receptor
      agonists or rituximab). The optimal second-line treatment remains a challenge.Berberine
      (BBR), an isoquinoline alkaloid derived from plants, is widely used as a nonprescription drug
      to treat diarrhea. Our previous data demonstrated that gut microbiota dysbiosis may
      contribute to the development of corticosteroid-resistant ITP. BBR may correct
      corticosteroid-resistance by modulating the gut microbiota structure, thus being a novel
      potential second-line candidate to treat ITP. Importantly, the potential clinical benefits of
      BBR have already been evaluated in various studies using human subjects, and it has been
      shown to be safe. Danazol is an attenuated androgen that has successfully been used in the
      treatment of ITP. Considering the side-effects of a regular dose of danazol and that BBR and
      danazol share disparate mechanisms in the treatment of ITP, we hypothesized that the
      combination of these two agents might be a promising option to maximize efficacy while
      minimizing adverse effects. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety
      of berberine plus danazol in patients with corticosteroid-resistant or relapsed ITP.
