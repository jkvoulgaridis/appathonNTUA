  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, multi-institutional, historically-controlled, study of 100 patients with
      newly diagnosed Grade II and III astrocytoma comparing the combination of TTFields with
      adjuvant temozolomide versus temozolomide alone in historical controls after the completion
      of definitive chemoradiotherapy. Study treatment may continue past first tumor recurrence.
      The primary endpoint will be overall survival.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with newly diagnosed high-risk Grade II or III astrocytoma must undergo maximal safe
      resection (biopsy alone may be eligible) and chemoradiotherapy: concomitant 75mg/m2 daily
      temozolomide with 80% prescribed dose completed and RT with minimal RT dose of 40 Gy
      delivered.

      Within three weeks prior to beginning adjuvant temozolomide, all patients will undergo a
      Baseline contrast-enhanced MRI of the brain. Within two weeks prior to beginning adjuvant
      temozolomide, all patients will undergo baseline assessments. Patients will begin study
      treatment with temozolomide and TTFields within 2 weeks of the baseline evaluation, and no
      later than 6 weeks from last dose of concomitant temozolomide or radiation therapy (the
      latter of the two). A minimum of 6 and a maximum of 12 cycles of adjuvant temozolomide will
      be given. Patients will be seen and examined before each cycle of temozolomide. After a
      maximum of 12 cycles of adjuvant temozolomide, patients will be seen every 8 weeks. Brain MRI
      and QoL assessments will be performed every 8 weeks following the baseline MRI for the first
      2 years then every 3 months thereafter until second progression (when TTFields treatment will
      be terminated).

    The study was terminated because the Study Chair/IDE Sponsor and Novocure determined that
    conducting this trial was not feasible without CMS approval.
