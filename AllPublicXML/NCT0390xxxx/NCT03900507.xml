  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim is to determine the endometriotic foci formed in the incision line after
      surgical operations, and the medical treatment approach is the primary objective. Medical
      treatment was initiated and the patients who did not benefit from the treatment would be
      operated and postoperative pain scores would be compared with the medical treatment. It will
      be tried to determine which treatment is more effective in pain control.

      In addition to removing the symptoms and providing therapeutic methods in patients, it is
      aimed to help in differential diagnosis of dermatological diseases and malignancy and thus to
      prevent anxiety in patients. It is also aimed to evaluate the pathology results in the most
      appropriate way to eliminate the symptoms (severe pain, bleeding, etc.) that occur in
      accordance with the menstrual cycle every month.
