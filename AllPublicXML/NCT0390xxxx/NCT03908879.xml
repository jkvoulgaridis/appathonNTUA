  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective diagnostic accuracy study investigating the sensitivity and specificity
      of methods used to confirm correct placement of an intraosseous (IO) catheter. Intraosseous
      catheters allow medical providers to rapidly administer fluids and medications to critically
      ill patients when intravenous (IV) access is not present or difficult to achieve. It is
      standard of care to confirm the correct placement of an IO catheter prior to using it to
      administer medications or fluids. Three IO placement confirmatory tests will be performed on
      all research subjects using a standardized protocol. There will be two index tests (the
      method utilized by most of the medical community evaluating the stability of the catheter,
      ability to aspirate blood or bone marrow and ability to administer fluids without visible or
      palpable extravasation as well as the method of demonstrating color flow Doppler only within
      the intraosseous space during bedside ultrasound exam) and one reference test (ability to
      visualized a pulsatile waveform when the IO catheter is attached to a pressure transducer).
      Primary outcome measures of the study will be the determination of correct or incorrect IO
      catheter placement from the confirmation methods. This data will be used to investigate the
      primary endpoints of sensitivity and specificity of the confirmation tests as well as
      inter-operator variability interpreting the raw data from the confirmation methods. Secondary
      outcomes include complications from the IO catheter. The goal of this study is to see if a
      more sensitive and specific method of IO catheter confirmation can reliably be performed by
      different physicians and reduce the amount of complications associated with the catheters.
      Additional subgroup analyses will be performed in regards to the research subjects BMI and
      the anatomic site selected for IO catheter use (proximal tibia or humeral head).

    <masking_description>There is only one arm because all participants will be undergoing the same protocol. To evaluate inter-operator variability for methods 2 and 3, co-investigators will be reviewing saved images recorded by the physicians who placed the intraosseous (IO) catheter. Saved images include the color flow Doppler image for method 2 and the pressure waveform for method 3. Two co-investigators will review saved images from method 2, blinded and independently. Two other co-investigators will review saved images from method 3, blinded and independently. If the results of the two co-investigators for method 2 or method 3 is discordant then a third blinded reviewer will review the saved image for the method with discordant results.</masking_description>

    <description>The high frequency probe of a portable ultrasound with color flow Doppler is placed adjacent to the intraosseous (IO) catheter, visualizing the IO space in long or short axis. Color flow Doppler signal will be turned on during IO use and the physician will determine if the Doppler signal is in the intraosseous space or the extraosseous space. Saved data of the ultrasound image will be reviewed independently by at least two blinded reviewers. If the conclusions from the blinded reviewers are discordant then a third blinded reviewer will evaluate the saved data.</description>
