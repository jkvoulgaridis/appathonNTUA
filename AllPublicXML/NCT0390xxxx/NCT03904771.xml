    <textblock>
      Aims. The main aim of the study is to explore whether Food for Mind - Group-based behavioral
      nutrition intervention alleviates depression symptoms. Furthermore, we aim to investigate,
      whether the intervention improves the quality of diet, eating habits, quality of life,
      ability to work and to study its cost-effectiveness.

      In collaboration with Psychiatric clinic of the City of Kuopio and Mental Health Services of
      the City of Kuopio.

      Participants. The total number of subjects will be 144 based on power calculations. The
      calculation is based on the clinical decline of seven points assessed by the Center for
      Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) Scale. Participants sign an informed consent form to
      participate Food for Mind - intervention.

      Study design.

      In this randomized controlled clinical trial subjects are randomized into two parallel
      groups: Food for Mind -behavioral nutrition intervention group (n=72) and Group to bring Good
      Mood -control group (n=72).

      The intervention consists of behavioral nutrition counselling (5 times 1½ h and 1 time 3 h)
      and the control group (befriending group) (n=72) (5 times 1½ h and 1 time 3 h). Thus, in the
      befriending group the same visit schedule and length without any nutrition counselling is
      used. The befriending group consists of discussion of neutral topics, like hobbies, music,
      sports, and doing together. Both groups continue to have their normal depression care in the
      health care.

      Enrollment and treatment will take about three years, and follow-up will last about one year.

      The Northern Savo Hospital District Committee on Research Ethics gave its consent to the
      study protocol.

      Methods. All questionnaires are validated. CES-D -depression scale, Seasonal Pattern
      Assessment Questionnaire, The Diet Quality Index (IDQ), Diet frequency -questionnaire, Eating
      competence -questionnaire (ecSI 2.0), The Three Factor Eating Questionnaire, Ability to work
      and function -questionnaires, Assessment of Quality of Life (AQoL)-8D (8 dimensions)
      -questionnaire, Treatment expectancy -questionnaire.

      In addition, body composition measurement and cost-effectiveness analyses to evaluate the
      health outcomes in relation to resource utilization and costs in Food for Mind -intervention.

      Food for Mind -intervention group - topics of small group meetings

        1. Getting to know each other and forming a group.

        2. Overall quality of diet and meal rhythm, shifting thoughts to changing of wishes.

        3. Nutrition and depression based on the evidence based studies

        4. Mindful Eating - practical Food for Mind cooking class and eating meal together applying
           mindful eating

        5. Food for Mind - getting to know a selection of Food for Mind -food items available in
           the grocery store.

        6. Tools for the future: discovering and ensuring your own tools for success to put into
           action.

      Participants in the Food for Mind -intervention group will get for every group meeting
      optional home exercises consisting of observing their own food habits and bringing &quot;food for
      mind&quot; items on their meal plan. As a social support, participants can share their own
      experiences and findings via WhatsApp (Whats Application) messenger -mobile application. The
      WhatsApp messenger-mobile application is used during the intervention and ten months after
      it.

      The behavioral nutrition counselling is theory-based, i.e. solution focused theory (SFT) and
      self -determination theory. SFT places responsibility for change in the hands of subjects by
      using empowering language and recognizing them as skilled in matters of self-care. Subjects
      have strengths, resources, and coping skills that drive change while generating optimism and
      hope. Use of basic counseling skills, such as attending and listening, genuineness, empathy,
      positive regard and reflection, provide the foundation upon which SFT is practised.

    <time_frame>12 months: assessed at baseline, at eight weeks, at 6 months and at 12 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Depressive symptomatology measured with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies (CES-D) scale at eight weeks, 6 months and 12 months after patient recruitment compared to the social support befriending group.
The scale has 20 items and measures symptoms of depression. Each item is scored from 0 (zero) to 3 points. The total score ranges from 0 (zero) to 60 points.Higher values of the total score represent a worse outcome.Four of the items (#4, #8, #12, #16) are reversed before calculating the total score. The total score is calculated as follows: the answers to the items are summed, the sum is divided by the number of scored items, and this value is multiplied by 20. If the answers are missing to more than five items, the total score will not be calculated.</description>
