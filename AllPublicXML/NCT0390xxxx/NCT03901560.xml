  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess whether participants who receive music therapy during inpatient care
      report a decrease in pain and whether music therapy influences factors such as family
      satisfaction.

  <detailed_description>

      The purpose of this study is to determine if music therapy services can serve as a viable,
      necessary, and beneficial aspect of inpatient pain management, distraction, and coping for
      pediatric patients in the acute care hospital setting. The investigator will note the effect
      of music therapy services in conjunction with pain scores reported by the participant and an
      increase in self and family reported coping skills during hospitalization.

      Participants will be referred by providers from pain management service, oncology/hematology
      service, or the gastrointestinal (GI) service for functional and abdominal pain. Participants
      who meet the criteria for inclusion will be selected. The study will be explained to parents
      and a consent form will be left for the family to review and sign at their convenience.
      Participants will provide a pain scale level and vitals before completing the music therapy
      intervention. Once the music therapy intervention is completed, the pain scale and vitals
      will be repeated.
