  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effectiveness of integrated care pathways for hip fractures in sub-acute rehabilitation
      settings is not known. The study objective was to assess if a hip fracture integrated care
      pathway at a sub-acute rehabilitation facility would result in better functional outcomes,
      shorter length of stay and fewer institutionalisations. A randomised controlled trial on an
      integrated care pathway was conducted for hip fracture patients in a sub-acute rehabilitation
      setting. The study supports the use of integrated care pathways in sub-acute rehabilitation
      settings to reduce length of stay whilst achieving the same functional gains.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients admitted to St Luke's Hospital, a 185-bed hospital in Singapore providing
      multidisciplinary stepdown care, from 8 September 2004 to 14 June 2006 for the purpose of
      rehabilitation after a new hip fracture were included. Patients were excluded if any of the
      following criteria were present: (i) Pre-morbid non-ambulatory status, (ii) nursing home
      residents, (iii) palliative care patients, and (iv) patients previously enlisted for the
      trial. Administrative staff allocated patients to either ICP or usual care according to the
      last digit of their National Registration Identity Card (NRIC) numbers, odd numbers to the
      intervention group and even numbers to the control group. Patients were then admitted to 1 of
      2 intervention wards or 1 of 3 control wards. Patients were enrolled by the principal
      investigators only after moving into their respective wards because of work flow limitations.
      Those who refused consent or were excluded remained in their assigned wards and received
      usual care. Both intervention and control groups were under the care of multidisciplinary
      teams but the intervention group had structured assessments and checklists in addition to
      usual care while the control group had usual care alone.

    <description>The intervention group had the following as part of the integrated care pathway:
Medical assessment on admission for risk factors for falls.
A weekly assessment of complications including pain, deep venous thrombosis, anaemia, wounds and pressure ulcers, etc. The Confusion Assessment Method and the Geriatric Depression Scale were utilized.
Physiotherapy and occupational therapy guidelines with recommended milestones (set for the full, partial and non-weight bearing groups)
Physiotherapy Clinical Outcome Variables Scale (PTCOVS)16 was used by the physiotherapists in the intervention group to assess the baseline mobility, to define outcome goals and to direct treatment plans.
A postoperative hip precaution handout (containing information on avoiding hip prosthesis dislocation in patients with total hip replacement or hemiarthroplasty) was given to patients and their caregivers.</description>
