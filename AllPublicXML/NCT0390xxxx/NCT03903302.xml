      SAD study:

      Eighteen subjects will be included in the SAD study (single dose) in 3 parallel arms, each
      with 6 subjects. The 3 arms will receive a single dose of one of the CS1 formulations I, II
      or III. The result of the pharmacokinetics analysis from the 6 first subjects is defined as
      SAD Pilot and will be used to evaluate the timing of PK sampling. Based on pharmacokinetic
      evaluations from all 18 subjects one of the formulations I (275 mg), II (276 mg) or III (276
      mg) will be chosen to proceed into the MAD study. If none of the formulations show the
      desired PK properties the formulations may be re-dosed with a slightly different timing of
      the dose, i.e the IMP to be administered earlier or later during the evening.

      MAD study:

      Fifteen subjects will be included in a dose escalating study with 2 dose levels. The subjects
      will receive the lowest dose level (275 or 276 mg depending on the outcome of SAD) for the
      first 2 weeks before the dose is doubled (550 or 552 mg depending on the outcome of SAD) for
      the following 2 weeks.
