  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to be able to describe optical coherence angiography (OCTA)
      patterns of disease activity and quiescence in eyes that have received treatment. Our target
      population group is patients that have neovascular age-related macular degeneration and have
      had treatment with aflibercept for this condition.

      This is a single-site study and does not involve any masking or treatment allocation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of this condition (neovascular age-related macular degeneration - nAMD) with
      aflibercept has transformed the outlook for patients with this sight-threatening disease.

      In clinical practice, eye doctors commonly use a &quot;treat and extend&quot; approach to treatment in
      which the interval between aflibercept injections is gradually increased once there is nAMD
      disease quiescence.

      It is uncertain about the ideal retinal imaging biomarkers doctors should use to define
      disease remission or inactivity; and therefore extend treatment intervals. Increased
      certainty of the ideal biomarker would also avoid stopping treatment too soon.

      The scan we will be performing (OCTA imaging) detects blood flow within the choroidal
      neovascular membrane (CNV) - the immature blood vessel network which causes nAMD. This scan
      is therefore a potentially powerful way of determining if the disease is active or quiescent.
      Disease activity on this device can be defined as a blood flow pattern which suggests an
      active CNV or lesion growth.

      By better defining disease activity using OCTA, eye doctors would be more confident in
      continuing and defining a treatment plan for nAMD.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients over 50 years of age with a diagnosis of nAMD receiving anti-VEGF treatment with
        no signs of intra-or subretinal fluid on structural OCT imaging and with no macular
        haemorrhage after a minimum of three intravitreal injections.

        Visual acuity in the study eye of 35 Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS)
        letter score or better (6/60 or better) Ability to understand the nature/purpose of the
        study and to provide informed consent Any ocular condition which would lead to image
        artefact or poor OCT image quality Ability to undergo retinal imaging

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients with polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy or pachychoroid Patients in whom imaging of
        the study eye leads to ungradable OCTA images. Any condition which, in the investigators'
        opinion, would conflict or otherwise prevent the subject from complying with the required
        procedures, schedule or other study conduct.
