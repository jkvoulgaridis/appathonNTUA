  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study will refine and conduct a preliminary efficacy evaluation of Care to Plan.
      Care to Plan is an online care planning tool that provides a succinct and clear overview of
      various types of dementia caregiver interventions, administers a brief validated assessment
      of risk, and generates individualized recommendations for dementia caregivers as well as
      resources that link users to a selected recommendation.

      There remains a lack of individualized information that can directly meet the diverse needs
      of caregivers or their relatives with Alzheimer's disease or a related dementia (ADRD). This
      project will advance scientific knowledge, technical capability, and clinical practice as
      they pertain to ADRD management and caregiver support.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Given the well-documented health implications of dementia family caregiving, existing
      interventions are designed to modify the more challenging aspects of care for a relative with
      Alzheimer's disease or a related dementia (ADRD) in order to improve key outcomes. However,
      current research has yet to discern which caregivers are most likely to benefit from
      different types of interventions or services. There also remains a lack of individualized
      information that can directly meet the heterogeneous needs of caregivers or their relatives
      with ADRD. This project will advance scientific knowledge, technical capability, and clinical
      practice as they pertain to ADRD management and caregiver support. The research team has
      developed and tested the feasibility and utility of an online care planning tool prototype
      (called Care to Plan, or CtP) that provides a succinct and clear overview of various types of
      ADRD caregiver interventions, administers a brief validated assessment of risk, and generates
      individualized service recommendations for ADRD caregivers as well as resources that link
      users to a selected recommendation. The goal of CtP is to offer a more efficient,
      user-directed process to link ADRD caregivers to the services that may be most appropriate
      for them given their needs, the needs of their relatives, and other contextual
      characteristics. We will deploy and more fully evaluate CtP for family caregivers of persons
      with ADRD who seek services in Riverside Health System (RHS) in the state of Virginia. The
      Specific Aims are to: 1) Implement CtP for 20 family members of persons with ADRD in four RHS
      clinical sites (Phase I) over a 1-month period; and 2) Evaluate the preliminary efficacy and
      implementation of CtP (Phase II) via an embedded randomized controlled evaluation for 100
      newly enrolled ADRD caregivers over a 6-month period. We anticipate that the CtP will serve
      as an innovative, low-cost tool that both families and long-term service and support
      providers can utilize to better meet the diverse needs of family caregivers of persons with
      ADRD in their communities.

    <ipd_description>Public access to the research data generated from this project will be offered via de-identified data files maintained by the investigators. All personal identifiers of family caregivers of persons with Alzheimer's disease or a related dementia (ADRD) participating in the study will be removed and replaced with random identification numbers prior to distributing data files. Dr. Gaugler plans to maintain all data from the proposed project on the secure School of Public Health shared server folder for 7 years following study completion. Potential external investigators will be asked to complete a data use agreement and a recommended citation to these materials will be provided. Dr. Gaugler will oversee the distribution of public data during the course of the funding period and for an indefinite time thereafter.</ipd_description>
