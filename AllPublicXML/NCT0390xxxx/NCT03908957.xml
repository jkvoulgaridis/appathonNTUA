  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1 study to evaluate the safety of Ga68-Dolacga Injection in healthy
      volunteers and to assess the normal reference range and inter-individual variability of the
      Ga68-Dolacga Injection in estimating liver reserve in healthy volunteers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ga-68 is a positron-emitting radionuclide with short half-life of 68 minutes. Dolacga is a
      non-radiolabeled formulated drug product and will be reconstituted to become the finished
      radiopharmaceutical product Ga68-Dolacga Injection, a PET tracer specifically targeting to
      surface receptors of hepatocytes. The study aims to evaluate the safety of Ga68-Dolacga
      Injection in healthy volunteers and to assess the normal reference range and inter-individual
      variability of the Ga68-Dolacga Injection in estimating liver reserve in healthy volunteers.
