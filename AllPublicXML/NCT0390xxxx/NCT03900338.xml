    <textblock>
      This is an observational case-control study which objective is to analyse differences in
      intestinal microbiota between patients with and without arterial stiffness, measured by pulse
      wave velocity. It will take place in two different research units located in Portugal and
      Spain.

      Aim: analyse differences in intestinal microbiota between patients with and without arterial
      stiffness, measured by pulse wave velocity.

      Design and setting: An observational case-control study. Study population: The investigators
      will select 324 subjects, between 30 to 75 years-old, from a database that combine data from
      four different studies: Triple A, Early vascular Aging (EVA) and Improving interMediAte Risk
      management (MARK) that took place in the Research Unit of La Alamedilla Primary Care Center,
      and Guimarães/ Vizela Study promoted by the Life and Health Sciences Research Institute in
      Minho University.

      Measurements: 162 Cases will be defined by a Carotid-femoral Pulse Wave Velocity (cf-PWV)&gt;10
      mm/s determined using the SphygmoCor System. 162 controls will be selected by the propensity
      score. The composition of the gut microbiome in faecal samples will be determined by
      ribosomal ribonucleic acid (16S rRNA) gene sequencing. Other measurements: demographic data,
      lifestyle assessment (physical activity, adherence to the Mediterranean diet, alcohol and
      tobacco consumption). Anthropometric Variables: Weight, body composition by bioimpedance,
      size, body mass index (BMI), waist and hip perimeter, peripheral and central arterial
      pressure. Analysis of structure and vascular function and organ lesions target: pulse wave
      velocity, cardio-ankle vascular index and ankle-brachial index; Intimal median carotid
      thickness, central and peripheral rate of increase, renal and cardiac organic lesion. Blood
      analysis: short chain fatty acids, total bile acids, ursodeoxycholic acid

        The investigators will select 324 subjects, between 40 to 75 years-old, from a database
        that combine data from four different studies: Triple A, EVA and Mark that took place in
        the Research Unit of La Alamedilla Primary Care Center, and Guimarães/ Vizela Study
        promoted by the Life and Health Sciences Research Institute in Minho University.

        The 162 cases with a pathologic pulse wave velocity will be randomly selected, each of this
        subjects will be matched to an individual with the same or similar propensity score. Each
        one of these subjects will go through a PWV study to confirm that they're in the right
        group.
