      Primary objectives:

      Assessing the safety and tolerability of mRNA personalized tumor vaccines encoding neoantigen
      for unresectable or metastatic advanced esophageal and non-small cell lung cancers with
      standard treatment failure or no standard treatment.

      Secondary objectives:

      Preliminary observation of the efficacy of mRNA personalized tumor vaccines encoding
      neoantigen for unsurgically resected or metastatic advanced esophageal and non-small cell
      lung cancers with standard treatment failure or no standard treatment.
