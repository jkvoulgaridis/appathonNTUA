  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Esophageal cancers are the seventh most common cancer in the world and one of the most common
      causes of cancer deaths. In some parts of China, the incidence of SCC is among the highest in
      the world. Despite surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy, the prognosis for SCC patients was
      disappointing. There is therefore an urgent need for new prevention and treatment strategies.

      Epidemiological investigations have found that about 25% of human tumors are associated with
      chronic inflammation caused by a variety of causes, and chronic inflammation activates
      nuclear transcription factors (nuclear Factor,NF), induces gene and epigenetic changes such
      as DNA methylation, tumor suppressor gene point mutations, and post-translational
      modification, and participates in the process of tumorigenesis. It has been noted that the
      long-term regularity of the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs aspirin can reduce
      the incidence and mortality of a variety of tumors, including esophageal cancer.

      Aspirin is the earliest, most extensive and common antipyretic analgesics and anti-rheumatism
      drugs used to play an anti-inflammatory role by inhibiting the synthesis of PGs. COX-2 is a
      key enzyme in the synthesis of PGs, so it is speculated that the anti-tumor effect of aspirin
      inhibits the PGs of COX and its inhibition.

    <description>Aspirin (aspirin), also known as acetylsalicylic acid (acetylsalicylic acid), is a salicylic acid drug commonly used as a painkiller, antipyretic and anti-inflammatory drug. There is growing evidence that aspirin has a preventive effect on certain cancers, especially gastrointestinal cancers, and that taking aspirin every day can reduce the risk of colon cancer, and in vitro experiments have also shown that aspirin inhibits the growth of a variety of cancer cells and induces apoptosis.</description>
