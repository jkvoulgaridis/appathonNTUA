  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of Part 1of this trial is to investigate the effect of co-administration
      of multiple doses of donepezil on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of BI 425809 in healthy
      subjects. In Part 2 the main objective is the investigation of the effect of
      co-administration of multiple doses of BI 425809 on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of
      donepezil in healthy subjects.

          -  Smoker (more than 10 cigarettes or 3 cigars or 3 pipes per day)

          -  Inability to refrain from smoking on specified trial days

          -  Alcohol abuse (consumption of more than 20 g per day for females and 30 g per day for
             males)

          -  Drug abuse or positive drug screening

          -  Blood donation of more than 100 mL within 30 days of planned administration of trial
             medication or intended blood donation during the trial

             administration of trial medication or during the trial

          -  Inability to comply with the dietary regimen of the trial site

          -  A marked baseline prolongation of QT/QTc interval (such as QTc intervals that are
             repeatedly greater than 450 ms in males or repeatedly greater than 470 ms in females)
             or any other relevant Electrocardiogram (ECG) finding at screening

          -  A history of additional risk factors for Torsade de Pointes (such as heart failure,
             hypokalaemia, or family history of Long QT Syndrome)

          -  Subject is assessed as unsuitable for inclusion by the investigator, for instance,
