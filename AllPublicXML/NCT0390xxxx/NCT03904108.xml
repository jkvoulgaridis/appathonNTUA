  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, phase-II study of platinum doublet chemotherapy plus ramucirumab in
      patients with advanced NSCLC who have progressed on first line anti-PD-1 Immunotherapy. Up to
      25 evaluable participants will be enrolled over a period of 2 years. Seven patients will be
      recruited at the first stage .Eligible patients would include those treated with a PD-1
      inhibitor as primary therapy and exhibit evidence of disease progression, but maintain a good
      performance status.

      The investigators hypothesize that immune therapy acts as chemo-sensitizer and patients
      treated with standard platinum-based combination chemotherapy with the addition of the
      anti-angiogenic agent Ramucirumab, after immunotherapy will have higher response rates

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary Objective

        1. To assess the objective response rate to a three-drug regimen (a platinum doublet plus
           an anti-angiogenic agent) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer who fail to
           respond, or progress after an initial response, to primary therapy with an immune
           checkpoint inhibitor.

        2. To assess the toxicity profile of the three-drug regimen in this population compared to
           historical treatment-naïve population (as published in literature)

      Exploratory Objective

        1. To investigate the role of peripheral blood CD 8+ T cells, absolute eosinophil count
           (AEC) and circulating tumor cells (CTC) as biomarkers of response to salvage
           chemotherapy after primary immunotherapy

        2. To investigate the role of plasma carbonic anhydrase IX level as predictive biomarker of
           response to ramucirumab.
