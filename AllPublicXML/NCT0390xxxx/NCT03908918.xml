  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the use of a mobile-app delivered mindfulness-based intervention for
      supporting psychosocial resilience in aging patients undergoing rehabilitation treatment.
      Half of the patients will receive the mobile-app, while the other half will receive the app 6
      months later.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although, several mobile-app based MBTs are available in the marketplace, there is scant
      evidence of high scientific rigor to support their therapeutic efficacy. Furthermore, the
      tracking of wellness outcomes, stress resilience and functioning as a result of use of a
      therapeutic digital product is a challenging task requiring expertise in technology. In this
      study, the investigators aim to investigate not only the effectiveness of an app-based MBT in
      aging adults, but also the mechanisms of efficacy - i.e. the therapeutic effects - of app
      usage, including changes in, depression, anxiety, or mood and the acceptance of the app in
      older adult populations. The investigators also aim to measure the Return On Investment (ROI)
      of mobile mindfulness on health services utilization.

      The study is a randomized controlled design with 1:1 equal allocation to treatment
      (Experimental Am app group) or control (treatment as usual). The investigators will recruit
      82 participants in total.

      The Experimental group will start the 4 week Am app intervention immediately after
      randomization and baseline intervention questionnaires, while the wait-list control group
      will receive treatment as usual. Assessments are conducted at four time point: At Baseline
      (#1), Post-Intervention (#2), Follow-up at 3 months post baseline (#3) and Follow-up at 6
      months post baseline (#4).

      The clinical champions that referred the patient to the study will complete brief surveys
      about the quality of their appointments with the patient at two time points: At baseline (#1)
      and Post-Intervention (#2).

      The waitlist control group will be granted access to the mindfulness intervention at 6 months
      post baseline.

    <description>To evaluate the cost-benefit measures of the Am smartphone-app by measuring length of stay in hospital and levels of health services utilization
As no Electronic Health Records (EHR) are kept by Providence, a chart review, including progress notes, will be required to assess the following:
Date of admission.
Date of discharge.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Outcome: Health services utilization; measure: survey questions</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Cost of Treatment will also be measured using patient self-reports of health services utilization at 3 and 6 months post intervention. Participants will answer five questions related to their use of health services utilization drawn from peer-reviewed literature (Van den Brink et al., 2005).
Compared to the 3 months prior to the study, in the past 3 months my use of health care services has: (1) greatly decreased (2) stayed the same (3) greatly increased

    <description>The NRS minimum data set contains clinical data on functional status based on the 18-item Functional Independence Measure (FIM®) instrument.
FIM™ is comprised of 18 items, grouped into 2 subscales - motor and cognition.
Each item is scored on a 7 point ordinal scale, ranging from a score of 1 to a score of 7. The higher the score, the more independent the patient is in performing the task associated with that item.

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Am quantifies the efficacy of mindfulness training on each individual user through self-reports.
Self-reported mood will be collected by the participant's selection of mood words from Mobio's circumplex model of affect (based on Posner, Russell &amp; Peterson, 2005). This model holds that all emotions derive from two underlying, orthogonal dimensions of emotional experience: valence and arousal. These orthogonal dimensions divide the circumplex into four quarters: low arousal - low affect; low arousal - high affect; high arousal - low affect; high arousal - high affect.</description>

    <description>The Acceptance &amp; Action Questionnaire-II (AAQ-II) was developed in order to measure psychological flexibility, and scores have been found to predict many outcomes, including mental health and work absence rates.
The AAQ-II is a seven item, one factor measure of psychological inflexibility or experiential avoidance. The scale is scored by summing the responses. Higher scores equal greater levels of psychological inflexibility.</description>
