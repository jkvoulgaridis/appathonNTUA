  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients aged 65 years and older, polypathology is frequent and often associated with
      polypharmacy. This polypharmacy may be a source of iatrogeny due to pharmacokinetic
      interactions, enhanced sensitivity of older people to medication, or failure to adhere to the
      therapy. Since January 2018, French community pharmacists have been allowed by the Health
      ministry to perform medication reviews for people aged 65 years and over, who are being
      treated with more than 5 medications a day. the present hypothesis is that medication therapy
      management performed in collaboration with patients, general practitioners, and community
      pharmacists will lead to a reduction in medical events and inappropriate prescriptions.

      This is a stepped-wedge cluster randomised controlled trial conducted in 9 regions of France.
      Each region represents one cluster with 7 community pharmacies located around the University
      Hospital associated with that cluster. In total, 63 community pharmacies will be enrolled,
      with each pharmacy including 20 patients over a 10 month-period. Over the life-time of the
      project, a total of 1260 patients will benefit from either the intervention or from a
      controlled pharmaceutical care according to the period of time they will be enrolled.
