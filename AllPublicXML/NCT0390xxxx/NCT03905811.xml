  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The TZ-PD trial will be a 1:1 (active:placebo) randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      Phase II trial to evaluate the safety and tolerability of terazosin for the treatment of PD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single center, randomized, double-blind, controlled, pilot study to assess the
      safety and tolerability of terazosin (TZ) at a dose of 5 milligrams (MG) daily for patients
      with PD. The primary goal of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of TZ in
      patients with PD. This is a pilot study and is not powered to assess efficacy of this
      medication. Our hope is that this study will guide future studies of this (and similar)
      medications for the disease modification of PD. This study is also aimed to learn more about
      how patients with produce and use energy and if TZ can help to reverse energy deficits that
      appear in PD.
