  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates whether adding home-based resistance training to a multidisciplinary
      specialist weight management service can promote weight loss and improve physical function,
      strength, power and quality of life in adults with severe obesity. The study also
      investigated whether performing resistance exercises as fast as possible can yield further
      improvements in physical function compared with traditional slow-speed resistance training.

      All recruited participants completed a 3-month home-based resistance training programme with
      behavioural support; half of the participants performed resistance exercises in a slow and
      controlled manner, whereas the other half performed resistance exercises with maximal
      intentional velocity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Severe obesity reduces muscle contractile function, which manifests as a diminished ability
      to perform activities of daily living. These functional impairments often lead to pain during
      movement and a decreased motivation to exercise.

      In the United Kingdom (UK), specialist Tier 3 weight management services are provisioned for
      adults with severe obesity. Tier 3 services comprise a multidisciplinary team (MDT) of
      specialists and mainly adopt an educational approach, focusing on psychological therapy,
      dietary modification, pharmacotherapy and physical activity advice. However, current Tier 3
      programmes do not specifically address the functional impairments imposed by obesity, which
      predisposes adults with severe obesity to musculoskeletal pain and pathology.

      Adding supervised resistance training to MDT weight management programmes has been shown to
      improve functional capacity in adults with severe obesity. However, supervised interventions
      place considerable time and resource burdens on the service provider and patient, which may
      not be conducive to sustained participation. Obese individuals often report feeling too
      embarrassed to exercise in front of others and feel uncomfortable appearing in public wearing
      exercise clothing. Home-based exercise is a convenient alternative to supervised
      interventions and may promote similar functional adaptations.

      Traditional resistance training typically involves sustained contractions at low to moderate
      velocities. While this method of training is effective for augmenting maximal strength
      production, which is executed at slow velocities, it may neglect the development of muscle
      power. This is problematic because lower-limb power has recently emerged as a critical
      determinant of function in adults with severe obesity.

      Power training integrates a high-speed component into conventional resistance training
      exercises. Research in older adults has consistently shown that power training is superior to
      conventional slow-speed strength training for improving functionality. Preliminary evidence
      also exists supporting the superiority of power training in sarcopenic obese adults.
      Nevertheless, it is unknown whether home-based power training is feasible or effective when
      added to an MDT weight management programme.

      The investigators recruited participants from a UK Tier 3 specialist weight management
      service. In a prospective, parallel groups, randomised design, participants were randomly
      allocated to a slow-speed strength training group or a high-speed power training group. Both
      groups completed a 12-week, individualised, home-based resistance training intervention
      (2x/week) with behavioural support. The high-speed power training group performed resistance
      exercises with maximal intended concentric velocity whereas the slow-speed strength training
      group maintained a slow (2-s) lifting speed. Outcomes were assessed at baseline, 3-month
      (post-intervention), and 6-month (follow-up) endpoints.

    <measure>Lower-limb power (W)</measure>
    <time_frame>3-month endpoint</time_frame>
    <description>Mean power was measured in the sit-to-stand transfer with a wearable inertial sensor (PUSH, PUSH Inc., Toronto, Canada). The device is worn on the participant's forearm and measures acceleration in the upwards phase of the movement. Power is then calculated as velocity x force, where velocity is the integral of acceleration, and force is the product of mass and acceleration. The test was administered in a firm bariatric chair (height, 48 cm; depth, 56 cm; width, 69 cm). From a seated position, participants were instructed to maintain their arms crossed against their chest and stand up as quickly as possible (legs straight), before returning back to the initial seated position in a controlled manner (full weight on chair). Two warm-up trials were performed, followed by three repetitions separated by 60 seconds of rest. Additional trials were performed if the arms moved away from the chest.</description>

    <measure>EuroQol 5-level questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L)</measure>
    <time_frame>3-month and 6-month endpoints</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a generic, self-administered measure of health-related quality of life that gathers descriptive information on five main dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has five levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems. The participant indicates the level that best describes their state of health on that day. This results in a 1-digit number expressing the level selected for that dimension, which were combined to produce a five-digit number describing the participant's health status (ranging from 11111 to 55555). This is then converted to a single index value based on the EQ-5D-5L Crosswalk value set for England that ranges from -0.594 (worst possible health) to 1.000 (best possible health).</description>

    <measure>Obesity and Weight Loss Quality of Life Instrument (OWLQOL)</measure>
    <time_frame>3-month and 6-month endpoints</time_frame>
    <description>The OWLQOL measured obesity-specific quality of life, which is self-administered and contains 17-items that explore unobservable needs such as freedom from stigma and attainment of culturally appropriate goals. Each item has a 7-point Likert-like response scale ranging from 0 (&quot;Not at all&quot;) to 6 (&quot;A very great deal&quot;). The raw score is transformed to a standardised scale of 0 to 100, where higher scores indicate better quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Weight-related symptom measure (WRSM)</measure>
    <time_frame>3-month and 6-month endpoints</time_frame>
    <description>The WRSM is a 20-item, self-report measure for the presence and bothersomeness of obesity symptoms. Participants responded either &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; as to whether they experienced the symptom in the last four weeks and then rated the degree of bothersomeness that having the symptom caused them. The bothersomeness options are on a 7-point Likert-like response scale ranging from 0 (&quot;Not at all&quot;) to 6 (&quot;A very great deal&quot;). A total score is calculated by adding up all the bothersomeness scores for each symptom. Scores range from 0 to 120, with higher scores indicating a higher or worse experience of symptoms.</description>

    <description>Patients completed two home-based resistance training sessions each week on non-consecutive days for 12 weeks. The programme was delivered online via individual playlists on Youtube (YouTube, San Bruno, California, USA), with each playlist involving an individually-prescribed series of pre-recorded exercise videos. Each session involved a dynamic warm-up followed by 11 resistance exercises using body weight and resistance bands, and finished with static stretching. Participants completed 1-2 sets of 5-12 repetitions at 4-7 on a modified 10-point rating of perceived exertion scale, which corresponded to qualitative descriptors of &quot;moderate&quot; to &quot;hard&quot;. Resistance training stimuli were progressed weekly by increasing the external load, modifying the exercise selection, increasing the number of repetitions, and/or increasing the number of sets.</description>
