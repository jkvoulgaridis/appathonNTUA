  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dental caries is a polymicrobial infection originally thought to be caused by Streptococcus
      mutans and Lactobacilli. However, unprecedented developments in modern molecular techniques
      have demonstrated that several microbial species are associated with the disease in addition
      to streptococci and lactobacilli. Dental caries initiation and progression is a dynamic
      process in which demineralization of the tooth structure, as a result of acid production from
      acidogenic bacteria (due to carbohydrate metabolism) is being counteracted by the
      remineralization of the tooth surface by strong alkali production by certain bacteria in the
      dental biofilm. The aim of the present study is to identify the different microbiota in the
      oral biofilm using new laboratory techniques as well as the levels of salivary proteins in
      caries-free compared with caries active Arab children.

      The objective of this study will be to investigate the dental plaque's microbial diversity
      using Human Oral Microbe Identification using Next Generation Sequencing (HOMINGS) technology
      in the mixed dentition as well as the levels of salivary proteins in caries-free compared
      with caries active Arab children. The study protocol was approved by the Health Science
      Center Ethical Committee at Kuwait University.

      One hundred 6-9 year-old children with caries active and caries-free status will be recruited
      from randomly selected public schools in Kuwait. After DNA purification from supragingival
      plaque samples, HOMINGS will be performed. To get an insight into the host factors involved
      in this complex interplay between the host and the bacteria, stimulated saliva from the study
      subjects will be analyzed by proteomics. For children in both groups supragingival plaque
      samples will be collected from the buccal and lingual surfaces of all teeth. After preparing
      the samples, the aliquots of purified DNA samples will be shipped to The Forsyth Institute
      for Human Oral Microbe Identification using Next Generation Sequencing (HOMINGS) protocol.
