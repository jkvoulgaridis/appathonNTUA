  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of obesity is increasing and affects more than 650 million people of all ages
      to become one of the foremost global health threats. Obesity is a complex syndrome that can
      seriously impair health through a broad range of complications such as cardiovascular
      disease, type 1 and 2 diabetes (T1D and T2D), cancer, musculoskeletal disorders, psychosocial
      imbalances, and reduced quality of life, and impacts the treatment of other conditions.
      Weight reduction has been shown to have a positive effect on these co-morbidities and may
      increase the effectiveness of treatments specific for other co-morbidities. Lifestyle
      modification is an integral part of the weight management journey, but is often insufficient
      on its own, and can be complimented by pharmacological and surgical add-on treatments to
      achieve greater and more sustainable weight loss, as appropriate. It is likely that there are
      subgroups of patients that are more suited to certain types of treatment and results risk
      dilution of perceived efficacy unless these groups are identified and treatment is
      personalised. The aim of this project is to identify pathophysiologically and clinically
      meaningful subgroups of obesity by performing Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) approaches and
      network based algorithm that will allow the optimisation of prevention and treatment of
      obesity and its complications.

      Population study will be recruited at the Clinical Department of Internal Medicine and
      Specialistics, Department of Advanced Clinical and Surgical Sciences belonging to University
      of Campania &quot;Luigi Vanvitelli&quot;. This study will be performed according to the principles
      outlined in the Helsinki Declaration. Subcutaneous adipose tissues located in the surgical
      incision will be withdrawn without the use of surgical devices in order to avoid the
      degradation of the biological sample from 50 obese subjects (25 obese subjects with Type 2
      Diabetes vs 25 obese subjects without Type 2 Diabetes) undergoing bariatric surgery. As
      controls (n=50) we will recruit subcutaneous adipose tissues from patients without a clinical
      history of cardiovascular or dysmetabolic diseases undergoing to surgery for stress inguinal
      hernia. Clinical and demographic characteristics of the study population will be available
      from datasets generated by physicians.

      From tissue samples the genomic DNA and the total RNA will be extracted. Genomic DNA will be
      extracted by using DNeasy Blood &amp; Tissue kit (QIAGEN), according to manufacturer protocol.
      Pooled DNA samples consisting of equal quantities of DNA (2 µg) from cases and controls will
      be shipped to Genomix4Life Genomics and Bioinformatics Service, to perform a global DNA
      methylation analysis. For this aim, it will be used the Human Methylation 27K BeadChip
      platform by using Bisulfite conversion technology (BBRS-Seq). Total RNA will be extracted
      from tissues using RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN) according to manufacturer protocol. The cDNA
      library preparation will be performed starting from 4 ug of total RNA by using Illumina
      TruSeq Libraries and then sequenced at high coverage on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 NGS platform.
      Nucleic acid concentrations and quality control from Genomix4Life will be assessed by using
      Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and Qubit assay (Thermo Fisher
      Scientific) and TapeStation 4200 (Agilent). The weighted human DNA methylation PPI network
      (WMPN) will be construct to obtain a obesity interactome in both subgroups (obese and obese
      with T2D vs controls) based on differentially methylated genes in order to identify putative
      useful diagnostic biomarkers. The TargetScan algorithm , by searching the conserved seed
      pairing regions in the 3' untraslated regions (UTR) of genes based on whole genome alignment,
      will be used to robustly predict miRNA-target gene pairs from the same study population.
