    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the determinants of immunologic variance within the
      general healthy population.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Susceptibility to infections, disease severity, and response to medical therapies and
      vaccines are highly variable from one individual to another. While the question of variance
      in human populations continues to be a focal point of scientific research, medical practices
      and public health policies typically take a 'one size fits all' model to disease management
      and drug development.

      Individual heterogeneity in the immune response can have an enormous impact on the likelihood
      to respond to therapy or the development of side effects secondary to vaccine administration.
      Because of the complexity of immune responses in the individual and within the population, it
      has not been possible thus far to define the parameters (genetic or environmental) that
      constitute a healthy immune system and its natural occurring variability.

      Efforts to restore the 'personal' in medical care are the current challenge, and the driving
      vision of the project, to which the current study belongs.

      In order to realize the promise of personalized medicine, an in-depth understanding of the
      determinants of heterogeneity in host response to stress is required. The Milieu Interieur
      cohort was established to address these questions through a population systems immunology
      approach.
