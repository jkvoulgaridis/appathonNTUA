  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to understand how early intervention could impact reinnervation of
      the recurrent laryngeal nerve (which innervates the vocal cord), recovery of mobility of the
      paralyzed vocal cord and / or vocal recovery in the case of unilateral vocal fold paralysis.
      To achieve this goal we must therefore carry out a complete outcomes assessment of different
      intervention methods (voice therapy and injection laryngoplasty), which are offered to UVFP
      (unilateral vocal fold paralysis) patients in the early stage (&lt; 3 months). Their respective
      impacts on the central and peripheral nervous system and on the voice quality will be
      assessed, taking into account factors related to the severity of the paralysis.

    <description>The patients in the first group will receive an IL of hyaluronic acid in the paralyzed vocal fold within a maximum of three months after the onset of symptoms. The Ear-Noise-Throat (ENT) physician will perform the injection in office, under topical anaesthesia.</description>

    <description>Patients from the second group will be involved in 15 sessions of thirty minutes of voice therapy, twice a week, and will have to do home practice. Patients will have to record these training sessions. Initiation of this intervention should also take place within the first three months after the onset of symptoms. They will also receive an injection of physiological saline under the skin of the neck (sham of injection).</description>

    <description>The patients of the third group will be treated following the traditional wait-and-see policy. They will receive an injection of physiological saline under the skin of the neck and will be seen during 15 sessions of 30 minutes, twice a week. Therefore, this will be a sham procedure for both IL and VT.</description>

    <description>15 sessions of thirty minutes of voice therapy, twice a week, and home practice.
This voice management will be specific to unilateral vocal fold paralysis and will focus on three objectives: reinforcement of the vocal muscle, glottal closure and glottal opening. These three objectives will be worked through different vocal exercises (on voiced phonemes) and breathing exercises</description>
