  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate any difference in the extent and rate of
      absorption of doxylamine between the test (investigational medicinal product [IMP]) and
      reference products that could impact the bioavailability of the medication when administered
      under fasting conditions.

      The objective of the study is to compare the bioavailability of doxylamine between two oral
      delayed-release formulations containing the fixed-dose combination of doxylamine succinate 10
      milligrams (mg)/pyridoxine hydrochloride 10 mg

        -  A product of Tecnandina, S.A. TENSA (Test) and

        -  Diclegis (Registered Trademark), a product of Duchesnay Inc.(Reference)

      after an administration of a single dose equivalent to doxylamine succinate 20 mg and
      pyridoxine hydrochloride 20 mg (i.e., 2 tablets) under fasting conditions to determine
      bioequivalence in terms of rate and extent of absorption.

      Furthermore, the tolerability of the fixed-dose combination doxylamine succinate 10
      mg/pyridoxine hydrochloride 10 mg will be evaluated in healthy women in a dose equivalent to
      doxylamine succinate 20 mg and pyridoxine hydrochloride 20 mg.
