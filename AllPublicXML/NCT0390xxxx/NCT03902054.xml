    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, blinded and controlled phase II study to evaluate the safety and
      immunogenicity of a Sabin Inactivated Poliovirus Vaccine (sIPV) in Infants. A total of 600
      infants aged 2 months (60~90 days) were randomized to receive five different vaccination
      regimens: three experimental groups (1, 2, and 3) received three doses of sIPV with high,
      medium, and low D antigen content, respectively, on the month 0,1,2 schedule; two control
      groups (4 and 5) received three doses of conventional IPV (cIPV, manufactured by Sanofi
      Pasteur) or sIPV (manufactured by the Institute of Medical Biology, the Chinese Academy of
      Medical Biology), respectively, on the same schedule. Serum samples were collected before the
      1st dose and 30 days after the 3rd dose vaccination to assess the immunogenicity. Adverse
      events occurring within 30 days after each dose were collected to assess the safety.
