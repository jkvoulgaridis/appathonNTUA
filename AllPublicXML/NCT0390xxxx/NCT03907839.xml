    <textblock>
      This study was to examine the effect of endurance training combined with cognitive training
      in patients with COPD. The intervention group underwent Cognitive Training added to Endurance
      Training and the control group underwent only Endurance Training.

    <textblock>
      Pulmonary rehabilitation is an essential part of the management of COPD. Although various
      methods and therapies of PR have been used in COPD patients. Furthermore, the Cognitive
      Training has been performed people with mild cognitive impairments.

      Therefore, the combination of endurance training and cognitive tarining could be another
      alternative to improve the exercise tolerance and cognitive function in patients with COPD.
      It may also be useful for clinicians interested in designing new rehabilitation therapies.
      The aim of the study was to analyze the effect of CT combined with ET on exercise tolerance
      and cognitive functions in COPD patient.

    <measure>6 minute walk test</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The patients are instructed to cover the maximal distance in 6 min.Dyspnea was measured using Borg scale before the start of 6MWT and at the end of the test. Portable Spiropalm COSMED recorded heart rate (HR) and oxygen saturation (SpO2) continuously throughout the 6MWT. At the end of the 6MWT, the total covered distance was recorded.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Montreal cognitive assessment test</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The test, scored on a scale of 0-30 points, is designed to identify cognitive impairment by assessing multiple cognitive domains.
MOCA scores between 26 and 30 are considÂ¬ered normal, while scores &lt; 26 indicate cognitive impairment</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>P300 test</measure>
    <time_frame>2 days</time_frame>
    <description>The electroencephalogram signals were recorded with Fz, Cz, and Pz, electrodes. The P3b and P3a components were identified as the largest positive deflections between 250 ms and 500 ms, respectively, in the target and novel responses. Scalp electrode activity was measured at all electrode sites of which Fz, Cz, and Pz were analyzed. Fz, Cz, and Pz were chosen for analyses because ERPs responses are largest on the midline locations.</description>
