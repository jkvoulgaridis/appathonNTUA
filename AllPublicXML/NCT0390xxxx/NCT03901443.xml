  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to investigate the pruriception (i.e. the perception of the character and
      intensity of itch), the impact of itch on quality of life, the response to itch and the
      subjective efficacy and preferences of the different treatment options among patients with
      different skin diseases. Better insights into these aspects might help to optimize itch
      treatment in clinical Settings.
