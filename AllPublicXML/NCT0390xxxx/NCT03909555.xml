  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Short-term intensive insulin therapy (SIIT) is able to reverse β cell dysfunction and induce
      glycemic remission in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. On the other hand,
      intensive control of glucose and lifestyle modification are two key elements in preventing
      chronic complications, especially microvascular neuropathy. However, no study reported the
      long-term effect of SIIT on the chronic complications. In this multi-center, case-control
      study, effects of SIIT on the proportion of long-term chronic complications as well as
      potential biomarkers were investigated.

      In total, 777 patients with type 2 diabetes, including 259 patients who participated SIIT
      when diabetes was newly diagnosed and 518 patients who received routine diabetic therapy will
      be enrolled in 12 centers in China. After baseline assessments, all patients will undergo
      complications assessment, including records of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), carotid
      ultrasonography, electrocardiogram, echocardiography, fundus photography, urinary albumin
      excretion, Toronto Clinical Neuropathy Scale and Composite Autonomic Symptom Score. Primary
      endpoint is the difference in the proportions of macrovascular and microvascular
      complications between groups. Secondary endpoints include the difference of glucose control,
      insulin resistance, complexity of anti-diabetic therapy and self-management skills and
      quality of life between two groups. What's more, new biomarkers, which may indicate the
      occurrence of chronic complications of diabetes, such as circulating endothelial progenitor,
      β cell dysfunction, and T cells.

Patients were questioned about five aspects, including positive attitude, negative attitude, ability to care for their diabetes, belief in importance of care, and self-care adherence. Each statement included a 5-point ranking scale, ranging from strongly disagree (never) to strongly agree (always), with 3 points as neutral. Items under the subscales of positive attitude, care ability, importance of care, and self-care adherence scoring ≥4 points and items of negative attitude scoring≤2 points were designated as good performance, whereas the opposites were poor.</description>

The DQOL adopts a 5-point Likert scale for its response options. The scores range from 1, labeled as &quot;very satisfied,&quot; to 5, labeled as &quot;very dissatisfied,&quot; for items in the life satisfaction domain; from 1, labeled as &quot;never impacted,&quot; to 5, labeled as &quot;always impacted,&quot; for items in the diabetes impact domain; and from 1, labeled as &quot;never worried,&quot; to 5, labeled as &quot;always worried,&quot; for the social/vocational related and diabetes related worries domains.
