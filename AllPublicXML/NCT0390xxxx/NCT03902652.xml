  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When newborn babies are born without a heartbeat the clinical team has to provide breathing
      and chest compressions (what is call cardiopulmonary resuscitation) to the newborn baby.
      Cardiopulmonary resuscitation is an infrequent event in newborn babies (~1% of all
      deliveries), approximately one million newborn babies die annually due to lack of oxygen at
      birth causing being born without a heartbeat. Outcome studies of newborn babies receiving
      cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the delivery room have reported high rates of death and
      neurological impairment. This puts a heavy burden on health resources since these infants
      require frequent hospital re-admission and long-term care.

      The poor prognosis raises questions as improve cardiopulmonary resuscitation methods and
      specifically adapt them to newborn babies to improve outcomes. Currently a 3:1 ratio, which
      equals 3 chest compressions to one rescue breath to resuscitate a newborn baby. This means
      that chest compressions are stopped after every 3rd compression to give one rescue breath.
      The investigators believe that this interruption of chest compressions is bad for the newborn
      baby and that chest compressions should be continued without interruption while rescue
      breaths are given continuously. The investigators believe that this approach will allow us to
      reduce death and long-term burdens in newborn babies born without a heartbeat.

      Furthermore, it is not known if rescue breaths given with 100% oxygen or 21% oxygen (room
      air) is better for newborn babies.

      Using continuous chest compressions and rescue breaths without interruptions, this study will
      compare 21% with 100% oxygen.

    <description>Infants randomized into the &quot;21% oxygen CC+SI group&quot; will receive a SI with a PIP of 25-30 cmH2O while receiving chest compression.
The SI will be delivered over a period of 20 seconds. This will be followed by PEEP of 5-8 cm water fro 1sec. The use of 20sec SI will be repeated 3 times, which results to 60sec of chest compression. At that time the clinical team will perform an assessment of the newborn's heart rate.
If heart rate is &gt;60/min continue with standard care as per local hospital policy (standard hospital practice guideline). If heart rate remains &lt;60/min continue with CC+SI for another 20sec at which time a further assessment should be performed. If heart rate remains &lt;60/min continue with CC+SI.
During CC+SI the clinical team will only use 21% oxygen.</description>
