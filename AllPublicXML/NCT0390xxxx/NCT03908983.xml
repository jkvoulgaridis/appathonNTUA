    <textblock>
      KALIOS is indicated for the surgical treatment of mitral regurgitation by mitral valve
      repair.It is intended for mitral valve repair using conventional open heart or minimally
      invasive techniques.

      The KALIOS device is an adjustable annuloplasty ring, to be implanted by open surgery, having
      a hollow structure that comprises a flat rigid ring surrounding a deformable cage. The unique
      feature of KALIOS is that its annular shape and dimension can be finely adjusted
      percutaneously by an external actuator (three-balloon catheter) independently in the three
      areas corresponding to P1, P2 and P3

      The primary objective of this clinical investigation is to assess the safety and
      effectiveness of KALIOS for the surgical treatment of Mitral Regurgitation with optional
      intra-operative and/or post-operative adjustment(s) The secondary objectives are to
      investigate the effects of KALIOS for the surgical treatment of Mitral Regurgitation on
      cardiac function and on patient functional status This clinical trial is prospective,
      non-randomized, single arm, multicentric &amp; international. Up to 100 patients are expected to
      be enrolled to obtain 62 evaluable patients at one year,presenting with primary
      (degenerative) or secondary (functional) mitral valve regurgitation and who are candidate to
      a mitral valve repair.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        - Patients must meet ALL the following inclusion criteria :

          1. with primary or secondary mitral regurgitation recorded by TTE and confirmed during
             TEE where surgery for mitral valve repair is required with indications consistent with
             AHA/ACC and ESC/EACTS guidelines :

               1. primary (degenerative) : severe MR grade parameters (R Vol and EROA measured by
