        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed diagnosis at MSK of either (1) granulosa cell ovarian cancer,
             (2) low grade serous ovarian/ primary peritoneal cancer, or (3) endometrioid
             endometrial cancer; with PR expression ≥1% by IHC on archival tissue taken within the
             prior 3 years or new biopsy if no archival tissue is available. IHC results do not

          -  Measurable disease as defined by RECIST 1.1. Measurable disease is defined as at least
             one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension. Each lesion must
             be ≥10mm when measured by CT or MRI. Lymph nodes must be ≥15mm in short axis when
             measured by CT or MRI

          -  Patients must have had one prior chemotherapy regimen for management of disease. Note:
             additional lines of chemotherapy, biologic or immunotherapy are allowed.

          -  Recovery from effects of recent surgery, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy

          -  At least 4 weeks out from their last dose of radiation therapy

          -  At least 4 weeks post-op from any major surgical procedure

             therapy

          -  Must be ≥ 18 years of age

          -  Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) of ≥ 70%

             prior to commencement of study treatment

          -  Women of child bearing potential must use an effective form of contraception during
             study and for at least 6 months after completion of study treatment

          -  Laboratory Test Findings performed within 14 days prior to initiation of study drug
             showing:

          -  Bone marrow function:

          -  History of prior hormonal therapy (i.e., megesterol acetate, tamoxifen or aromatase
             inhibitors) for treatment cancer within the 28 days before starting study drug

          -  Any psychological, familial, sociological or geographic condition that would

             medical treatment. Patients with a history of hypertension are allowed provided blood
             pressure is controlled by anti-hypertensive treatment.

          -  Refractory nausea and vomiting, requirement for parenteral hydration and/or nutrition,
             drainage gastrostomy tube, malabsorption, external biliary shunt, or significant small
             bowel resection that would preclude adequate study drug absorption

          -  Anticipated or ongoing administration of anti-cancer therapies other than those
             administered in this study

          -  Use of any prescription medication during the prior 28 days of first onapristone
             dosing that the investigator judges is likely to interfere with onapristone activity;
