  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study assesses: (1) the impact of the Relax, Be Aware, Do a Personal Rating (RAP) Club,
      a school-based prevention program for urban eighth graders, on students' emotional
      functioning and education outcomes; (2) potential moderators and mediators of RAP Club's
      effects; and (3) factors related to the implementation of RAP Club, including cost of
      delivery and perceptions of key stakeholders.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Youth in low-income urban communities are often exposed to chronic stress and trauma, which
      poses risk for emotional, behavioral, and academic problems. This study will evaluate the
      impact of RAP Club, a trauma-informed school-based prevention program intended to promote
      positive emotional and academic development for eighth graders. Participants will be randomly
      assigned within schools to receive RAP Club or Healthy Topics, a health education active
      control condition.

      The study will achieve the following specific aims:

        1. Test whether students randomized to RAP Club have improved academic, social-emotional,
           and behavioral outcomes as compared to those randomized to Healthy Topics (e.g.,
           student-reported mood and stress; teacher-rated academic performance; academic record
           data).

        2. Explore potential moderators (e.g., baseline trauma exposure, emotional regulation) and
           mediators (e.g., changes in self-regulation and emotional symptoms) of RAP Club's
           effects.

        3. Evaluate factors related to program implementation, including cost of delivering RAP
           Club versus Healthy Topics and perceptions of key stakeholders (teachers, group
           facilitators, students) regarding intervention acceptability and sustainability.

    <measure>Teacher Rating of Social Competence Scale (TRSCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Past three weeks</time_frame>
    <description>31-item teacher-rated scale of student classroom behavior using a 6-point Likert scale. Means are calculated for each subscale (Aggressive Behaviors, Oppositional Behavior, Attention and Concentration, Social and Emotional Competence). Higher scores reflect a higher level of that particular construct.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Past 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Made up of 5 scales (Emotional Symptoms, Conduct Problems, Hyperactivity, Peer Problems, Prosocial Behavior). Several items (7, 21, 25, 11, and 14) are reverse coded. Total difficulties score is created by summing scores from all scales except the prosocial scale. The score ranges from 0-40 and is counted as missing if one of the 4 component scores is missing.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Academic Competence Evaluation Scale (ACES)</measure>
    <time_frame>Past 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>10-item teacher report of student academic functioning with 3 subscales (Engagement, Motivation, Academic Performance) that is rated on a 5-point Likert scale. Mean of items 1-9 provides the total score; subscales are calculated by taking the mean of relevant items. Higher scores indicate more academic competence.</description>

    <time_frame>Past 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>17-item self-report measure of trauma symptoms using a 4-point Likert scale. Items are summed to produce a total score. Higher scores indicate more trauma symptoms.</description>

    <time_frame>Past 7 days</time_frame>
    <description>4-item self-report measure of anxiety symptoms using a 5-point Likert scale. Items are summed and then converted to standardized t score. Higher scores reflect higher frequency of anxiety symptoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Children's Depression Inventory - Short Form (CDI-S)</measure>
    <time_frame>Past 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>10-item self-report measure of depressive symptoms using a 5-point Likert scale. Items are summed to create a score ranging from 0-20; cutoffs can be used to determine depression severity. Higher scores reflect greater frequency of depression symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Youth Outcome Questionnaire Self-Report (YOQSR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Past week</time_frame>
    <description>64-item measure of youth psychological symptoms using a 5-point Likert scale. Items are summed to produce a total score, with higher scores indicating more psychological symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Brief Cope</measure>
    <time_frame>Past 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>28-item self-report measure of coping using a 4-point Likert scale. We intend to score this measure by using factor analysis to identify sub scales. In previous research, we have identified an adaptive subscale and maladaptive sub scale using this method. Higher scores indicate greater frequency of using a particular coping method.</description>

    <time_frame>Past 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>14-item self-report measure of rumination using a 4-point Likert scale. Mean score is calculated excluding item 14. Higher scores reflect greater tendency to engage in a ruminative response style.</description>

    <intervention_name>Healthy Topics</intervention_name>
    <description>Co-investigator Dr. Sibinga developed the Healthy Topics curriculum to function as an active control condition for randomized controlled trials in both clinic-based and school-based studies of mindfulness instruction for urban youth. Adapted from the Glencoe Health Curriculum (McGraw Hill), it was designed to control for the effects of a positive adult, time and attention, a small group learning environment, engaged instruction, and interesting material. The Healthy Topics curriculum has been successfully implemented as an effective active control condition, with student engagement and participation comparable to the intervention arm. The curriculum includes information about nutrition, exercise, sleep, drug use, and other topics related to physical health.</description>

    <ipd_description>The final study data will be computerized datasets that include demographic, behavioral, and emotional information. Data will be redacted to strip all subject identifiers. Datasets will be archived with The Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) at the Institute for Social Research.
ICPSR will provide: (1) data preparation tasks, which include reviewing data for confidentiality and usability, creation of a metadata record, generation of multiple data formats for dissemination and preservation, as well as assignment of a Digital Object Identifier (DOI); and (2) documentation to accompany the quantitative data including codebooks, variable and value labels for two quantitative data files containing up to 200 variables.
A copy of the qualitative data with all identifying information redacted will be placed in ICPSR's data hosting service (openICPSR.org). A digital object identifier (DOI) will be issued for the files from this project.</ipd_description>
