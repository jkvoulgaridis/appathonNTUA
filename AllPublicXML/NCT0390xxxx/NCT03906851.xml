    <textblock>
      The study examine possible changes in physical activity, nutrition, and psychosocial health
      following the intervention &quot;Active and Healthy Kids in Telemark&quot;. The intervention schools
      will received the intervention, whereas the control schools will continue as usual.

      School based, health promoting interventions with focus on increase physical activity and
      improved nutrition seems to be a good solution to the challenges with low physical activity
      level, poor physical fitness, poor nutrition and psychosocial health challenges among
      children and adolescents. Low physical activity levels and physical fitness is recognized as
      one of the major public health challenges in the 21st century, and it negatively affects
      cognitive skills and academic performances. Providing school based health promoting
      interventions makes it easier to reach all children and adolescents regardless of social and
      cultural background, and hence reduce social inequalities in health.

    <description>KIDSCREEN-27 (unabbreviated name) is a 27 item self-report instrument for health-related quality of life in children and adolescents. Each item is scored on a Likert scale from 1 to 5. The scores of each item are clustered into five dimensions: Physical Well-Being, Psychological Well-Being, Autonomy &amp; Parents, Peers &amp; Social Support and School Environment. Each dimension, or subscale, is scored as Rasch scales (i.e., sum of item scores for each subscale, transform the raw sumscores into Rasch person parameter estimates and T-values according to the KIDSCREEN-27 manual (KIDSCREEN group Europe, 2006)). For all these dimensions, higher Rasch scores and T-scores indicate better quality of life according to that given dimension.</description>
