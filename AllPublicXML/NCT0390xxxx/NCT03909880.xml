      This study explores the sensorimotor control effect of kinesio tape and confirms additional
      tension can influence the effect of kinesio tape. Kinesio tape will be taped on wrist flexor.
      There are three types of taping, one is taped with additional 20% tension, another is taped
      with neutral tension, the other is without taping. All participants will receive all types of
      taping. Our hypothesis is taping will improve wrist sensorimotor control and 20% additional
      tension will improve more than neutral tension.

    <textblock>
      Wrist and hand function is important in our daily life. People can do movement with proper
      force output and joint position sense due to sensorimotor control. In addition, people with
      better sensorimotor control have lower risk of injury.

      According to some researches, the investigators can improve wrist sensorimotor control with
      kinesio taping. However, there is no study comparing whether kinesio taping with additional
      tension improve sensorimotor control more than kinesio taping with neutral tension. In
      addition, many wrist movements in life are related to grip and the dominant muscle of
      grasping is wrist flexor. No research explores whether improving wrist sensorimotor control
      with kinesio taping on wrist flexor. Therefore, the investigators want to explore the effect
      of kinesio taping on wrist flexor sensorimotor control in healthy people.

    <description>Kinesio taping(kinesio taping;kinesio holding corporation,USA) is given between the pretest and the posttest. The taping is operated by a physical therapist who is the co-host of this experiment in 614 room, Research Building, National Yang-Ming University. Posttest will be started immediately after taping. After posttest, kinesio tape will be removed. There are 3 types of taping conditions. Kinesio tape is pulled from 5 cm distal wrist joint line to medial epicondyle and 5 cm at both ends of the head and tail without tension .All participants will receive all conditions of taping. They will be randomly assigned to any taping conditions. In order to wash out the effect of taping, the interval of any condition is at least 7 days.</description>
