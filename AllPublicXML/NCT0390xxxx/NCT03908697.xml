      •The Pilot study will involve current Marquette Method users who own and use a ClearBlue
      Fertility monitor and who will be asked to simultaneously use the Mira monitor for the sake
      of comparing the two devices to monitor the menstrual cycle.

      -  The Mira fertility monitoring system (www.miracare.com) is a new home-use hormone
           tracking device with the ability to quantitatively measure reproductive hormones in the
           urine but is also synced to a smart phone App that provides a graphic representation of
           the hormonal levels throughout a menstrual cycle.

        -  The Mira monitor will be compared to the ClearBlue Fertility Monitor for its ease of
           use, satisfaction, and accuracy.

        -  The Mira hormonal monitor and App system has not been tested for its use in Natural
           Family Planning (NFP).

        -  The Pilot study will involve current Marquette Method users who own and use a ClearBlue
           Fertility monitor and who will be asked to simultaneously use the Mira monitor for the
           sake of comparing the two devices.

        -  Female participants invited to participate will need to meet the following criteria:

        -  Age 18 to 42 years

        -  Menstrual cycle ranging between 21-42 days

        -  At least 3 cycles after cessation of breastfeeding

        -  Not currently on medications that affect ovulation and 3 months prior

        -  Not currently pregnant or breastfeeding

        -  No known fertility problems

        -  Not planning on achieving pregnancy during the 3 menstrual cycles of the study
