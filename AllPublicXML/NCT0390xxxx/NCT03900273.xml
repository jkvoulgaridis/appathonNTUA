  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol focuses on novel measures of cognition and everyday function that have robust
      psychometrics and reduced practiced effects. They will be deployed in a parallel group study
      in which participants are randomized to assessment type (novel vs established) and receive
      serial assessments over a one year period in order to highlight contrasts between novel and
      established measures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This protocol has the goal of validating novel cognitive and everyday functional measures
      that have sharply attenuated practice effects and are not prone to ceiling effects for use in
      preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) trials in which participants are cognitively within
      normal limits. To implement this, we will conduct an innovative parallel group study in which
      320 healthy, non-cognitively impaired older subjects are randomized to one of two groups
      based on assessment type (novel instruments vs. established) and receive three serial
      assessments over a one year period. Novel cognitive measures include tests of executive
      function, episodic memory, and processing speed combined into a single composite. Novel
      functional measures involve computerized performance based, ecologically relevant
      instrumental activities. We will compare our novel No Practice Effects (NPE) cognitive
      battery and Miami Computerized Functional Assessment Scale (CFAS) against established
      measures that include the ADAS-COG in order to determine which battery (novel or established)
      has better psychometric properties and is less sensitive to practice effects in this clinical
      trials structure.

    <description>Novel computerized measure of everyday function. Testing format is a set of simulations (ATM use, Kiosk ticket purchase , Prescription refill , and Doctor's visit ). We will construct a z score based on the &quot;rate&quot; measure which accounts for both speed and accuracy. Higher scores suggest greater cognitive function while lower scores indicate greater cognitive impairment.</description>

    <description>Novel measure of cognitive function. Scores can be age-adjusted by decade. The majority of the subtests ( including tests of Cognitive Control/Executive Processes, Working Memory,Speed of Processing,Verbal Fluency and Episodic Memory)are computerized or partially computerized. All tests have three equivalent alternate forms. We will construct a z-score averaged composite based on scores of the subtests at baseline. Higher scores suggest greater cognitive function while lower scores indicate greater cognitive impairment.</description>
