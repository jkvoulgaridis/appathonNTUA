  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women with intramural myoma not reaching the endometrial cavity will be randomized to either
      open myomectomy or no intervention . The participants will be assessed through full
      history-taking with special consideration to age and the duration, type, and cause of
      infertility. The medical examination included general, abdominal, and vaginal examinations.
      Finally, an ultrasonography examination was performed to check for the presence of three or
      more preantral follicles and to exclude ovarian cysts. On day 3 of a natural cycle, a
      baseline levels of FSH, luteinizing hormone (LH),

      , estradiol and anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH).Ovarian stimulation was performed using a long,
      antagonist, or short protocol. They were assigned to one of the 2 groups according to having
      an intramural myoma not indenting the cavity or not. All will be followed up by transvaginal
      ultrasonography . When two or more follicles had reached a mean diameter of 18 mm, oocyte
      maturation was triggered by intramuscular administration of hCG. Embryo transfer will be done
      at day 2, 3 or 5 according to the circumstances.
