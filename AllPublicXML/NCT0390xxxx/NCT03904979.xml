  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: The investigators hypothesize that exposure to chronic environmental stress is a
      risk factor for adverse pregnancy outcomes related to preterm birth and preeclampsia among
      high-risk pregnant women. Additionally, the investigators hypothesize that women can be
      screened for high levels of environmental stress through the perceived stress scale, and
      therapeutic writing can be used as a low-resource intervention to help decrease maternal
      perceived stress and inflammation - measured through analysis of maternal serum and placental
      samples.

      Participants: Pregnant women at high risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes, including
      pre-eclampsia and preterm birth, enrolled in prenatal care at UNC will be recruited for
      participation

      Procedures: Using results from the perceived stress scale, the investigators will identify
      women who screen positive for high environmental stress. Women meeting inclusion criteria
      will be contacted for possible participation at regularly scheduled prenatal visits. Women
      who are enrolled will be randomized to generalized writing prompts, therapeutic writing
      prompts, or no writing during their pregnancy to be administered at each prenatal visit.
      Maternal blood sample for biochemical markers of stress and gene expression will be obtained
      at the initial visit; a followup blood sample will be obtained later in pregnancy, and a
      small portion of the placenta saved at delivery. Delivery outcomes will be obtained through
      medical record review.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During pregnancy, women regularly interact with healthcare professionals, an often untapped
      resource and opportune time to optimize mental health, positively impacting outcomes.
      Cumulative psychosocial stress is a risk factor for several adverse obstetric outcomes
      including preterm birth (PTB), preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, and postpartum
      depression.

      The overarching hypothesis of this study is that pregnant women with high levels of stress
      can be identified through easily-implemented screening tools; importantly, the investigators
      propose that these women can be engaged in care via a cost-effective therapeutic writing
      intervention combined with the availability of expert pastoral and perinatal psychiatry
      resources.

      Women will be enrolled early in pregnancy and followed prospectively. Some women (if
      randomized to a writing group) will complete a standardized writing prompt at several time
      points during gestation. The investigators will follow their outcomes prospectively.
