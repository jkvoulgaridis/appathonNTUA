  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effecacy and safety of dialysis centers
      switching its dialysis patients from using recombinant human erythropoietin injection (CHO
      Cell) (ESPO) to Pegol-Sihematide injection on hemoglobin levels and other parameters.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 3, randomized, multicenter, open-label, active-controlled, non-inferiority
      trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of from ESPO to monthly Pegol-Sihematide injection
      for the treatment of anemia in participants with chronic kidney disease（CKD）, who are on
      maintenance dialysis. Study included a period of 4 weeks for screening, 8 weeks for baseline,
      16 weeks for dose adjustment, 8 weeks for evaluation, and 28 weeks for extensional treatment
      period. All patients who passed the screening were received ESPO in baseline period, then,
      eligible patients were centrally allocated in a 2:1 ratio to receive Pegol-Sihematide or
      ESPO. Doses of both drugs were adjusted to achieve and maintain hemoglobin levels between
      10.0 and 12.0 g per deciliter for 52 weeks or more. The primary efficacy end point was the
      mean change from the baseline hemoglobin level to the mean level during the evaluation
      period; non-inferiority was established if the lower limit of the two-sided 95% confidence
      interval was -1.0 g per deciliter or higher. Cardiovascular safety was evaluated on the basis
      of an adjudicated composite end point.

    <description>The primary efficacy end point is the mean change from the baseline hemoglobin level to the mean level during the evaluation period. The baseline hemoglobin value is defined as the mean of three hemoglobin values: the 4 weeks and 2 weeks recent hemoglobin values taken prior to the day of randomization and the value obtained on the day of randomization. The mean hemoglobin during the evaluation period was calculated as the mean of all available hemoglobin values during that period. Hemoglobin measurements will be performed at baseline and thereafter every 2 weeks (for the dose adjustment and the evaluation periods) or every 4 weeks (for the extensional treatment period).</description>
