  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The adequacy of the currently used dosing regimen of glycopeptides (vancomycin and
      teicoplanin) and beta-lactam antibiotics (amoxicillin-clavulanic acid,
      piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftazidim) in patients with end-stage kidney disease receiving
      intermittent hemodialysis is studied by evaluating pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics (PK-PD)
      target attainment. A population pharmacokinetic study is performed to assist the selection of
      the optimal individualized dose for patients undergoing intermittent dialysis, taking into
      consideration as many relevant variables as possible.

    <description>The antibiotic administration protocol is not changed for this study. From the first administration on, administrations (dosage and duration) are well documented. Blood samples are taken as peak, distribution and trough samples during at least 24 or 48 hours. During the first dialysis session after study start, blood samples are also taken from the arterial and venous blood line simultaneously and at different dialysis time points, to calculate dialyzer extraction ratio. When appropriate, urine is collected during a documented period. During the second dialysis after study start, arterial and venous samples are taken for different dialysis settings, in order to calculate extraction ratios for different settings.
All blood and urine samples are analyzed for amoxicillin-clavulanic acid.</description>
