  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Respiratory failure is characterized by low levels of oxygen and high levels of carbon
      dioxide in the blood which causes difficulty breathing. The management of patients with
      respiratory failure aims at improving oxygenation, and decreasing the effort required to
      breathe. Mechanical ventilation is a life-saving treatment, but may be associated with a high
      mortality rate, increased length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay and infection. Oxygenation
      techniques to avoid mechanical ventilation include standard oxygen therapy, continuous
      positive pressure (CPAP) and high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy (HFNC). CPAP consists of
      delivering oxygen through a mask. As compared to standard oxygen therapy, CPAP can promote
      lung recruitment leading to improved oxygenation and decreased work of breathing in patients
      with respiratory failure. Conversely, high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy (HFNC) delivers
      oxygen through nasal prongs. Oxygen is heated and humidified and can be delivered at
      different flows (from 10 - 60 L/min). As compared to standard oxygen therapy, HFNC can
      promote some lung recruitment leading to improved oxygenation, and decreased work of
      breathing. Therefore, the present study will compare the physiological effects of different
      flows of HFNC to CPAP in healthy volunteers. The investigators hypothesize that the
      physiological effects of HFNC in the nasopharynx are comparable to that of CPAP at 4 cm H2O.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>End expiratory nasopharyngeal pressure (NP)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint is to compare the end expiratory nasopharyngeal pressure (NP) under 60 L/min of high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP 4 cmH2O). This will be assessed using a nasopharyngeal catheter.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in physiologic variables of airway pressure at different flows of HFNC (20, 40, and 60 L/min) and CPAP (4 cmH20).</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>One of the secondary endpoints is to compare variables of airway pressure at different flows of HFNC to CPAP. We will measure the end expiratory NP, mean NP, mean peak inspiratory pressure, mean peak expiratory pressure, delta inspiratory pressure and delta expiratory pressure.
Each of these variables will be measured for 1 minute using a nasopharyngeal catheter. Furthermore, at each flow of HFNC, we will ask the patient to breathe with their mouth open and mouth closed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in end-expiratory lung impedance</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>The other secondary endpoint is to compare the change in ventilation distribution and end-expiratory lung impedance at different flows of HFNC and CPAP. These variables will be measured using electrical impedance tomography (EIT) by placing a band around the chest of each participant.</description>
