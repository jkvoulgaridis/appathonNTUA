      The main objective of this trial is to investigate the pharmacodynamic effects of a single
      dose of BI 1358894 on CCK-4- induced anxiogenic/ panic-like symptoms using the PSS in
      preselected CCK-4 sensitive healthy volunteers.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male subjects according to the assessment of the investigator, as based on a
             complete medical history including a physical examination, vital signs (Blood Pressure
             (BP), Pulse Rate (PR)), 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical laboratory tests

          -  Age of 18 to 55 years (inclusive)

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) of 18.5 to 29.9 kg/m2 (inclusive)

             accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and local legislation

          -  Willingness to comply with contraception requirements. Subjects who are sexually
             active must use adequate contraception with their female partner throughout the study

               -  Sexual abstinence or

               -  A vasectomy performed at least 1 year prior to screening (with medical assessment
                  of the surgical success) or

               -  Surgical sterilisation (including bilateral tubal occlusion, hysterectomy or
                  bilateral oophorectomy) of the subject's female partner or

               -  Postmenopausal, defined as at least 1 year of spontaneous amenorrhea (in
                  questionable cases a blood sample with FSH above 40 U/L and estradiol below 30
                  ng/L is confirmatory) or

               -  The use of condoms, if the female partner uses an adequate contraception method
                  in addition, e.g., intrauterine device (IUD), hormonal contraception (e.g.
                  implants, injectables, combined oral or vaginal contraceptives) that started at
                  least 2 months prior to first drug administration, or barrier method (e.g.
                  diaphragm with spermicide)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any finding in the medical examination (including Blood Pressure (BP), Pulse Rate (PR)
             or Electrocardiogram (ECG)) deviating from normal and assessed as clinically relevant
             by the investigator

          -  Repeated measurement of systolic blood pressure outside the range of 90 to 140 mmHg,
             diastolic blood pressure outside the range of 50 to 90 mmHg, or pulse rate outside the
             range of 50 to 90 bpm

          -  C-Reactive Protein &gt;ULN, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) ≥15 millimeters/h, liver
             or kidney parameter above ULN,

          -  Any laboratory value outside the reference range that the investigator considers to be
             of clinical relevance

          -  Any evidence of a concomitant disease assessed as clinically relevant by the
             investigator

          -  Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic,
             immunological or hormonal disorders

          -  Cholecystectomy or other surgery of the gastrointestinal tract that could interfere
             with the pharmacokinetics of the trial medication (except appendectomy or simple
             hernia repair)

          -  Diseases of the central nervous system (including but not limited to any kind of
             seizures or stroke), and other relevant neurological or psychiatric disorders

             medication, CCK-4 or its excipients)

          -  Use of drugs within 30 days of planned administration of trial medication that might
             reasonably influence the results of the trial (including drugs that cause QT/QTc
             interval prolongation)

          -  Intake of an investigational drug in another clinical trial within 60 days of planned
             administration of investigational drug in the current trial, or concurrent

          -  Smoker (more than 5 cigarettes or 3 cigars or 3 pipes per day)

          -  Drug abuse or positive drug screening

          -  Blood donation of more than 100 mL within 30 days of planned administration of trial
             medication or intended blood donation during the trial

             administration of trial medication or during the trial

          -  Inability to comply with the dietary regimen of the trial site

          -  A marked baseline prolongation of QT/QTc interval (such as QTc intervals that are
             repeatedly greater than 450 ms) or any other relevant Electrocardiogram (ECG) finding
             at screening

          -  A history of additional risk factors for Torsade de Pointes (such as heart failure,
             hypokalaemia, or family history of Long QT Syndrome)

          -  Subject is assessed as unsuitable for inclusion by the investigator, for instance,
             because the subject is not considered able to understand and comply with study
             requirements, or has a condition that would not allow safe participation in the study

          -  Any lifetime history of suicidal behaviour (i.e. actual attempt, interrupted attempt,
             aborted attempt, or preparatory acts or behaviour)

          -  Any suicidal ideation of type 2 to 5 on the C-SSRS in the past 12 months (i.e. active
             suicidal thought, active suicidal thought with method, active suicidal thought with
             intent but without specific plan, or active suicidal thought with plan and intent)
