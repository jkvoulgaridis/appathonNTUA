  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study researchers want to learn more about the effect of low-dose Aspirin on cancer
      that develops in the colon (the longest part of the large intestine) and/or the rectum (the
      last several inches of the large intestine before the anus), diseases that affects the heart
      or blood vessels and safety outcomes. Study will focus on two groups of adults aged 50-59 and
      60-69 years having an increased risk of heart and/or blood vessel disease who are taking
      either low-dose aspirin or no low-dose aspirin for heart and/or blood vessel disease
      prevention. The model will be based on information publicly available either on government
      organization websites or in scientific journals. Based on these data researchers will focus
      in a first step to build a model of 2 million adults (1 million for each age group) for the
      UK population and in a second step, the model will be modified for use with other European
      countries, to reflect the epidemiology and guidelines for aspirin use in these countries.

      Observational Study Model is selected as &quot;Other&quot; - Reason: Individual-level state transition
      model simulating the number of events of CRC, CVD, safety events and deaths in hypothetical
      cohorts of 1 million adults aged 50-59 years and 1 million adults aged 60-69 years followed
      for 20 years or till death, whichever comes first. The hypothetical cohorts are reflective of
      a population eligible for taking aspirin for primary or secondary CVD prevention.

      Time Perspective is also selected as &quot;Other&quot;

      - Reason: Individual-level state transition model built mimicking the UK population using
      data published in scientific international peer-reviewed journals or published data from
      government agencies. In a second phase, the model results will be extrapolated to other EU
      countries, modifying the model parameters to reflect the other EU countries epidemiology.
