  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies have shown that ethnic-racial minority elders are more likely to be neglected from
      appropriate dementia care in time than the white counterparts. Among minorities group, Korean
      Americans (KAs) are the 4th largest and one of the most rapidly growing Asian subpopulations
      and have been characterized as under-resourced and underserved population of dementia care.
      This research is being done to understand how an education and navigation support program led
      by trained community health workers (CHWs) helps Korean American elders with probable
      dementia and the Korean American elders' caregivers. In a 2-arm randomized controlled trial
      (RCT) with 288 dyads, the investigators' aims are to (1) test the effect of a community-based
      intervention delivered by trained CHWs for undiagnosed KA elders with probable dementia and
      the KA elders' caregivers, (2) evaluate the effect of the PLAN on improving caregiver's
      dementia literacy, self-efficacy in dementia care and service use, social support,
      depression, and quality of life at 6 months in comparison to usual care, and (3) examine
      whether the effect of PLAN differs across age, sex, English proficiency and education
      caregiver subgroups. Exploratory Aim is to test the effect of PLAN on Korean elders with
      probable dementia and caregiver development of a plan regarding dementia care at 6 months in
      comparison to usual care.

      Aim 1 and Exploratory Aim test the following hypotheses: (1) Korean elders with probable
      dementia who receive the PLAN will have higher rates of linkage to medical service for
      dementia than those in the control group (Aim 1) and (2) Korean elders with probable dementia
      and the KA elders' caregivers who receive the PLAN will have higher rates of having a plan
      for dementia care than those in the control group (Exploratory Aim). Aim 2 tests the
      following hypothesis: Caregivers in the PLAN group will have higher dementia literacy,
      self-efficacy in dementia care and service use, social support, and quality of life, and
      lower depression than those in the control group.

    <intervention_model_description>Our study will use PRECEDE-PROCEED model for planning and evaluation of interventions to address our intervention delivery model using trained community health workers (CHWs) and community-participatory approaches. Predisposing factors of sociodemographic characteristics like caregiver age, gender, level of education, and English proficiency and the KA elder's Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) score will be considered as covariates. Enabling factors for the study include caregiver's dementia literacy and self-efficacy in dementia care, and the KA elder's access to medical care, and reinforcing factors include social support and primary physician recommendation for cognitive testing.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Dementia literacy test is a 11-item instrument (true or false). Scoring of the dementia literacy instrument is in such a way that each correct response will be coded as 1 whereas incorrect response will be coded as 0. Total scores can range from 0 to 11 with higher scores indicating higher health literacy.</description>

Scoring of the dementia self-efficacy scale ranges from &quot;not at all certain&quot; coded as 1 to &quot;very certain&quot; coded as 10 for each item.

    <description>Group 1 will receive the study intervention during the 6 months of the study, after the first baseline questionnaire. The intervention is as follows: participants will be asked to take part in a one-time, one-hour education in participants' home or any community location that is most convenient for the participants by a trained community health worker. An educational resource that participants can read at home will be provided at the end of education session. Participants' community health worker will call the participants monthly to identify barriers to dementia care and help participants and participants' elder with making an appointment or transportation to the health care facility, when participants request for assistance.</description>
