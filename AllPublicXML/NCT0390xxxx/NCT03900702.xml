  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a planning project with a clinical trial pilot to prepare for a larger fully powered
      clinical trial. Goals of this pilot project are: to identify and address any modifications of
      the games required for adaptation to diminished sensory abilities; to optimize training
      dosage and test timing of retention of effects; and to test and refine the battery of outcome
      assessments. Primary outcome assessment are tests of attention distraction (subtest from a
      Useful Field of View Test). This pilot will explore a number of secondary outcome measures
      including EEG and functional imaging biomarkers of change, measures of general cognitive
      improvement and measures of function including a driving simulator task.

      This is a planning trial to optimize procedures for a larger clinical trial. Participants
      will be randomized into one of two groups--an active group that has intervention training
      after initial visit and a wait control group that begins intervention after 12 weeks. All
      participants will receive in-lab baseline testing including IQ (WASI-II), a
      medical/psychiatric history questionnaire, a depression screen (Geriatric Depression Scale
      Short Form) and a pre-training battery that includes selected tests from the NIH toolbox, the
      Repeatable Battery for Neuropsychological Status (RBANS), a Useful Field of View task (UFOV),
      a driving simulator task, a dual (motor-cognitive) task, an n-back task with and without
      distractors(with EEG) and 6 minutes of resting state EEG. Participants will be trained to use
      the game system and play the game at the pre-training in-lab visit. Participants will be
      provided with a PC with eye-tracker that has training game software installed. Participants
      will play intervention training games at home for 8-12 weeks with in-lab assessments (the
      pre-training battery described above). Participants will be asked to play the training games
      a minimum of 5 times per week for 30 minutes at a time. Compliance will be monitored daily
      over a secure internet connection. If a participant has played less than the required time in
      a given week, a research associate will contact the participant to inquire about potential
      problems and to encourage the participant to resume or increase training time. The first
      group of 36 participants will receive post-training assessments at 8 weeks, 12 weeks and 6
      months. The second group of 36 participants will have an additional pre-training session with
      structural and functional imaging and will receive only pre- and post-training assessment.
