      Introduction:

      Femoro-acetabular impingement is a well known cause of damage to the acetabular labrum and
      chondrolabral junction. Additionally, it has been proposed that disruption of hip
      biomechanics resulting from a labral tear causes a faster progression towards osteoarthritis
      (OA). This progression has been observed to begin with breakdown of the chondrolabral
      junction with later development of diffuse osteoarthritis. Use of hip arthroscopy has
      increased dramatically in recent years to treat symptomatic labral tears and potentially
      avoid the morbidity and cost associated with hip osteoarthritis.

      Correction of labral pathology presents a technical challenge and many techniques currently
      exist. Increased understanding of the structure-functional relationship dictated by labral
      anatomy has led to the development of methods aimed at restoring functional anatomy by
      re-establishing the labrum's native position and contour on the rim of the acetabulum.
      Therefore, akin to repairing a torn meniscus in the knee, restoring the anatomic footprint of
      a torn labrum will reconstitute normal joint biomechanics.

      Despite the advances in techniques for labral repair, strategies for mitigating or repairing
      damage to the chondrolabral junction do not yet exist. This area has been shown to consist of
      hyaline and fibro cartilage. Many techniques for cartilage repair exist, although most are
      not feasible due to technical challenges specific to the hip joint.

      The management of articular cartilage defects is one of the most challenging clinical
      problems for orthopaedic surgeons. Articular cartilage has a limited intrinsic healing
      capacity, and pathology frequently results in gradual tissue deterioration. Currently, the
      standard surgical intervention for end-stage degenerative joint pathology is total joint
      replacement. Early surgical interventions for symptomatic cartilage lesions including cell
      based therapies such as autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI), bone marrow aspirate
      concentrate (BMAC) implantation, or microfracture have been suggested to restore normal joint
      congruity and minimize further joint deterioration. Techniques such as ACI, which have been
      successfully used in the knee joint, have limited application in the hip due to the technical
      difficulties of open procedures.

      The acetabular labrum is a wedge shaped fibrocartilage structure attached to the acetabular
      rim. It is continuous with the transverse acetabular ligament at the inferior aspect of the
      acetabulum. The medial aspect of the labrum abuts the acetabulum to form the chondrolabral
      junction.

      Anatomic labral refixation aims to preserve healthy tissue and restore native joint anatomy
      and biomechanics. Labral tears that are caused by Femoro-Acetubular Impingement (FAI) require
      concomitant correction of bony cam lesions, pincer lesions, or both to prevent reinjury of
      the labrum. However, repair has not yet been proven to mitigate the osteoarthritic
      accelerating effects of labral tears. Many patients presenting with hip pain in the third and
      fourth decade of life already have osteoarthritic changes seen at the time of arthroscopy.
      Restoring the biomechanics of the joint via labral repair does not reverse this damage and
      investigating methods to repair early osteoarthritis is important to the future of hip
      arthroscopy.

      Bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) has been used effectively in many joints for the
      management of chondral defect repair. As an alternative to the aforementioned chondral
      treatment modalities, BMAC treatment does not require multiple procedures or additional
      waiting time for treatment completion.

      Within the technical constraints of the hip joint, bone marrow aspirate concentrate is
      feasible and potentially efficacious option for the treatment of chondral defects. Late stage
      hip osteoarthritis is a known factor implicated in poor outcomes in both the surgical and
      non-surgical treatment options available for chondral defect management. Preventing late
      stage hip osteoarthritis is paramount to decrease these poor outcomes and improve the
      patient's quality of life. Early and effective intervention with modalities that afford
      patients little to no drawbacks, like BMAC treatment, are necessary to achieve these goals.

      This is a 24-month prospective study, which will enroll 40 adult subjects with evidence of an
      acetabular labrum tear and pincer deformity. Labral tears will be diagnosed by clinical exam
      and positive magnetic resonance arthrogram (MRA) findings. Pincer deformity is diagnosed with
      standard antero-posterior radiographs of the pelvis.

      Administration of diagnostic modalities is independent of study protocol as they are routine
      standard of care. Upon diagnosis, eligible potential subjects will be approached for study
      enrollment. After consent, enrolled subjects will undergo arthroscopic labral repair and
      acetabuloplasty using the capsular chondrolabral preservation technique with or without BMAC
      based on intra-operative findings. The decision to use BMAC is made intra-operatively;
      therefore the patients are consented for the BMAC prior to surgery. If the chondrolabral
      junction shows advanced arthritis or the absolute absence of wear the BMAC is unnecessary and
      not used. This surgery in the absence of BMAC is considered routine practice and standard of
      care. Those patients who do not qualify for BMAC will not receive it and will be dropped from
      the study. Afterwards, those subjects who received BMAC will follow-up at routine
      post-operative intervals of 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 24 months, and an optional
      follow-up at 5 years to monitor progress.

        Inclusion criteria and Rationale:

          1. Age 18 or older: patients of any age have the capacity to potentially benefit from
             labral repair

          2. Symptoms consistent with a tear of the acetabular labrum (at least one: catching,
             clicking, popping, pain with sitting, episodic pain, pain with hip flexion, adduction,
             and/or internal rotation): asymptomatic labral tears do exist in the general
             population however there is not definitive evidence to suggest treatment of
             asymptomatic tears is beneficial.

          3. Symptoms not due to some other acute process in or around the hip (including septic
             arthritis, osteonecrosis, hemarthrosis, iliotibial band syndrome, fractures of the
             femoral neck or head, fractures of the acetabulum, greater trochanteric pain syndrome,
             sacroiliac joint pain, piriformis syndrome, low back pain associated with hip pain and
             not knee nor acute low back injury): certain conditions are not treatable by either
             arthroscopy or physical therapy. Some of these conditions can be managed with physical
             therapy but not arthroscopy.

          4. Availability of hip radiographs and magnetic resonance arthrography (MRA): needed to
             assess eligibility

          5. Evidence of labral tear on MRA: documentation of acetabular labrum tear

          6. Evidence of femoroacetabular impingement, pincer type, on anteroposterior radiographs
             of the pelvis or MRA: patho-anatomy required to perform acetabuloplasty with capsular
             chondrolabral preservation; documentation needed to prove eligibility for study;
             pincer deformity is suspected by &quot;cross-over&quot; sign, reflective of acetabular
             retroversion, on standard antero-posterior radiographs.

          7. Willingness to participate and ability to understand and sign informed consent
             document: ability to understand study and consent willingly

          8. Presence of breakdown at the chondrolabral junction visualized at the time of
             arthroscopy: patients without any chondral damage or patients with advanced arthritis
             would not require repair of this area

        Exclusion criteria and Rationale:

          1. Any narrowing of the joint space of the affected hip on standing plain
             anterior-posterior radiographs of the hip: indicative of osteoarthritic disease that
             may confound our results.

          2. Coagulopathy or hemophilia or anemia: abnormal bleeding patterns skew the normal rate
             of labral blood flow. Confounder of results.

          3. Tonnis Grade 3 Arthritic changes on plain radiographs: these patients have advanced
             arthritic disease that is unlikely to benefit from hip arthroscopy.

          4. Outerbridge Grade 4 arthritic changes at arthroscopy: classified as visualized full
             thickness cartilage loss with exposure of subchondral bone. These patients have
             advanced arthritic disease that is unlikely to benefit from BMAC intervention. These
             patients would likely negatively skew results at long term follow-up

          5. Same site surgery: complex anatomy

          6. Back pain greater than hip pain or back pain associated with leg symptoms below the
             knee: source of pain less likely to be originating from the hip and more likely to be
             referred from the back/spine. Confounder of results.

          7. Back pain associated with positive neural tension signs e.g. positive slump test,
             positive SLR (straight leg raise), positive reflex changes or drop foot: source of
             pain less likely to be originating from the hip and more likely to be referred from
             the back/spine. Confounder of results.

          8. Knee pain greater than hip pain: source of pain less likely to be originating from the
             hip and more likely to referred from the knee. Confounder of results.

          9. Bilateral tears of the acetabular labrum: difficult to gauge patient progress after
             treatment. Confounder of results.

         10. Metabolic or oncologic medical history that may affect the status of bone marrow cell
             lines: cells exposed to oncologic diseases, metabolic diseases, or treatments of these
             conditions may not have the same regenerative potential as those without these
             exposures.

         11. Systemic infection: surgery is generally contraindicated when systemic infection is
             present.

        12: Systemic heparinization: the vascularity of the bone and adjacent tissues is
        significant, posing a potential problem for bleeding when the patient is anti-coagulated.

        13. Pregnant women/fetuses: although surgery can be performed on pregnant women, pregnant
        women are excluded under federal regulations.
