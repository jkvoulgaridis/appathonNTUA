  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to find prevalence and risk factors for chronic venous disease (CVD)
      in the general population. All the resident, who live in a single rural settlement will be
      invited to participate.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study has cross-sectional design. All the residents aged 10 and more, living in the
      single rural settlement located in Central Russia will be invited to participate in the
      study.

      Those who agree, will be examined both clinically and by duplex ultrasound. Medical history
      of participants will be taken, demographic data will be collected. Possible factors that may
      influence CVD development will be registered.

      Signs and symptoms of CVD will be registered. Duplex ultrasound will be used in every
      resident to reveal pathological venous reflux in deep and superficial veins.
