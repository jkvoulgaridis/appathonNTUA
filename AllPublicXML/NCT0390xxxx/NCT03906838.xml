  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite many recent advances in pain management, post-operative pain is widely considered to
      be poorly managed. Furthermore, the mainstay of current pain management is opioids, for which
      there is strong evidence of ill effects and long-term potential for addiction. There are many
      studies demonstrating that perineural regional anesthesia can be superior to intravenous
      opioid analgesia, and that the technique is safe. By using temporary implanted catheters,
      this method can now deliver prolonged analgesia, thus reducing the need for opioids in the
      postoperative period. Regional anesthesia is a proven technique and used daily by
      anesthesiologists, and it is also the first choice for hip and knee replacement surgery for
      orthopedic surgeons. Patients undergoing head and neck reconstruction with the use of free
      tissue transfer experience a significant amount of post-operative pain due to the complexity
      of the surgery, the presence of a head and neck surgical site as well as a secondary donor
      site, and existing co-morbidities, most commonly malignancy, that also cause significant
      pain. These patients often require opioids for pain control throughout the hospital stay, and
      are almost always discharged home with additional opioids. By utilizing regional anesthesia
      blocks at the donor sites, the investigators can potentially reduce post-operative pain while
      also reducing the use of opioids.
