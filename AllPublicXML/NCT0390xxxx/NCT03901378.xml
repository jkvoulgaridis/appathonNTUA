      The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of the
      combination of chemotherapy treatment, which could be either Cisplatin or carboplatin and
      etoposide, and the research study drug, Pembrolizumab (also known as MK-3475) in patients
      with high grade neuroendocrine carcinomas of the gastroenteropancreatic system or lung who
      are chemotherapy naïve. The chemotherapy treatment you receive will be either Cisplatin or
      carboplatin and etoposide. the participant's doctor will discuss this choice with you and
      determined which chemotherapy treatment is best for you.

    <textblock>
      Combination chemotherapy is the mainstay of treatment for patients with high grade GEPNETs
      and neuroendocrine carcinomas of the lung.

      This study will utilize pembrolizumab, a potent humanized immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal
      antibody (mAb) with high specificity of binding to the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)
      receptor, thus blocks a protective mechanism of cancer cells and thereby allows the immune
      system to destroy them, in combination with chemotherapy.

      Combination chemotherapy and pembrolizumab was recently FDA approved and ongoing trials are
      utilizing this or similar combination with preliminary data demonstrating a promising safety
      profile.

             neuroendocrine tumors other than somatostatin analogs.

          6. Has had a prior anti-cancer monoclonal antibody (mAb) within 4 weeks prior to study
             Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events
             due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          7. Has had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy
             within 2 weeks prior to study Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at
             baseline) from adverse events due to a previously administered agent.

               -  Note: Subjects with ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy are an exception to this criterion and
                  may qualify for the study.

               -  Note: If subject received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from

             drugs). Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a
             form of systemic treatment.

             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

         14. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

         15. Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit
             through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.

         16. Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent or with
             an agent directed to another stimulatory or co-inhibitory T-cell receptor (eg, CTLA-4,
             OX-40, CD137).

         17. Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).

         18. Has a known history of Hepatitis B (defined as Hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg]
             reactive) or known active Hepatitis C virus (defined as HCV RNA [qualitative] is
             detected) infection. Note: no testing for Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C is required
             unless mandated by local health authority.

         19. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug.
             Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles,
             mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster (chicken pox), yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus
             Calmette-Guérin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection
             are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza
             vaccines (eg, FluMist) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.
