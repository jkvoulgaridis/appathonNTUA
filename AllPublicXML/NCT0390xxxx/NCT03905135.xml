  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Some T-cell lymphomas and leukemias do not respond to standard treatment. Researchers hope to
      develop a treatment that works better than current treatments.

      Objective:

      To test if interleukin (IL-5) combined with avelumab is safe and effective for treating
      certain cancers.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 18 and older with relapsed T-cell leukemias and lymphomas for which no standard
      treatment exists or standard treatment has failed

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with:

        -  Medical history

        -  Physical exam

        -  Blood, urine, heart, and lung tests

        -  Possible tumor biopsy

        -  Bone marrow biopsy: A small needle will be inserted into the hipbone to take out a small
           amount of marrow.

        -  CT or PET scans and MRI: Participants will lie in a machine that takes pictures of the
           body.

      Participants will get the study drugs for 6 cycles of 28 days each. They will have a midline
      catheter inserted: A tube will be inserted into a vein in the upper chest. They will get
      IL-15 as a constant infusion over the first 5 days of every cycle. They will get avelumab on
      days 8 and 22 of each cycle. They will be hospitalized for the first week of the first cycle.

      Participants will have tests throughout the study:

        -  Blood and urine tests

        -  Another tumor biopsy if their disease gets worse

        -  Scans every 8 weeks

        -  Possible repeat MRI

        -  Another bone marrow biopsy at the end of treatment, if there was lymphoma in the bone
           marrow before treatment, and they responded to treatment everywhere else.

      After they finish treatment, participants will have visits every 60 days for the first 6
      months. Then visits will be every 90 days for 2 years, and then every 6 months for 2 years.
      Visits will include blood tests and may include scans.

      Background:

      -Mature T-cell cancers are a phenotypically heterogeneous group of malignancies which

      constitute 10-15% of all non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL). Patients with relapsed/refractory T
      cell lymphomas have limited therapeutic options, making new therapeutic approaches extremely
      important.

      -The immunologic effects of recombinant human Interleukin-15 (rhIL-15), a stimulatory

      cytokine that promotes the differentiation and activation of NK cells, monocytes and longterm

      CD8+ memory T-cells, has been assessed in several Phase 1 trials in cancer patients.

      -Avelumab is an anti-programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) fully human IgG1 antibody that

      inhibits PD1/PD-L1 interactions while leaving the PD1/PD-L2 pathway intact and enhances
      immune activation against tumor cells. It has received U.S. FDA accelerated approval for the
      treatment of patients with metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) and urothelial carcinoma.

      -Unlike other approved anti-PD-L1/PD1 antibodies, avelumab induces lysis of tumor cells

      via antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), indicating an additional mechanism
      of action. However, avelumab has not shown ADCC against normal immune cell subsets in humans.

      -A significant number of T-cell malignancies express PD-L1, and since the anti-PD-L1 antibody
      avelumab has shown ADCC activity in vitro, agents that may enhance ADCC by increasing number
      and activity of Fc-binding effector cells such as rhIL15 could improve efficacy of avelumab
      in these diseases.

      Objectives:

      -To determine the safety and toxicity profile and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of
      continuous intravenous infusion (civ) rhIL-15 administration in combination with standard
      intravenous (IV) avelumab treatment

      Eligibility:

        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years of age

        -  ECOG performance status of less than or equal to 1

        -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed relapsed and/or refractory T-cell lymphoma
           other than adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL), angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma
           (AITL), peripheral T-cell lymphoma T follicular helper phenotype (PTCLTFH), and
           enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL).

        -  Adequate organ and marrow function

      Design:

        -  Open-label, single-center, non-randomized Phase 1 study

        -  Standard 3 + 3 design will be used to determine the MTD of dose-escalated rhIL-15 with
           fixed dose avelumab with a small expansion cohort at the MTD

        -  Maximum 6 cycles (28-day cycle) of combination therapy- To explore all dose levels,
           including further evaluation in a dose expansion cohort, the

      accrual ceiling will be set at 30 patients.

          -  Patients who have had prior therapy with any antibody/drug targeting PD-1/PD-L1 Tcell
             coregulatory proteins (immune checkpoints)

          -  Current use of immunosuppressive medication, EXCEPT for the following:

               -  Intranasal, inhaled, topical steroids, or local steroid injection (e.g.,
                  intra-articular injection)

               -  Systemic corticosteroids at physiologic doses less than or equal to 10 mg/day of
                  prednisone or equivalent; or,

               -  Steroids as premedication for hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., CT scan
                  premedication)

          -  Patients with known CNS involvement should be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events

          -  Patients with previous malignant disease other than the target malignancy within the
             last 5 years with the exception of basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or

             transplantation

          -  Received a live vaccine within 4 weeks of the first dose of avelumab. Vaccination with
             a live vaccine while on trial is prohibited. NOTE: Seasonal influenza vaccines for
             injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and are allowed; however intranasal
             influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist ) are live attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed

          -  Patients with history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar
             chemical or biologic composition to rhIL-15 or avelumab

          -  Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing
             or active infection requiring systemic therapy, or psychiatric illness/social
             situations that would limit compliance with study requirements

          -  Inability or refusal to practice effective contraception during therapy or the
             presence of pregnancy or active breastfeeding. Based on its mechanism of action,
             avelumab can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Animal studies
             have demonstrated that inhibition of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway can lead to increased risk
             of immune-mediated rejection of the developing fetus resulting in fetal death. These
             potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study

          -  Patients with active bacterial infections, documented HIV infection or positive
             screening serology, PCR evidence for active or chronic hepatitis B or hepatitis C, or
             positive screening HBV/HCV serology without documentation of successful curative
             treatment

          -  Patients with active or history of any autoimmune disease, unrelated to their
             malignancy, including asthma requiring chronic inhaled or oral corticosteroids, or
             with history of asthma requiring mechanical ventilation; patients with a history of
             mild asthma that are on or can be switched to non-corticosteroid bronchodilator
             regimens are eligible

          -  Cardiovascular disease: Clinically significant (i.e., active) cardiovascular disease:
             cerebral vascular accident/stroke (&lt; 6 months prior to enrollment), myocardial
             infarction (&lt; 6 months prior to enrollment), unstable angina, congestive heart failure
             (greater than or equal to New York Heart Association Classification Class II), or
             serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication

          -  Other severe acute or chronic medical conditions including immune colitis,
             inflammatory bowel disease, immune pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis or psychiatric
             conditions including recent (within the past year) or active suicidal ideation or
             behavior; or laboratory abnormalities that may increase the risk associated with study
             participation or study treatment administration or may interfere with the
             interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make
             the patient inappropriate for entry into this study
