    <textblock>
      This study was a single-arm, multi-center, phase II study, which is aimed to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of CM082 combined with JS001 as the second-line treatment of advanced
      small cell lung cancer. Eligible patients will receive CM082 tablets 150mg once daily orally
      in combination with JS001 (240mg, intravenously) every 21 days. Treatment continues until
      disease progresses , intolerable toxicity, or withdraw.

      The primary endpoint is tumor response per investigator assessment according to response
      evaluation criteria in solid tumors (recist) version 1.1, secondary endpoints include disease
      control rate, progression-free survival, overall survival, safety and tolerability. iRECIST
      is also implemented for tumor response assessment.
