  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The preschool stage has been identified as an important moment for the study of factors
      associated with obesity. The worrying national situation of overweight in children from 3 to
      5 years old, the increase in consumption of ultra-processed foods nationwide that is
      associated with the increase of the body mass index at the national level, the reduced
      national scientific evidence regarding the effectiveness of interventions in promoting
      healthy habits, as well as the lack of tools for mothers of preschool children in nutrition
      and physical activity, make interventions necessary in this area. On the other hand,
      currently, users worldwide are installing fewer applications and, although they spend more
      time using mobile applications, they are limited to a handful. Therefore, developing a native
      mobile application that is highly consumed is very difficult and expensive. For this reason,
      progressive web apps emerge as an attractive alternative for users given its attractive
      features, cross-platform interface, lower development cost and a growing demand for such
      applications. Thus, this research seeks to explore a novel way to promote healthy habits in
      preschoolers and check their effectiveness. In this way, a precedent could be set in the use
      of technologies in health promotion that could be extended to other age groups.

      SAMPLE SIZE The sample size was calculated using OpenEpi (www.openepi.com), with the sample
      size formula to compare two means, considering a confidence interval of 95%, power of 80%,
      ratio of sample size (group 2 / group 1) equal to 1, a minimum expected mean difference of 5
      points and a standard deviation of 9.5 points for both groups. Thus, the required sample size
      is 114 participants (57 intervened and 57 not intervened).

      TECHNIQUES AND PROCEDURES FOR DATA COLLECTION

      First stage: Design of the progressive web app

      In this phase, the profile of the users will be defined through a focus group. Among the
      information gathered is socio-demographic data, use of technology, current situation of the
      feeding and physical activity of the preschool, and expectations of the functions of the
      computer tool. In addition, a complementary bibliographic search will be carried out on the
      subject to expand the information necessary for the design of the PWA.

      Based on the information collected, the alpha version of the application will be developed.
      It will undergo a validation process and based on the feedback, the application will be
      improved until a beta version is developed.

      Second stage: intervention with the progressive web app (PWA)

      ANALYSIS PLAN

      The data was collected using the Magpi software. To verify the comparability of the two
      randomization groups based on the sociodemographic covariates through a descriptive analysis,
      a frequency and percentage table was constructed, which were compared by statistical tests.

      In addition, the variation of the ration consumption of the food groups, the score in each
      component of the feeding behavior and the activity of the preschool was analyzed; the
      variation of the nutritional status and quality of the components of the lunch box in the
      control and intervention group was identified; and the variation of the Z score for the
      indicator of BMI for age and the consumption of the lunch box was plotted through a chart of
      boxes.

      To determine the effect of the intervention, the differences of the measurements (post-pre)
      of the control and intervention groups were compared. For this, the Student t test was used
      for independent samples. The variables analyzed were:

        -  Variation of the dietetic quality of the preschool

        -  Variation in the nutritional status of children

        -  Variation of preschool feeding behavior

        -  Variation of the composition of the lunchbox

        -  Variation of the consumption of the lunchbox

        -  Variation of physical activity Finally, a satisfaction survey was applied to the
           intervention group and the results were presented using descriptive statistics.

    <intervention_model_description>First, a baseline evaluation will be made to the participants, based on the indicators of interest.
During a period of 60 days, the caregivers of the intervention group had free access to the progressive web app &quot;Nutrinidos&quot; and received training for its use. On the other hand, nutritional counseling was available every 30 days for the participants assigned to the control group. They consisted of personalized sessions with a duration of 20 minutes in which parents and caregivers could resolve their doubts regarding the feeding of their children. In addition, they were offered physical education materials designed and adapted with content used in this study. The educational material addressed contains information about lunch boxes, eating habits, consumption of fruits and vegetables, prevention of anemia, and physical activity.
After 60 days of follow-up, the evaluation of results will be carried out.</intervention_model_description>
