    <description>EORTC QLQ-C30: cancer-specific instrument with 30 questions to assess the participant QoL. First 28 questions used to evaluate 5 functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, social), 3 symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain) and other single items (dyspnea, appetite loss, insomnia, constipation, diarrhea, financial difficulties). Each question assessed on 4-point scale (1= not at all, 2= a little, 3= quite a bit, 4= very much); functional scales: higher score = better level of functioning; symptom scale: higher score = more severe symptoms; for single items: higher score= more severe problem. Last 2 questions used to evaluate global health status (GHS)/QoL. Each question was assessed on 7-point scale (1= very poor to 7= excellent). Scores averaged, transformed to 0-100 scale; higher score=better quality of life/better level of functioning.</description>

    <description>EORTC-QLQ-BR23 is a disease-specific module for breast cancer developed as a supplement for the EORTC-QLQ-C30 to assess the quality of life of participants with breast cancer. EORTC-QLQ-BR23 symptoms subscale includes 4 items: systemic therapy side effects, breast symptoms, arm symptoms, upset by hair loss. Each item is rated by choosing 1 of 4 possible responses that record the level of intensity (1= not at all, 2= a little, 3= quite a bit, and 4= very much), higher scores=high level of symptom/problems.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Females or males age ≥ 18 years (at time of signing informed consent)

          2. Histologically confirmed metastatic or recurrent triple-negative breast cancer
             (estrogen receptor (ER) ≤10%; progesterone receptor (PR) ≤10%; HER2 negative by
             immunohistochemistry (IHC) or fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH)

          3. Part 1: Progressed on at least 1 prior cytotoxic chemotherapy at least 21 days prior
             to the start of study treatment. Part 2: Progressed on no more than 3 prior
             chemotherapy-inclusive regimens for locally advanced or metastatic disease (no limit
             on prior targeted anticancer therapies such as mechanistic target or rapamycin (mTOR)
             or CDK4/6 inhibitors, immune-oncology agents, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, or
             monoclonal antibodies against CTL4 or VEGF) at least 21 days prior to the start of
             study treatment.

          4. Patient is not a candidate for endocrine based therapy or has progressed on at least 2
             prior endocrine based therapies in the locally advanced or metastatic setting

          5. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1

          6. Part 2 only: Measurable disease per RECIST version 1.1

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Documented germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations

          2. Evidence of disease progression during platinum treatment either in the neoadjuvant or
             in the metastatic setting. For patients receiving platinum in the neoadjuvant setting,
             at least 12 months must have elapsed between the last dose of platinum-based treatment
             and enrollment.

          3. Patients with inflammatory breast cancer

          4. Current or anticipated use of medications known to be strong inhibitors or inducers of
             CYP3A4 or substrates of CYP1A2 with narrow therapeutic windows. Strong inhibitors,
             inducers or substrates must be discontinued at least 7 days prior to the first
             administration of study drug.

          5. Current or anticipated use within 7 days prior to the first administration of study
             drug, or during the study, of strong P-gp inhibitors. For a list of strong P-gp
             inhibitors, refer to Section 8.4.1.

          6. Prior anticancer therapy (chemotherapy, radiation, hormone therapy, immunotherapy or
             investigational agent) within 3 weeks from the start of study drug (except for
