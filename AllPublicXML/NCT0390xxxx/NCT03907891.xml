  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After a 30-year decline, heart disease is projected to increase up to 18% by 2030.
      Participation rates in cardiac rehabilitation remain extremely low and hopeless individuals
      are less likely to participate. This innovative study has the potential to advance science,
      improve patient care, and improve patient outcomes by demonstrating the effectiveness of the
      Heart Up! program to increase physical activity and reduce hopelessness in patients with
      heart disease. Hopelessness is associated with a 3.4 times increased risk of mortality or
      nonfatal myocardial infarction in patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD), independent of
      depression. Hopelessness has been identified in 27-52% of patients with IHD and can persist
      for up to 12 months after hospital discharge. Hopelessness, a negative outlook and sense of
      helplessness toward the future, can be a temporary response to an event (state) or a habitual
      outlook (trait). Hopelessness is associated with decreased physical functioning and lower
      physical activity (PA) levels in individuals with IHD. While research has investigated
      strategies to increase PA among IHD patients in general, the study team is the only group to
      design an intervention to promote PA specifically in hopeless IHD patients. The purpose of
      this randomized controlled trial is to establish the effectiveness of our 6-week mHealth
      intervention (Heart Up!) to promote increased PA in hopeless patients with IHD. A total of
      225 hopeless IHD patients will be enrolled from a large community teaching hospital in the
      Midwest. Patients will be randomized (75 per group) to one of three groups: 1) motivational
      social support (MSS) from a nurse, 2) MSS from a nurse with additional significant other
      support (SOS), or 3) attention control (AC). It is hypothesized that 1) The MSS with SOS
      group will have the greatest increase in average minutes of moderate to vigorous PA per day
      at 8 and 24 weeks as compared to the MSS only or AC groups; 2) Greater increase in minutes of
      moderate to vigorous PA per day will be associated with decreased state hopelessness levels
      from baseline to weeks 8 and 24; and 3) Increased social support and increased motivation
      will mediate the effects of Heart Up! on a greater increase in moderate to vigorous PA at 8
      and 24 weeks. The findings from this study could transform care for IHD patients who are
      hopeless by promoting self-management of important PA goals that can contribute to better
      health outcomes.

      Hopelessness is associated with a 3.4 times increased risk of mortality or nonfatal
      myocardial infarction in patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD), independent of
      depression. Hopelessness has been identified in 27-52% of patients with IHD and can persist
      for up to 12 months after hospital discharge. Hopelessness, a negative outlook and sense of
      helplessness toward the future, can be a temporary response to an event (state) or a habitual
      outlook (trait). Hopelessness is associated with decreased physical functioning and lower
      physical activity (PA) levels in individuals with IHD. Low levels of PA independently
      contribute to increased death and adverse events in patients with IHD. Rates of PA in IHD
      patients continue to be unacceptably low in both hospital-based cardiac rehabilitation and
      home settings. Hopelessness frequently compounds this issue. The links among hopelessness,
      PA, and mortality and morbidity for patients with IHD remain unknown. While research has
      investigated strategies to increase PA among IHD patients in general, the study team is the
      only group to design an intervention to promote PA specifically in hopeless IHD patients.
      This research, based on Self Determination Theory and Cohen's Stress and Coping Social
      Support Theory, has shown feasibility and preliminary efficacy for a motivational
      intervention that integrates social support from both the patient's nurse and significant
      other to promote increased PA. The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to
      establish the effectiveness of our 6-week mHealth intervention (Heart Up!) to promote
      increased PA in hopeless patients with IHD. The study team will enroll 225 hopeless IHD
      patients from a large community teaching hospital in the Midwest. Patients will be randomized
      (75 per group) to one of three groups: 1) motivational social support (MSS) from a nurse, 2)
      MSS from a nurse with additional significant other support (SOS), or 3) attention control
      (AC). Data will be collected at baseline, 8 and 24 weeks using an accelerometer for PA and
      valid and reliable instruments of physical and emotional health and behaviors. The specific
      aims are to: 1) test the effectiveness of 6 weeks of MSS and MSS with SOS on increasing mean
      minutes per day of moderate to vigorous PA, measured by an ActiGraph accelerometer; 2)
      determine the effects of change in minutes per day of moderate to vigorous PA on state
      hopelessness, measured by the State-Trait Hopelessness Scale; and 3): determine if social
      support (measured by the ENRICHD Social Support Inventory) and motivation (measured by the
      Exercise Self-Regulation Questionnaire) mediate the effects of the Heart Up! intervention on
      PA. The findings from this study could transform care for IHD patients who are hopeless by
      promoting self-management of important PA goals that can contribute to better health
      outcomes. This proposal supports NINR's investment in self-management to improve the quality
      of life for individuals with chronic illness.

    <description>Patients will receive a 60-minute session of motivational interviewing in their home from a trained nurse. The nurse will apply motivational interviewing techniques to explore the patient's thoughts about making a behavior change to attain adequate physical activity (PA). Patients will be encouraged to exercise based on instructions provided by the hospital staff. The patient's ability to take their radial pulse before and after PA will be assessed, and patients will be provided written instructions on the correct manner to take a radial pulse. Patients will receive daily motivational text messages from the nurse for 6 weeks. The texts will be sent via the REDCap automated system. The automated system confirms that texts were sent. The motivational interviewer nurse will confirm by phone that the patient receives her/his first text from the REDCap system.</description>

    <description>Patients will also receive a 60-minute session of motivational interviewing in their home from a trained nurse and text messages from a nurse for 6 weeks, as described in arm 1. In addition, patients will receive daily text messages from their significant other for 6 weeks. Researchers developed the 42 significant other text messages. The motivational interviewing nurse will provide the text messages to the significant other in writing. The order of texts sent from the significant other will be randomized so that we can determine their effectiveness in general. The significant other will be asked to type and send the text message listed for each date to the patient. Study staff will confirm by phone that the patient received the first text from the significant other. Patients will be asked to track the number of text messages from the significant other that they read over the 6-week period using the log provided.</description>
