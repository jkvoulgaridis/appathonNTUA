      A Multicentre Randomized Controlled Trial to Investigate the Effect of Natrox Oxygen Wound
      Therapy on the Healing rates of Diabetic Foot Ulcers.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 132 patients with Diabetic Foot Ulcers will be enrolled into the trial at
      fifteen Wound Care Centers and Hospitals across the United States of America. Patients will
      be selected to receive standard wound care or standard wound care plus Natrox Oxygen Wound
      Therapy for their wounds. Patients will be monitored for 12 weeks. The primary comparator
      between the groups will be complete wound healing at 12 weeks, but other parameters will be
      assessed, such as pain, wound size reduction and infection status.

             A. Diabetic foot ulcer present for greater than 4 weeks (documented in the medical
             record) but less than 12 months duration if being treated with active SOC.

             B. Minor amputation wound sites

          3. Subject has clinical documentation of no visible wound improvement in the after 4
             weeks of standard of care. Objectively, less than 40% healing in the past four weeks

             an ABI between 0.7 and ≤ 1.3, or TBI of &gt;6 within 3 months of the first Screening
             Visit.
