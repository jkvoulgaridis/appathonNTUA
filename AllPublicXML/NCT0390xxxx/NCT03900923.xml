  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 6-week open trial to identify the optimal dosing of cannabidiol (CBD) in youth with
      autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and to identify primary and secondary outcomes for future
      controlled studies. This study will evaluate change in symptoms commonly associated with ASD,
      as evidence suggests that CBD may be effective in addressing difficulties such as
      irritability and anxiety, while maintaining a benign adverse effect (AE) profile in children
      and adolescents.

      30 male and female participants with ASD between the ages of 7 and 17 years old will be
      recruited. Participants will have fluent speech and an estimated IQ greater than or equal to
      80. Study intervention will be 98% pure CBD. The CBD will be Greenwich Biosciences, Inc.'s
      100mg/mL oral solution, brand name EPIDIOLEX. A Bayesian optimal interval (BOIN) design will
      be used, such that participants will be assigned to cohorts of size 3 receiving doses of 3,
      6, or 9 mg/kg/day, depending on the treatment response of participants in prior cohorts.
