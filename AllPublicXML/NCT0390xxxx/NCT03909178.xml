  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tears of the acetabular labrum appear to be common with the prevalence of asymptomatic tears
      in the general population approaching 66% and 70% based on cadaveric dissection and magnetic
      resonance imaging, respectively. Despite this prevalence, there is no currently accepted
      justification for performing labral repair in an asymptomatic patient despite the many
      postulated biomechanical benefits that an intact labrum imparts to the hip joint.

      Representing a smaller proportion of all tears, symptomatic tears of the acetabular labrum
      present a therapeutic challenge. Current treatment modalities range from conservative
      measures to open surgical intervention. Conservative measures have typically included:
      activity modification, the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), physical
      therapy (PT), core strengthening and improvement of sensory motor control. In the past two
      decades, technological advances in the form of surgical instrumentation and traction devices
      have facilitated less invasive arthroscopic techniques to diagnose and treat hip problems and
      as such is now the preferred treatment modality for many orthopedic surgeons treating
      patients with hip pathology.

      Determining which patients, using age and arthritic burden as predictors, can benefit from
      labral repair is paramount for several reasons. Showing arthroscopic repair is of little or
      no benefit to a specific cohort can reduce the number of unnecessary surgeries performed,
      increase the use of conservative therapy (if validated) and reduce the interval between
      diagnosis and total hip replacement.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There has been only one prospective study documenting the outcomes of patients treated with
      physical therapy for intra-articular conditions of the hip. These conditions included mild
      FAI and mild developmental dysplasia of the hip. Here, physical therapy was given as a first
      line treatment. Those who did not make satisfactory improvements in pain or wished to have
      surgery were then scheduled for surgery to repair the defects. Patients saw improvement in
      validated outcome measures at one year.

      Although there have been studies looking at age secondarily in patients with labral tears,
      there is no prospective evidence to endorse or refute a recommendation of hip arthroscopy for
      patients of any age being treated for a tear of the acetabular labrum.

      Most recently, the authors involved in this study performed a retrospective investigation
      (unpublished data) to capture patients with clinically and radiographically confirmed
      acetabular labral pathology electing to undergo conservative management defined as the
      refusal of surgical intervention. Based on a retrospective review of 894 patients presenting
      to clinic over a 10-year period, the investigators identified 22 patients with labral
      pathology that were treated non-operatively. Retrospective case control analysis was
      performed using outcome questionnaires administered to both surgical and non-surgical
      cohorts. The investigators found that patients with labral tears managed non-operatively
      appear to score highly on hip function outcome scores, preliminarily indicating there may be
      some benefit in using conservative management alone in the treatment of labral pathology.

      This is a 12-month prospective randomized control trial (RCT), which will enroll 121 subjects
      with evidence consistent with a tear of the acetabular labrum. Labral tear will be diagnosed
      by clinical exam and positive MRI findings. Subjects will receive conservative physical
      therapy treatment alone or arthroscopic surgical labral repair and physical therapy. The
      investigators anticipate that pain, range of motion, activity level, and functional
      performance, as judged by validated outcome measures and serial physical exams, will improve
      when compared to baseline. The investigators also anticipate that the level of response will
      be greater in the surgical treatment group than in the physical therapy group at 12 months.

      Our Primary Outcome is change in the modified Harris Hip Score at 6 months and 12 months.
      Secondary outcomes include changes in other outcomes measures (LEFS, HOS, NAHS, iHOT-33),
      patient satisfaction, and degree of improvement on physical exam, and the influence of OA
      severity (Outerbridge scoring) and location on the aforementioned outcome measures.

    <description>The research coordinator will, perform a baseline assessment, and randomize the patients into the study at this visit.
Randomization will be assigned utilizing an electronic randomization program. Patients are prospectively identified and randomized into one of two study arms: arthroscopic surgery (AS) or physical therapy (PT). A third study arm, dependent upon improvement with PT, was created as patients crossed over (CO) from PT to AS after a lack of improvement after a minimum of 8 weeks of PT. AS consisted of labral repair.
Any subject randomized to surgery will be seen by Dr. Martin to be consented separately for the arthroscopic procedure, which is standard of care. Those receiving surgical management will be scheduled for the post-operative physical therapy protocol within 2 weeks of their operative date, once a surgical date has been scheduled.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age 40 or greater: higher likelihood or undetectable OA on imaging

          2. Symptoms consistent with a tear of the acetabular labrum (at least one: catching,
             clicking, popping, pain with sitting, episodic pain, pain with hip flexion, adduction,
             and/or internal rotation): asymptomatic labral tears do exist in the general
             population however there is not definitive evidence to suggest treatment of
             asymptomatic tears is beneficial.

          3. Symptoms not due to some other acute process in or around the hip (including septic
             arthritis, osteonecrosis, hemarthrosis, iliotibial band syndrome, fractures of the
             femoral neck or head, fractures of the acetabulum, greater trochanteric pain syndrome,
             sacroiliac joint pain, piriformis syndrome, low back pain associated with hip pain and
             not knee nor acute low back injury): certain conditions are not treatable by either
             arthroscopy or physical therapy. Some of these conditions can be managed with physical
             therapy but not arthroscopy.

          4. Availability of hip radiographs and MRI: needed to assess eligibility

          5. Evidence on MRI of a tear of the acetabular labrum: documentation of acetabular labrum
             tear

          6. Willingness to undergo randomization and ability to understand and sign informed
             consent document: ability to understand study and consent willingly

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Less than 2 mm of joint space on standing plain anterior-posterior radiographs of the
             hip: indicative of severe osteoarthritic disease and the patient would benefit more
             from a total hip replacement

          2. Developmental dysplasia of the hip: distorted acetabular anatomy and biomechanics

          3. Kellgren-Lawrence Grade 4 changes: classified as large osteophytes, marked narrowing
             of joint space, severe sclerosis, and definite deformity of bone contour; indicative
             of severe OA

          4. Tonnis Grade 3 changes: classified as large cysts in the head or acetabulum, severe
             narrowing or obliteration of the joint space, severe deformity of the head, and
             necrosis; indicative of OA

          5. Unexpected pathology at the time of arthroscopy: source of pain less likely to due
             dysfunction of the labrum and more likely due to aberrant extra-articular biology

          6. Same site surgery: complex anatomy

          7. Back pain greater than hip pain or back pain associated with leg symptoms below the
             knee: source of pain less likely to be originating from the hip and more likely to be
             referred from the back/spine

          8. Back pain associated with positive neural tension signs e.g. positive slump test,
             positive SLR (straight leg raise), positive reflex changes or drop foot: source of
             pain less likely to be originating from the hip and more likely to be referred from
             the back/spine

          9. Knee pain greater than hip pain: source of pain less likely to be originating from the
             hip and more likely to referred from the knee

         10. Bilateral tears of the acetabular labrum: difficult to gauge patient progress after
             treatment

         11. Contraindication to surgery or physical therapy: cannot tolerate either treatment
             grouping

         12. Alternate form of PT for greater than 6 weeks: will negatively augment results. May
             affect recruitment.
