    <textblock>
      This Phase IIa study is a 16-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study aiming
      at evaluating the safety and the efficacy of ABX464 given once a day (o.d) at 50 mg in
      subjects with moderate to severe active Crohn's Disease who have inadequate response, loss of
      response, or intolerance to prior amino-salicylates, immunosuppressant treatment, biologics,
      and/or corticosteroid treatment, and followed by a 4 weeks period of follow-up after the last
      study drug intake.

      This Phase 2a study is a 16-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study aiming
      at evaluating the safety and the efficacy of ABX464 given once a day (o.d) at 50 mg in
      subjects with moderate to severe active Crohn's Disease who have inadequate response, loss of
      response, or intolerance to prior amino-salicylates, immunosuppressant treatment, biologics,
      and/or corticosteroid treatment, and followed by a 4 weeks period of follow-up after the last
      study drug intake.

      Eligible patients will be randomized according to a 2/1 ratio in two different groups of
      treatment : ABX464 50mg OR placebo.

      After the treatment phase at week 16, all randomized patients willing to continue with the
      study treatment will have the possibility to enter a separate open-label study. In that case,
      patients will stop their participation after week 16, otherwise they will go through the 4
      weeks follow-up period and the end of study visit will take place on week 20.
