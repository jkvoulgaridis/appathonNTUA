    <textblock>
      This study is being done to evaluate the safety and tolerability of using the combination of
      gemtuzumab ozogamicin and midostaurin together with standard induction chemotherapy
      (cytarabine and daunorubicin) in the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed FLT-3 mutated
      acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The study will evaluate the benefit of adding gemtuzumab
      ozogamicin and midostaurin to standard induction chemotherapy efficacy, compared to standard
      induction for treating AML.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess the maximum tolerated dose of combining GO to the induction regimen of DA and
      midostaurin.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess the frequency of early death associated with study treatment. II. To evaluate
      the preliminary efficacy of the study treatment. III. To assess the safety profile of the
      study treatment.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Quantify CD33 expression on AML blasts. II. Determine the CD33 SNP status previously
      reported to correlate with response and correlate clinical outcomes of patients with the CD33
      genotype.

      OUTLINE:

      Potential participants will undergo a screening bone marrow examination with complete
      cytogenetic and molecular studies to evaluate disease. In general, individuals with
      confirmatory mutations to FLT3 ITD or TKD will be considered eligible to participate in this
      study.

      Dose Levels:

      The induction portion of this study is comprised of 4 dose levels, with dose levels 1-3
      consisting of an incremental increase in the number of fractionated gemtuzumab ozogamicin
      doses and dose level 4 being identical to dose level 3, except the daunorubicin dosage is
      increased to 90 mg/m2. A dose cohort consists of 3 patients, after assessment the cohort an
      escalation/de-escalation decision is made, over a total of 8 dose cohorts (n=24 patients).
      Except for the change in daunorubicin dosing between dose levels 3 and 4 (i.e., 60 mg/m2 to
      90 mg/m2), the doses of all other drug agents will remain the same across dose levels.

      Treatment Plan - Induction:

      Eligible participants will initiate a single course of standard '7+3' induction with
      cytarabine, which will be consecutively administered on Days 1 to 7 and daunorubicin
      consecutively administered on Days 1 to 3. Participants will also concurrently receive
      fixed-dose gemtuzumab ozogamicin (3 mg/m2) given at varying time intervals, with the lowest
      dose fraction being a single dose given on Day 1, and the highest dose fraction consisting of
      gemtuzumab ozogamicin administered on Days 1, 4, and 7. Participants will continue this
      initial induction course by receiving midostaurin (50 mg b.i.d) on Days 8 through 21 of the
      28 day cycle.

      Participants may repeat induction a second time if results of the Day 14 bone marrow biopsy
      show a residual blast count ≥5% with adequate cellularity. A bone marrow evaluation after
      first induction will be performed after count recovery (between days 23-days 35). If results
      of the bone marrow examination after peripheral blood count recovery are consistent with
      complete remission (CR) or complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi),
      then participants may undergo allogenic stem cell transplantation (if a suitable donor is
      available) or proceed to consolidation therapy.

      Treatment Plan - Consolidation:

      Gemtuzumab ozogamicin is only administered as part of the first course of the consolidation
      regimen. Individuals aged &lt; 60 years will receive standard high-dose cytarabine (HiDAC, 3
      g/m2 IV, b.i.d) given on Days 1, 3, and 5, along with gemtuzumab ozogamicin (3 mg/m2) given
      on Day 1 (first consolidation course only), and midostaurin administered on Days 8 through 21
      of a 28 day cycle. Participants aged ≥ 60 years will consist of cytarabine (1.5 to 2 g/m2)
      given on Days 1, 3, 5, gemtuzumab ozogamicin (3 mg/m2) given Day 1 (first consolidation
      course only), then midostaurin administered on Days 8 through 21 of a 28 day cycle.
      Participants may receive a total of 2 courses of consolidation therapy.

      Follow-up:

      Participants who proceed to allogeneic stem cell transplantation and those who develop
      progressive disease will be removed from clinical trial treatment and will be followed for
      disease status and survival, together with those participants who complete induction and
      consolidation, up to 24 months after end of treatment.
