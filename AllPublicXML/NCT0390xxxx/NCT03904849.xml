  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether cannabidiol, relative to placebo, affects
      subjective response to alcohol or alcohol drinking.

      This study will examine the effects of Epidiolex among adults who drink alcohol heavily but
      who are not seeking treatment for their alcohol use. Epidiolex is an FDA-approved formulation
      of cannabidiol, the primary non-psychoactive constituent of cannabis. Participants in the
      study will be randomly assigned to take Epidiolex or placebo for 8 days. There are 3 study
      visits, including a day-long visit in the laboratory.
