  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study was to compare, a standard efficient technique in accelerating
      OTM as surgical corticotomy as a gold standard versus surgical corticotomy combined with LLLT
      in an attempt for further acceleration of OTM.

      The study design was a randomized split mouth design to compare, clinically and
      radiographically, between the two interventions (Corticotomy and Laser versus Corticotomy
      only) by assessing the rate of maxillary canine retraction achieved in 4 months. Secondary
      outcomes were to evaluate 1st maxillary molar anchorage loss, changes in tipping, torque and
      rotations values of maxillary canine and 1st molar. In addition, the impact of both
      interventions on root resorption was assessed. The present study was carried on 16 female
      patients. All patients required maxillary 1st premolar extraction and subsequent maxillary
      canine retraction.
