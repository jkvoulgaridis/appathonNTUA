  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While interdisciplinary family meetings are evidence-based and part of usual care, this study
      seeks to test a novel set of implementation strategies (the SET-to-Meet intervention) to
      improve adherence to best practice guidelines for interdisciplinary family meetings. SET
      stands for Screen-Engage-Track; SET-to Meet is a nurse-led, team based intervention to ensure
      routine interdisciplinary family meetings are held on behalf of incapacitated, critically-ill
      patients in ICUs. This study is a feasibility and acceptability pilot test of the
      intervention.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intervention components are: a protocol for interdisciplinary family meetings that is
      tailored to the individual ICU unit and steps in the SET-to-Meet process: 1.) Screening of
      patients on admission to determine if patient meets criteria for a family meeting; 2.)
      proactively Engaging family members to inform them about the unit's protocol for family
      meetings and to find out who from the family might attend the meeting; and Tracking the
      progress of setting up the meeting (identifying the patient during ICU team rounds as a
      patient meeting criteria for a family meeting; discussing setting up the meeting with the ICU
      team; scheduling the meeting and communicating details to attendees.)

      Implementation of the intervention includes: 1.) Working with the site ICU physician and
      nursing leadership to tailor the SET-to-meet protocol and tracking tool for family meetings,
      ensuring they are customized for the unit workflow and staffing model, and 2.) Providing
      on-line training and 2 weeks of on-site coaching to ICU nursing staff, care management/social
      work staff, and intensivists (MD and APP) in the use of the tailored protocol and tracking
      tool.

      Feasibility and acceptability will be assessed by percentage of staff completing training,
      adherence to elements of the intervention, and number of patients meeting enrollment
      criteria. Acceptability will be assessed via focus groups and a survey testing satisfaction
      with the intervention.

    <ipd_description>This study will be conducted at sites within two different health systems, Allegheny Health Network and Excela Health, each with their own Institutional Review Board (IRB). The data use agreements with those respective organizations are pending, and we do not yet know the conditions and specifically, if and under what circumstances data sharing will be permitted.
Provided data sharing is permitted, and in accordance with those agreements, academic collaborators of the Principal Investigator outside of the University of Pittsburgh may have access to participant data collected during the trial, after de-identification. These outside collaborators will obtain their own IRB approval for their role.</ipd_description>
