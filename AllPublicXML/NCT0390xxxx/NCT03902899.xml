  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this non-randomized controlled trial, a semi-random group of Dutch endoscopist receive an
      oral training about the significance of serrated polyps. The primary aim of this training is
      to improve the endoscopist's awareness of the significance of serrated polyps, ultimately
      leading to increased detection. In addition, a random group of endoscopists that will not
      receive this training will be used as a reference group.

      Data will be collected as part of routine care within the Nationwide Dutch Bowel cancer
      screening program. The serrated polyp detectionrate of each endoscopist will be extracted
      from anonymized data that will be prospectively collected as part of routine care within the
      Dutch Nationwide bowel cancer screening program. Data will be anonymized and provided by
      Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid en Milieu (RIVM) and ScreenIT.

    <description>All endoscopists employed by 9 semi-randomly chosen hospitals in the Netherlands will be exposed to an educational intervention (oral presentation): an oral awareness training which will be delivered twice, first in 2014 and then in 2016/2017.
In total 38 endoscopists are included from these 9 hospitals.</description>
