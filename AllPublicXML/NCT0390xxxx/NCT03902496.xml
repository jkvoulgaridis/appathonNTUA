    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the Avulux device in
      reducing the impact of migraine headaches as measured by improvement in Headache Impact Test
      (HIT-6TM) scores at three weeks when compared to a control/sham device.

      Avulux™ is intended to decrease the impact of headache and migraine on normal daily life and
      the ability to function, and reduce the frequency and severity of headache, in adult patients
      diagnosed with episodic migraine headache or chronic migraine.

      Avulux™ consists of a pair of optical filters in the form of spectacle lenses, provided in
      standard spectacle frames or as clip-on units, coated with a thin film that effectively
      blocks light at specified wavelength ranges while minimizing distortion of the visible
      spectrum. The optical filters block a portion of the optical spectrum that is suspected to
      stimulate photophobic responses that trigger some, and exacerbate most, migraines.

    <description>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the Avulux device in reducing the impact of migraine headaches as measured by improvement in Headache Impact Test (HIT-6) scores at three weeks when compared to a control/sham device. HIT-6 scores range from 36 to 78. Higher scores indicate a greater impact of headaches on the respondent's life, i.e., 36 = no impact, 78 = maximum impact.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number and Severity of Headache Days</measure>
    <time_frame>Three-week</time_frame>
    <description>To measure effects on the number and severity of headaches, we will use the subjects' daily diaries to count the number of days with headache that either a) made activity difficult, b) caused activity changes, or c) caused patient to go to bed. We will then compare the proportion of days with headaches that met one of these criteria for the 4-week baseline period and the 3-week intervention.</description>
