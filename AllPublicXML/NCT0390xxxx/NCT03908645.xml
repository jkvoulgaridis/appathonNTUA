    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop and validate the performance of an artificial
      intelligence(AI) assisted Boston Bowel preparation Scoring(BBPS) system for evaluation of
      bowel cleanness, then testify whether this new scoring system can help physicians to improve
      the quality control parameters of colonoscopy in clinic practice.

    <textblock>
      Colonoscopy is recommended as a routine examination for colorectal cancer screening. Adequate
      bowel preparation is indispensable to ensure a clear vision of colonic mucosa，complete
      inspection of all colon segments, and furthermore improves the detection rates of small
      adenomas. Thus, the adequacy of bowel preparation should be accurately evaluated and
      documented. However, the accuracy of current bowel preparation quality scales greatly relies
      on intra-observer and inter-observer consistency for lack of objective measurements.
      Recently, deep learning based on central neural networks (CNN) has shown multiple potential
      in computer-aided detection and computer-aided diagnose of gastrointestinal lesions. While,
      no studies have been conducted to evaluate the performance of deep learning algorithm in
      bowel preparation quality scoring. This study aims to train an algorithm to assess bowel
      preparation quality using the BBPS, and testify whether the engagement of AI can improve the
      quality control parameters of colonoscopy.

    <description>Bowel preparation quality was measured by BBPS. After fully washing or suctioning of colonic contents, three segments including right colon (containing cecum and ascending colon), transvers colon (containing hepatic and splenic flexures) and left colon (containing descending and sigmoid colon) were individually scored from 0 to 3. Point 0 refers to unprepared colon segment with obscured solid stool making mucosa cannot be seen; Point 1 refers to part of mucosa can be seen, but some areas are covered by staining, residual stool, and/or opaque liquid; Point 2 refers to entire mucosa is well-seen; Point 3 refers to clean colon segment without staining, fecal materials or liquids. A sub-score of each colon segment was used, ranging from minimum 0 to maximum 3. The highest score means the excellent bowel preparation. Adequate bowel preparation was defined as a total BBPS≥6 and sub-BBPS≥2 per segment.</description>

    <description>After receiving standard bowel preparation regimen, patients go through colonoscopy under the AI monitoring device. During the withdrawal process, bowel preparation quality is monitored by AI-associated scoring system. Whenever a sub-score below 2 points is detected, endoscopist will be alarmed up to three times to wash and suck the colonic contents. Videos will be recorded and re-evaluated by experts to determine the final BBPS score. The withdrawal time is targeted at least 6min in accordance with colonoscopy quality practice. All detected polyps will be removed and obtained for histological assessment, with the possible exception of diminutive(less than 5mm) rectal polyps.</description>

    <description>After receiving standard bowel preparation regimen, patients go through conventional colonoscopy without the AI monitoring device. During the withdrawal process, after washing and sucking the colonic contents according to endoscopist's personal experience, bowel preparation quality is evaluated by human. Videos will be recorded and re-evaluated by experts to determine the final BBPS score. The withdrawal time is targeted at least 6min in accordance with colonoscopy quality practice. All detected polyps will be removed and obtained for histological assessment, with the possible exception of diminutive(less than 5mm) rectal polyps.</description>
