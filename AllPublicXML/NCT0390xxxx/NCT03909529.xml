      An open label, balanced, randomized, single-dose, two-treatment, two-sequence, two-period,
      crossover oral drug-drug interaction study of spironolactone (perpetrator) and Digoxin
      (substrate drug) in healthy adult human subjects under fasting condition.

    <textblock>
      Drug interaction studies between spironolactone and digoxin, particularly studies in which
      digoxin was administered intravenously (Waldorf, S 1978; Fenster, P.E. 1984), indicate that
      spironolactone may decrease the renal clearance of digoxin by 18-25%, and increase the (area
      under curve) AUC of digoxin by 35-44%. Although the radioimmunoassay used in the study may be
      confounded, these results suggest that inhibition of P-gp in the renal proximal tubules may
      be possible. To account for possible renal P-gp inhibition, subjects in the test group will
      be pretreated with spironolactone for about 5 days to allow accumulation of some of the
      metabolites which have a long half-life (e.g., canrenone ~33 hours) and continue to be
      treated with spironolactone while digoxin is renally eliminated from the body. Based on this
      assessment, the FDA suggested study design is Treatment A: Single dose of digoxin alone.
      Treatment B: Digoxin + Spironolactone; Day 1- 9: Spironolactone quarter die (QD) dose; Day 6:
      Digoxin single oral dose.

      Also, digoxin has a long half-life of 1.5-2 days, and the Pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling
      scheme of up to 72 hours may not be enough to characterize the elimination kinetics of
      digoxin. Hence, the plasma concentrations of digoxin up to 96 hours (4 days) postdose is
      considered This will allow you to detect possible differences in the clearance of digoxin
      mediated by an interaction with P-gp in the renal proximal tubules.

      The study also involves collecting urine samples and measuring renal clearance (CLR) and
      unchanged drug excreted in urine (fe) for digoxin.
