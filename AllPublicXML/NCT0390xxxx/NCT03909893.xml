  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radical radiation therapy for prostate cancer is a common treatment that has shown to improve
      clinical outcomes in a post-operative setting. However, radiation therapy after surgery poses
      a greater risk for bladder and rectum injury for patients with prostate or bladder cancer.
      For prostate cancer patients, the risk is further amplified when pelvic nodes are part of the
      target irradiated volume. For bladder cancer patients, the risk of injury increases when more
      of the bladder is part of the target volume. Using an adaptive radiation therapy approach
      allows for correcting any shifts in the target volume. ART approach uses images from
      treatment to adapt the treatment plan. This study will use Adaptive Radiation Therapy for
      patients who receive pelvic nodal radiotherapy for either prostate or bladder cancer. Their
      treatment plans will adapted using MRI scans and CBCT scans taken during their first week of
      radiotherapy to account for any shifts in the target volume. The purpose of this study is to
      evaluate the feasibility of ART approach and its and on treatment plan quality metrics for
      pelvic radiotherapy. Acute and late toxicities will also be evaluated. 40 participants
      (minimum of 10 bladder cancer patients) will be enrolled. The participants will be followed
      for a period of 5 years post radiation therapy, during which they will have PSA as per
      standard practice, along with follow-up questionnaires (EPIC for prostate cancer patients and
      BUSS for bladder cancer patients).
