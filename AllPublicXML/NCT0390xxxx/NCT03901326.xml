    <textblock>
      The primary of this registry is to evaluate whether the availability of CTA/CT-FFR procedure
      could effectively optimize the flow of clinical practice of stable chest pain versus
      conventional clinical pathway in decision making, avoid the overuse of invasive procedure,
      finally improve clinical prognosis and reduce total medical expenditure. This registry is
      randomized, open labeled, prospective designed and will be performed in 6 Chinese hospitals.
      Approximately 1200 subjects will be enrolled and subsequently assigned to either routine
      clinically-indicated diagnostic care group (CID arm) or CTA/CT-FFR care group (CTA/CT-FFR
      arm) via computer-generated random numbers (1:1 ratio)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Based on the clinical fact that less stress single photon emission computed tomography
      (SPECT) and stress magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are performed rather than stress exercise
      electrocardiogram (ECG) in China, more patients undergo coronary computed tomographic
      angiography (CTA) for determining whether they should be sent to catheter lab. However,
      nearly 30% of patients sent to catheter lab were found without obstructive coronary artery
      disease (CAD) and this invasive procedure was unnecessary and overused partly. Fortunately,
      fractional flow reserve (FFR) based non-invasive CT algorithm technology (CT-FFR) showed a
      great potential in detecting functional myocardial ischemia related to coronary specific
      lesion (Discovery-Flow, DEFACTO and NXT trial)[1-3]. Moreover, clinical care guided by CT-FFR
      could provide benefits with equivalent clinical outcomes and lower expenditure, compared with
      routine clinical care over 1-year follow-up (Platform trial). On the other aspect, ADVANCE
      trial revealed that CT-FFR modified treatment recommendation was associated with less
      negative invasive coronary angiography (ICA), predicted revascularization and identified
      subjects at low risk of adverse events through 90 days in real-world. However, these studies
      was not randomized designed and selection bias still existed. So our registry is aim to
      evaluate whether CTA/CT-FFR outperforms the regular diagnostic care in ruling out patients
      without significantly obstructive CAD before catheter lab and improving clinical prognosis
      during follow-up in a randomized design.

    <description>If the subjects are randomly allocated to CTA/CT-FFR arm, they will be examined by DeepFFR for three major epicardial arteries. If CT-FFR value of one or more major coronary arteries is less than 0.75, ICA will be performed directly; if CT-FFR is 0.75-0.8 (including 0.8), physicians will decide whether to start intensive drug therapy or ICA; if CT-FFR value is more than 0.8, only drug therapy will be needed. The clinical management plan will be suggested including optimal medical therapy, ICA, PCI, CABG and other intervention according to the result of this non-invasive examination.</description>

    <description>When subjects are randomized to the CTA/CT-FFR arm, FFR based on the coronary CTA imaging will be measured. DeepFFR workstation is very dedicated software utilizing the original CTA imaging to meter simulated FFR values in artificial intelligence model.The first step is to extract a 3D coronary artery model and generate coronary centerlines which are similar to the routine reconstruction of coronary CTA. The centerlines are extracted using a minimal path extraction filter. Then a novel path-based deep learning model, referred to DeepFFR, is used to predict the simulated FFR values on the vascular centerlines. Deep learning algorithm is used to establish characteristic sample database of coronary hemodynamics characteristic parameters. When deep training model is proved to be valid, it is applied to a new lesion-specific measurement. Lesion-specific CT-FFR is defined as simulated FFR value 2-3cm downstream of an interest lesion.</description>
