  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate if motivational-interviewing will enhance the expected effect from physical
      activity monitors, on physical activity in older adults, we will conduct a two-arm randomized
      controlled trial in 2019.

      Both groups in the trial will receive a physical activity monitor for everyday use in the
      12-week intervention period and a folder with information about the benefits of physical
      activity in older age. Participants in the intervention group will in addition to the use of
      the physical activity monitors receive a motivational feedback session by phone of about 20
      minutes constructed from the theoretical framework of Motivational interviewing by Rollnick,
      Miller &amp; Butler and Social Cognitive Theory by Bandura. The content of the session focuses on
      investigating the most relevant possibilities and barriers for the participant to increase
      his or her levels of PA.

      The primary outcome will be between group difference in average steps per day throughout the
      intervention period, measured objectively by the physical activity monitor (Garmin Vivofit
      3). Secondary outcomes include participant reported outcome measures such as 'International
      Physical Activity Questionnaire', 'Nordic Physical Activity Questionnaire', 'EQ5D Quality of
      life questionnaire', 'UCLA Loneliness Scale', 'Self Efficacy for Exercise', and 'Outcome
      expectancy for Exercise'. To ensure 80% power with an alpha-level on 0.05, we will include
      128 participants. The study will enroll in March 2019.

    <time_frame>Baseline + end point at 12 weeks + follow up at 6 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire: The EQ-5D-5L is a generic health-related quality of life (HRQoL) measure developed as a non-disease-specific instrument for describing and valuing health states and comprises five dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression), each of which has three levels (no problems, moderate problems and extreme problems) and a visual analogue scale (EQ VAS). The score for the five dimensions can be combined into a five-digit number that describes the patient's health state. The EQ VAS records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale, where the endpoints are labelled 'The best health you can imagine' and 'The worst health you can imagine'.</description>

    <measure>University of California, Los Angeles, Loneliness Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline + end point at 12 weeks + follow up at 6 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire: The 20-item UCLA loneliness scale (third version) is a self-report measure of loneliness and social isolation. The scale consists of 11 positive and nine negative items and the total score is calculated by finding the sum of 20 items (0-60), with a higher score indicating more loneliness.</description>

    <measure>Self Efficacy for Exercise</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline + end point at 12 weeks + follow up at 6 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire: The nine-item SEE-DK addresses confidence to engage in regular exercise [44], when challenged by known barriers to exercise. The scale was developed initially for sedentary adults in the community who participated in an outpatient exercise program and was revised to older adults. It is designed to be administered using face-to-face interview. Response categories range from 0 (no confidence) to 10 (very confident). Item scores are used to calculate a total score (0-90), with higher scores indicating higher confidence, or self-efficacy, related to exercise. The SEE-DK is adapted to Danish older adults with acceptable face and content validity, construct validity by acceptable model fit as a unidimensional scale, and test-retest reliability.</description>

    <measure>Outcome expectancy for Exercise</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline + end point at 12 weeks + follow up at 6 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire: The 13-item OEE-2 scale was developed from the original 9-item Outcome Expectations for Exercise scale (OEE) that specifically focused on measuring the positive outcome expectations for exercise (POEE). To complete the OEE2-DK scale the participants are asked, using a Likert scale, to strongly agree, agree, neither agree nor disagree, disagree, or strongly disagree with the stated outcomes to each statement of exercising.</description>

    <description>During the 12-week intervention, the participants will receive seven telephone calls from a physical therapist. The interviews will be held in week 1, 2,3,5,7,9, and 12.
The telephone call will consist of a motivational interview focused on enhancing the daily level of physical activity in the participants.
MI is a form of counselling aiming at prompting increases in self-efficacy, which may leave people more open to and invested in changing their behaviours and shows potential for significant effects for exercise behaviour change.
In addition to the telephone based motivational interviews, the experimental group will also receive the &quot;base intervention&quot; which is described in detail under the &quot;control intervention paragraph&quot;.</description>

    <description>The &quot;base intervention&quot; consists of a physical activity monitor (PAM) for everyday use in the intervention period and a pamphlet with information about Danish recommendations on physical activity in aging populations. The PAM will be the Garmin Vivofit 3 monitor linked to a pre-specified Garmin Connect account. The participants will be asked to install the Garmin Connect application on their smartphone and use the given ID/password in the app. The participants will be asked to wear the monitor 24-hours a day for the 12-week intervention period. The participants can use the PAM as they like but they will be asked to try to use the PAM and the application to enhance their daily level of physical activity.</description>
