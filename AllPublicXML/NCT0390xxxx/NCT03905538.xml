  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The experimental [18F]FLT-PET/CT will be completed before initiation of chemotherapy and
      prior to the third cycle (or month) of chemotherapy. Laboratory analysis and correlative
      radiology, as directed per clinical care based on the primary diagnosis, are required within
      30 days of the baseline [18F]FLT PET/CT. Follow-up will comprise 24 months of standard
      practice treatment and follow up.

      Primary Objective is to assess if percentage change in [18F]FLT PET/CT quantitative
      parameters (SUV max, or SUV peak or proliferative tumor volume) after 2 cycles of
      chemotherapy can predict progression free survival at 1 and 2 years in pediatric patients
      with newly diagnosed solid tumors.

      Secondary Objectives are: (1) to assess if percentage change in [18F]FLT PET/CT quantitative
      parameters (SUV max, or SUV peak or proliferative tumor volume) after 2 cycles of
      chemotherapy can predict overall survival at 2 years in pediatric patients with newly
      diagnosed solid tumors; and (2) for enrolled patients that undergo tumor resection as part of
      their therapy regimen within one month of the FLT imaging, mitotic index of the tumor will be
      assessed as compared to initial biopsy specimen and correlate with FLT activity.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with histologically confirmed solid tumor malignancies with residual tumors
             present that require standard of care chemotherapy for a minimum number of cycles. All
             anatomical sites and all tumor histologies are eligible including central nervous
             system tumors.

          -  Patients ages 13 - 25 years

          -  In the opinion of the investigator, patients must be thought to be able to lie still
             for imaging without sedation for 20 - 30 minutes.

          -  Patients must have a performance status of &gt; 50% (Lansky or Karnofsky).

          -  Patients of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test
             as per institution's standard of care within 7 days prior to [18F]FLT PET/CT imaging

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent/assent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with known allergic or hypersensitivity reactions to previously administered
             radiopharmaceuticals of similar chemical or biologic composition to [18F]FLT

          -  Subjects who had prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy before enrollment in the study.

          -  Subjects for whom chemotherapy is not a standard of care primary therapy option.

          -  Patients who are pregnant or breast-feeding

          -  Patients with no residual tumor (i.e. complete resection at diagnosis)
