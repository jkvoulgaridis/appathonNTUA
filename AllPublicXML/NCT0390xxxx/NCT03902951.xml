  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well antiandrogen therapy (leuprolide, apalutamide, and
      abiraterone acetate) and stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) works in treating
      patients with prostate cancer that has come back and has spread to other parts of the body.
      Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as leuprolide, apalutamide, and abiraterone acetate, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. SBRT uses special equipment to
      position a patient and deliver radiation to tumors with high precision. This method can kill
      tumor cells with fewer doses over a shorter period and cause less damage to normal tissue.
      Giving antiandrogen therapy and SBRT may work better in treating patients with prostate
      cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the efficacy of combined systemic and tumor directed therapy for recurrent
      oligometastatic M1a,b prostate cancer patients with 1-5 metastases (exclusive of pelvic nodal
      N1 metastases) staged by prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission
      tomography (PET)-computed tomography (CT).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Time to biochemical progression. II. Time to additional antineoplastic therapy. III.
      Prostate cancer specific survival. IV. Safety and tolerability. V. Assessment of health
      related quality of life using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Prostate (FACT-P)
      scale.

      CORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine genomic and transcriptomic features present in metastatic tumors in patients
      that respond to this multimodal therapy.

      II. To evaluate biomarkers of response using circulating tumor cells (CTCs). III. To evaluate
      biomarkers of response using circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (ctDNA).

      IV. To evaluate immunophenotypes of circulating immune cells.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive a single dose of leuprolide subcutaneously (SC) on day 1 and apalutamide
      orally (PO) once daily (QD) and abiraterone acetate PO QD for up to 6 months in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning 2 months of initiation of
      antiandrogen therapy (ADT), patients also receive SBRT over 1, 3, or 5 fractions in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 2 -4 weeks, every 30
      days for 6 months, and then every 3 months thereafter.

    <description>This uses the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Prostate (FACT-P) questionnaire. It assesses patient function in four domains: Physical, Social/Family, Emotional, and Functional well-being, which is further supplemented by 12 site specific items to assess for prostate related symptoms. Items are rated on a 0 to 4 Likert type scale and combined to produce subscale scores for each domain and a global score, the higher the score, the better the quality of life. Range from 0-150 .

                  co-administered, abiraterone acetate dose frequency will be adjusted). [SAFETY:
                  Warning against use with CYP2C8 inhibitors with narrow therapeutic index is also
                  pertinent to be included as it is also part of United States Prescribing
                  Information (USPI): In a CYP2C8 drug-drug interaction trial in healthy subjects,
                  the area under curve (AUC) of pioglitazone (CYP2C8 substrate) was increased by
                  46% when pioglitazone was given together with a single dose of 1,000 mg
                  abiraterone acetate. Therefore, patients should be monitored closely for signs of
                  toxicity related to a CYP2C8 substrate with a narrow therapeutic index if used
                  concomitantly with ZYTIGA]

               -  Treatment with CYP2D6 substrates that have a narrow therapeutic index. If an
                  alternative treatment cannot be used, a dose reduction of the CYP2D6 substrate
                  may be considered

               -  Baseline moderate and severe hepatic impairment (ChildPugh Class B &amp; C)

          -  Presence of visceral metastases (i.e., stage M1c)
