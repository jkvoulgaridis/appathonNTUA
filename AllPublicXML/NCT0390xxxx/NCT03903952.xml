  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-classified atypical squamous cells (ASCUS) is the most common abnormal cervical cytology
      (%39). The risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2-3 is 5% and the risk of carcinoma is
      around 0.1% after diagnosis. Mostly human papillomavirus (HPV) is responsible for this
      transition. Most of them are transient, but some infections become persistent and can
      progress into precancer and invasive cancer. In the process of progression to cancer;
      patients with cell cycle problems are thought to be at risk. In some studies, B12 and folate
      deficiency, which play a role in DNA synthesis and repair, have been shown to induce
      incorrect binding of uracil to DNA, leading to DNA breakage and repair disorder. Therefore,
      in this study, it has been aimed that the relation of presence of atypical squamous cells and
      HPV persistence with folate and vitamin B12 levels which effect on immune system.

      Participants were divided into two groups according to their smear results; atypical squamous
      cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) (study group: 100 patients) and women who did not
      have intraepithelial neoplasia as a result of smear (control group: 100 patients). Patients
      who had well preserved sufficient number of squamous epithelial cells, who did not have
      bleeding, fixation failure, inflammation or atrophy, and had negative cervical cytology smear
      were considered as control group. HPV test was also requested from the study group. B12 and
      folate blood levels were compared between the groups.
