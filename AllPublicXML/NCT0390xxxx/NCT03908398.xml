  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of outcome-oriented visual assessment and
      process-oriented visual assessment using ATP bioluminescence test as a comparator in order to
      find out which method can be used to assess hospital cleanliness.

      This study was conducted in a 17-bed adult medical intensive care unit at a medical center
      during December 2019 to December 2020. First of all, high-touch room surfaces were selected
      in patient rooms, including bed rails / controls, light switch, IV pump control, feeding pump
      control, monitor control, bedside table handle, call button, IV pole (grab area) and suction
      machine control. Then, Areas to be sampled on those high-touch room surfaces were identified.
      Whenever the housekeepers started to do terminal cleaning after patients were transferred or
      discharged, the researcher also started to observe directly the practices of cleaning at the
      same time and recorded &quot;cleaned&quot; if surfaces were cleaned and disinfected properly. Then, the
      researcher inspected surfaces and recorded &quot;clean&quot; if surfaces were free of dust, debris, and
      stains immediately after terminal cleaning.Ten minutes after terminal cleaning, Hygiena
      Ultrasnap Surface ATP test was performed to swab a standard area of 10 square centimeters on
      specific surfaces. After completing sampling, swabs were replace back in swab tube and all
      liquid in bulbs was expelled to activate the reaction. Once activated, samples were read
      right after shaking swab tube for 5-10 seconds.
