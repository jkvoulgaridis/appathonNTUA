  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, cervical pain is the second most frequent musculoskeletal disorder, which
      generates an important impact on the function and quality of life. It is estimated that its
      anual prevalence for the general population can reach 50%.

      Non-specific cervical pain attends without signs or symptoms of structural or neurological
      pathology, its etiology is unknown. However, it is related with joint and muscular
      structures. It has been observed a decrease in the strength and endurace of the deep cervical
      flexor muscles in 70% of patients with cervical pain; as well as motor control déficit and
      coordination alterations in the sinergy between the activity of the superficial and deep
      musculature.

      Also, phycosocial factors, as for example: behaviors of fear-avoidance, catastrophism,
      hypervigilancy, psychosocial stress and negative adaptative neuroplastic changes, may have an
      importante role in chronic musculoskeletal pain.

      In the last years, RV has been used in clinical rehabilitation, being a reliable and valid
      tool, which allows the patient distration to virtual world and they have offered results
      like: decreased pain and fear of movement and also improvements in motor performance and
      neuroplasticity processes.

      The aim of this single-blinded randomized novel pilot study is to observe the effects
      generated in motor variables, when a protocol of manual therapy combined with augmented
      reality as a method of exercise in subjects with non-specific cervical pain is applied; in
      comparaison with a protocol of manual therapy combined with conventional cervical exercises.

      Different variables will be measured at the beginning and at the end of intervention. Also,
      they will be measured one month after the intervention to observe the changes produced in
      short term. These variables are: pain, function, satisfaction, propioception, endurance, as
      well as phychological and somatosensory variables.

    <measure>Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia(TSK-11)</measure>
    <time_frame>change measures (Baseline, 4 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Self-report that assesses fear related to musculoskeletal pain. It is composed of 11 statements, in which the patient will have to rate from 1 to 4, being 1 totally in disagreement and 4 totally in agreement. The scores will range from 11 to 44 points, the higher the score the greater the fear of pain related to the movement.</description>

    <measure>Q Sense (Quantitative termal thresholds: cold and heat)</measure>
    <time_frame>change measures (Baseline, 4 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The thermotest Q-sense evaluates quantitatively the termal thresholds such as cold and heat, as well as the sensation of pain due to heat or cold. It provides an comprehensive somatosensory profile. It has been shown that in patients with sensory disorders of different etiologies, the sensory quantitative tests are considered as an useful/valuable diagnostic tool, which have good interobserver and test-retest reliability</description>

    <measure>Pain (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>change measures (Baseline, 4 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>is a scale of 100 mm, in which the patient must make a mark to indicate the intensity of its pain, being the minimum value 0, which represents the absence of pain and the maximum value is 10, representing the worst pain.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>The intervention will be divided into two parts, the first one where MT treatment will take place and the second part where usual care exercise protocol will be introduced.
The manual therapy protocol that will be used is the one proposed by Beltrán-Alacreu et al. (2015). The mentioned protocol consist of specific passive movements in the facet cervical joints, global mobilization of the cervical spine and high-velocity technique in the thoracic región.</description>

    <arm_group_label>MT treatment + Augmented reality (AR) exercises</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The intervention will be divided into two parts, the first one where MT treatment will take place and the second part where AR will be applied as an exercise method.
The same manual therapy protocol will be used for both groups.
For this group, the Microsoft HoloLens Development Edition device will be used, which is a holographic device that allows us to interact with high definition holograms in its environment. The application that will be used will be the Roboraid software, this app is a &quot;shooter&quot;, which requires the cervical movement to move the pointer and be able to play.</description>
