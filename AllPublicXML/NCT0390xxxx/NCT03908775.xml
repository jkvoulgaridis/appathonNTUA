  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nasotracheal intubation is indicated in patients undergoing oral, maxillofacial, or dental
      procedures. During nasal intubation with the traditional Macintosh laryngoscope, use of
      Magill's forceps or external laryngeal manipulation is usually required to facilitate
      intubation. The prolonged or multiple intubation attempts and, subsequently, may be
      associated with complications such as oxygen desaturation or airway and dental injuries.

      The C-MAC videolaryngoscope (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany) is a videolaryngoscope using a
      modified Macintosh blade, which may be a useful alternative both for routine and difficult
      airway management and for educational purposes.

      In this prospective, randomized, controlled trial, the purpose is to compare C-MAC and DL in
      terms of intubation times, hemodynamic response and adverse events associated with
      nasotracheal intubation in children undergoing dental procedures.

    <textblock>
      Tracheal intubation using direct laryngoscopy is successful in the majority of patients, even
      when a line-of-sight view of the glottis is not possible. Although poor glottic visualization
      is encountered between 1% and 9% of attempts, success can generally be achieved with
      additional force, external laryngeal manipulation, or the use of gum elastic bougies and
      stylets. However, poor glottic exposure is more likely to require prolonged or multiple
      intubation attempts and, subsequently, may be associated with complications such as oxygen
      desaturation or airway and dental injuries. In recent years, videolaryngoscopy has begun to
      play an important role in the management of patients with an unanticipated difficult or
      failed laryngoscopic intubation.
