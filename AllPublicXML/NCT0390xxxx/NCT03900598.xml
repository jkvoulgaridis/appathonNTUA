    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose regimen or the maximum
      tolerated dose of JNJ-67856633 in participants with relapsed/ refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin
      lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) represents a diverse set of diseases. Among them diffuse large
      B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) represents the most common subtype of NHL, accounting for 30 percent
      (%) to 40% of all newly diagnosed cases. Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma
      translocation protein 1 (MALT1) is a key mediator of the nuclear factor
      kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kappaB) signaling pathway and has been
      shown to play a critical role in different types of lymphoma, including activated B cell-like
      (ABC) subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). JNJ-67856633 is a MALT1 inhibitor and
      will be administered orally. The study will evaluate the following: Dose Escalation (Part 1):
      One or more recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2Ds) of JNJ-67856633. Cohort Expansion (Part 2):
      JNJ-67856633 is well tolerated and achieves antitumor responses at the RP2D. The study
      consists of screening phase (less than or equal to 28 days before first dose), treatment
      phase (from Cycle 1 Day 1 till end of treatment visit [within 30 (+7) days after the last
      dose]) and post-treatment phase. A prescreening period may also apply to participants in
      select cohorts in Part 2. The total study duration will be approximately 3 years. Efficacy
      assessments will include radiographic image assessments, positron emission tomography scan,
      bone marrow assessment, endoscopy or colonoscopy etc. Safety will be monitored throughout the
      study.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status grade of 0 or 1

          -  Cardiac parameters within the following range: corrected QT interval (QTc intervals
             corrected using Fridericia's formula [QTcF]) less than or equal to (&lt;=)480
             milliseconds based on the average of triplicate assessments performed no more than 5
             minutes apart (plus minus [+-]3 minutes)

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative highly sensitive serum (Beta
             human chorionic gonadotropin) at screening and prior to the first dose of study drug,
             and until 30 days after the last dose

          -  In addition to the user-independent, highly effective method of contraception, a male
             or female condom with or without spermicide is required, example, condom with
             spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository. Male condom and female condom should not
             be used together (due to risk of failure with friction)

          -  Men must wear a condom when engaging in any activity that allows for passage of
             ejaculate to another person. Male participants should also be advised of the benefit
             for a female partner to use a highly effective method of contraception as condom may
             break or leak

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known active central nervous system (CNS) involvement for dose escalation and specific
             expansion cohorts as determined by the study evaluation team (SET)

          -  Prior solid-organ transplantation

          -  Either of the following: a) Received an autologous stem cell transplant less than or
             equal to (&lt;=)3 months before the first dose of study drug. b) Prior treatment with
             allogenic stem cell transplant &lt;=6 months before the first dose of study drug, has
             evidence of graft versus host disease, or requires immunosuppressant therapy

          -  History of malignancy (other than the disease under study in the cohort to which the
             participant is assigned) within 1 year prior to the first administration of study
             drug. Exceptions are squamous and basal cell carcinomas of the skin and carcinoma in
             situ of the cervix, or malignancy which in the opinion of the investigator, with
             concurrence with the sponsor's medical monitor, is considered cured with minimal risk
             of recurrence within 1 year before the first dose of study drug. Concomitant
             malignancies that are unlikely to progress and/or preclude evaluation of study
             endpoints may be allowed after discussion with the Study Responsible Physician

          -  Prior treatment with a mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation
             protein 1 (MALT1) inhibitor
