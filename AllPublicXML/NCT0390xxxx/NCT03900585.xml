  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a controlled, randomized intervention trial. Patients are randomized into either
      an intervention group or a control group. The duration of the study is 10 weeks. Patients in
      the intervention group participate in a 10 weeks exercise program consisting of 150 minutes
      interval walking per week administered by an app on the patient's telephone. Patients in the
      control group live as usually, with a maximum of 30 minutes aerobic exercise per week.

      Before and after the 10 weeks study period, patients (from both the intervention and the
      control group) participate in a 2 hours session of functional testing (e.g. walk tests, test
      of muscle strength ect.) at Rigshospitalet.

    <measure>Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis Score</measure>
    <time_frame>45 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) score is an established and validated measure of disease severity used in myasthenia gravis (MG) trials. This scoring system is based on quantitative testing of sentinel muscle groups by means of a 4 point scale ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 3 (severe symptoms). The scale measures ocular, bulbar, respiratory and limb function, grading each finding, and the total score ranges from 0(no myasthenic findings) to 39 (maximal myasthenic deficits).</description>

    <measure>Myasthenia gravis composite score</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Myasthenia Gravis composite score (MGC) covers 10 important functional domains most frequently involved in patients with MG. This scoring system is based on quantitative testing of muscle groups, or symptom history told by the patient, by means of a 4 point scale ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 9 (severe symptoms). The scale measures ocular, bulbar, respiratory and limb function, grading each finding, and the total score ranges from 0(no myasthenic findings) to 50 (maximal myasthenic deficits).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Myasthenia gravis activity of daily living profile (MG-ADL)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Impact on daily living is assessed using the MG-ADL. An eight-question survey of symptoms severity, with each response graded from 0 (normal) to 3 (most severe). Questions include ocular, oropharyngeal, respiratory, and extremity functions. Total MG-ADL score ranges from 0 to 24. MG-ADL is also an indirect measurement of disease severity.</description>

    <measure>Myasthenia gravis quality of life 15-item score (MG-QoL15)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>MG -specific quality-of-life instrument is a 15-item questionnaire encompassing physical and psychological domains of MG to assess disease-specific Qol in MG patients. Rating consist of a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (&quot;not at all&quot;) to 4 (&quot;very much&quot;) as to the degree to which patients agree with the given statement summing up to a total score 0-60 points.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI-20)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported questionnaire that measure fatigue severity. It contains 20 items and consists of five domains: mental fatigue, reduced motivation, reduced activity, physical fatigue and general fatigue. The response options consist of five check boxes ranging from &quot;yes, that is true&quot; to &quot;No, that is not true&quot;. The scores in each domain range from 4 to 20, with higher scores indicating higher levels of fatigue. A total fatigue score for all five domains is not used. MFI-20 has been used in several clinical and healthe populations.</description>
