  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effect of 5Hertz (Hz) repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation
      (rTMS) on Left Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex enhancing Cognitive Stimulation in Mild
      Cognitive Impairment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is defined as an intermediate state between normal aging and
      an early stage of neurodegenerative diseases. It is estimated that exist 24.3 million people
      worldwide with neurocognitive disorders. Cognitive Stimulation (CS) is defined as the set of
      techniques and strategies that optimize the effectiveness in various functions of different
      cognitive abilities throughout its use in rehabilitation on MCI. Transcranial Magnetic
      Stimulation (rTMS) is a safe neuromodulation technique that modifies brain electrical
      activity through electromagnetic fields. There is evidence of the relationship between CS and
      rTMS for the improvement in MCI levels and cognitive functions; it´s important to deepen the
      knowledge of the therapeutic potential of both techniques combined on MCI

    <description>The Geriatric Depression Scale is a 30 item scale that evaluates the severity of depressive symptoms in Geriatric patients. With a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 30 scores, above 11 are suggestive for depression, relating a higher score with a higher depression level.</description>

    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>The Barratt Impulsivity Scale is a likert-type self-questionnaire designed to assess the personality and behavioral construct of impulsiveness; composed of 30 items, each one scored from 0-4 according to the presence and severity of them, describing common impulsive or non-impulsive behaviors and preferences. This scale does not have a cut-off point, relating a higher score with a higher impulsivity in which can be assessed three types of impulsivity (cognitive, motor and non-planned impulsivity).</description>
