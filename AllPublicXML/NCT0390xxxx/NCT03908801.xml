  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities (PIMD) have extensive health
      problems and need for personal assistance throughout the day. Few physical- and health
      promoting activities are available for them and among the activities, few have been
      scientifically evaluated. Specialized water dance intervention (SWAN) is a new method
      developed to relieve discomfort and promote physical wellbeing among people with PIMD. The
      aim of the study is to evaluate the effects of SWAN on stress, spasticity, pain, alertness,
      wellbeing and social interaction among individuals with PIMD.

      aim of the study is to evaluate the effects of SWAN on stress, spasticity, pain, alertness,
      wellbeing and social interaction among individuals with PIMD.

      Prospective randomized controlled intervention study in which the effects of SWAN are tested
      in a two-group cross-over design with pre-, under- and post-measurements. The study is
      conducted as a multicenter study with four participating county councils/regions I Sweden
      (Varmland County Council, Region Orebro County, Region Ostergotland and Region Gavleborg).

      The SWAN intervention is given once a week for 3 months (12 occasions). Each SWAN session is
      45 minutes and is led by two SWAN leaders.

    <intervention_model_description>The participants are first randomized to the intervention or control group and when the intervention for the first group is completed, the intervention is given to the second group (former control group). Since the prevalence of profound intellectual and multiple disabilities is low, the project is carried out as a multicenter study.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The Modified Ashworth Scale is used to assess muscle tone. The flexor muscles of the elbows and the extensor muscles of the knees on the participants left and right side are tested. The muscle tone is scored on a 6-point scale from 0 (No increase in muscle tone) to 5 (Affected part(s) is(are) rigid in flexion or extension). The higher the score, the more resistance to passive movement.</description>

    <measure>Wellbeing: Observed (questionnaire)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The questionnaire includes items on spasticity, anxiety, pain, social interaction and joy. The support person assess the patients' level of spasticity, anxiety, pain, social interaction and joy three times: before, during and after each session. Each item is assessed on a five-point Likert scale, from 'not at all present' (1) to 'present all the time' (5). The research group has developed the questionnaire.</description>

    <measure>Quality of Life assessment: EQ5D</measure>
    <time_frame>14 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life was assessed using the proxy version of the EuroQol Five Dimension (EQ5D). The EQ5D is divided into five items: mobility, self-care, Daily activities, pain and discomfort, anxiety and depression. The items are scored on a 5 point scale, as well as a visual analogue scale ranging from 0 (worst imaginable health) to 100 (best imaginable health).</description>

    <description>Video assisted observation. Each person will be video recorded in the pool on three occasions (1st, 6th and 12th session). The responsible intervention leader and the project coordinator perform the video recording. From the video recordings, assessments are made of the patient's expression of emotions and social interaction, through a structured assessment protocol developed by the research group. The video material is transferred to the computer and encoded according to a pre-established protocol using a computer program-coding tool.</description>

    <measure>Goal attainment</measure>
    <time_frame>14 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>We use the Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS), which provides an individualized, criterion-referenced measure of change. The GAS procedure involves: (a) defining a unique set of goals for each participant, (b) specifying a range of possible outcomes for each goal (on a scale recommended to contain five levels, from -2 (the participants baseline level before the intervention) to +2(represent much better than expected after the intervention) and (c) using the scale to evaluate the participants change after a specified intervention period.</description>

    <description>Group activity in a warm pool (32-34 °C) led by two SWAN leaders. During each session, nine songs are played and the participants, assisted by a support person, perform dance movements rhythmically to the mood of the music. The songs are chosen to stimulate different movement patterns and to emphasize different emotions.</description>
