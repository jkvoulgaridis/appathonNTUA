  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled trial, in parallel, aimed to evaluate the effects of 12
      weeks of Beach Tennis Training on blood pressure in hypertensive participants. The current
      hypothesis is that 12 weeks of Beach Tennis Training will reduce blood pressure, when
      compared to pre training corresponding values and to the control group without exercise.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although exercise is widely recommended as a non-pharmacological therapy to reduce blood
      pressure (BP), the efficacy of sport training in reduce BP is poorly investigated. The
      potential anti-hypertensive effects of Beach Tennis (BT) training in reduce BP remain
      unclear, particularly in individuals with hypertension.

      This is a randomized parallel trial to evaluate the effects of 12 weeks of Beach Tennis
      training on ambulatory blood pressure in hypertensive participants. The current hypothesis is
      that Beach Tennis Training will reduce blood pressure, when compared to pre training
      corresponding values and to the control group without exercise.

      Men and women aged between 35 and 65 years with the medical diagnosis of hypertension will
      composed the sample of this study. The primary outcome variable (i.e., 24h, daytime and
      nighttime systolic and diastolic blood pressure) will be assessed before and after the 12
      weeks of interventions through outpatient blood pressure monitoring.

      The participants will be randomized in two different groups: BT training group, which will
      perform two sessions per week of BT training and a control intervention (control group),
      which will perform one session per week of theoretical-practical lectures of BT and health
      education.
