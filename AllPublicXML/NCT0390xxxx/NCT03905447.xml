  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study tests the effects of pre-emptive treatment with an experimental drug PC945 in lung
      transplant recipients whose lungs are infected by the fungus Aspergillus fumigatus.

      PC945 may be useful in treating patients infected with Aspergillus fumigatus as, unlike the
      usual treatments, it is inhaled into the lung and has been designed to stay there and treat
      the infection. Participants will be monitored for up-to 12 weeks for the presence of
      Aspergillus in their lungs. Suitable participants will receive PC945 for an initial 28 days
      (Pre-emptive treatment phase) and, if needed, a further 8-weeks (Extended treatment
      phase).The amount of fungus in the patients' lungs will be measured over the course of the
      study. Participants with lung infections but not eligible for PC945 will be followed-up for
      16-weeks on standard of care treatment. The study will take place at multiple sites in UK and
      10 participants will receive PC945. The maximum study duration will be about 28 weeks.
