  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this initial proof of principle single arm cohort trial is to determine if
      contemporary endovascular venous intervention, compared with a 1:1 propensity-matched medical
      therapy arm of the ATTRACT trial, significantly reduces the 2-year occurrence of Post
      Thrombotic Syndrome (PTS) in subjects with symptomatic proximal Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A single arm cohort will serve as a proof of principle study, and be the foundation for a
      larger subsequent prospective, Randomised Clinical Trial (RCT). The aim of this initial
      single arm cohort is to both validate that contemporary catheter directed therapy performed
      by experienced operators has significant efficacy and safety at 10 days, 30 days, 6 months,
      12 months, and 2 years (details below). If a strong signal of efficacy and safety is found in
      the initial single arm cohort at 30 days and 6 months, this will provide objective evidence
      to move forward with a larger multicentre, prospective, RCT.

      If the results of the initial single arm proof of principle cohort do not show efficacy, or
      there is a safety issue, a larger prospective, RCT will not be performed.

    <intervention_name>Contemporary endovascular venous intervention by Zelante pharmacomechanical thrombolysis</intervention_name>
    <description>All patients will undergo ultrasound guided micro puncture venous access of the enrolled ipsilateral lower extremity popliteal vein followed by a diagnostic venogram to define thrombus burden and anatomic extent of DVT. Prior to and every 30 minutes during the endovascular procedure, an activated clotting time (ACT) will be obtained. Intravenous unfractionated heparin will be administered to keep the ACT between 250 - 300. A Zelante catheter will be utilised to perform pharmacomechanical thrombolysis of the enrolled lower extremity. If there is involvement of the popliteal and/or femoral vein, pharmacomechanical thrombolysis should also be performed of these veins. Venous stenting may be implemented to address areas of residual venous stenosis or outflow obstruction following pharmacomechanical thrombolysis. Stent placement in the common iliac, external iliac, and common femoral vein are routinely done to address inflow or outflow issues after pharmacomechanical thrombolysis.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient age 16 years to 75 years.

          -  Onset of acute DVT symptoms of 14 days or less in the study limb.

          -  DVT located in the common and/or external iliac, or common femoral vein

          -  Consent to participate in this research study and be willing to commit to study
             requirements including completion of questionnaires and follow-up visits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  In the index leg: established PTS, or previous symptomatic DVT within the last 2
             years.

          -  In the contralateral (non-index) leg: symptomatic acute DVT a) involving the iliac
             and/or common femoral vein; or b) for which thrombolysis is planned as part of initial
             therapy.

          -  Limb-threatening circulatory compromise.

          -  Pulmonary embolism defined as either massive (Systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mmHg and/or
             patient on IV vasoactive medication to support blood pressure), or intermediate high
             risk pulmonary embolism (PE), as defined by the European Society Guideline on
             management of PE. Low risk PE and/or intermediate low risk PE can be enrolled.

          -  Inability to tolerate contemporary venous intervention procedure due to severe dyspnea
             or acute systemic illness.
