      The aim of this study was to evaluate the surgical decisions of Watson artificial
      intelligence in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatectomy is an effective treatment for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, but liver
      failure after hepatectomy may lead to increased postoperative mortality. Therefore, it is
      very important to make preoperative surgical decisions, evaluate the safety of the operation
      and identify which patients are likely to suffer from liver failure. The artificial
      intelligence platform developed by IBM Watson for Watson tumor treatment decisions can
      provide treatment decisions and corresponding theoretical basis to guide surgical decisions
      based on the key clinical data of liver cancer patients.
