  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is a first-in-human drug combination with the first-in-class alkylating histone
      deacetylase inhibition (HDACi) fusion molecule Tinostamustine (EDO-S101) and the anti-PD-1
      monoclonal antibody Nivolumab in patients with refractory, locally advanced or metastatic
      melanoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite improvement of systemic treatment in patients with advanced melanoma, there is still
      unmet medical need in this group of patients. Tinostamustine is a medication without
      marketing authorization, while Nivolumab is approved for several tumor entities. The primary
      objective of this trial is to assesses the safety, tolerability and recommended dose of
      Tinostamustine in combination with Nivolumab in patients with advanced melanoma.Secondary
      objectives of this trial in patients with advanced solid tumors are to assess the preliminary
      efficacy of Tinostamustine when given in combination with Nivolumab and to characterize
      potential predictive biomarkers of the combination treatment of Tinostamustine and Nivolumab.
      The trial includeds patients with either histologically or cytologically confirmed inoperable
      stage III or metastatic stage IV melanoma with an indication for the regular systemic
      treatment with Nivolumab and a maximum of 1 prior systemic palliative line of treatment.
