  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BEEPS describes the utility of patient reported outcomes (PRO) as simple, pragmatic, and
      sensitive tool to assess early treatment response of benralizumab to document the level of
      asthma control and change in medication after 1 to 16 weeks post-treatment initiation
      including use of OCS. The generated data on the time of asthma symptom relief after
      initiation of benralizumab will support patient management for a better disease control in
      severe asthma patients under benralizumab treatment. To assess long term outcomes the
      patients will have a last mandatory visit after 56 weeks, with no visits scheduled between
      week 16 and 56.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim and objective of this single arm, prospective observational study is to describe
      patient reported outcomes (PRO) in severe eosinophilic asthma patients who are treated with
      benralizumab according to the label granted in Switzerland. The PRO measures consist of the
      weekly Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ‑5) as well as Patient Global Impression of Change
      and Severity (PGI-C and PGI-S) collected at each visit (0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 56 weeks). In
      addition the patient fills out twice daily the patient electronic asthma diary (eDiary)
      capturing daily symptoms and symptom free days together with a PEF (Peak Expiratory Flow)
      measurement. Persistance with eDiary and PEF will be assessed after 56 weeks. The percentage
      of patients successfully reducing their OCS dose will be evaluated after 16 weeks of
      treatment with benralizumab and if OCS reduction is persistent until week 56. Furthermore,
      the proportion of patients with an ACQ-5 score improvement of ≥ 0.5 after 8 weeks of
      treatment with benralizumab will be determined. In addition, the study will assess changes in
      FEV1 and FVC after 8, 16 and 56 weeks of treatment with benralizumab and describe
      retrospectively asthma disease history, past treatment status and current medication at
      baseline.

        The study will recruit 77 male and female patients aged ≥ 18 years with severe,
        eosinophilic asthma who meet all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria.
        Approximately 15-20 specialist centres across Switzerland will participate in the study
        which have experience with biologic treatment, can initiate treatment with benralizumab and
        have a good oversight on the severe asthma population, as in some settings the patients are
        referred for longer term stationary care to achieve asthma control.

          6. Patients must be able and willing to read and comprehend written instructions, and
             comprehend and complete the questionnaires required by the protocol (ACQ-5, PGI-C and
             PGI-S).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects meeting any of the following criteria will not be eligible to participate in the
        study:

          1. Documented lung diseases other than asthma, e.g. COPD, and not within reimbursed
             label, e.g pregnancy or lactation.
