      Relationship between hemodynamic change and fluid removed during hemodialysis measured by
      non-invasive monitor
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      By applying non-invasive hemodynamic monitors (ex. ClearSight, I-COM), the trends of mean
      arterial pressure (MAP), stroke volume (SV), cardiac index (CI) and calculated systemic
      vascular resistance (SVR) were collected along with volume removal by hemodialysis on ESRD
      patients. All data were compared and analyzed to detect the sequential body volume status as
      well as the autonomic responses during hemodialysis.
