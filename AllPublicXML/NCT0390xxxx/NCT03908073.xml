  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are approximately 2.5-3 million patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) across
      Europe, with associated healthcare costs of €4.6-5.6 billion per annum (1). IBD is associated
      with a significant reduction in quality of life. Treatments directed towards modifying the
      inflammatory response, such as anti-tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) agents, are
      expensive, can necessitate admission to hospital for their administration and can be
      associated with side effects (2 3). Thus, the development of a novel non-pharmacological
      anti-inflammatory intervention, such as electrical vagal nerve stimulation, is warranted.

      This is a proof of concept study which aims to investigate whether transcutaneous vagal nerve
      stimulation is effective at reducing stress induced inflammatory cytokine levels in patients
      with quiescent ulcerative colitis.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males or females between 18 and 76 years of age (inclusive).

             score and faecal calprotectin of &lt;4 and &lt;250 μg/g (18) respectively, scored within 3
             months of entry into the study. Faecal calprotectin &lt;250 μg/g within 2 weeks before
