  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate whether visual interpretation of flortaucipir-PET (positron emission
      tomography) scans, examining patterns of tracer uptake at baseline, can predict the rate of
      clinically-meaningful cognitive decline due to AD after 18 months. All scans are acquired
      from cohorts of a previously completed study, I8D-MC-AZES (NCT02245737, Eli Lilly and Company
      sponsor).

    <measure>Assessment of reader visual interpretation of flortaucipir F 18 PET imaging to predict risk of cognitive and functional deterioration within 18 months of scan.</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 18 months of scan</time_frame>
    <description>Baseline Flortaucipir F 18 PET imaging status will be determined by majority, after classification by each reader as τAD++, increased neocortical uptake consistent with AD and likely to progress, or non-τAD++ (τAD+ / τAD-). Both groups will be evaluated for predicting the risk of subjects clinically meaningful cognitive and functional deterioration within 18 months of scan. Clinically meaningful deterioration (CMD) is defined as the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Box (CDR-SB) change from baseline with an increase of one point or more. Risk ratio between τAD++ and non-τAD++ will be calculated by Poisson regression.</description>
