  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a cross-over design, 15 participants, age 65-75, will be tested in six different arms in a
      randomised order. After a 12-hour fast participants will be served 2.5 dl coffee with 15 g
      cream + 30-50 g of different fatty acids, with or without 50 g glucose. Blood ketones and
      other biomarkers will be measured during 4 hours.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the metabolic state ketosis, beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) and acetoacetate are synthesised
      from fatty acids in the liver, resulting in higher circulating levels. Ketosis can be induced
      by fasting or adherence to a low-carb-high-fat diet, but also by intake of—at least
      some—medium-chain-triglycerides (MCT). MCT are built from fatty acids with a chain of 6-12
      carbon atoms. Caprylic acid (C8) is well known to be ketogenic, but the effect of lauric acid
      (C12)—constituting about 50% of coconut oil—is less clear.

      The aim of this study is to assess ketosis, as a combined effect of an extended overnight
      fast, and intake of coconut oil or C8, and to study how ketosis is affected by simultaneous
      glucose intake. Sunflower oil is used as control, expected to not break fasting ketosis,
      although not being ketogenic in itself. Some sunflower oil is also added to C8 to make that
      arm isocaloric with coconut oil, with a roughly similar proportion of MCT.

      Coffee with cream will be used as a vehicle, and although coffee has been reported to be
      mildly ketogenic, this effect is expected to be negligible and equally distributed between
      arms.

Very hungry. Hunger appeared during the last hour.
Hungry or very hungry. Hunger has been palpable for more than one hour.
Answers a, b &amp; c will be interpreted as sufficient satiety.</description>
