  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Childhood obesity is a serious problem in the United States, as it increases the risk for
      various cardiometabolic, pulmonary, and psychosocial complications for children, which often
      continue into adulthood. Examination of disparities in early childhood obesity among ethnic
      groups shows that Hispanic infants/children have higher rates of overweight and obesity than
      children/infants of other races/ethnicities. According to the most recent National Health and
      Nutrition Examination Survey (2014), the prevalence of high weight for recumbent length
      (≥95th percentile) among infant and toddlers from birth to 2 years was 6.6% in Whites, 8.4%
      in Blacks, and 9.4% in Hispanics. Furthermore, the percentages of children ages 2 through 5
      years who are overweight or obese (Body Mass Index [BMI] ≥ 85th) were 20.9% among
      non-Hispanic Whites, 21.9% among non-Hispanic Blacks, and 29.8% among Hispanics. These data
      suggest that ethnic disparities in childhood obesity prevalence have their origins in the
      earliest stages of life.

      Bergmann et al. reported that infants that received early formula artificial feeding by 3
      months had significantly higher BMIs and thicker skin fold than exclusively breastfed
      infants, and from 6 months on, compared with breastfed children, a consistently higher
      proportion of artificially-fed children exceeded the 90th and 97th percentile of BMI and skin
      folder thickness reference values. Exclusive breastfeeding (EBF), defined as exclusive infant
      feeding with breast milk without any additional food or drink, is the feeding option
      engendering greatest nutrition and health, imparting enhanced glucose management and
      reductions in early childhood obesity.

      Hispanic mothers in the U.S. are more likely to supplement with formula in the first 2 days
      of life, compared with Black and White U.S. mothers (Hispanic 33%; Black 28%; White 22%).
      Additionally, a common feeding practice among Hispanic mothers is the early introduction of
      solids including ethnic food. The introduction of formula or complementary food in breastfed
      Hispanic infants produces an overfeeding problem that leads to childhood obesity. In a study
      published by this team of investigators on infant feeding management in Hispanic women living
      in Kentucky was reported that even when 51% of the group of Hispanic mothers initiated EBF
      during hospital stay, only 22% continued EBF at 4 months after birth. These trends underscore
      the critical need for intervention to support EBF in this population.

      Objectives: There is great opportunity and immense need to empower vulnerable, at-risk
      Hispanic mother/infant dyads to prevent and manage childhood obesity by increasing duration
      and EBF and delaying the introduction of complementary food. The primary aim of this pilot
      study was to determinate the feasibility and evaluate the clinical impact of a novel,
      tailored, culturally and linguistically appropriate community-based intervention. The
      intervention was delivered by Hispanics bilingual/bicultural team of an International Board
      Certified Lactation Consultant (IBCLC) and a peer counselor (PC) and was tested in terms of
      its influence on key modifiable factors that are positively associated with increasing
      breastfeeding duration and exclusivity: (a) mother's breastfeeding intention; (b)
      breastfeeding self-efficacy; and (c) perceived social support. Specific aims for this study
      are:

      Aim 1: Determine the feasibility of the intervention. This aim is designed to answer the
      following important research questions:

      Q-1: Is the planned recruitment period sufficient to enroll the targeted number of
      participants? Q-2: What percent of treatment group participants will complete all sessions of
      the intervention? Q-3: What percent of participants will be retained in the study until the
      conclusion? Q-4: What factors are associated with intervention adherence and study retention?

      Aim 2: Evaluate the clinical impact of the intervention. The following hypotheses will be
      tested:

      Hypothesis #1: Women in the intervention group will have higher intention to breastfeed
      during the pre-natal period and will perceive greater self-efficacy and social support during
      postnatal period, compared with the usual care group.

      Hypothesis #2: Women in the intervention group will be more likely to initiate EBF during
      their post-delivery in-hospital stay than those in the usual care group.

      Hypothesis #3: Among those who practice EBF during their hospital stay, women in the
      intervention group will be more likely to continue EBF for six months than women in the usual
      care group.

      Hypothesis #4: Women in the intervention group will have longer time to introduction of
      complementary food to their infants compared with the usual care group.

      The feasibility of a tailored community-based intervention, entitled Early Childhood Obesity
      Risk-Reduction Program in Hispanics (ECOR-H), was tested. The ECOR-H provided mothers with
      culturally tailored, self-management risk-reduction modules, and with continued peer
      counselor (PC) and professional lactation consultant support to develop personal skill-set to
      &quot;take control&quot; of modifiable behaviors and help participants to exclusively breastfeed for a
      longer time and delay the introduction of solid food to the infants. The study was conducted
      in the University of Kentucky (UK) Polk Dalton Clinic and in the Birthing Center of UK Albert
      B. Chandler Hospital. A convenient sample of 39 self-identified Hispanic pregnant women were
      recruited and randomly assigned to intervention and standard care groups (Intervention n = 20
      ; Control n=19).

      Trained Research Personnel (RP) approached and screened women for eligibility in the waiting
      prenatal area, which was exclusively used by pregnant women--while waiting for prenatal care
      appointments. Screening for eligibility was accomplished using a checklist that contains
      eligibility criteria. If the woman satisfied the eligibility criteria, the potential
      participant was invited to go to a private room in the clinic available for this purpose and
      the research staff provided a review and explanation of the study with an invitation to
      participate. If the person stated that was not interested, the research staff asked if can
      share the reason(s) why of the decision and collected the information in the log track of
      potential recruitment contacted. Then the research staff thanked the time and ended the
      conversation. Women who agreed to participate were scheduled for an appointment at another
      convenient time at the participant's home or clinic to provide informed consent and signed a
      HIPAA authorization. Since the potential participants included English/Spanish speaking
      participants, the informed consent, HIPPA authorization, and interview materials and
      intervention sessions were provided in the language in which the subject was most proficient.
      The parental permission for the infant was included in the informed consent that the mother
      signed when agreed to participate in the study. The consent form explains that this study
      would collect information on the infant from the medical record. The type of information that
      would be collected about the infant was also described in the HIPAA authorization form. The
      informed consent form provided the overall goal of the research; a brief description of the
      research; the type of survey that would be conducted in each encounter; the infant assessment
      for the anthropometric measurements of weight, length, and head circumference, and the
      mother's BMI. The explanation also described the minimal risks to participants and the
      potential benefits, procedures to assure confidentiality, and the voluntary nature of
      participation and how the confidentiality of the information that participants provide during
      the study would be maintained. It was also necessary to collect the name and a telephone
      number for contact information and follow-up encounters. The research staff explained that
      this information would be used only for research purposes and to send reminding of time,
      date, and place of the follow-up interviews, and it will be destroyed by the end of the
      study.

      All identifiers such as name, address, date of birth, telephone number, medical record
      number, and a code number were included in a private list and saved in a Microsoft Excel
      program with password protection to which only the PI and research staff had access. The
      Microsoft Excel file was opened only in encrypted computers located in the office of the PI
      and research staff in the University of Kentucky College of Nursing. Only staff certified in
      human subjects research and who were listed as study personnel with the University of
      Kentucky Institutional Review Board (UK IRB) were allowed access to participant data. When
      the study was completed, the data was de-identified prior to data sharing.

      After providing informed consent, the participant completed a baseline study survey.
      Following the baseline interview, the research staff informed the PI weekly of the new number
      of participants recruited. The PI randomly assigned participants to intervention and standard
      care groups following randomization procedures. Data collection was similar for both groups
      (standard care and intervention) and was obtained independently by research staff at 30 weeks
      of pregnancy (T-1), at 37 or more weeks of pregnancy (T-2), chart review of mother/infant
      medical record at birth (T-3), between 2-4 weeks after birth (T-4), and at three (T-5) and
      six (T-6) months after the birth. Randomization: After the baseline interview (T-1), the
      participant was randomly assigned to the standard of care group or standard care plus ECOR-H
      intervention group. The random assignment schedule was stratified according to whether the
      woman was a first-time mother or has other children; this allowed equal numbers within each
      of these two strata to be assigned to each of the two treatment conditions. The
      biostatistician prepared envelopes that contain the treatment assignments, one set for each
      stratum. Within each stratum, the treatment assignments were set in blocks of 10 (i.e., 5
      assignments to each of the treatment conditions). Though the total recruitment target was 39
      women, it was not known what percentage will be first-time mothers, so the investigators
      created at least 3 blocks of 10 mothers for each of the two strata. The blocks in the
      randomization schedule ensured that investigators have approximately equivalent numbers of
      mothers in each of the treatment and standard care groups at all stages of data collection
      for both strata. The PI opened the sealed envelope based in the parity of the participant;
      each envelope contained a card with &quot;Standard care&quot; or &quot;Intervention.&quot; The PI informed the PC
      the participants that have been assigned to initiate the intervention. The PC initiated
      contact with the participant in a time frame not longer than a week. The research personnel
      who collected data was blinded to the treatment condition of the participants. A script was
      read in each data collection session to request the participant to avoid sharing with the
      research staff if she was or not receiving the visit of the PC or professional lactation
      consultant.

      Data Analysis: Given the descriptive nature of this feasibility study, no power analysis was
      warranted. However, the feasibility study informed effect sizes that will be used to estimate
      statistical power for future studies, including a planned R01 submission. Descriptive
      analysis will be accomplished using means and standard deviations or frequency distributions.
      Differences in baseline demographic and personal characteristics between the intervention and
      usual care groups will be assessed using two-sample t-tests, Mann-Whitney U tests, or
      chi-square tests of association to verify that the randomization yielded comparable groups
      from this population. Measures of feasibility (including number of participants completing
      the intervention sessions and entire study) will be examined. Logistic regression with
      demographics and personal characteristics as covariates will be used to discern whether there
      is a difference in the likelihood of breastfeeding initiation, duration and exclusivity
      between the intervention and usual care group. Qualitative methods will be used to assess
      factors impacting recruitment, adherence, and acceptability of the intervention.

    <description>Infant Feeding Status was determined at discharge via medical chart review from reports in the infant's chart. Follow-up infant feeding status at each encounter post-discharge, was assessed via mother's report; mothers were asked to choose the practice that most closely resembles how she was feeding her infant with possible options of exclusive breastfeeding, predominant breast milk; mixed feeding; predominant formula milk; and exclusive formula milk. Then, the mother was also asked 'Does your baby receive water, juice or any other juices or solids?' If the mother agreed that the infant is receiving additional food, mothers were asked when they introduced the food to their child and portions given by day.</description>

    <measure>Intention to breastfeed</measure>
    <time_frame>Prenatal: At baseline around 30 weeks of pregnancy and aftr 37 week of pregnancy.</time_frame>
    <description>Infant Feeding Intention was assessed at baseline and again before the birth of the infant using the Infant Feeding Intentions Scale, Spanish version (IFI). This scale has 5 items, with response options ranging from 0 = 'Very much disagree' to 4 = 'Very much agree.' The total score is obtained by averaging the first 2 items (which include planning about giving breastfeeding a try and another item that is reverse-coded as it is an endorsement of planning to use formula) and adding the remaining 3 items to this mean. The range of scores is from 0 to 16, with higher scores indicating a stronger intention to EBF for 6 months.</description>

    <time_frame>prenatal at baseline and postnatal at 1 month post partum</time_frame>
    <description>Social support was assessed during the prenatal period using the Spanish version of the Autonomy and Relatedness Inventory (ARI). Each of the 32 items is scored on a 5-point scale, with response options ranging from 1 = 'Not at all like' to 5 = 'Very much like.' To calculate a total score, negative items are reversed, all ratings are summed, and then 32 is subtracted from the sum so that the cumulative score ranges from 0 to 128. Higher scores indicate a more positive assessment of the relationship.</description>

    <description>BF Knowledge was assessed at baseline and again before the birth of the infant using and adapted Spanish version of the BF Knowledge Questionnaire. The questionnaire has 25 items, with response options 1= True, and 0 = False. The total score is obtained by first reversing eight of the items by assigning a value of 1 for each correct answer of 'False' and then adding all the items.</description>
