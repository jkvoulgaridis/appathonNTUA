    <textblock>
      The aims of this study examine the immune system, muscle metabolism, and autonomic nervous
      system response to an acute bout of exercise. Cancer survivors will participate in an acute
      bout of exercise. Blood samples will be collected before the exercise bout and at two time
      points after the exercise bout to assess the proposed variables.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Between the ages of 40-70 years

               -  At least two years past detectible cancer (two years disease-free survival)

               -  Have received chemotherapy and/or radiation as part of their cancer treatment

               -  All cancers were of the organs/non-blood producing tissues (not blood/hematologic
                  cancers) and while they were an adult (no history of pediatric cancer)

               -  Meeting ACSM-AHA guidelines for exercise (150 minutes per week of
                  cardiorespiratory fitness type exercises and ~two days per week of resistance
                  training), as confirmed by a combination of a physical activity questionnaire and
                  a cardiorespiratory fitness classification of &quot;good&quot; or higher (age and sex
                  matched)

               -  A BMI between 20-33 kgÂ·m-2

               -  Able to speak and read English

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Participants may not:

          -  Have any contraindications to moderate to vigorous exercise

          -  Have any recent illness or have been instructed not to exercise by a healthcare
             provider

          -  Participants may not have range of motion restrictions that would prevent them from
             participating in aerobic or resistance training with proper form (they must be
             ambulatory)

          -  Be taking medications (prescription or over the counter) known to influence immune
             function (including daily NSAID's and beta blockers), cholesterol-lowering medications
             (statins), drugs that increase bone mass (bisphosphonates), or steroids.

          -  Have known cardiovascular, respiratory, metabolic, or renal disease, with the
             exception of controlled hypertension (as defined by resting BP below 140/90) and/or
             controlled asthma (self-reported).

          -  Be pregnant

          -  Be unable to complete all visits (i.e. must not be planning to leave the Houston area
             long-term before concluding their participation in the study)

          -  Fall outside of a BMI range of (20 - 33)

          -  Consume alcohol or recreational drugs for 24h prior to visits

          -  Participants must not have scheduling conflicts that would prevent them from reporting
             to the laboratory of integrated physiology 2-3 times over the course of the study
