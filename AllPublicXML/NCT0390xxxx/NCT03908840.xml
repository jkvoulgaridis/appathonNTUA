  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide. TBI 302 is being
      developed for the treatment of inoperable HCC by intravenous infusion. The objective is to
      determine the safety and tolerability of TBI 3002.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, Phase 1 study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, and MTD of TBI
      302 in patients with non-resectable, non-transplantable HCC. Tumor response will be assessed
      at Week 9 (5 weeks following cessation of treatment) according to RECIST (ver 1.1) and AASLD
      criteria.
