  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite improved assessment and pharmacologic management, cancer pain is still undertreated.
      Using non-pharmacologic treatments alongside medications may better address patients' total
      pain experience by relieving physical and psychological symptoms and reducing the adverse
      effects of drugs. However, our knowledge of the benefits of multidisciplinary approaches in
      real-world hospital settings is limited. Patients want to know &quot;How can I get the most pain
      relief with the fewest side effects?&quot; This study proposal is designed to address this
      question by testing how combining pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic (acupuncture and pain
      counseling) treatments can: (1) maximize effectiveness, (2) minimize harms, and (3) align
      with patients' preferences.

    <textblock>
      This study compares clinically-relevant therapeutic options in two high-volume hospitals (one
      public, one university) to address the core research question of whether non-pharmacologic
      approaches improve symptom management among diverse inpatients. Study investigators will
      assess the effectiveness of acupuncture and of pain counseling independently and in
      combination.

      Participants will be randomized to two factors each with two levels, yielding four
      experimental conditions: (1) standard pharmacologic pain management, (2) pharmacologic pain
      management + acupuncture, (3) pharmacologic pain management + pain counseling, (4)
      pharmacologic pain management + acupuncture + pain counseling. Patient outcomes will be
      assessed using a mixed-methods approach, with validated scales for quantitative measures and
      qualitative interviews to elicit stakeholder perspectives (patients, caregivers, providers).

      The study will be conducted as a pragmatic clinical trial at two hospitals to address these
      aims:

        1. Determine the effectiveness of adjunctive acupuncture and of pain counseling for
           improving pain management.

        2. Determine the extent that adjunctive acupuncture and pain counseling reduce use of
           opioid analgesics and side effects.

        3. Examine stakeholder perspectives on non-pharmacologic approaches to pain management.

    <description>The EuroQol EQ-5D-3L descriptive system comprises the following 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 3 levels: no problems, some problems, extreme problems. The respondent is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking (or placing a cross) in the box against the most appropriate statement in each of the 5 dimensions. The EuroQol visual analogue scale (EQ VAS) records the respondent's self-rated health on a vertical, visual analogue scale where the endpoints are labelled 'Best imaginable health state' and 'Worst imaginable health state'.

Each of the subscales are scored from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating greater satisfaction.</description>
