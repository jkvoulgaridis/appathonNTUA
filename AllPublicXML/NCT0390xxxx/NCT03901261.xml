    <textblock>
      TriAL21 study is an interventional, open, one arm, prospective, national and single center
      study.

      A total of 200 patients with Down syndrome, aged 35 years and over, without diagnosis of
      Alzheimer's disease will be enrolled into the study.

      Participating centre is Institut Jérôme Lejeune; outpatient's clinic dedicated to treating
      patients with cognitive deficiencies of genetic origin including patients with Down syndrome.

  <detailed_description>

      The aim of the study is to describe and follow a cohort of patients with Down syndrome
      without diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease at inclusion, in order to identify factors
      influencing the age of onset of the disease.

      The total study duration will be approximately 4 years.

        -  Inclusion period : 2 years

        -  Follow-up period per patient : 2 years

      Patients will be then followed during 10 years for routine medical follow-up. In case of
      Alzheimer's disease onset during this period, all data regarding diagnosis of AD will be
      collected for the study. Data about dementia evolution and mortality in case of AD diagnosis
      during the study will also be collected during this follow-up period.
