  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this project is to assess the efficacy (effectiveness) of plant-based
      nitrate tablets to elevate nitric oxide in your system as measured by saliva and effect on
      lowering blood pressure (BP), supporting blood vessel function in men and women with
      hypertension.

      This clinical trial is to assess the efficacy of plant-based bioequivalent Nitric Oxide
      supplement for improving blood pressure and endothelial reactivity over a 12 weeks
      intervention period in individuals with metabolic syndrome. The study also examines the
      effect of plant-based bioequivalent Nitric Oxide supplement on other markers of
      cardiovascular function and cardiovascular disease risk including Total, LDL and
      HDL-Cholesterol, Triglycerides, and a multitude of inflammatory markers.
