  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The human ovary is the target of an autoimmune attack, usually in organ or non-specific
      autoimmune disorders. Serum anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels decrease early in menopause
      and menopause is seen in women with type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM1) at a young age. DM1 is
      aimed to show DM1 relationship with ovarian reserve based on the assumption that it will have
      lower AMH levels than controls, secondary to bad glycemic control and autoimmune attack in
      women.

      The study was designed prospectively. Ovarian functions in healthy volunteer women and
      patients who use DM1 diagnosed between 18-40 years old will be examined. Gonadotropin and AMH
      levels will be measured in follicular phase. To calculate the number of antral follicles
      (AFC) and ovarian volume, ultrasound will be looked at. Fasting and satiety blood glucose,
      HbA1c and C-peptide levels will be evaluated.
