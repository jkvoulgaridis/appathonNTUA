  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-specific low back pain is a common condition. Insoles are one of the many treatment form
      for chronic nonspecific LBP. The investigators hypothesized the contact total insole group
      will present pain reduction and functional improvement.

      The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of contact total insole for people with
      nonspecific chronic low back pain and the impact of this insole on function, quality of life,
      load distribution in the plantar region, gait variables and satisfaction with insole use.

      A randomized, controlled, double-blind, clinical trial with intent-to-treat analysis.
      Eighty-four patients with nonspecific chronic low back pain will be randomly into a study
      group and control group. One week following the baseline evaluation, the study group will
      receive a contact total insole made of ethyl vinyl acetate and the control group will receive
      a flat insole made of the same material, color and density. The groups will be evaluated
      after 6, 12 and 24 weeks of insole use. The following assessment parameters will be employed:
      low back pain numerical pain scale; functional capacity (Oswestry and roland morris
      questionnaire, six minute walk test and timed to up and go test); quality of life (Short
      Form-36) and foot pressure analysis using the AMCube FootWalk Pro program.

    <description>It will be measured by the Brazilian version of the Numeric Pain Rating Scale 10 cm. The Numeric Pain Rating Scale goes from 0 to 10, where 0 is &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 is &quot;the worst pain imaginable.&quot; Participants will be asked to answer about their pain levels based on the last week. Change in pain score or an improvement of 2 levels or more is accepted as clinically relevant.</description>
