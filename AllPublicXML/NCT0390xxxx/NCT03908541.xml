  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Evidence suggests that inflammatory processes are key elements in the secondary effects of
      severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). The present study was designed to examine whether the
      peripheral inflammatory markers and brain structural alterations be associated with clinical
      measures and primary outcome following severe TBI. We hypothesized that peripheral
      inflammatory markers might be correlated with voxel-based GM volumes in patients with
      disorder of consciousness.

      Background: Systemic inflammation, neurocognitive impairments, and morphologic brain changes
      are associated with outcome in patients with disorder of consciousness.

      Objective: The aim of this study is to assess the value of peripheral inflammatory markers
      and brain structural alterations in the chronic phase after severe traumatic brain injury.

      Methods: Serum levels of Interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-13 and TNF-α were
      investigated in patients with chronic disorder of consciousness and healthy volunteers.
      Correlations were carried out between GM, WM, and CSF volumes and inflammatory cytokines
      levels. In addition, the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R) score was used to quantify the
      severity, and long-term recovery clinical outcome at 12 month was determined according to
      Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS).

    <description>Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R) score was used to quantify the severity, which consists of 23 hierarchically arranged items that comprise six subscales addressing auditory, visual, motor, oromotor/verbal, communication, and arousal processes. The lowest item on each subscale represents reflexive activity, whereas the highest items represent cognitively mediated behaviors.</description>

      Peripheral blood (5 mL) was collected in a Vacutainer® tube without anticoagulant, using
      standardized phlebotomy procedures. Serum was prepared by centrifugation (2,000 g, 5 min,
      4°C) and stored at -80°C until further analysis.
