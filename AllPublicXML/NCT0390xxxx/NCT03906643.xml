  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HS-201 is Verteporfin-tethered HSP90 inhibitor for clinical imaging of selective tumor
      binding. HS-201 consists of a HSP90 inhibitor that binds competitively to the Hsp90 ATP
      binding domain connected by a linker to a photosensitizing agent (verteporfin) that can be
      used for imaging. HS-201 can freely enter tumor cells to selectively bind Hsp90. Due to the
      the verteporfin, HS-201 accumulation in the malignant cells allows for specific visualization
      of tumors within the body and verteporfin may allow for photodynamic therapy of tumors.

      The product to be tested in this study, HS-201, is a tumor imaging agent.

      Hsp90 (heat shock protein 90) is a chaperone protein that aids in the folding, stabilization,
      and degradation of cellular proteins and is found in virtually all living organisms. Cancer
      cells in particular have high expression of Hsp90. Hsp90 has three structural domains
      including an N-terminal domain that contains an ATP binding site. Small molecule inhibitors
      of HSP90 (Hsp90i) can selectively and competitively to the Hsp90 ATP binding domain. HS-196
      consists of a HSP90 inhibitor that binds competitively to the Hsp90 ATP binding domain
      connected by a linker to a photosensitzing agent (verteporfin) that can be used for imaging.
      HS-201 can freely enter tumor cells to selectively bind Hsp90. Due to the verteporfine,
      HS-201 accumulation in the malignant cells allows for specific visualization of tumors within
      the body.

      HS-201 will be used in this investigation for the imaging of solid tumors The objectives of
      the study are to determine the dose of HS-201 that achieves the greatest ratio of tumor to
      normal tissue fluorescence in patients with malignancy, the safety of HS-201 administration
      in patients with malignancy, the average radiant efficiency in resected tumors following
      HS-201 administration, the localization of the HS-201 by microscopy of tumor slices, and the
      PK metrics of HS-201 when administered to patients.
