  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Objectives: To evaluate the clinical efficacy of using a manual inhibition technique for the
      suboccipital muscles compared with the use of the so-called INYBI tool in individuals with
      chronic non-specific neck pain, and the compare the results of using both approaches on pain
      relief, cervical range of motion neck and vertical maximum mouth opening.

      Design: Quantitative, experimental, longitudinal, prospective, and double blinded study.

      Subjects: Patients between 18 and 40 years, with chronic non-specific neck pain of at least 3
      months of evolution.

      Methods: The experimental group will undergo a 5 minutes intervention for the suboccipital
      muscles using the INYBI tool. The control group will receive a 5 minutes of treatment
      involving the suboccipital muscles manual inhibition technique.

    <description>PPT levels, defined as the minimum necessary pressure to evoke pain will be evaluated using a handheld electronic pressure algometer.</description>

    <measure>Pain free vertical mouth opening. This outcome will be evaluated in centimeters.</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to immediately after treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>Maximum pain free vertical mouth opening will be assessed using a digital caliper that will place between the incisors 11, 21, 31 y 41.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Atlas rotation ROM, assessed in degrees</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to immediately after treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>The atlas bone left and right rotation ROM will be assessed using the flexion-rotation test. For this test, with the participant in supine position, the maximum mobility in head rotation while keeping maximum passive neck flexion will be assessed</description>

    <measure>Self-reported pain intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to immediately after treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>Self-perceived pain intensity will be evaluated during all active cervical movements by a 0 to 10 Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), where 0 denotes no pain at all, and 10 denotes the maximum possible pain</description>

    <description>Patients will lie down in supine position so that the INYBI tool will contact the suboccipital muscles at the posterior arch of the atlas. The therapist will adapt the height of the tool for each individual. All patients will use the softest head of the device. A 50Hz vibration speed will be set sup during 5 minutes.</description>
