  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain, postural dysfunction, loss of balance control and stability are
      musculoskeletal changes that occur over life span due to aging process and are inevitable.
      Core stability exercises are an effective means to counteract these changes.The study was
      executed with initially n=35 subjects selected as per proposal, but only n=24 subjects
      completed the study with n=14 in experimental group and n=10 in control group. Experimental
      group received core stability exercises and control group received conventional physical
      therapy treatment for 12 weeks. Baseline assessment was done, then at 6 week and again at end
      of intervention.Following outcome measures were used in study Numeric pain rating scale
      (NPRS), Utain quality of life (UQOL), Oswestry disability index (ODI), manual muscle testing
      (MMT) flexion and extension. Data was analysed using Statistical package for social sciences
      SPSS- 21.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      About total of 80% of population once in their life have gone through Low back pain that
      cause significant loss of productive working hours along with disability. People suffering
      from chronic low back pain and impaired function, often experience anxiety, depression, as
      well as effects on work and social life. Low back pain largely effects the women population,
      aged 45-60 years, accounting for distress on a social as well as economic level.

      Age predicted incidence of low back pain (LBP) was also found to be higher in post-menopausal
      women. (90% between 40 and 60, mean age 50.1 years). Decline in psychological and cognitive
      function along with other health related conditions like heart disease, mood swings, risk of
      cancer are of particular importance in post-menopausal women affecting their quality of life.

      The hormonal changes occurring in women during and after menopause, may also have an impact
      on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) particularly at the physical, psychological, and
      sexual spheres. Physical therapy remains the most advanced conservative option for the
      treatment of LBP Core stability or core strengthening exercises are increasingly becoming an
      important element of the sports world of therapeutics as it provides distal mobility with
      proximal stability(9). Core stability and strengthening exercises are supported strongly by
      theoretical principles for the treatment of spinal disorders that helps in decreasing pain
      and improving function in people suffering from LBP.

      Core strengthening has attracted limited research attention so far yet it has been promoted
      as a mode of rehabilitation, for performance enhancement and as preventive measure of
      injuries related to the musculoskeletal and lumbar spine. The significance of core stability
      exercises in postmenopausal women with backache has been overlooked so far. The proposed
      study focused on Core stability exercises in Postmenopausal woman with Lower back pain to
      investigate the effects of core strength training on lower back pain, disability, strength
      and the quality of life in postmenopausal woman.

    <time_frame>The score were recorded at baseline, at the (6th week) and at 12th visit (12th week) to determine the reduction or aggravation of pain followed by treatment in both control and experimental groups.</time_frame>
    <description>Changes from the Baseline, NPRS was used to measure the patient's pain intensity and divided from 0-11 into 11 divisions. 0 means absence of pain. 1 to 3 demonstrates mild degree of pain. 4 to 6 moderate level of pain and 7 to 10 means severe degree of pain. Patients were directed to select a number that best described the pain at the moment.</description>

    <description>Changes from the Baseline, ODI is an effective tool to provide information on the extent of backache affecting the patient ability to cope with tasks of everyday life. Ten sections are included in the ODI tool with a total possible score of 5 for each section. The first statement carries a score of 0, and the last has a score of 5.</description>

It consists of 0- 5 grades. 0 indicates no visible or palpable contraction, 1 indicates Visible or palpable contraction with no motion, 2 indicates full range of motion (ROM) with gravity eliminated, 3 full range of motion anti gravity, 4 shows Full ROM against gravity, moderate resistance, 5 indicates Full ROM against gravity, maximal resistance.</description>
