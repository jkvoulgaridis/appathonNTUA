  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study's objective is to confirm that RHT-3201 reduces the signs and symptoms of moderate
      atopic dermatitis determined by SCORAD, in patients aged 1 to 12 years, as compared to
      placebo. It will also be examined if the RHT-3201 treatment, as compared to placebo, reduces
      the quantity of topical steroids used to treat disease flares

    <measure>Change from baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI)</measure>
    <time_frame>after 4, 8 and 12 week treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) quantifies the severity of a subject's AD based on both severity of lesion clinical signs and the percent of body surface area (BSA) affected. EASI is a composite scoring of the degree of erythema, induration/papulation, excoriation, and lichenification (each scored separately) for each of four body regions, with adjustment for the percent of BSA involved for each body region and for the proportion of the body region to the whole body.
Scores range is 0-72 and Higher values represent a worse outcome</description>

    <time_frame>after 4, 8 and 12 week treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The CDLQI is a 10-item questionnaire that measures the impact of skin disease on participant's quality of life. Each question is evaluated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much); where higher scores indicate more impact on quality of life. The DLQI total score ranges from 0 (not at all) to 30 (very much): 0-1 = no effect at all on the participant's life; 2-6 = small effect on the participant's life; 7-12 = moderate effect on the participant's life; 13-18 = very large effect on the participant's life; 19-30 = extremely large effect on the participant's life. Higher scores indicate more impact on quality of life of participants.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in Dermatology Family Impact (DFI)</measure>
    <time_frame>after 4, 8 and 12 week treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The DFI is a 10-item disease questionnaire that measures the impact of having a child with AD on family quality of life. It is completed by parent/legal guardian of the child (affected by AD), based on recall over the past week. Each question is scored on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (good) to 3 (worst), where higher scores indicated worst quality of life of family. The DFI total score is the sum of individual scores of the 10 questions and ranges from 0 (good) to 30 (worst), where higher DFI scores indicated worst quality of life of family.</description>

    <description>AE will be assessed by incidence of AE, abnormalities in vital sign assessments, clinical laboratory assessments, and physical exams Incidence of treatment emergent AEs. An AE was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to study drug in a participant who received study drug. AEs are classified according to the severity in 3 categories a) mild (AEs does not interfere with participant's usual function); b) moderate (AEs interferes to some extent with participant's usual function) and c) severe (AEs interferes significantly with participant's usual function).</description>
