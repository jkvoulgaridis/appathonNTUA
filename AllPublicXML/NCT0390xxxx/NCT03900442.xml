    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-randomized study to evaluate the PD, PK, and safety of 500 to 2000
      mg/m2 PTX-100 in patients with advanced malignancies.

      PTX-100 will be administered by IV infusion over 60 minutes on days 1 to 5 of a 14-day cycle
      for 4 cycles unless toxicity is observed.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Biopsy proven multiple myeloma (MM), peripheral T-cell lymphoma (CTCL, AITL or
             PTCL-NOS), colo-rectal cancer (CRC), pancreas cancer (PANC), or diffuse gastric cancer
             (DGC)

          2. Must have a relapsed or refractory advanced malignancy for which no standard therapy
             exists.

          3. Must have at least 6 unstained slides of archived formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
             tumor tissue available for genotyping studies; if insufficient or no archived tissue
             is available, a fresh tumor biopsy within 30 days prior to Cycle 1/Day 1 is mandatory.

          5. ECOG performance status ≤ 2

          6. Adequate hematological function: absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1000/mm3, platelet
             count ≥ 50,000 mm3

          7. Adequate hepatic function: total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times the upper limit of normal
             (ULN), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 2.5

             effective barrier method of contraception if sexually active with a female of
             childbearing potential. Acceptable methods of contraception are condoms with
             contraceptive foam, oral, implantable or injectable contraceptives, contraceptive
             patch, intrauterine device, diaphragm with spermicidal gel, or a sexual partner who is
             surgically sterilized or postmenopausal. For both male and female patients, effective

             ventricular arrhythmias, clinically significant pericardial disease, or
             electrocardiographic evidence of acute ischemic or active conduction system
             abnormalities

          5. Uncontrolled infection requiring parenteral antibiotics, antivirals, or antifungals
             within 1 week prior to first dose (Patients with controlled infection or on
             prophylactic antibiotics are permitted in the study.)

          6. Known to be HIV seropositive

          7. Known active hepatitis A, B, or C infection or known to be positive for HCV RNA or
             HBsAg (HBV surface antigen)

          8. Grade &gt; 2 peripheral neuropathy at screening

          9. Previous allogeneic transplant within the past 6 months or evidence of clinically
             significant graft-versus-host disease (if prior bone marrow transplant)

         10. Any history of malignancy, other than that treated in this study, unless the patient
             has remained free of the disease for over 3 years (except for properly treated basal
             cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma in situ of the cervix or
             breast)

         11. Any active medical or psychiatric illness that, in the judgement of the investigator,
             may interfere with adherence to the protocol
