      The PERGROUP trial aims to investigate whether Web-based personal or Web-based group
      counselling weight management program can help to achieve lifestyle changes needed for weight
      loss and improvement in quality of life and cardiovascular risk factors. The control group is
      the traditional nurse-lead weight management group counselling.

      In this study, efficacy of two web-based weight management systems will be compared to a
      traditional nurse-lead sessions for weight management.

      Ten nurse-lead group counselling sessions lasting 90 minutes each will be conducted in three
      groups of 10-14 participants. Each session comprise education about healthy diet,
      psychoeducation and discussions.

      The web-based group counselling program offers informative weight management system with
      peer-based conversation possibility. Three groups of 10-14 participants who gather together
      for three nurse-lead sessions in the weeks 0, 5, and 12. The web-based program can be used
      for a year.

      The web-based personal counselling program offers informative weight management system with
      conversation possibility with the nurse for 12 weeks. Altogether 37 participants are enrolled
      and they can use the web-based weight management system for one year.

      In each intervention arm, intervention and counselling provided by the study nurses last for
      three months. Among all participants, weight loss, cardiometabolic data, information of
      lifestyle and quality of life will be measured at baseline, after the nurse-lead intervention
      (three months) and 12 months from the baseline.
