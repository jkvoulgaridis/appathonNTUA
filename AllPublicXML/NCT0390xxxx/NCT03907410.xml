  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Improving adherence to inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) medication in urban minority pediatric
      populations is a clinical and population health priority. Financial incentives have been
      shown as a compelling method to engage a high-risk asthma population in regular ICS use, but
      whether and how adherence can be maintained and lead to sustained high adherence trajectories
      is unknown.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators propose to enroll 125 children and their parents in a six-month intervention
      with a six month follow-up period. Children will be ages 5-12, and must have two or more
      visits to any combination of the outpatient, ED or hospital setting in the past year for
      asthma exacerbations at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP).

      The study intervention will include daily automated medication reminders (either via text
      message or push reminder), an app to track daily medication use, and nominal incentives to
      promote daily controller use. Inhaled controller medication adherence and rescue medication
      use will be measured using electronic monitors affixed to the inhalers. Factors associated
      with differential adherence will be assessed using surveys administered during enrollment,
      the experiment interval (months 1 through 3), the observation interval (months 4 through 6),
      and study completion (months 12-13). Efficacy outcomes will include change in parent-reported
      asthma control and mean adherence to ICS between study arms during the experiment interval,
      as well as the observation interval.

      Patients will be considered enrolled when they fulfill the requirements of the Run-in period
      (sensor data uploaded to research platform AND text message receipt confirmed by caregiver)
      and are subsequently randomized.

    <description>Assess the cACT score at multiple time points and evaluate the changes in score from first study visit to the second, third, fourth, and fifth study visits. The Child Asthma Control Tool (cACT) score ranges from 0 (poor control) to 27 (complete control). The greater the value, the higher the control. The larger the difference (larger magnitude) of the value in the differences between the scores, the greater the improvement in controlling the child's asthma diagnosis.</description>
