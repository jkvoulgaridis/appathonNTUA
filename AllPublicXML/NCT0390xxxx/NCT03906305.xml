      The investigators aim to determine if dry needling technique in a non myofascial trigger
      point area generate the same changes in spasticity, function and pain responses as with dry
      needling in a myofascial trigger point area.

      Spasticity is a consequence of multiple diseases that affect the Central Nervous System, such
      as stroke and other neurodegenerative diseases. Its pathophysiology is unclear and the
      variety of clinical symptoms is determined by the injury location. Several studies have
      suggested the possibility of active pain treatment effectiveness through myofascial trigger
      points management. One of these interventions is dry needling, which has been used in several
      scientific studies. However, these investigations have been based on spasm response or deep
      dry needling mechanisms always over a trigger point, but none of the participants compare the
      possible mechanical effects of the insertion of a needle into a spastic muscle without
      targeting specifically a trigger point. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the
      effects on spasticity, pain and motor function after a dry needling intervention versus the
      insertion of a needle into a non trigger point area in patients who had experienced a stroke.

    <intervention_model_description>In this study patients will receive dry needling intervention in shoulder muscles. The following muscles will be addressed: upper trapezius, supraspinatus, deltoid anterior fibers and infraspinatus.
They will also receive physical therapy based on Bobath concept. All the subjects belong to Madrid Polibea Sur neurorehabilitation clinic. The sample of the study is estimated to consist of twenty patients, with a washout period of forty five days after the intervention.
The data will be collected by an external physical therapist. All the therapists belong to Polibea Sur neurological clinic and Madrid Rey Juan Carlos University departments of physical therapy, occupational therapy, rehabilitation and physical medicine, experts in neurological treatment and trained in dry needling.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>It will be measured using the Modified Ashworth Scale. The Modified Ashworth Scale evaluates the muscle tone in patients with central nervous system lesions. It consists of 5 ordinal categories: 0 (no increase in muscle tone), 1 (slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch and release or by minimal resistance at the end of the range of motion), 1+ (slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch, followed by minimal resistance throughout the remainder less than half of the range of motion), 2 (more marked increase in muscle tone through most of the range of motion, but affected parts easily moved), 3 (considerable increase in muscle tone, passive movement difficult) and 4 (the part affects this rigid extension or flexion).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 weeks after each intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Upper limb function will be measured using both Motor Evaluation Scale for Upper Extremity in Stroke patients (MESUPES) and the reaching performance scale (RPS).
The MESUPES includes eight items with six response categories (scores 0-5), and nine hand items with three response categories (scores 0-2). The total score of this scale is 58 points.
The RPS evaluates 6 components. Four components are related to reaching close and far targets: trunk displacement, movement smoothness, shoulder movements, and elbow movements. The 2 additional components globally rate the quality of prehension and the accomplishment of the task. The total score of this scale is 18 points.</description>

    <description>Other: Dry Needling Participants will receive dry needling application over a myofascial trigger point by an experienced physical therapist with clinical experience in neurological patients, that will be inserted into taut bands of the following shoulder spastic muscles (when a trigger point was present): upper trapezius, supraspinatus, infraspinatus and deltoid anterior.
Other: Physical Therapy
Participants will receive physical therapy treatment based on the modulating Bobath technique. This technique will be applied using the general parameters, carrying out similar action protocols with every patient, based on the aim of normalizing upper limb muscle tone.
