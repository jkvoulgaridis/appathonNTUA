  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Foot problems are common in society. Accordingly, loss of workforce, quality of life and
      mental health deterioration can be observed in employees and hardship in daily life
      activities, balance-walking problems and fall risk increase in older adults. The presence of
      athletic and sedentary populations causes a large number of patients to apply to outpatient
      clinics with the complaint of heel pain every year. Plantar fasciitis (plantar heel pain),
      although multifactorial origin, obesity, overload bearing and ankle joint motion reduction
      factors are thought to play an active role in the emergence of discomfort.

      Foot orthoses are a common treatment used for plantar heel pain, but a period of several
      weeks is usually required between the diagnosis and transportation to the orthosis due to the
      production process. Therefore, short-term therapies such as supportive banding are used to
      alleviate the symptoms of this intermediate period. The low-dye taping technique is the most
      commonly used banding technique and has been found to be effective in randomized controlled
      trials. In addition, there is a rare study in the literature showing the efficacy of Kinesio
      taping method. Although both were found to be useful in the treatment of plantar fasciitis,
      no randomized controlled trial was studied in this patient population of the low-dye method
      with Kinesio taping. In the studies, the early period of banding therapy is mentioned and
      studies on relatively longer treatment response are still required. Our hypothesis is that
      low-dye Kinesio-banding treatment added to ESWT treatment for patients diagnosed with plantar
      fasciitis will be effective on foot functionality by reducing the pain of the patient both in
      the early and later period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One of the most common musculoskeletal pathologies of the foot and pain is plantar heel pain.
      In the studies, it was stated that the feeling of foot pain and stiffness was between 18% and
      63%. The plantar fascia is the most common cause of heel pain in adult age. Due to overuse,
      such as standing for a long time or running, it is assumed that it occurs as a result of
      micro-injury on the surface of the plantar fascia. It has been reported that 10% of the
      general population will be encountered throughout life. Although the exact cause is not
      known, middle age, obesity, excessive foot pronation, pes cavus, running, pes planus and
      long-term standing are among the reasons that facilitate. Patients experience severe pain in
      the first step they take after sitting for a long time or when they get up in the morning and
      start to walk and the pain is triggered by the tension of the plantar fascia and overlapping
      weight onto the foot. A large number of conservative methods have been used in the treatment
      of plantar fasciitis. Anti-inflammatory agents (Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,
      steroid injections), physical therapy modalities (iontophoresis, ultrasound, extracorporeal
      shock wave therapy, electrical stimulation, cryotherapy, and whirlpool), manual therapy,
      stretching therapy and external support (orthosis and banding) treatment most of these
      methods. Orthosis and taping aim to correct poor biomechanics in the foot while most of the
      other treatment programs are suppressing symptoms. Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT),
      which is another treatment modality that is used effectively in treatment, is currently
      preferred in delayed and nonunion fractures, calcified tendinitis of the shoulder, lateral
      epicondylitis, plantar fasciitis, patellar tendinitis, and calcaneal spur. In a recent
      prospective study, ESWT treatment was not superior to Kinesio-taping, and both treatments
      were found to be similar in both pain reduction and increased functionality.
