  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our objective in this study is to identify an optimal ultrasound spectroscopy parameter that
      can be used as an early predictor of pathological complete or partial response in men with
      prostate cancer and men and women with rectum and head and neck cancers receiving treatment
      radiotherapy.

      We have previously demonstrated that high-frequency ultrasound and spectroscopy, and recently
      conventional-frequency ultrasound and spectroscopy may be used to detect cell death in vitro,
      in situ and in vivo. The method can detect different forms of cell death and has been
      demonstrated to be sensitive to apoptotic, necrotic and mitotic cell death. The objectives of
      this study are to evaluate the use of ultrasound imaging and spectroscopy as a predictive
      marker of advanced tumour response to radiotherapy. Since radiation treatments may also act
      on tumour vasculature to &quot;normalize&quot; it we will also evaluate blood-vessel imaging by
      standard Doppler-imaging and with standard higher-resolution imaging using clinically
      approved microbubble contrast agents.

      The main goal, as described above, is to select the best ultrasound spectroscopy parameter to
      use as an early predictor of pathological complete response
