  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cirrhotic patients are at higher risk of sepsis due to impaired innate and adaptive immune
      responses. Septic complications represent a major issue in the management of cirrhotic
      patients, with a 1-month mortality rate of 23%, which increases to 80% at 3 months in case of
      associated organ failure.

      Delay to treatment initiation during a septic episode may increase the risk of complications
      and mortality of cirrhotic patients. However, the inappropriate use of antibiotics exposes
      cirrhotic patients to the risk of more severe infections due to multi-resistant organisms or
      fungi.

      The use of diagnostic markers for sepsis is limited in the context of cirrhosis because of
      the lack of hepatic synthesis of these markers on the one hand and non-specific inflammation
      related to cirrhosis on the other hand.

      Therefore, it is necessary to develop new tools for the early diagnosis of sepsis and
      appropriate management of cirrhotic patients.

      The interest of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the diagnosis and prognosis of septic shock has been
      reported in the general population. No studies have described circulating miRNAs or reported
      their interest in the diagnosis of sepsis in a population of cirrhotic patients with acute
      decompensation (AD).

      This preliminary study of 800 circulating miRNAs will be performed in a cohort of patients
      with acute cirrhosis decompensation, for whom the incidence of sepsis is estimated at 40%.
      The aim to evaluate the interest and feasibility of a larger study on the interest of
      circulating miRNAs in the early diagnosis of sepsis in cirrhotic patients. The long-term
      objective of this study is the development of biomarkers for the early management of
      cirrhotic patients with sepsis and the rationalization of antibiotic use to improve their
      prognosis.

        The patients concerned are cirrhotic patients, followed in the hepatology department of Pr
        Zoulim and in department of Pr Souquet (Croix Rousse Hospital, North Hospital Group,
        Hospices Civils de Lyon), without a history of cancer or active infection with the virus of
        the hepatitis B, hepatitis C virus or HIV.
