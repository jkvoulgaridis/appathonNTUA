  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with acute myeloid leukemia aged 65-75 have a very poor prognosis, irrespective of
      the treatment strategy, including demethylating agents or conventional chemotherapy. With
      these approaches, remission rates do not exceed 40%, and overall disease-free survival at 1
      year is in the order of 15%. The hypothesis is that up-front allogeneic hematopoietic stem
      cell transplant will produce a complete remission rate of 60% on day +56-70, and disease-free
      survival at 1 year of 30%. This is a single arm phase II study of upfront allogeneic stem
      cell transplantation, for patients with acute myeloid leukemia aged 65-75: the primary
      endpoint is a complete remission rate on day +56-70. The secondary endpoint is a 1-year
      overall disease-free survival of 30%.

    <description>As a primary outcome measure, the rate of complete remission in treated patients will be evaluated. Complete remission will be assessed from days +56 to days +70 after transplant. A complete remission rate equal to or higher than 60% is expected.</description>

    <intervention_name>Up-front allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)</intervention_name>
    <description>Patients classified as fit/unfit are included in the HSCT program. There are two early approaches allowed. A) Patients will be left untreated until HSCT B) Patients will receive 1 short course of chemotherapy before HSCT (Ara-C and anthracycline).
Selection of strategy A or B, will be patient based on disease characteristics and dynamics or presence of high tumor load.
Conditioning for haplo-HSCT should be started as soon as possible, within day 45 after initial diagnosis. This is to avoid delayed transplantation. Two dosing levels of the Thiotepa-Busulfan-Fludarabine (TBF) based protocol are allowed based on the clinical condition of the patient: fit patients below 70 will receive the TBF with 2 days of Busulfan, whereas patients with poorer clinical condition or above the age of 70 will receive a dose-reduced TBF, in which Busulfan may be reduced to 1 day only.</description>
