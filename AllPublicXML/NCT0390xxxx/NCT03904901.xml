  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Today in Brazil, 6.9% of the population has Diabetes Mellitus 2 (DM2). In the world, there
      are about 422 million people with DM2. It is a chronic disease of the endocrine system,
      accounts for 90 to 95% of cases of DM2 and is characterized by defects in insulin action and
      secretion. Its main cause is linked to obesity and insulin resistance. Obesity is a chronic,
      multifactorial disease - environmental, nutritional and genetic factors - characterized by
      excessive accumulation of body fat, and is reaching epidemic proportions, more than 100
      million children and 600 million adults worldwide. The number of obese people in Brazil
      reaches 17.9% of the population.

      Rates of obesity and DM2 have increased in the last decades, both diseases being associated
      with inflammation and specific alterations in the intestinal microbiota. Thus, studies show
      that the use of probiotics may be associated with reduced body weight and reduced glucose in
      the bloodstream. Probiotics are living microorganisms that, when administered in suitable
      dosages, confer benefits to the health of the host. In addition, studies show the
      relationship of the intestinal microbiota and the emergence of various diseases and
      demonstrate that probiotics can control inflammatory processes, metabolic dysfunctions,
      normalization of stress-induced behaviors, regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
      axis and neuropsychiatric disorders. Thus, the importance of investigating the ingestion of
      probiotics in relation to anthropometry, biochemical profile and anxiety in diabetic and
      overweight individuals with cardiopathy are justified. It is a randomized, double-blind,
      controlled clinical trial. The study will last 3 months and will occur with 74 adult
      individuals (between 20 and 60 years) of the SUS outpatient clinic of the Institute of
      Cardiology of Porto Alegre - RS, of both sexes, with BMI above 25 m² / kg. and less than 40
      m² / kg, divided into 2 groups and 37 individuals per group. These patients were: Group A
      (intervention: n = 37): patient received 1 sachet per day of probiotics Lactobacillus
      acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus lactis, Bifidobacterium lactis and
      Bifidobacterium bifidum for 90 days and Group B (placebo; n = 37): microcrystalline
      cellulose, lactose, pregelatinized maize starch. Probiotics will contain a dose of 109 CFU in
      each strain. The excipients used will be: microcrystalline cellulose.

    <description>To assess anxiety, was applied by a psychologist to the Beck Scale.
BAI consists of 21 questions about how the individual has felt in the past week, expressed in common anxiety symptoms (such as sweating and feelings of distress). Each question presents four possible answers, and the one that most closely resembles the individual's mental state must be signaled. The possible answers are:
Not; Lightly: did not bother me too much; Moderately: it was unpleasant, but I could bear it; Severely: I hardly supported.
BAI can have a maximum score of 63 and the categories are:
0-10: minimum degree of anxiety; 11-19: mild anxiety; 20-30 moderate anxiety; Severe anxiety 31-63.</description>

    <description>Blood samples were collected fasting (fasting of 12h overnight) for glycemia, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in mg / dL, total cholesterol (TC) in mg / dL, high density lipoprotein (HDL-c) in mg / dL, non-HDL in mg / dL and triglycerides in mg / dL. Levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL in mg / dL) were determined by the Friedewal formula. LDL-c (mg / dL) = TC (mg / dL) - HDL-c (mg / dL) - TG (mg / dL) / 5.</description>
