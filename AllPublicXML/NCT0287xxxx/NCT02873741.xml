  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to study different strategies to identify women at highest
      risk for anal cancer. Primarily, investigators want to study a risk assessment called the
      Anal Cancer Risk Index; it gives women an overall number score based on risk factors that
      they may have for anal cancer, such as age, number of sexual partners, or smoking.
      Investigators seek to understand whether women with higher Anal Cancer Risk Index scores are
      more likely to have abnormal results on anal pap smears, HPV tests, or anal biopsies. The
      study team will collect swabs of the cervix and the anus to study different laboratory tests
      that could identify women at highest risk of cervical and anal cancer. These laboratory tests
      include an anal pap smear, tests for markers of disease and tests that detect the HPV types
      most likely to cause cancer. The study team would like to see which of these laboratory tests
      do the best job at predicting precancerous lesions in the anus and are better indicators of
      risk for cancer. After collecting these swabs, women will have a procedure called high
      resolution anoscopy where investigators look closely at the anus and biopsy any suspicious
      areas. Finally, the study team will look for HPV proteins and changes that HPV can make in
      cells to see if these tests predict anal lesions.

      Investigators seek to study different strategies to identify women at highest risk for anal
      cancer. Primarily, investigators want to study a risk assessment called the Anal Cancer Risk
      Index; it gives women an overall number score based on risk factors that they may have for
      anal cancer, such as age, number of sexual partners, or smoking. The study team would like to
      determine whether women with higher Anal Cancer Risk Index scores are more likely to have
      abnormal results on anal pap smears, HPV tests, or anal biopsies. Next, the team will collect
      a swab of the cervix and swabs of the anus to study different laboratory tests that could
      identify women at highest risk of anal cancer: these tests include an anal pap smear and
      tests that detect HPV types most likely to cause cancer. Investigators would like to see
      which of these laboratory tests do the best job at predicting precancerous lesions in the
      anus. After collecting these swabs, women will have a procedure called high resolution
      anoscopy where investigators will look closely at the anus and biopsy any suspicious areas.
      Finally, the study team will look for HPV proteins and changes that HPV can make in cells to
      see if these tests predict anal lesions. The HPV protein is called E6 and E7 and the cell
      change test is called CADM1/MAL/miR-124-2. Investigators will measure E6/E7 and
      CADM1/MAL/miR-124-2 in cervical and anal samples to see if women positive for this marker are
      more likely to have abnormal results on anal pap smears or anal biopsies.

    <description>Assessment of anal cancer screening, risk factors for anal cancer, and its association with HPV using AIDS Risk Reduction Model Framework, that is a three stage model, including knowledge as a prerequisite to recognize risk and to take action to change or reduce the risk. Knowledge was measured with the Knowledge of Anal cancer and HPV, that is a 44-item knowledge multiple choice survey adapted from the Hild-Mosely, et al study, substituting &quot;cervical&quot; with &quot;anal&quot;. A percentage score of correct responses was calculated and range from o to 100, being 100 the maximum correct result.</description>

    <description>A speculum will be inserted into the vagina to visualize the cervix. The sample for research tests will be collected with one ThinPrep cytobroom inserted into the cervix.

    <description>The anal cytology specimen will be collected by inserting a saline moistened cotton-tipped swab into the anus, rotating it clock-wise for 20 seconds, and placed in SurePath. The first twenty participants will have anal cells collected in two different ways for validation/optimization: 1) saline moistened Dacron swab placed directly in ThinPrep medium and 2) Medscand Cytobrush Plus, a special brush, placed directly into ThinPrep medium. After validation/optimization is complete for up to 20 participants, the best collection method will be selected and will be used for all future enrolled participants.</description>

    <intervention_name>High Resolution Anoscopy (HRA)</intervention_name>
    <description>High Resolution Anoscopy is a procedure that allows for examination and evaluation of the anal canal. Using a small thin round tube called an anoscope, the anal canal is examined with a high resolution magnifying instrument called a colposcope. Application of a mild acidic liquid (acetic acid or diluted vinegar) or a brown iodine-based solution (Lugol's) onto the anal canal facilitates evaluation of abnormal tissue such as anal dysplasia. If abnormal staining is seen using acetic acid (dense white lesion) or Lugol's solution (bright yellow lesion) a biopsy of that area will be obtained.</description>
