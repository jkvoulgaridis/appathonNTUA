    <textblock>
      Study CC-90011-ST-001 is an open-label, Phase 1, dose escalation and expansion,
      First-In-Human (FIH) clinical study of CC-90011 in subjects with advanced unresectable solid
      tumors (enriched for grade 2 NENs, grade 2 NETs and NECs) and R/R NHL (MZL, including
      transformed MZL). The dose escalation part (Part A) of the study will explore escalating oral
      doses of CC-90011 to estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CC-90011. The expansion
      part (Part B) will further evaluate the safety and efficacy of CC-90011 administered at or
      below the MTD in 3 selected expansion cohorts of approximately 10-20 evaluable subjects each,
      in order to further define the RP2D.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parts A and B will consist of 3 periods: Screening, Treatment and Follow-up. Screening Period
      The Screening Period starts 28 days (± 3 days) prior to first dose of CC-90011. The informed
      consent form (ICF) must be signed and dated by the subject and the administering staff prior
      to the start of any other study procedures. All screening tests and procedures must be
      completed within the 28 days (±3 days) prior to the first dose of CC-90011.

      Treatment Period During the Treatment Period, CC-90011 will initially be administered orally
      in each 4-week (28 day) Cycle in Part A.

      In September 2018, after completion of Part A, the SRC determined the RP2D to be 60 mg CC
      90011 once weekly (QW) in each 28-day cycle. In Part B, 3 cohorts, of approximately 10-20
      evaluable subjects each, with advanced low/intermediate-grade lung NETs, NEPCs, R/R NHL (MZL,
      including transformed MZL) will receive the RP2D to further evaluate safety, PK, PD and
      preliminary efficacy.

      Follow-up Period In the Follow-up Period, subjects will be followed for 28 days (± 3 days)
      after the last dose of CC-90011 for safety.

      After the Safety Follow-up visit, all subjects will be followed every subsequent 3 months (±
      2 weeks) for survival follow-up for up until 2 years or until death, lost to follow-up, or
      the End of Trial, whichever occurs first.
