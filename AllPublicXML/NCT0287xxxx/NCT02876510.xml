    <textblock>
      The study purpose is to learn about the safety and tolerability of IMA101 alone (Cohort 1) or
      in combination with atezolizumab (Cohort 2) in patients with advanced solid cancers that
      express collagen VI alpha 3 (COL6A3) exon 6, preferentially expressed antigen in melanoma
      (PRAME), melanoma-associated antigen 1 (MAGEA1), melanoma-associated antigen 4 (MAGEA4),
      melanoma-associated antigen 4 or 8 (MAGEA4/8), cancer/testis antigen 1A/New York esophageal
      squamous cell carcinoma 1 (CTAG1A/NY-ESO-1), or matrix remodeling-associated protein 5
      (MXRA5).

      SCREENING: Patient eligibility will be determined by HLA (human leukocyte antigen) and the
      main biomarkers screening. If the patient is eligible, white blood cells will be collected
      with a leukapheresis for the manufacture of the IMA101 product.

      MANUFACTURE: IMA101 product will be made from the patient's white blood cells.

      TREATMENT: IMA101 product will be administered to the patient intravenously after
      lymphodepleting pre-conditioning with chemotherapy (fludarabine and cyclophosphamide).

      Low-dose IL-2 will be self-administered twice daily for a total of 28 doses after infusion of
      IMA101 product. In Cohort 2, atezolizumab will be administered every 3 weeks, starting no
      earlier than 3 weeks after the IMA101 product infusion and after hematologic recovery.

      Patients will be monitored closely throughout the study.
