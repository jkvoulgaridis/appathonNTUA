  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Whereas the efficacy of exercise interventions has been abundantly proven in male with
      peripheral artery disease (PAD), it remains to be determined whether these interventions are
      effective in women. The aim of this randomized controlled trial which will be performed with
      34 PAD women will be to investigating the effects of 12 weeks of supervised walking on
      functional capacity and cardiovascular function and regulation at rest and during exercise.
