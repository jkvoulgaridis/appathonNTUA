      This project is a clustered randomized controlled trial of a knowledge translation
      intervention of new ACOG guidelines for the diagnosis of poor progress in labor. The intent
      is to reduce the rate of cesarean section (CS) in first time mothers at term (&gt;= 37 weeks),
      with a vertex presenting singleton fetus, without increasing maternal or neonatal morbidity.
      The guidelines were developed from data from the Consortium for Safe Labor. The unit of
      randomization will be sites in Alberta that deliver

    <textblock>
      Cluster randomized controlled trial of a knowledge translation intervention of new guidelines
      for the diagnosis of poor progress in labor. The intervention will be randomized to centres
      (the clusters) in Alberta that provide intrapartum care, have facilities to perform cesarean
      section and deliver at least 70 primparous women annually, with stratification based on
      facility type and geographic location. Clustering by centre and not individual caregivers
      (nurses/physicians) is necessary to prevent leakage or crossover of the intervention to
      controls. As all participating centres will eventually receive the intervention, the
      biostatistician will generate a randomization into two &quot;waves&quot;. The intervention will be
      introduced sequentially by strata (Calgary, Edmonton, regional centres, rural centres) to the
      first &quot;wave&quot; hospitals in multi-week run-in periods after which those strata will be
      revisited for roll-out to the second &quot;wave&quot; hospitals.
