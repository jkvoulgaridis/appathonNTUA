  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot longitudinal mixed-methods study of pregnant women (n=20) who participate in
      CPC+Y at the VCU Health System Nelson Clinic or the Virginia Department of Health Richmond
      Health District's prenatal clinic (RHD) during their pregnancies. This pilot project will
      provide the necessary preliminary data to fuel an appropriately powered randomized controlled
      trial to evaluate the effects of CPC+Y in controlling weight gain, enhancing stress
      resilience, and improving maternal-child outcomes among overweight/obese diverse women.
      Because increasing physical activity has been found to have important mental health effects
      and maternal-child outcomes, it stands to reason that this innovative intervention has the
      potential to impact the way prenatal care is delivered in high risk populations.

    <measure>Self-efficacy for Physical Activity</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline (early pregnancy), end of pregnancy (approx 10 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Physical Activity Self-Efficacy Scale (PASES): The Physical Activity Self-Efficacy Scale (PASES) is an 8 question scale which contains items about SM of physical activities and social support regarding PA. This psychometrically sound scale was selected because of its specific focus on SM of PA. Originally designed for adolescents, the wording has been slightly adapted for an adult sample. A higher score indicates higher levels of self-efficacy. Lowest possible score is 8; highest possible score is 40. Only participants in the intervention arm receive this particular instrument.</description>

    <measure>Salivary Biomarkers (α-amylase)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline (early pregnancy), mid-pregnancy (approx 4-5 months), end of pregnancy (approx 10 months)</time_frame>
    <description>salivary biomaker measure. This is an exploratory measure related to acute stress, yet it does not currently have known clinical associations with certain numeric levels of this measure (i.e., there is no identified &quot;high&quot; or &quot;low&quot; level of alpha-amylase). Only collected in the intervention group.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Depressive Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline (early pregnancy), end of pregnancy (approx 10 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ9): The PHQ-9 includes self-report items regarding depressive symptoms over the past two weeks. Total scores range from 0-27, where 0-4 indicates minimal depression, 5-9 mild depressive symptoms, 10-14 moderate depressive symptoms, 15-19 moderately severe depressive symptoms, and ≥20 severe depressive symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Stress</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline (early pregnancy), end of pregnancy (approx 10 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Perceived Stress Scale (PSS): The Perceived Stress Scale-10 (PSS-10), a widely used, psychometrically sound instrument, will assess the degree to which a participant perceives stress in her life during the past month. The PSS-10 asks respondents to report about feelings such as unpredictability, uncontrollability, and overloading of stress in their lives; scores range from 0-40; higher scores correspond to a higher perceived stress level.</description>

        <description>Physical Activity Self-Efficacy Scale (PASES): The Physical Activity Self-Efficacy Scale (PASES) is an 8 question scale which contains items about SM of physical activities and social support regarding PA. This psychometrically sound scale was selected because of its specific focus on SM of PA. Originally designed for adolescents, the wording has been slightly adapted for an adult sample. A higher score indicates higher levels of self-efficacy. Lowest possible score is 8; highest possible score is 40. Only participants in the intervention arm receive this particular instrument.</description>

          <description>To strengthen our ability to examine causal relationships between the intervention and outcomes, we will use longitudinal comparison group data contributed from deidentified archival data from an existing IRB-approved study (PI: Masho) which includes pregnant women who participated in the CPC model of care alone (without the yoga component) and were followed throughout their pregnancies using numerous measures identical to those in the proposed study, including weight/BMI, depressive symptoms, anxiety, and stress.</description>
