  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this project is to develop a novel transdiagnostic treatment for
      anhedonia, called Behavioral Activation Treatment for Anhedonia (BATA), using ultra-high
      field functional neuroimaging. There is a critical need for a validated treatment that
      specifically targets anhedonia, and this project will evaluate the effects of this new
      treatment on anhedonia and will establish how this treatment impacts brain systems that
      mediate reward processing, clinical symptoms of anhedonia, functional outcomes, and
      behavioral indices of reward processing. This work will also identify brain targets by which
      future novel anhedonia treatment may be evaluated.

  <detailed_description>

      Deficits in motivation and pleasure, together referred to as anhedonia, are implicated in a
      number of psychiatric illnesses, including mood and anxiety disorders, substance-use
      disorders, schizophrenia, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. As a result,
      constructs related to anhedonia are central to the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC)
      project. Anhedonia is often one of the most difficult psychiatric symptoms to treat and thus
      represents a critical endophenotype and vulnerability factor for a range of psychiatric
      disorders. Given the centrality of anhedonia to a large number of psychiatric disorders,
      improved interventions to treat motivation and pleasure are critical for these disorders. The
      overall goal of this R61/R33 project is to develop a novel transdiagnostic treatment for
      anhedonia, called Behavioral Activation Treatment for Anhedonia (BATA). This new intervention
      is designed to treat anhedonia by emphasizing supported engagement with personally relevant
      goals and reducing avoidance behaviors. Consistent with the objectives and milestones
      outlined in RFA-MH-16-406 (&quot;Exploratory Clinical Trials of Novel Interventions for Mental
      Disorders&quot;), in the R61 phase of this trial that lasted from June 22, 2017-July 31, 2019, the
      investigators propose to use an experimental therapeutics approach to first evaluate
      mesocorticolimbic target engagement by this treatment in a transdiagnostic sample
      characterized by clinically impairing anhedonia (Aim 1). Specifically, the investigators will
      examine the effects of this treatment, relative to an active comparison treatment, on caudate
      nucleus activation during reward anticipation and rostral anterior cingulate cortex
      activation during reward outcomes using ultra-high field (7T) functional magnetic resonance
      imaging. In this phase of the project, the investigators will also use fMRI to determine the
      optimal dose of the intervention (Aim 2).

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 15 in Neural Activation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 15 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change due to BATA, relative to MBCT, from baseline in right caudate nucleus activation during the anticipation phase of the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task assessed by Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). The BOLD (Blood Oxygen Level-Dependent signal change is expressed as a z-score that represents the magnitude of change relative to baseline. A score of 0 would correspond to no change, and a score of 1 would represent 1 standard deviation of change. The difference in z-scores between the BATA and the MBCT groups reflects the difference in change in fMRI responses between the two treated groups. Thus even a score of 0 in the BATA group may reflect greater change than observed in the MBCT group if change in the MBCT group is negative.</description>

    <description>Treatment will consist of 15 weekly 45-minute sessions. Session 1 provides orientation and psychoeducation on anhedonia, and activity monitoring is introduced. Sessions 2-3 include structured values assessments of 10 life areas to enhance motivation for sustained behavior change and to clarify goals. Following goals clarification, an activity hierarchy is developed, establishing a set of idiographic behavioral targets across life areas prioritized by ease of implementation to scaffold task engagement during the course of treatment.</description>

    <description>BATA will be compared to mindfulness based cognitive therapy (MBCT), chosen because its mechanisms of action are hypothesized to impact different brain mechanisms than BATA. Mindfulness is nonjudgmentally bringing awareness and acceptance to one's present-moment experience. MBCT will be administered in an individual format. The MBCT protocol will be modeled on the session outlines presented in Wahbeh et al., 2014. Treatment will be compromised of 15 weekly 45-minute sessions.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 15 in Neural Activation</title>
        <description>Change due to BATA, relative to MBCT, from baseline in right caudate nucleus activation during the anticipation phase of the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task assessed by Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). The BOLD (Blood Oxygen Level-Dependent signal change is expressed as a z-score that represents the magnitude of change relative to baseline. A score of 0 would correspond to no change, and a score of 1 would represent 1 standard deviation of change. The difference in z-scores between the BATA and the MBCT groups reflects the difference in change in fMRI responses between the two treated groups. Thus even a score of 0 in the BATA group may reflect greater change than observed in the MBCT group if change in the MBCT group is negative.</description>

Sessions 2-3 include structured values assessments of 10 life areas to enhance motivation for sustained behavior change and to clarify goals. Following goals clarification, an activity hierarchy is developed, establishing a set of idiographic behavioral targets across life areas prioritized by ease of implementation to scaffold task engagement during the course of treatment.
