  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the researchers can help people change the
      amount of time they spend in sitting activities and whether this change might improve health
      outcomes.

      Specific Aim 1: Determine feasibility of a 12-week home and telephone based intervention in
      older adults with mild cognitive impairment targeting both the impaired individual and their
      study partner to help initiate and maintain behavior change. We will recruit KUADC registry
      participants with MCI and their caregivers (as study partners). Behavioral interventions are
      more effective when there is built in social support. We will evaluate feasibility in terms
      of successful recruitment and retention of participants, 10% or less of technological
      failures, rate of participant concerns addressed by phone and at home visits, acceptability
      of the intervention to participants (measured by questionnaires during home visits).

      Specific Aim 2: Determine whether a 12-week home and telephone based intervention results in
      reduced total sitting time and shorter bouts of sitting in older adults with MCI and their
      caregivers. Electronic postural monitors will record sitting time for a duration of one week
      at three time points (pre-intervention, mid-intervention, and post-intervention). The
      intervention includes 1) feedback from baseline monitoring, 2) educational and goal setting
      session with the participants and research staff, 3) wrist worn monitors that alert wearers
      to sitting times &gt;30 minutes, 4) home and telephone visits to address physical,
      psychological, and home environment barriers to behavior change. Changes in sitting time and
      breaks from sitting will be compared between baseline, mid-intervention, and
      post-intervention measurement occasions.

      Specific Aim 3: Determine whether sedentary behavior intervention results in improved insulin
      sensitivity and glycemic control. To evaluate whether reduced sitting results in meaningful
      metabolic changes, we will measure postprandial insulin and glucose, and body composition,
      and evaluate changes from pre- to post- intervention adjusting for relevant covariates.

    <measure>Change in Glucose Levels Area Under the Curve in Response to Mixed Meal Tolerance Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The average area under the curve at week 12 minus the average area under the curve at baseline. Blood was collected at baseline (pre-mixed meal). Post-mixed meal it was collected at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120 minutes. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) was computed using the trapezoidal rule as we have previously described (Burns et. al. 2012, Morris et al 2014). This results in a single AUC pre-intervention value, and a single AUC post-intervention value for each metabolic outcome measure (glucose, insulin, etc).
The Area Under the Curve (AUC) for each individual is calculated as a single unitless value that results from calculating the definite integral under a timecourse curve. This method has been widely used and cited in metabolic studies for more than two decades https://doi.org/10.2337/diacare.17.2.152. This results in a single unitless AUC pre-intervention value, and a single AUC post-intervention value for each metabolic outcome response measure (glucose, insulin, etc).</description>

        <title>Change in Glucose Levels Area Under the Curve in Response to Mixed Meal Tolerance Test</title>
        <description>The average area under the curve at week 12 minus the average area under the curve at baseline. Blood was collected at baseline (pre-mixed meal). Post-mixed meal it was collected at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120 minutes. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) was computed using the trapezoidal rule as we have previously described (Burns et. al. 2012, Morris et al 2014). This results in a single AUC pre-intervention value, and a single AUC post-intervention value for each metabolic outcome measure (glucose, insulin, etc).
The Area Under the Curve (AUC) for each individual is calculated as a single unitless value that results from calculating the definite integral under a timecourse curve. This method has been widely used and cited in metabolic studies for more than two decades https://doi.org/10.2337/diacare.17.2.152. This results in a single unitless AUC pre-intervention value, and a single AUC post-intervention value for each metabolic outcome response measure (glucose, insulin, etc).</description>

        <title>Change in HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance)</title>
        <description>HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance) is calculated as fasting insulin (microU/L) x fasting glucose (nmol/L)/22.5. The average HOMA-IR at week 12 minus the average HOMA-IR at baseline. A lower score means a person is more sensitive to insulin, whereas a higher score indicates greater resistance to insulin. The HOMA-IR is a tool for calculating degree of insulin resistance. Given that this is a product of insulin and glucose values divided by a constant, there is no maximum score for this measure. The minimum score would be zero as neither insulin or glucose would drop below zero.</description>

            <description>Subjects will have clinic visits, home visits, and telephone visits. Subjects will be asked to wear a wrist monitor (Jawbone Up) for duration of the study, will meet with the study team to review Physical Activity Education and also be asked to wear the ActivPAL device to assess sitting time.
Jawbone Up: Jawbone Up is a wrist wore water resistant activity monitor.
Physical Activity Education: A study team member will discuss benefits of changing sitting habits and ways to make changes to personal habits.
ActivPAL: Devices measures postural changes over time. Participants will wear device for 7 days. The device measures time sitting, standing, and posture changes (i.e. sit-to-stand).</description>

          <title>Change in HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance)</title>
          <description>HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance) is calculated as fasting insulin (microU/L) x fasting glucose (nmol/L)/22.5. The average HOMA-IR at week 12 minus the average HOMA-IR at baseline. A lower score means a person is more sensitive to insulin, whereas a higher score indicates greater resistance to insulin. The HOMA-IR is a tool for calculating degree of insulin resistance. Given that this is a product of insulin and glucose values divided by a constant, there is no maximum score for this measure. The minimum score would be zero as neither insulin or glucose would drop below zero.</description>
