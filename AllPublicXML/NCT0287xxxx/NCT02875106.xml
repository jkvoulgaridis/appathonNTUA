    <textblock>
      The primary objective in this study is to identify commercial pulse detection systems (CPDS)
      parallel to electrocardiogram (ECG) recording within routine clinical setting, which are able
      to detect atrial fibrillation or sinus rhythm of screened patients.

    <measure>The rate of correctly detected AF of the applied algorithm of the ECG-data in reference to the primary diagnosis of the investigator using the ECG-graph (sensitivity of algorithm).</measure>
    <time_frame>120 seconds</time_frame>
    <description>This will be calculated as proportion of AF patients detected by the applied algorithm compared with proportion of AF patients diagnosed by the investigator, both based on ECG records.</description>

    <time_frame>60 seconds, 180 seconds, 240 seconds, 300 seconds</time_frame>
    <description>This will be a sensitivity analysis of derived sensitivities of CPDS in different time frames, calculated as proportion of patients with sinus rhythm diagnosed by CPDS record out of the total number of patients diagnosed with sinus rhythm by ECG record (for patients with diagnosis for both recordings available).</description>

    <ipd_description>Availability of this study's data will be determined according to Bayer's commitment to the EFPIA/PhRMA &quot;Principles for responsible clinical trial data sharing&quot;. This pertains to scope, timepoint and process of data access. As such, Bayer commits to sharing upon request from qualified researchers patient-level clinical trial data, study-level clinical trial data, and protocols from clinical trials in patients for medicines and indications approved in the US and EU as necessary for conducting legitimate research. This applies to data on new medicines and indications that have been approved by the EU and US regulatory agencies on or after January 01, 2014. Interested researchers can use www.clinicalstudydatarequest.com to request access to anonymized patient-level data and supporting documents from clinical studies to conduct research. Information on the Bayer criteria for listing studies and other relevant information is provided in the Study sponsors section of the portal.</ipd_description>
