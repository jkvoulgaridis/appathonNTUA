  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Three hundred-twenty (320) adult smokers of menthol or non-menthol combustible cigarettes
      will be recruited and randomly assigned to one of five groups (n=64/group), who will be asked
      to switch for 12 weeks to ad libitum use of combustible cigarettes (matched to subjects'
      menthol preference) containing either 0.4, 1.4, 2.5, 5.6 or 16.9 mg nicotine (standardized
      nicotine yields ranging from 0.02-0.80 mg/cigarette), respectively. Each group will include
      32 heavy (≥ 20 cigarettes/day), and 32 light smokers (≤10 cigarettes/day), who are
      hypothesized to be more sensitive to nicotine's reinforcing effects. Participants will also
      have free access to nicotine-containing e-cigarettes (JUUL) throughout the 12-week period.
      Abuse liability of combustible cigarettes will be assessed by behavioral (cigarettes/day,
      time to first cigarettes), self-report (rewarding effects, withdrawal symptoms) and
      biochemical indices (expired air carbon monoxide, cotinine blood sampling).

      In laboratory sessions, we will measure nicotine thresholds for detecting and recognizing the
      addictive, rewarding effects of smoking. This study is designed to help the FDA identify a
      target nicotine threshold that will not attract young people to smoking or induce relapse in
      former smokers. Additionally, we will determine the level of cigarette nicotine reduction
      that will be tolerated without inducing dissatisfaction in smokers, information that is
      relevant to the FDA for designing a stepwise nicotine reduction policy that can be
      implemented without widespread objections. The knowledge gained from this project will
      greatly increase our knowledge of nicotine addiction and will help frame an FDA policy
      relating to the regulation of the nicotine content of tobacco. Ultimately, a well-designed
      nicotine reduction policy has the potential to greatly reduce the enormous toll of death and
      disease caused by cigarette smoking.
