    <description>Ability to return to Normal, subject's baseline, diet. EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ -H&amp;N35) will be analyzed at each post-operative assessment: at days 1 through 7, 10 and 14. The module consists of 35 questions assessing symptoms and side effects of treatment, social function, and body image/sexuality. The head and neck cancer module incorporates seven multi-item scales that assess pain, swallowing, senses (taste and smell), speech, social eating, social contact, and sexuality. There are also eleven single items. For all items and scales, high scores indicate more problems. This score will be assessed qualitatively by asking if they have experienced symptoms or problems using the below subgroups:
Not at all: 1
A little: 2
Quite a bit: 3
Very much: 4</description>

The module consists of 35 questions assessing symptoms and side effects of treatment, social function, and body image/sexuality. The head and neck cancer module incorporates seven multi-item scales that assess pain, swallowing, senses (taste and smell), speech, social eating, social contact, and sexuality. There are also eleven single items. For all items and scales, high scores indicate more problems. This score will be assessed qualitatively by asking if they have experienced symptoms or problems using the below subgroups:
