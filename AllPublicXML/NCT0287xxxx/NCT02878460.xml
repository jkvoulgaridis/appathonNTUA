  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently, hyperoxia has been recognized as being potentially deleterious for critically ill
      patients, with increased duration of mechanical ventilation and even with increased mortality
      rates. This could be related to pulmonary lesions (including notably atelectasis) but also to
      increased tissue damage and organ dysfunctions, secondary to increased/induced oxidative
      stress. At last higher FiO2 led to &quot;over-consumption&quot; of oxygen and therefore to additional
      costs. Usually, FiO2 and oxygen flows are modified according to the monitoring of SpO2. But,
      it has also been recognized that modifying FiO2 (and oxygen flows) according to SpO2
      monitoring is not routinely (or easily) done. Indeed, nurses (and doctors) are reluctant to
      reduce oxygen flows when everything appear under control.

      The ORI (Oxygen Reserve Index) is an index measured using non-invasive SpO2 sensors (Rainbow
      sensors- MASIMO) that evaluates non-invasively PaO2 (partial pressure of oxygen). An ORI ≤0
      indicates that PaO2 is less than 100 mmHg. When ORI increases (i.e. ORI≥0.01) PaO2 is higher
      than 100 mmHg. This index increases up to 1. ORI between 0.01 and 1 indicates that PaO2 is
      probably between 100 and 200 mmHg. Thus, monitoring critically ill patients using the ORI,
      may help identifying when PaO2 is high and when FiO2 (or oxygen flows in non-intubated
      patients) may be reduced. This could help reducing the time with hyperoxia (i.e. PaO2 ≥100
      mmHg or ≥80 mmHg).

      The purpose of this feasibility study is to evaluate if the use of ORI can help to decrease
      length of moderate hyperoxia (PaO2&gt;100mmHg) in critically ill patients, in comparison with
      monitoring the SpO2 only.
