  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study explores whether offering follow-up counseling and referral over the phone after
      using a home-based HIV test increases rates of ever and repeat testing, compared with
      home-based testing with no follow-up (HBST alone) or mailing reminders for clinic-based
      testing.
