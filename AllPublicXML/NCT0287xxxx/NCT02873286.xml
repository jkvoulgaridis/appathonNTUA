    <textblock>
      A total of 400 subjects will be recruited into five treatment subject groups à 80
      subjects.Subject will receive two administrations 4 weeks apart which will consist of
      MVA-BN-RSV Dose 1, MVA-BN-RSV Dose 2 or Placebo (TBS).

      86 subjects from 2 treatment groups (43 per treatment group) are supposed to receive one
      (booster) dose of MVA-BN-RSV vaccine approximately one year after their first vaccination. In
      this booster substudy, eligible subjects will receive the same dose they received during the
      main trial.
