      Primary Objective:

      The primary objective of this trial is to compare the clinical efficacy of BI 695501 with
      EU-approved Humira® in patients with active Crohn's disease (CD).

      Secondary Objectives:

      The secondary objectives of this trial are to compare the efficacy and safety of BI 695501
      with EU-approved Humira® across the induction and maintenance phases.

    <measure>Percentage of Patients With a Clinical Response (CDAI Decrease of ≥70 Compared With Baseline) at Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) is a validated instrument to measure disease severity in Crohn's Disease (CD). The CDAI score is a sum of the 8 factors (number of liquid stools, abdominal pain, general well-being, extra-intestinal complications, antidiarrheal drugs, abdominal mass, hematocrit and body weight) after adjustment with a weighting factor. Higher CDAI scores indicating more active disease.
The CDAI decrease at Week 4 was assessed as the decrease relative to baseline measurement, patients with a decrease ≥70 were responders.
Percentage=least squares means per treatment group back transformed using inverse logit function. Missing data were imputed according to non-responder imputation (NRI) and last observation carried forward (LOCF).</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Patients With Adverse Events (AEs), Serious AEs (SAEs), and AEs of Special Interest (AESIs)</measure>
    <time_frame>From first administration of trial medication until 10 weeks after last administration, up to a maximum of 56 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Analysis of AEs focused on treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs). For the period 1 'Baseline - Week 24', TEAEs were defined as AEs that started or worsened on or after first dose of trial medication and prior to date of the Week 24 visit or within 10 weeks (70 days, inclusive) after last dose of trial medication for patients who discontinued treatment before Week 24. For the period 2 'Week 24 - Week 46', TEAEs were defined as AEs that started or worsened on Week 24 visit and prior to or on Week 56 visit or within 10 weeks (70 days, inclusive) after last dose of trial medication for patients discontinuing treatment prior to Week 46. TEAEs and SAEs (including investigator-assessed trial medication-related TEAEs) and AESIs are reported. The following were considered an AESI: hepatic injury, anaphylactic reactions, serious infection and hypersensitivity reactions.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This was an exploratory, randomized, 56-week, double-blind, parallel arm, multiple dose, active comparator trial of BI 695501 and EU-approved Humira, with a 48-week treatment period and a 10-week follow-up period (starting after last dose of trial medication at Week 46) in patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's Disease (CD)</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The trial consisted of a screening period of up to a maximum of 28 days, a 48-week treatment period consisting of an induction period from baseline to Week 4 and a maintenance period from Week 5 to Week 48, and a 10-week safety follow-up period (starting after last dose of trial medication at Week 46).</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Patients randomized to BI 695501 received treatment every 2 weeks until Week 4 when they were assessed for clinical response. If classified as responders (Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) decrease of ≥70 compared to baseline), patients continued to receive BI 695501 every 2 weeks until the end of the treatment (EoT) period (Week 46).
Patients were administered with a loading dose of 160 milligram (mg) BI 695501 on Day 1, followed by 80 mg BI 695501 2 weeks later (Day 15), and thereafter 40 mg BI 695501 every 2 weeks until Week 46. Trial medication was administered by subcutaneous (SC) injection.</description>

          <title>Crohn’s Disease Activity Index score at baseline</title>
          <description>Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) is a valid instrument to measure severity in Crohn’s disease. The CDAI is composed of 8 factors (Number of liquid stools, abdominal pain, general well being, extra-intestinal complications, antidiarrheal drugs, abdominal mass, hematocrit, body weight) the score is calculated by adding up the scores after adjustment with a weighting factor. The total score ranges from 0 to approx. 600, higher scores indicates more severe disease. A score of less than or equal to 150 is evaluated as a remission while 220 and 450 indicate moderate to severely active disease.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Patients With a Clinical Response (CDAI Decrease of ≥70 Compared With Baseline) at Week 4</title>
        <description>The Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) is a validated instrument to measure disease severity in Crohn's Disease (CD). The CDAI score is a sum of the 8 factors (number of liquid stools, abdominal pain, general well-being, extra-intestinal complications, antidiarrheal drugs, abdominal mass, hematocrit and body weight) after adjustment with a weighting factor. Higher CDAI scores indicating more active disease.
The CDAI decrease at Week 4 was assessed as the decrease relative to baseline measurement, patients with a decrease ≥70 were responders.
Percentage=least squares means per treatment group back transformed using inverse logit function. Missing data were imputed according to non-responder imputation (NRI) and last observation carried forward (LOCF).</description>

        <description>Analysis of AEs focused on treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs). For the period 1 'Baseline - Week 24', TEAEs were defined as AEs that started or worsened on or after first dose of trial medication and prior to date of the Week 24 visit or within 10 weeks (70 days, inclusive) after last dose of trial medication for patients who discontinued treatment before Week 24. For the period 2 'Week 24 - Week 46', TEAEs were defined as AEs that started or worsened on Week 24 visit and prior to or on Week 56 visit or within 10 weeks (70 days, inclusive) after last dose of trial medication for patients discontinuing treatment prior to Week 46. TEAEs and SAEs (including investigator-assessed trial medication-related TEAEs) and AESIs are reported. The following were considered an AESI: hepatic injury, anaphylactic reactions, serious infection and hypersensitivity reactions.</description>
