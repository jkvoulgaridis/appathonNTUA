  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The cryoanesthesia (CA) device is designed to provide anesthesia to a focal area on the
      surface of the eye immediately prior to intraocular injections.

      The investigators plan to carry out a pilot study to collect preliminary data on the
      effectiveness of the cryoanesthesia (CA) device in minimizing the pain caused by intravitreal
      injections (IVT).

Their other eye will receive anesthesia via the active comparator, lidocaine.
Comment: Cryoanesthesia Device is the name of the device.
Cryoanesthesia device: The study will be carried out in patients receiving bilateral injections. One eye will be anesthetized using the cryoanesthesia device, developed at the University of Michigan. This has been assessed to be a Non-significant Risk device.
Patients will receive the cryoanesthesia at a temperature of -5C for 10 seconds, -5C for 20 seconds, 0C for 20 seconds, or -10C for 10 seconds.</description>
