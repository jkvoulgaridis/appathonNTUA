  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At each site (OHSU &amp; UM), 160 socially isolated adults 75+ years old will be recruited from
      the community and randomized to either the Video Chat Group or the Control Group. Those in
      the Video Chat Group will receive a computer and internet service for the duration of the
      study, which they will use to video chat with study staff for 30 minutes/day 4x/week for 6
      months (high dose), and then 2x/week for an additional 6 months (maintenance dose). Both
      intervention and control groups will have a brief (about 10 minutes) telephone check-in with
      study staff once per week. In-home testing will occur at Baseline, 6 months, and 12 months.
      All participants at OHSU will have their medication compliance tracked using an electronic
      medication monitoring device and all participants at both OHSU and UM will have MRIs at
      Baseline and 6 months, if they are able to safely receive MRIs. All participants at both
      sites will contribute saliva for genetic testing, and all video chat and neuropsychological
      assessment sessions will be recorded for speech and language analysis.

Conversational staff will facilitate content-standardized but naturalistic-style social engagement. Staff and participants will engage in conversation about a wide variety of topics that are culturally and personally relevant and interesting to participants. Each day, participants will be able to choose from topic options. Participants will also receive a phone call once per week that lasts approximately 10 minutes; interviewers ask brief questions to monitor participant social activities and health conditions.</description>
