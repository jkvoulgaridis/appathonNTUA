  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study utilizing Marqibo® (vincristine sulfate liposome injection) combined
      with dexamethasone, mitoxantrone and asparaginase (UK ALL R3) for relapsed acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will utilize Marqibo® as a replacement for standard vincristine in combination
      with chemotherapy for children with relapsed ALL. The hypothesis is that the incorporation of
      Marqibo® with combination chemotherapy will be safe and feasible. In the context of this
      pilot study, overall outcomes and efficacy will be a secondary objective. It is hypothesized
      that data from this combination may show improved efficacy including, complete remission
      (CR), minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity, and progression free survival (PFS) rates
      and safety (i.e., neurotoxicity) in comparison to outcomes in historical regimens, including
      the UK ALL R3 with standard vincristine.

          -  Patients must have recovered from the acute toxic effects (≤ Grade 2 or baseline) of
             all prior chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or radiotherapy prior to entering this study,
             unless otherwise specified. Subjects with disease related cytopenias will be eligible.

          -  Patients must have relapsed or refractory disease after attaining at least a first
             remission. They may be in first to third relapse..

             States, by Health Canada for institutions in Canada and by The Therapeutic Goods
             Administration for institutions in Australia.

        Exceptions:

          -  There is no time restriction in regard to prior intrathecal chemotherapy provided
             there is complete recovery from any acute toxic effects of such; it is allowable to
             enroll a patient that has received IT Cytarabine (ARA-C), IT Methotrexate (MTX) or
             triple IT therapy within 14 days of enrollment as part of their evaluation to diagnose
             disease relapse. The IT therapy given within 14 days of initiation of protocol
             specified chemotherapy, may substitute for the day 1 IT in cohorts A and B

          -  Subjects with rapidly progressive disease may receive hydroxyurea until they begin
             study therapy;

          -  Patients who relapse while on maintenance-type ALL therapy or are receiving
             maintenance therapy for disease stabilization will not require a wash-out period
             before entry into this study. However, there must be at least 10 days after any dose
             of standard vincristine.

        Renal and Hepatic Function

          -  Renal function: Patient's serum creatinine must be ≤ 1.5 x institutional upper limit
             of normal (ULN) according to age. If the serum creatinine is greater than 1.5 times
             normal, the patient must have a calculated creatinine clearance or radioisotope
             glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ≥ 70milliliter/min/1.73m2. Alternatively, a 24-hour
             creatinine clearance may also be used.

          -  Hepatic function: alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST)
             must be &lt; 5 x institutional upper limit of norm ULN. Total bilirubin must be ≤ 1.5 x
             ULN (except in the case of subjects with documented Gilbert's disease ≤ 5 × ULN).

        Cardiac Function

        -Patients must have a shortening fraction ≥ 27% or an ejection fraction ≥ 55% by
        echocardiogram, cardiac MRI or multigated acquisition scan (MUGA).

        Reproductive Function

          -  Female patients must not be pregnant and those of childbearing potential must have a
             negative urine or serum pregnancy test confirmed within one week prior to enrollment.

          -  Female patients with infants must agree not to breastfeed their infants while on this
             study.

          -  Male and female patients of childbearing potential must agree to use an effective
             method of contraception during the study.

        Patients will be excluded if they have previously received Marqibo®.

        Patients will be excluded if they have a known allergy to any of the drugs used in the
        study, with the exception that patients with an allergy to PEG-asparaginase who can receive
        Erwinia asparaginase are eligible. Patients unable to receive any formulation of
        asparaginase may only enroll on cohort C

        Patients will be excluded if they have active, uncontrolled systemic fungal, bacterial,
        viral or other infection despite appropriate antibiotics or other treatment.

        Patients with pre-existing, persistent grade 2 or greater sensory or motor neuropathy from
        any cause will be excluded.

        Patients will be excluded if they have, significant concurrent disease, illness,
        psychiatric disorder or social issue that would compromise patient safety or adherence with
        the protocol treatment or procedures or interfere with consent, study participation, follow
        up, or interpretation of study results.Patients with Down syndrome will not be eligible for
        enrollment on Cohort A

        Patients with a known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) will will be excluded
