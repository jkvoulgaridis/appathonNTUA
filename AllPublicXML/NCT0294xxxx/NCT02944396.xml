  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to establish the recommended Phase 2 dose (RPTD) of veliparib in combination
      with nivolumab and platinum doublet chemotherapy (carboplatin/paclitaxel or
      carboplatin/pemetrexed) (Phase 1 portion) and to assess whether the addition of nivolumab to
      veliparib in combination with platinum doublet chemotherapy results will improve progression
      free survival (PFS) compared to veliparib with platinum doublet chemotherapy alone in
      participants with metastatic or advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) (Phase 2
      portion).

      A strategy decision was made not to proceed to Phase 2 portion of this study due to change in
      standard of care.
