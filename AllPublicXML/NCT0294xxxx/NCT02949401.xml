  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to assess the utility of virtual reality technology to aid in the
      mental health of patients with cardiac disease, specifically looking at decreasing anxiety
      and perceptions of pain from stressful procedures in the pediatric electrophysiology
      laboratory.

      The investigators will perform a pilot study of 40 patients who are randomized to either
      standard of care preparation for an electrophysiology procedure (control arm) vs. Virtual
      Reality preparation (VR arm). Participants in control arm will have standard preparation for
      a procedure including discussion of the procedure with the provider the day before the
      procedure with all questions answered at that time. VR arm participants will have access to
      the Virtual Reality tour and gear 1 week prior to the procedure. VR arm participants will be
      instructed to watch the Virtual Reality tour at least three times prior to the procedure but
      will be encouraged to watch as often as the participants would like. The Virtual Reality
      equipment will measure how often participants complete the tour. All participants will
      undergo anxiety measures a total of four times: once at time of recruitment, day of procedure
      and then 1 week and 4 weeks post procedure. Participants will have cortisol salivary swabs
      performed 1 week before procedure (before VR use), pre-op visit, day of procedure, and
      immediately following procedure. Heart rate and blood pressure will be measured on day of
      procedure.

    <measure>Change in anxiety levels from baseline in patients as measured by the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI).</measure>
    <time_frame>At time of recruitment, day of procedure, 1 week post procedure, and 4 weeks post procedure</time_frame>
    <description>State -Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) is a widely used self-report measure that estimates situational (state) and baseline (trait) anxiety in adults and children. It is both valid and reliable and routinely used in measuring anxiety associated with medical procedures. The pediatric version is available for use with upper elementary, or junior high or high school aged children.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in anxiety levels from baseline in patients as measured by Visual Analog Scale of Anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>At time of recruitment, day of procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Visual Analog Scale of Anxiety (VAS) is a widely used self-reported and observational measure of anxiety. Patients place a vertical line along a 10 cm horizontal line which is anchored with the descriptors &quot;not at all anxious&quot; and &quot;extremely anxious&quot; and 10 markings 1 cm apart. This simple format of assessing anxiety is often used in operating rooms or before medical procedures given its brevity and ease of administration is fast-paced settings. It has been correlated with STAI scores.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in parent observation of child behavior from baseline as measured by Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL)</measure>
    <time_frame>At time of recruitment and 4 weeks post procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) is a rating form of child behavior completed by parents. It has been developed for children aged 6-18 years. This checklist groups into sets of behaviors: internalizing, externalizing and total problems.</description>

    <description>The VR interactive module will consist of a 360° visit to the Hospital where patients encounter the various aspects of a procedure from the front door; through the pre-operative area where patients will receive an IV; to the catheterization lab and placement of the anesthesia mask; and back to the post anesthesia care unit. Patients will be accompanied by a child who acts as a guide to the experience. The guide will help explain what the patient is seeing and what to expect along the way. Health care professionals will be enmeshed within the scenarios and will also help with the explanations along the way. Patients will be prompted to enter the relaxation scenarios at different stressful times along the tour to practice relaxation and mindfulness techniques (i.e. before IV start, or upon entering catheterization laboratory). Relaxation scenarios will include a snow scene, tropical beach or other guided imagery scenes.</description>
