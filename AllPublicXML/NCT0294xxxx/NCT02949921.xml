  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to provide a preliminary assessment of the radiographic
      appearance of Radiesse material that has been injected into the dorsum of the hands.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Radiesse dermal filler is radiopaque and shows no overt radiographic safety concerns in a
      study of 58 patients after facial implantation, with Radiesse not always visible on plain
      X-rays.

      This Post Approval Safety study will evaluate if there are concerns after Radiesse
      implantation in the dorsum of hands, specifically if implantation interferes with
      radiological assessment by obscuring the bones of the hand.

      Hands will be scored according to the 5 point Merz Hand Grading Scale (MHGS), which ranges
      from 0 (No loss of fatty tissue) to 4 (Very severe loss of fatty tissue; marked visibility of
      veins and tendons).

    <time_frame>Baseline, Months 1, 6, 7, 12, 13, 18, 19 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>The MHQ is a hand-specific outcomes instrument that measures outcomes of participants with conditions of, or injury to, the hand or wrist. The MHQ contains six domains: overall hand function, activities of daily living, work performance, pain, aesthetics and satisfaction. For this study, MHQ overall hand function and MHQ pain domains were evaluated. Scores for both scales range from 0-100. Higher MHQ hand function scores denote better hand performance whereas higher MHQ pain scores denote more pain. MHQ minimal clinically important differences were defined as score changes greater than an 11-point increase for the pain domain and greater than a 13-point decrease for the function domain.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Greater Than or Equal to (&gt;=) 1 Point Improvement on the MHGS in Both Hands After Initial Treatment at Months 1 and 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Months 1 and 6</time_frame>
    <description>The MHGS was used to measure clinical efficacy of the Radiesse hand treatments by a masked evaluator performing live, dorsal hand assessments. The MHGS was an ordinal scale; therefore, ratings were made based on a &quot;snap-shot&quot; at a specific study time point. A measure of successful or improved treatment effect was demonstrated by a decrease in MHGS score. MHGS had 5 categories, where: 0 (no loss of fatty tissue); 1 (mild loss of fatty tissue; slight visibility of veins); 2 (moderate loss of fatty tissue; mild visibility of veins and tendons); 3 (severe loss of fatty tissue; moderate visibility of veins and tendons); 4(very severe loss of fatty tissue; marked visibility of veins and tendons).</description>

        <title>Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire (MHQ) Scores</title>
        <description>The MHQ is a hand-specific outcomes instrument that measures outcomes of participants with conditions of, or injury to, the hand or wrist. The MHQ contains six domains: overall hand function, activities of daily living, work performance, pain, aesthetics and satisfaction. For this study, MHQ overall hand function and MHQ pain domains were evaluated. Scores for both scales range from 0-100. Higher MHQ hand function scores denote better hand performance whereas higher MHQ pain scores denote more pain. MHQ minimal clinically important differences were defined as score changes greater than an 11-point increase for the pain domain and greater than a 13-point decrease for the function domain.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Greater Than or Equal to (&gt;=) 1 Point Improvement on the MHGS in Both Hands After Initial Treatment at Months 1 and 6</title>
        <description>The MHGS was used to measure clinical efficacy of the Radiesse hand treatments by a masked evaluator performing live, dorsal hand assessments. The MHGS was an ordinal scale; therefore, ratings were made based on a &quot;snap-shot&quot; at a specific study time point. A measure of successful or improved treatment effect was demonstrated by a decrease in MHGS score. MHGS had 5 categories, where: 0 (no loss of fatty tissue); 1 (mild loss of fatty tissue; slight visibility of veins); 2 (moderate loss of fatty tissue; mild visibility of veins and tendons); 3 (severe loss of fatty tissue; moderate visibility of veins and tendons); 4(very severe loss of fatty tissue; marked visibility of veins and tendons).</description>

All participants were treated in the dorsum of the hands. Based on the investigator and participant’s decision, participants received up to three retreatments at Months 6, 12, and 18.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With &gt;=1 Point Improvement on the MHGS in Both Hands Following Retreatment at Months 7 and 12</title>
        <description>The MHGS was used to measure clinical efficacy of the Radiesse hand treatments by a masked evaluator performing live, dorsal hand assessments. The MHGS was an ordinal scale; therefore, ratings were made based on a &quot;snap-shot&quot; at a specific study time point. A measure of successful or improved treatment effect was demonstrated by a decrease in MHGS score. MHGS had 5 categories, where: 0 (no loss of fatty tissue); 1 (mild loss of fatty tissue; slight visibility of veins); 2 (moderate loss of fatty tissue; mild visibility of veins and tendons); 3 (severe loss of fatty tissue; moderate visibility of veins and tendons); 4(very severe loss of fatty tissue; marked visibility of veins and tendons).</description>

        <population>All participants who were enrolled in the study. Participants who were evaluable for this measure at given time period were included in the assessment.</population>

All participants were treated in the dorsum of the hands. Based on the investigator and participant’s decision, participants received up to three retreatments at Months 6, 12, and 18.</description>
