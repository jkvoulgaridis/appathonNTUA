  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this investigation is to conduct a series of case studies on the impact of a
      novel functional medicine approach to improving cognitive skills, brain structure, and daily
      functioning for participants with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Using a multiple baseline design across cases with start point randomization, the proposed
      study will examine the outcomes from a combination of optimized diet, exercise, nutritional
      supplements, and cognitive training across domains on standardized measures used to monitor
      treatment effectiveness for Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI).
