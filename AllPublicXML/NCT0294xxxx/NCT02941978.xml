      The purpose of the study is to investigate the impact of motivational interviewing in the
      adherence of patients with AF to oral anticoagulation (OAC) regimens. Patients assigned to
      the intervention group will be interviewed and guided on the importance of adherence to OAC
      medication, and will be contacted at 1 week, 2 months, 6 months and 1 year after discharge
      for educational interactive sessions. Patients in the control group will receive usual
      treatment and will be contacted at 1 year after discharge.

      Study Purpose: To investigate the impact of motivational interviewing in the adherence of
      patients with AF to oral anticoagulation (OAC) regimens

      Trial Design: Prospective, two-arm, single-center, randomized controlled clinical trial

      Sample Size: 1000 subjects

      Population: Adults with Non-valvular Atrial Fibrillation (NVAF) hospitalized in the
      cardiology ward for any reason who receive OAC at hospital discharge.

      Intervention

        1. Motivational Interview - Baseline: At hospital discharge or one day before, patients
           assigned to the intervention group will be contacted in person by a study physician for
           an interactive session and will be given an educational leaflet. Both methods will aim
           to educate them about the risk for stroke and the importance of adherence to OAC
           medication, and motivate them to adhere to their OAC treatment plan.

        2. Motivational Interview - Follow-up: Patients assigned to the intervention group will be
           contacted via telephone for a pre-specified interview at 1 week, 2 months, 6 months and
           1 year after discharge. The delegated study personnel will assess whether an
           intervention is required and provide specific support tailored to the needs of the
           patient, focusing on maintaining or improving patients' adherence to OAC

      Control Patients assigned to the control group receive usual treatment, corresponding to
      standard practice and management of hospitalized patients with AF. Patients assigned to the
      control group will be contacted via telephone for a pre-specified interview at 1 year after
      discharge for outcome assessment.

      Primary Outcome: The primary outcome is overall adherence to OAC in the year after
      hospitalization for any reason, reported as Proportion of Days Covered (PDC) by OAC regimens.
      Patients with a PDC &gt;80% will be classified as adequately adherent.

      Secondary Outcomes: The secondary outcomes include:

        -  The rate of persistence: the proportion of patients who are on OAC after hospital
           discharge and continue receiving OAC at the end of the study period.

        -  OAC treatment gaps: the percentage of patients who have i) continuous OAC use (no
           treatment gaps or gaps &lt;7 days), ii) transient treatment gaps (7-89 days), and iii)
           major treatment gaps (3 months or more)

        -  Clinical outcomes such as death, thromboembolic event, myocardial infraction or bleeding
           after hospitalization.

      Clinical Duration:The total study duration (concerning the primary outcome) is expected to be
      3-4 years.

    <description>Motivational Interview - Baseline: At hospital discharge, patients assigned to the intervention group will be contacted in person by a study physician for an interactive session and will be given an educational leaflet. Both methods will aim to educate them about the risk for stroke and the importance of adherence to OAC medication. The leaflet will also provide some basic information on how to take OAC medication (doses, food interactions, skipping doses, etc.) and will describe the main clinical manifestations of side effects.
Motivational Interview - Follow-up: Patients assigned to the intervention group will be contacted via telephone for a pre-specified interview at 1 week, 2 months, 6 months and 1 year after discharge. The delegated study personnel will assess whether an intervention is required and provide specific support tailored to the needs of the patient, aiming to improve adherence to OAC.</description>

    <description>Patients assigned to the intervention group receive additional medical consultation aiming to boost optimal uptake of the anticoagulation regimen prescribed. Initially (i.e., at hospital discharge), this includes a physician-patient interactive session and provision of an educational leaflet. The leaflet is designed in a culturally and linguistically conceivable template in Greek language. It uses simple terms together with both written and pictorial materials. Patients in the intervention group will also undergo short telephonic sessions at 1 week, 2 months, 6 months and 12 months following hospital discharge</description>
