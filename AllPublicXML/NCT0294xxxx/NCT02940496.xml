      This phase I/II clinical trial studies the side effects of pembrolizumab with or without
      elbasvir/grazoprevir and ribavirin and to see how well they work in treating patients with
      liver cancer that has spread to other places in the body and does not respond to previous
      treatment. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the
      body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to
      grow and spread. Elbasvir/grazoprevir and ribavirin may stop the growth of tumor cells by
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving pembrolizumab in combination with
      elbasvir/grazoprevir and ribavirin may work better in treating patients with liver cancer
      than with pembrolizumab alone.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the tolerability of intravenous (V) administration of pembrolizumab as
      second-line systemic therapy in subjects with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. (Arm A and
      Arm B).

      II. To evaluate the efficacy of pembrolizumab in combination with elbasvir/grazoprevir
      (Zepatier) as assessed by the proportion of subjects with hepatitis C virus (HCV) GT1 or GT4
      achieving Sustained Virologic Response 12 weeks after the end of all HCV study therapy
      (SVR12), defined as HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) below the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ)
      (either target detected unquantifiable [TD(u)] or target not detected [TND]) 12 weeks after
      the end of all study therapy. (Arm B)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the objective response rate (ORR), per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
      Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 assessed by MD Anderson radiology.

      II. To estimate the duration of response (DOR), disease control rate (DCR), time to
      progression (TTP), and progression-free survival (PFS) per RECIST 1.1 assessed by MD Anderson
      Department of Diagnostic Imaging.

      III. To evaluate the safety of pembrolizumab in combination with Zepatier as assessed by the
      proportion of subjects with HCV GT1 or GT4 achieving SVR12 and SVR24, defined as HCV RNA
      below the LLOQ (either TD[u] or TND) 12 and 24 weeks after the end of all study therapy.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate ORR, DOR, DCR, TTP, PFS and overall survival (OS) per immune response RECIST
      (irRECIST) as assessed by MD Anderson radiology.

      II. To explore the relationship between progression on sorafenib versus intolerance of
      sorafenib and response to pembrolizumab.

      III. To perform exploratory biomarker research to study the correlation between immunological
      and molecular changes in tumor tissues and peripheral blood with TTP, OS, and rate of adverse
      events (AEs).

      IV. To explore the association between PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) expression by immunohistochemistry
      (IHC), somatic gene expression profiling (GEP) and antitumor efficacy of pembrolizumab based
      on RECIST 1.1.

      V. To explore predictive biomarkers to study the correlation of independent effect of
      cirrhosis grade and severity of portal hypertension by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      classification on OS.

      VI. To explore retrospective risk stratification of the degree of the underlying liver
      dysfunction by IGF score.

      To explore retrospective risk stratification of the degree of the underlying liver
      dysfunction by IGF-1 score. See section 2.1. VII. To assess whether pembrolizumab in
      combination with Zepatier affects the course of viral infections in subjects with underlying
      HCV GT1 or GT4. We hypothesize that pembrolizumab in combination with Zepatier will help to
      reduce viral loads in those with untreated HCV.

      VIIII. To evaluate the response of HCV GT1 and GT4 to treatment as assessed by sustained
      virologic response at 4 and 12 weeks after the end of 12 to 16 weeks of pembrolizumab in
      combination with Zepatier dosing. Sustained virologic response is defined as defined as HCV
      RNA below the LLOQ (either TD[u] or TND).

      IX. To evaluate the emergence of viral resistance-associated variants (RAVs) to pembrolizumab
      in combination with Zepatier in subjects with HCV GT1 or GT4 without RAVs as baseline .

      X. To evaluate the efficacy of pembrolizumab in combination with Zepatier as assessed by the
      proportion of subjects with HCV GT1 or GT4 achieving undetectable (TND) HCV RNA and HCV RNA
      below the LLOQ at Weeks 2, 4, 12 and Follow- Up Week 4 (SVR4), Week 12 (SVR12), and Week 24
      (SVR24).

      XI. To explore the relationship between genetic variation and subject response to the
      treatment(s) administered.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Cycles
      repeat every 21 days for up to 35 cycles in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM B: Patients receive pembrolizumab as in arm A. Patients also receive elbasvir/grazoprevir
      orally (PO) once daily (QD) and ribavirin PO QD on days 1-28. Treatment continues for 12-16
      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30-90 days and then every 12
      weeks.

             (i.e., with use of disease-modifying agents, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive
             drugs); replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a
             form of systemic treatment

          -  Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any
             other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of trial

             consultation with the sponsor

          -  Has received locoregional therapy to liver (transarterial chemoembolization [TACE],
             transarterial embolization [TAE], radiation, radioembolization, or ablation) or
             surgery to liver or other site within 6 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug;
             minor surgery must have occurred at least 7 days prior to the first dose of study
             treatment (cycle 1, day 1); subjects must have recovered adequately (i.e., grade =&lt; 1

             starting therapy

          -  Has a known history of an additional malignancy, except if the participant has
             undergone potentially curative therapy with no evidence of that disease recurrence for
             5 years since initiation of that therapy

          -  Has radiographically detectable (even if asymptomatic and/or previously treated)
             central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis as assessed by
             local site investigator and radiology review/CIV

             viral load must be less than 100 IU/mL prior to first dose of study drug; those on
             active HBV therapy with viral loads under 100 IU/mL should stay on the same therapy
             throughout study treatment; those subjects who are anti-HBc (+) and negative for
             HBsAg, Anti-HBs, and HBV viral load do not require HBV prophylaxis, but need close
             monitoring for reactivation

          -  Subjects who have received therapy for HCV =&lt; 4 weeks from the start of pembrolizumab;
             Note: those with untreated HCV and those who completed HCV therapy &gt;= 4 weeks of study
