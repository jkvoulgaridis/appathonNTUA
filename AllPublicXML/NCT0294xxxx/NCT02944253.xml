  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Two dietary approaches, very low energy diets (VLEDs) and ketogenic low carbohydrate diets
      (KLCDs), have the ability to suppress appetite. The suppression of appetite typically
      observed during these diets is believed (but not clinically proven) to be due to ketosis, a
      condition where circulating concentrations of ketone bodies are increased due to a higher
      production of ketones in the liver. Little is known about the potential mechanisms through
      which ketosis may lead to appetite suppression in VLEDs and KLCDs. A 'ketogenic diet'
      typically contains less than 50 grams carbohydrate per day, yet ketosis has been seen in
      subjects who consume diets with a carbohydrates ranging between 59-192 grams per day.
      Although an association between ketosis and appetite suppression has been established, the
      minimum level of ketosis and maximum carbohydrate intake that is still associated with
      appetite suppression remains unknown and should be explored. The ability to increase
      carbohydrate intake while maintaining a suppressed appetite will allow dieters to consume
      more carbohydrate-rich food that is beneficial for health without feeling more hungry. The
      aim of this study, 'can Appetite Suppression be achieved using KEtogenic Diets with more
      carbohydrates?' (ASKED) is, therefore, to identify the maximum carbohydrate intake that is
      still associated with appetite suppression in a low energy diet and to determine the impact
      of a higher carbohydrate intake on appetite suppression, ketosis, body composition, and
      resting metabolic rate. 100 participants enrolled into this three-armed randomized controlled
      trial, where they were allocated into consume a low (70 gram), medium (100 gram) and high
      (130 gram) carbohydrate isocaloric diet of 1000 kilocalories for 8 weeks followed by 4 weeks
      of weight stabilization. Participants were followed up on a weekly basis for a period of 12
      weeks.

    <description>Assessed by an online version of Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), a validated scale used to measure appetite sensations in response to questions posed regarding feelings of hunger, fullness, desire to eat, prospective consumption. Study participants are asked questions such as 'How hungry do you feel right now?' and are asked to provide a response by marking across a 100 millimeter long line with sentences anchored at each end such as &quot;I have never been more hungry/ or I am not hungry at all&quot; corresponding to their feeling. VAS measurements are done in fasting, immediately after a meal and every 30 minutes for 2.5 hours. Measurements are quantified by measuring the distance from the left end of the line to the mark indicated by the participant.</description>
