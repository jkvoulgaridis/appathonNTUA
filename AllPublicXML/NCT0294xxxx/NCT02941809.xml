  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Methadone maintenance can be very helpful for treatment of addiction to opioid drugs. This
      sub-study of an on-going clinical trial attempts to understand the occurrence of co-morbid
      psychiatric symptoms, such as depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD),
      and how these factors may influence methadone treatment outcomes.

    <measure>Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scale</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Day</time_frame>
    <description>The Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scale is a 7-item screen designed to identify individuals with probable Anxiety. Each item is scored with a score between 0 and 3 (Not at all sure= 0; Several days= 1; Over half the days= 2; Nearly every day= 3), yielding a total between 0 and 21.</description>

    <description>The PHQ-9 Patient Depression Questionnaire is a 9-item screen designed to identify individuals with probable Depression. Each item is scored with a score between 0 and 3 (Not at all= 0; Several days= 1; More than half the days= 2; Nearly every day= 3), yielding a total between 1 and 27.</description>

    <time_frame>1 Day</time_frame>
    <description>The Primary Care PTSD Screen for DSM-5 (PC-PTSD-5) is a 5-item screen designed to identify individuals with probable PTSD. A cut-point of 3 on the PC-PTSD-5 (e.g., respondent answers &quot;yes&quot; to any 3 of 5 questions about how the traumatic event(s) have affected them over the past month) is optimally sensitive to probable PTSD.</description>

      Urine drug screening occurs via two methods: (1) a point of care Quik-tox screen (11 panel;
      LabCorp) (2) and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) testing for a
      panel of &gt;240 drugs, including new psychoactive substances, as well as other illicit and
      prescription drugs.
