  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with the aim of determining the cultural
      sensitivity, feasibility, and effectiveness of an expressive writing intervention for Chinese
      breast cancer survivors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study examines the potential health benefits (i.e., physical health, psychological
      health, and quality of life) of this expressive writing intervention for Chinese-speaking
      breast cancer survivors. The study also explores the mechanism through which expressive
      writing confers health benefits and investigates who will benefit most from the expressive
      writing intervention. Chinese-speaking breast cancer survivors who have completed primary
      treatment will be randomly assigned to a control writing condition, a self-regulation
      condition, or a enhanced self-regulation writing condition. Health outcomes are assessed at
      baseline, and 1, 3, and 6 months follow-ups. Mixed qualitative-quantitative mixed methods are
      used to explore the effect of the intervention on health outcomes and explore the mechanisms
      that explain the benefits of this intervention.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in quality of life score as assessed by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Scale (FACT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months follow-ups after the intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Scale (FACT) is a 27-item measure of health-related quality of life (Cella &amp; Tulsky,1993), which assesses perceived life quality in four different facets, including physical well-being (7 items,score range 0 - 28), social well-being (7 items, score range 0 - 28), emotional well-being (6 items, score range 0-24), and functional well-being (7 items, score range 0-28). A higher subscale score indicates better functioning in the corresponding domain.
Total score is computed by summing up the scores of the four subscales. Total score ranges from 0 to 108. A higher score indicates better quality of life.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), as assessed by the PTSD Symptom Scale - Self Report version (PSS-SR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months follow-ups after the intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>The scale contains 17 items reflecting the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fourth Edition -Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (Foa, Riggs, Dancu, &amp; Rothbaum, 1993).
Score can be reported in terms of total score or the score of the three subscales (Re-experiencing, Avoidance and Hyperarousal).
The score ranges for the three sub-scales are: Re-experiencing symptoms (5 items, 0-15), Avoidance symptoms (7 items, 0 -21) and Hyperarousal symptoms (5 items, 0-15). Each subscale score is computed by summing up the scores of the corresponding items. For each subscale, a higher score indicates more severe symptoms.
The total score is computed by summing up the scores of the three subscales. The total score ranges from 0 to 51. A higher score indicated more severe PTSD symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in fatigue as assessed by Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue Scale (FACIT-F)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months follow-ups after the intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>The scale contains 13 items. Total score is computed by summing up the scores of all the 13 items. The total score ranges from 0 to 52. A higher score indicates more severe fatigue symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in depressive symptoms as assessed by Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D).</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months follow-ups after the intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>The scale contains 10 items. Total score is computed by summing up the scores of all the 10 items. Total score ranges from 0 to 30. A higher scores indicates more severe depression symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in anxiety as assessed by Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI)-anxiety dimension</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months follow-ups after the intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>The scale contains 6 items. Total score is computed by summing up the scores of all the 6 items. Total score ranges from 0 - 24. A higher score indicates more severe anxiety symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in physical symptoms as assessed by the Physical Symptoms Checklist</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months follow-ups after the intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>The scale contains 10 items. Total score is computed by summing up the scores of all the 10 items. Total score ranges from 0 - 300. A higher score indicates more severe physical symptoms.</description>
