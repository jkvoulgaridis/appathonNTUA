      Assessment of lymphatic structure and function pre- and post- treatment and during recovery
      in head and neck cancer related lymphedema patients using NIR fluorescence lymphatic imaging:
      Response to ICD therapy in HNC Patients.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A non-randomized, non-blinded, single site pilot study designed to assess whether
      near-infrared fluorescence imaging can report on the efficacy of a pneumatic compression
      device to move lymph in head and neck cancer survivors with resulting head and neck
      lymphedema.

    <description>Demonstrate the ability of the Flexitouch system to move lymph/enhance lymphatic uptake (indicated by increased functionality of vessels and/or changes in area of dermal backflow) as measured by Indocyanine Green (ICG) lymphography.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dermal Backflow Measured by ICG Lymphography.</measure>
    <time_frame>Single Treatment, 2 Weeks of Treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Resolves dermal backflow as measured by ICG lymphography. A positive change in area indicates an increase in observable abnormal lymphatics, while a negative change indicates a decrease in observable abnormal lymphatics. A positive increase after a single treatment is expected as the manual stimulation of the lymphatics promotes the movement of ICG through the lymphatic space; however, a decrease over time provides an indication of improved lymphatic recovery.</description>

A positive change in area indicates an increase in observable abnormal lymphatics, while a negative change indicates a decrease in observable abnormal lymphatics. A positive increase after a single treatment is expected as the manual stimulation of the lymphatics promotes the movement of ICG through the lymphatic space; however, a decrease over time provides an indication of improved lymphatic recovery.</description>
