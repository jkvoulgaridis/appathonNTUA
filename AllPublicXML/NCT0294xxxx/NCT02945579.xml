      This clinical trial studies eliminating surgery and how well radiation therapy after systemic
      therapy works in treating patients with HER2 positive or triple negative breast cancer when
      image-guided biopsy shows no residual cancer. Patients then receive standard breast
      radiotherapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the 6 months (mo), 1, 2, 3, and 5-year biopsy confirmed ipsilateral breast
      tumor recurrence rate (IBTR, invasive, and/or in situ) among patients who do not undergo
      surgery.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the number (%) of patients where final biopsy reveals residual disease and
      quantify the residual disease (residual cancer burden, RCB) determined by routine pathologic
      examination of surgery specimens.

      II. To assess baseline, 6 months, 1, 3, and 5 years decisional comfort of clinical trial
      participation using the Decisional Regret Scale (DRS).

      III. To determine patient-reported cosmetic outcome, breast pain, and functional status using
      the Breast Cancer Treatment Outcomes Scale (BCTOS) at baseline, 6 months, 1, 3, and 5 years.

      IV. To determine the 6 mo, 1, 2, 3, and 5-year incidence of ipsilateral breast and nodal
      recommendation and performance of biopsy based on breast imaging follow-up.

      V. Correlate &quot;liquid biopsy&quot; analyses (after neoadjuvant systemic therapy [NST], 6 months and
      one year postradiotherapy or surgery) among protocol participants with pathologic complete
      response (pCR), utilizing circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and circulating
      tumor-deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (ctDNA).

      VI. Among patients who decide to proceed with routine surgery, record the results of final
      biopsy compared with routine pathologic examination of surgery specimens.

      VII. To determine patient-reported quality of life using the Functional Assessment of Cancer
      Therapy-Breast version 4 (FACT B+4) instrument at baseline, 6 months, 1, 3, and 5 years after
      treatment.

      OUTLINE:

      Within 12 weeks of completing neoadjuvant systemic therapy, patients undergo whole breast
      irradiation over 15-25 fractions on consecutive days. Patients then undergo external beam
      radiation therapy (EBRT) boost over 7 fractions on consecutive days beginning the day
      following completion of whole breast irradiation.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 5 years.

             clinical stage T1 or T2 (=&lt; 5 cm), N0 or N1 (=&lt; 4 abnormal axillary nodes on initial
             ultrasound), clinical stage M0

          -  HER2 positive (immunohistochemistry [IHC] 3+ and or fluorescence in situ hybridization

             receiving any standard routine clinical NST regimen

          -  Patient desires breast conserving therapy

          -  Age 40 years or older; this age cutoff is justified because breast cancers in women
             under the age of 40 are known to have a significantly higher risk of IBTR presumably
             due to underlying biologic differences

          -  Female sex

          -  If the patient has a history of a prior non-breast cancer, all treatment for this
             cancer must have been completed prior to study registration and the patient must have
             no evidence of disease for this prior non-breast cancer

          -  Patient must have an initial nodal ultrasound that does not demonstrate more than four
             suspicious lymph nodes, any suspicious lymph nodes should be biopsied to determine if
             nodal metastatic disease present

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Radiologic evidence for a stage T3 or clinical stage T4 breast cancer

          -  Clinical or pathologic evidence for distant metastases

          -  Prior diagnosis of invasive or ductal carcinoma in situ breast cancer in the
             ipsilateral breast

          -  Clinical evidence of progression of disease &gt; 20% in the breast or new evidence of
             nodal metastases

          -  Patient is known to be pregnant

          -  Patient is participating in a NST protocol in which surgical excision of the breast
             and or lymph nodes are required
