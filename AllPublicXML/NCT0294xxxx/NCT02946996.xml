  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to look at the effect that the study drug OPC has on AGE levels
      in patients with prostate cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AGEs are a type of metabolite, or substance, found in the food. The AGE content in food is
      determined by the types of food you eat and also how you prepare your food. The researchers
      helping conduct this study have found a potential link between AGE levels and cancer. The
      purpose of this study is to see if Oligomeric Procyanidin Complex (OPC) has an effect on the
      AGE levels in your blood and to see if those AGE levels have an effect on your cancer.

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Confirmation of adenocarcinoma of the prostate that is documented by one of the
             following: pathology report or clinic note with documented history of prostate cancer.

          2. Subjects must be receiving ADT with a GnRH agonist or antagonist, with or without an
             anti-androgen, with a current testosterone level documented to be &lt;50ng/dL at
             enrollment. Subjects whose ADT is interrupted may enroll or continue on study as long
             as the testosterone is documented to remain &lt;50ng/dL for the entire duration of study
             participation. Subjects who have undergone orchiectomy are also eligible.

          3. Prior cytotoxic chemotherapy for metastatic prostate cancer; prior treatment with
             genomically-targeted agents, or Provenge is allowed.

          4. Subjects must have adequate hematologic, renal, and hepatic function at baseline, as
             follows:

               -  Hematology parameters: ANC &gt;1000/mcL, platelets &gt; 100,000/mcL, Hgb &gt;8.0gm/dL

               -  Renal Function: eGFR of &gt; 45mls/min using Cockkroft and Gault formula (see
                  appendix C).

               -  Liver Function: Total bilirubin â‰¤ULN, AST and ALT &lt;1.5xULN

          5. Able to swallow and retain oral medication

          8. Testosterone level &lt;50ng/dL

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Known allergy to grapes or grape seed

          2. History of receiving more than 2 classes of ADT.

          3. Current use of strong antioxidants (extracts from grape seed, milk thistle; pine bark,
