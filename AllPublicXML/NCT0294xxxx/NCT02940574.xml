  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current trial aims to explore the neural and behavioral effects of oxytocin in autism
      spectrum disorders (ASD). Oxytocin is a nonapeptide produced by the paraventricular and
      supraoptic nuclei of the hypothalamus and is known to play a pivotal role in a variety of
      complex social behaviors. Initial studies showed that intranasal administration of oxytocin
      can have a positive effect on social functioning in ASD.

      However, future studies are necessary to explore whether and how oxytocin effects neural
      processes in the brain underlying these behavioral improvements. This trial will not only
      measure behavioral enhancements, but will specifically focus on elucidating the associated
      neurophysiological changes by guiding the administration of oxytocin with regular
      neurophysiological assessments.

      The present study is a monocentric, between-subjects, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.
      The investigators will recruit approximately 40 young-adult, male individuals with a clinical
      diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Participants will be randomly allocated to an
      experimental group (Oxytocin (OT)) and a control group (Placebo (PL)). All participants will
      receive the same frequency and duration of intervention. Behavioral and neural outcome
      measures will be assessed at multiple time points in a period of a year. Participants will be
      tested at 5 occasions: before and after a single dose of nasal spray, after multiple doses of
      nasal spray (1 daily dose of nasal spray during 4 weeks), after a 4-week retention period and
      after a 1-year retention period. At each time point participants will be tested at both the
      behavioral and neural level. Test performance of both participant groups (OT vs PL) will be
      compared by measuring reaction times and accuracy rates in a computerized task assessing a
      person's ability to recognize bodily emotional states from point light displays. In addition,
      attachment, social functioning, restricted behaviour, general quality of life and mood will
      be assessed via self-reported questionnaires.

      Functional MRI measurements will be performed in a 3T MR Philips Intera scanner. Before
      scanning, subjects will undergo a training session to familiarize them with the task
      instructions. In addition to the fMRI measurements, resting state fMRI and Diffusion Tensor
      Imaging (DTI) will also be performed to reveal alterations of the functional and structural
      connectivity between critical regions.

      Statistical analysis of the behavioral data will have a between-subject factor of group (OT
      vs PL) and within-subject factors of time (change-from-baseline). Image analysis will be
      performed with Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) software. The investigators will contrast
      for either decreased or increased activation, as different regions may show divergent changes
      due to the received nasal spray (either OT or PL).

This instrument comprises emotional adjectives subdivided in five domains: tension (6 items). depression (8 items). vigor (5 items). fatigue (6 items) and anger (7 items) which have to be rated on a five-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all), 1 (a little), 2 (moderately), 3 (quite a lot), to 4 (extremely). Only for the vigor scale, higher scores indicate improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Informant-based/ Self-report Scores on Questionnaires Assessing Attachment, Social Functioning, Quality of Life and Mood After 4 Weeks of Nasal Spray</title>
        <description>The Social Responsiveness Scale (for adults) (SRS-A) uses a four-point Likert-scale. Higher scores indicate lower social responsiveness.
The Repetitive Behavior Scale - Revised (RBS-R) uses a four-point Likert-scale. Higher scores indicate a higher frequency and/or higher severity of restricted and repetitive behaviors.
The State Adult Attachment Measure (SAAM) uses a seven-point Likert-scale.Higher scores indicate lower perceived secure attachment on the attachment avoidance and attachment anxiety subscales, and higher perceived secure attachment on the attachment security subscale.
Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment (IPPA) uses a four-point Likert-scale. Higher scores indicate indicate increased feelings of secure attachment towards peers or parents.
World Health Organization Quality of Life - Bref (WHO-QL) uses a five-point Likert scale. Higher scores indicate better quality of life.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Informant-based/ Self-report Scores on Questionnaires Assessing Attachment, Social Functioning, Quality of Life and Mood After 8 Weeks, Including 4 Weeks Without Nasal Spray</title>
        <description>The Social Responsiveness Scale (for adults) (SRS-A) uses a four-point Likert-scale. Higher scores indicate lower social responsiveness.
The Repetitive Behavior Scale - Revised (RBS-R) uses a four-point Likert-scale. Higher scores indicate a higher frequency and/or higher severity of restricted and repetitive behaviors.
The State Adult Attachment Measure (SAAM) uses a seven-point Likert-scale.Higher scores indicate lower perceived secure attachment on the attachment avoidance and attachment anxiety subscales, and higher perceived secure attachment on the attachment security subscale.
Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment (IPPA) uses a four-point Likert-scale. Higher scores indicate indicate increased feelings of secure attachment towards peers or parents.
World Health Organization Quality of Life - Bref (WHO-QL) uses a five-point Likert scale. Higher scores indicate better quality of life.

        <description>The Social Responsiveness Scale (for adults) (SRS-A) uses a four-point Likert-scale. Higher scores indicate lower social responsiveness.
The Repetitive Behavior Scale - Revised (RBS-R) uses a four-point Likert-scale. Higher scores indicate a higher frequency and/or higher severity of restricted and repetitive behaviors.
The State Adult Attachment Measure (SAAM) uses a seven-point Likert-scale.Higher scores indicate lower perceived secure attachment on the attachment avoidance and attachment anxiety subscales, and higher perceived secure attachment on the attachment security subscale.
Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment (IPPA) uses a four-point Likert-scale. Higher scores indicate indicate increased feelings of secure attachment towards peers or parents.
World Health Organization Quality of Life - Bref (WHO-QOL) uses a five-point Likert scale. Higher scores indicate better quality of life.

        <description>Change from baseline in scores on one questionnaire assessing mood (Profile of Mood States - POMS) after a single dose of nasal spray.
This instrument comprises emotional adjectives subdivided in five domains: tension (6 items). depression (8 items). vigor (5 items). fatigue (6 items) and anger (7 items) which have to be rated on a five-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all), 1 (a little), 2 (moderately), 3 (quite a lot), to 4 (extremely). Only for the vigor scale, higher scores indicate improvement.</description>
