  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Constipation is a known complication of the postoperative period after spinal surgery, where
      prescription pain medicines called opioids are traditionally used in high doses for the
      treatment of surgery-related pain. The goal of this study is to determine the effectiveness
      of Movantik (naloxegol)—a FDA-approved drug used to treat constipation that is caused by
      opioids—in preventing constipation in patients undergoing spinal fusion surgery at MGH.

    <textblock>
      We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial at a single, academic
      tertiary center (Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA) from 2017 to 2018. Adult male
      and female patients between the ages of 18 and 80 who were planned to undergo non-urgent,
      elective posterior-approach spinal fusion surgeries by the Department of Neurosurgery were
      eligible for inclusion. Of note, patients with preexisting opioid and/or laxative use were
      still considered eligible and patients were not stratified according to these
      characteristics. Once a surgeon and the patient made a joint decision to proceed with
      elective, posterior spinal fusion surgery, patients would be approached by study personnel,
      with all eligible patients recruited independently of their surgeon to ensure no conflict of
      interest. After informed consent, eligible patients provided baseline demographic information
      including age, sex, race, pre-operative laxative use, and pre-operative opioid use. In
      addition, subjects completed a Bowel Function Index (BFI), a validated measure of
      opioid-induced constipation.10 Patients were not instructed to alter their daily regimen from
      time of consent to initiation of the study. On the day prior to scheduled surgery, clinical
      research pharmacy staff randomized subjects in a 1:1 ratio. With the exception of the
      pharmacist preparing the study drug or placebo, who was unaffiliated with the investigators
      or study sponsor, the individual treatment assignment was unknown to study staff, patients,
      sponsors, and clinical treatment teams.

      Upon completion of surgery, post operative care unit nurses administered 25 mg of oral
      naloxegol (12.5 mg for creatinine clearance of &lt;60 mL/min) or an identical placebo within 2
      hours of arrival in the recovery room post-operatively and then every 24 hours thereafter

    <description>The primary endpoint of the study was time to first post-operative bowel movement, as defined by the first spontaneous bowel movement reported by nursing staff after transfer from the surgical suite to the inpatient floor. A bowel movement was defined as the spontaneous passage of one tablespoon or more of liquid or solid stool (excluding flatus), which could be measured and verified by nursing staff. Time was measured in hours post-operatively with the starting time point marked at the end of the surgical procedure.</description>

    <measure>Time to Rescue Laxative Medication Use During Hospitalization</measure>
    <time_frame>upon discharge from hospital, an average of 5 days</time_frame>
    <description>The use of a rescue laxative medication is defined as the administration of an additional bowel medication due to a decision by the clinical treatment team that the subject suffered from constipation and required a &quot;rescue&quot; bowel medication. Of note, this medication did not include the study drug, placebo, or the standing laxative orders used in all patient (docusate and sennosides). By definition, a rescue medication could only be given before a subject's first bowel movement or discharge</description>

        <description>The primary endpoint of the study was time to first post-operative bowel movement, as defined by the first spontaneous bowel movement reported by nursing staff after transfer from the surgical suite to the inpatient floor. A bowel movement was defined as the spontaneous passage of one tablespoon or more of liquid or solid stool (excluding flatus), which could be measured and verified by nursing staff. Time was measured in hours post-operatively with the starting time point marked at the end of the surgical procedure.</description>

            <description>Subjects in the treatment group will be administered MOVANTIK™ (naloxegol) 25 mg tablet or placebo once daily beginning 2 hours after the completion of their surgery until their discharge from the hospital (variable timing). Subjects with renal impairments (creatine clearance rate of less than 60 mL/min) will receive a 12.5 mg dose tablet of naloxegol in place of the 25 mg dose as advised by FDA guidelines. For patients who are unable to swallow the tablet whole, the tablet can be crushed and given orally or administered via nasogastric tube.
