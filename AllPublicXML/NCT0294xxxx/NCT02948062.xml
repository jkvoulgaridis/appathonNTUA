  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this single institution study is to evaluate boys with adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD)
      diagnosed early in life, and to prospectively monitor them to determine parameters that will
      facilitate earlier detection of the childhood cerebral form of the disease. These at-risk
      subjects will be assessed yearly through travel to the University of Minnesota, where plasma
      and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) biomarker studies, MRI based imaging and neuropsychological
      assessments will be performed at the University of Minnesota Masonic Children's Hospital and
      Clinics. The MRI and lumbar puncture to obtain CSF will be obtained under sedation. In
      addition, at intervening 6 months intervals information will be obtained remotely, including
      surveys and MRI's in their home location. Also at that time blood samples will be obtained
      locally and shipped to the University of Minnesota for study. There is no therapeutic intent
      in this study.

        While this study will be registered with clinicaltrials.gov, no specific patient
        recruitment materials will be utilized. However, various Foundations and Patient Groups
        will be contacted. In addition, we will work with providers, neurologists, genetic
        counselors, etc. in the areas where newborn screening is taking place. We will also be
        available for families and providers at other institutions where a diagnosis may be made.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Boys with confirmed adrenoleukodystrophy, as determined by very long chain fatty acid
             (VLCFA) analysis and/or genotyping. Genotyping is not necessary for diagnosis.

          -  Between 1 and 5 years of age, inclusive at the time of consent.

          -  Able to undergo a sedation

          -  English as primary language of the household, to maximize consistency of the
             neuropsychological/developmental testing.

          -  Voluntary written parental/guardian consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence of cerebral disease at time of enrollment - patients over 3 years of age must
             have an MRI within 4 months of signing consent to confirm that there is no evidence of
             cerebral disease

          -  Inability or unwillingness to travel to the University of Minnesota once a year for
             the duration of the study

          -  Evidence of cerebral disease by standard T2/FLAIR MRI. If a subject develops cerebral
             ALD during the study, they will come off study, as it is anticipated that they would
             be considered for transplantation.
