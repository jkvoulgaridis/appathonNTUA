  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators have compared the clinical outcomes of the laparoscopic and
      open right hemicolectomy within enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) programs in the
      treatment of right-sided colon cancer.

      This study was a prospective, single-center, randomized control trial. Including criteria
      were (1) Age between 18 and 75 years; (2) Histologically confirmed right-sided colon
      adenocarcinoma；(3) Clinical stage I-III; (4) Performance status (ECOG) 0-1; (5) Adequate
      hematological, hepatic and renal function. Patients operated on as an emergency, or with
      tumours in the transverse colon, or with other previous malignancy within 5 years were
      excluded.

      All particapants were recruited and randomly assigned to receive 3D-laproscopic or open right
      hemicoloectomy. All patients were treated with an ERAS protocol. The primary end-point was
      the incidence of postoperative complications within 30 days. Complications were diagnosed and
      classified according to the Clavien-Dindo classification. The secondary end-points were ERAS
      adherence, readmissions, reoperations, hospital length of stay, mortality, and survivals. The
      study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai,
      China. Written informed consent was obtained for patients to participate the study. This
      study followed the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) reporting guideline.
