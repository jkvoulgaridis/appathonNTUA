    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine if SAGE-547 Injection infused intravenously at up
      to 90 micrograms per kilogram per hour (μg/kg/h) for 60 hours reduces depressive symptoms in
      participants with severe postpartum depression (PPD) compared to placebo injection as
      assessed by the change from baseline in Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) total
      score.

    <measure>Change From Baseline at Key Time Points in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Hour 60, Days 7 and 30</time_frame>
    <description>The MADRS is a ten-item diagnostic questionnaire which psychiatrists use to measure the severity of depressive episodes in participants with mood disorders. It was designed as an adjunct to the HAM-D, to be more sensitive than the Hamilton Scale to the changes brought on by antidepressants and other forms of treatment. Each item yielded a score of 0 to 6. The MADRS total score was calculated as the sum of the 10 individual item scores, which ranged from 0 to 60. Higher MADRS scores indicates more severe depression. A negative change from baseline indicates less severe depression. A positive change from baseline indicates more severe depression.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Clinical Global Impression - Improvement (CGI-I) Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Hour 60, Days 7 and 30</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-I item employs a 7-point Likert scale to measure the overall improvement in the participant's condition post-treatment. The investigator rated the participant's total improvement whether or not it was due entirely to drug treatment. Response choices include: 0 = not assessed, 1 = very much improved, 2 = much improved, 3 = minimally improved, 4 = no change, 5 = minimally worse, 6 = much worse, and 7 = very much worse. The CGI-I was only rated at post-treatment assessments. By definition, all CGI-I assessments were evaluated against baseline conditions. CGI-I response was defined as having a score of 1 (very much improved) or 2 (much improved).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item Scale (GAD-7) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Hour 60, Days 7, 14, 21 and 30</time_frame>
    <description>The GAD-7 is a participant-rated, generalized anxiety symptom severity scale. Scoring for GAD-7 generalized anxiety is calculated by assigning scores of 0 = &quot;not at all sure,&quot; 1 = &quot;several days,&quot; 2 = &quot;over half the days,&quot; and 3 = &quot;nearly every day&quot; to the response categories. The GAD-7 total score for the seven items ranges from 0 to 21, where a score of 0 to 4 = minimal anxiety, 5 to 9 = mild anxiety, 10 to 14 = moderate anxiety, and 15 to 21 = severe anxiety. The GAD-7 total score was calculated as the sum of the seven individual item scores. A negative change from baseline indicates less anxiety. A positive change from baseline indicates more anxiety.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 37 days.</time_frame>
    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A treatment-emergent AE (TEAE) is defined as an AE with onset on or after the start of study drug infusion, or any worsening of a pre-existing medical condition/AE with onset on or after the start of study drug infusion.</description>

          <title>Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) Total Score</title>
          <description>The HAM-D Total Score comprises a sum of the 17 individual item scores. Items scored in a range of 0 to 2 include: insomnia (early, middle, late), somatic symptoms (gastrointestinal and general), genital symptoms, loss of weight, and insight. The following items are scored in a range of 0 to 4: agitation, depressed mood, feelings of guilt, suicide, work and activities, retardation, anxiety (psychic and somatic), and hypochondriasis. The Total Score can range from 0 to 52, and higher scores indicate a greater degree of depression.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in HAM-D Total Score</title>
          <description>The HAM-D Total Score comprises a sum of the 17 individual item scores. Items scored in a range of 0 to 2 include: insomnia (early, middle, late), somatic symptoms (gastrointestinal and general), genital symptoms, loss of weight, and insight. The following items are scored in a range of 0 to 4: agitation, depressed mood, feelings of guilt, suicide, work and activities, retardation, anxiety (psychic and somatic), and hypochondriasis. The Total Score can range from 0 to 52, and higher scores indicate a greater degree of depression. Higher scores indicate a greater degree of depression. A negative change from baseline indicates less depression. A positive change from baseline indicates more depression.</description>
          <population>All randomized participants who started study drug infusion, had a valid baseline HAM-D assessment and at least one post-baseline HAM-D assessment. Number analyzed is the number of participants with data available for analysis at the given time point.</population>

        <description>The HAM-D response is defined as having a 50% or greater reduction from baseline in HAM-D total score. The HAM-D Total Score comprises a sum of the 17 individual item scores. Items scored in a range of 0 to 2 include: insomnia (early, middle, late), somatic symptoms (gastrointestinal and general), genital symptoms, loss of weight, and insight. The following items are scored in a range of 0 to 4: agitation, depressed mood, feelings of guilt, suicide, work and activities, retardation, anxiety (psychic and somatic), and hypochondriasis. The Total Score can range from 0 to 52, and higher scores indicate a greater degree of depression. Higher scores indicate a greater degree of depression. A negative change from baseline indicates less depression. A positive change from baseline indicates more depression.</description>

        <description>The HAM-D remission is defined as having a HAM-D total score of ≤7. The HAM-D Total Score comprises a sum of the 17 individual item scores. Items scored in a range of 0 to 2 include: insomnia (early, middle, late), somatic symptoms (gastrointestinal and general), genital symptoms, loss of weight, and insight. The following items are scored in a range of 0 to 4: agitation, depressed mood, feelings of guilt, suicide, work and activities, retardation, anxiety (psychic and somatic), and hypochondriasis. The Total Score can range from 0 to 52, and higher scores indicate a greater degree of depression. Higher scores indicate a greater degree of depression. A negative change from baseline indicates less depression. A positive change from baseline indicates more depression.</description>

        <description>The HAM-D Bech 6 subscale score is calculated as the sum of the following six items: Item # 1 (depressed mood), Item # 2 (feelings of guilt), Item # 7 (work and activities), Item # 8 (retardation), Item # 10 (anxiety psychic), and Item # 13 (general somatic symptoms). Each item is scored in a range of 0 to 2 or 0 to 4, with higher scores indicating a greater degree of depression. The scores were transformed to a 100-point scale with a higher score indicating a greater degree of depression. A negative change from baseline indicates less depression. A positive change from baseline indicates more depression.</description>

          <description>The HAM-D Bech 6 subscale score is calculated as the sum of the following six items: Item # 1 (depressed mood), Item # 2 (feelings of guilt), Item # 7 (work and activities), Item # 8 (retardation), Item # 10 (anxiety psychic), and Item # 13 (general somatic symptoms). Each item is scored in a range of 0 to 2 or 0 to 4, with higher scores indicating a greater degree of depression. The scores were transformed to a 100-point scale with a higher score indicating a greater degree of depression. A negative change from baseline indicates less depression. A positive change from baseline indicates more depression.</description>
          <population>All randomized participants who started study drug infusion, had a valid baseline HAM-D assessment and at least one post-baseline HAM-D assessment. Number analyzed is the number of participants with data available for analysis at the given time point.</population>

        <description>The HAM-D comprises individual ratings of the following symptoms scored in a range of 0 to 2: insomnia (early, middle, late), somatic symptoms (gastrointestinal and general), genital symptoms, loss of weight, and insight. The following symptoms are scored in a range of 0 to 4: agitation, depressed mood, feelings of guilt, suicide, work and activities, retardation, anxiety (psychic and somatic), and hypochondriasis. Higher scores indicate a greater degree of depression. A negative change from baseline indicates less depression. A positive change from baseline indicates more depression.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline at Key Time Points in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) Total Score</title>
        <description>The MADRS is a ten-item diagnostic questionnaire which psychiatrists use to measure the severity of depressive episodes in participants with mood disorders. It was designed as an adjunct to the HAM-D, to be more sensitive than the Hamilton Scale to the changes brought on by antidepressants and other forms of treatment. Each item yielded a score of 0 to 6. The MADRS total score was calculated as the sum of the 10 individual item scores, which ranged from 0 to 60. Higher MADRS scores indicates more severe depression. A negative change from baseline indicates less severe depression. A positive change from baseline indicates more severe depression.</description>

        <population>All randomized participants who started study drug infusion, had a valid baseline HAM-D assessment and at least one post-baseline HAM-D assessment. Number analyzed is the number of participants with data available for analysis at the given time point.</population>

        <description>The CGI-I item employs a 7-point Likert scale to measure the overall improvement in the participant's condition post-treatment. The investigator rated the participant's total improvement whether or not it was due entirely to drug treatment. Response choices include: 0 = not assessed, 1 = very much improved, 2 = much improved, 3 = minimally improved, 4 = no change, 5 = minimally worse, 6 = much worse, and 7 = very much worse. The CGI-I was only rated at post-treatment assessments. By definition, all CGI-I assessments were evaluated against baseline conditions. CGI-I response was defined as having a score of 1 (very much improved) or 2 (much improved).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item Scale (GAD-7) Total Score</title>
        <description>The GAD-7 is a participant-rated, generalized anxiety symptom severity scale. Scoring for GAD-7 generalized anxiety is calculated by assigning scores of 0 = &quot;not at all sure,&quot; 1 = &quot;several days,&quot; 2 = &quot;over half the days,&quot; and 3 = &quot;nearly every day&quot; to the response categories. The GAD-7 total score for the seven items ranges from 0 to 21, where a score of 0 to 4 = minimal anxiety, 5 to 9 = mild anxiety, 10 to 14 = moderate anxiety, and 15 to 21 = severe anxiety. The GAD-7 total score was calculated as the sum of the seven individual item scores. A negative change from baseline indicates less anxiety. A positive change from baseline indicates more anxiety.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item Scale (GAD-7) Total Score</title>
          <description>The GAD-7 is a participant-rated, generalized anxiety symptom severity scale. Scoring for GAD-7 generalized anxiety is calculated by assigning scores of 0 = &quot;not at all sure,&quot; 1 = &quot;several days,&quot; 2 = &quot;over half the days,&quot; and 3 = &quot;nearly every day&quot; to the response categories. The GAD-7 total score for the seven items ranges from 0 to 21, where a score of 0 to 4 = minimal anxiety, 5 to 9 = mild anxiety, 10 to 14 = moderate anxiety, and 15 to 21 = severe anxiety. The GAD-7 total score was calculated as the sum of the seven individual item scores. A negative change from baseline indicates less anxiety. A positive change from baseline indicates more anxiety.</description>

        <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A treatment-emergent AE (TEAE) is defined as an AE with onset on or after the start of study drug infusion, or any worsening of a pre-existing medical condition/AE with onset on or after the start of study drug infusion.</description>
