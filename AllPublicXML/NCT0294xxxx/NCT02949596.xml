  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of anal cancer has been always linked to quality of life. Recently, with
      development on radiotherapy technique, toxicities have been lowered with the maintenance of
      adequate rates of disease control. This trial intends to follow patients prospectively with
      questionnaires to evaluate sexual quality of life among patients who are who men who have sex
      with other men and have been subject to concurrent chemoradiotherapy with IMRT technique.

  <detailed_description>

      In this prospective single-arm cohort, patients who are men who have sex with other men will
      be recruited to answer routine questionnaires on quality of life in general and sexual
      quality of life in specific, most validated and other waiting for validation in Portuguese
      language. These questionnaires will be applied after the diagnose and before the beginning of
      the treatment, on the last day of treatment, and 3, 6 and 12 months after the treatment is
      completed. Only patients who will be treated with concurrent chemotherapy will be recruited,
      and intensity-modulated radiotherapy technique is mandatory.
