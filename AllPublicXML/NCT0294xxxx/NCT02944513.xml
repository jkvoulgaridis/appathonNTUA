      Research Objectives: This is a 1-year trial designed to gather information about the use of
      the Quell for persons with chronic musculoskeletal low back pain. The investigators
      hypothesize that those assigned to using the device will report reduced back pain compared
      with those in the control condition; with those using the device also showing improvement in
      sleep, mood, and level of activity. The investigators hypothesize that frequency of using the
      Quell (increased tolerability and adherence) will be correlated with greater reduction in
      pain. The investigators hypothesize that the device will be safe to use and will demonstrate
      a reduction in healthcare utilization (reduced clinic and Emergency Department visits).
      Finally, based on preliminary analyses limited by few subject numbers, the investigators will
      investigate whether certain individuals report greater benefit from using the Quell than
      others and, in particular, would predict that those with more intense and longer duration of
      pain will demonstrate most benefit.

    <measure>Pain Intensity (Average)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Rate average pain intensity using visual analog scale on a scale of 0-10, where 0 is no pain and 10 is worst possible pain. Higher scores mean a worse outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Average Pain Interference</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>This measures the average pain interference with general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with others, sleep and enjoyment of life using visual analogue scale. On a scale of 0-10, 0 is no interference and 10 is extreme interference. Higher scores mean worse outcome.</description>

    <measure>Pain Disability Index</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Pain Disability Index (PDI) a simple and rapid instrument for measuring the impact that pain has on the ability of a person to participate in essential life activities. For each of the 7 categories of life activity listed, a score of 0 means no disability at all, and a score of 10 signifies that all of the activities in which you would normally be involved have been totally disrupted or prevented by your pain. The minimal index is 0 and maximal index is 70. The higher the index the greater the person's disability due to pain meaning a worse outcome.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Catastrophizing Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) has thirteen statements describing different thoughts and feelings that may be associated with pain. Using a 5-point scale from 0 (Not at all) to 4 (all the time), people indicate the degree to which they have these thoughts and feelings when they are experiencing pain. The sum has a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 52. Higher scores mean high levels of pain catastrophizing and worse outcome.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) is commonly used to determine the levels of anxiety and depression that a person is experiencing. The HADS is a fourteen item scale. Seven of the items relate to anxiety and seven relate to depression. Each item on the questionnaire is scored from 0-3 and this means that a person can score between 0 and 21 for either anxiety or depression. This outcome is a total score, which was calculated by adding the anxiety score and the depression score. Total score ranges from 0-42, with higher scores indicating a worse outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Post-study Helpfulness Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The questionnaire asked the participants to rate how helpful was the device for the low back pain on a scale of 0-10. 0 is not helpful at all and 10 is very helpful. Higher value means better outcome.</description>

        <description>The Pain Disability Index (PDI) a simple and rapid instrument for measuring the impact that pain has on the ability of a person to participate in essential life activities. For each of the 7 categories of life activity listed, a score of 0 means no disability at all, and a score of 10 signifies that all of the activities in which you would normally be involved have been totally disrupted or prevented by your pain. The minimal index is 0 and maximal index is 70. The higher the index the greater the person's disability due to pain meaning a worse outcome.</description>

        <description>Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) has thirteen statements describing different thoughts and feelings that may be associated with pain.

The sum has a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 52. Higher scores mean high levels of pain catastrophizing and worse outcome.</description>

        <title>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale Total Score</title>
        <description>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) is commonly used to determine the levels of anxiety and depression that a person is experiencing. The HADS is a fourteen item scale. Seven of the items relate to anxiety and seven relate to depression. Each item on the questionnaire is scored from 0-3 and this means that a person can score between 0 and 21 for either anxiety or depression. This outcome is a total score, which was calculated by adding the anxiety score and the depression score. Total score ranges from 0-42, with higher scores indicating a worse outcome.</description>

The HADS is a fourteen item scale. Seven of the items relate to anxiety and seven relate to depression. Each item on the questionnaire is scored from 0-3 and this means that a person can score between 0 and 21 for either anxiety or depression. This outcome is a total score, which was calculated by adding the anxiety score and the depression score. Total score ranges from 0-42, with higher scores indicating a worse outcome.</description>
          <population>For the experimental group, 35 subjects were consented, 4 subjects dropped out, 2 subjects did not complete the 3-month questionnaire, so 29 subjects were analyzed. For the control group, 33 subjects were consented, 1 subject dropped out, 1 subject did not complete the 3-month questionnaire, so 31 subjects were analyzed.</population>
