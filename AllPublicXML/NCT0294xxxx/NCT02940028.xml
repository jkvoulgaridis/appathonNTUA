  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ICU is a stressful and challenging place for patients and their families. Many family
      members experience anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder during and after
      their ICU experience. The investigators are studying post-traumatic growth in this study.
      Post-traumatic growth (PTG) is a set of positive changes that occurs after a challenging or
      difficult life experience. This study investigates the effects of expressive writing on
      positive changes that occur after a difficult experience. PTG will be compared between the
      intervention group receiving the expressive writing intervention and the control group
      (non-expressive or fact based writing).

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Family members of ICU patients are eligible for the study. We will enroll one study
        participant per patient admitted to a study ICU (Shock Trauma or Respiratory ICU at
        Intermountain Medical Center) who meets the following inclusion criteria:

          -  Participant can be a family member of a patient admitted to a study ICU for &gt;24 hours
             and ≥1 of the following:

               -  mechanical ventilation via endotracheal tube for ≥ 12 hours

               -  non-invasive ventilation (CPAP, BiPAP) for &gt; 4 hours in a 24-hour period provided
                  for acute respiratory failure in an ICU (not for obstructive sleep apnea or other
                  stable use)

               -  high flow nasal cannula or face mask O2 with FiO2 ≥ 0.5 for ≥4 hours

               -  use of vasopressors for shock of any etiology for &gt;1 hour

          -  Both participant and ICU patient must be adult (age ≥18 years of age)

          -  Participant must be able to read, speak, and write in English

          -  Participant must be enrolled within 72 hours of the patient's meeting mechanical
             ventilation criteria

        Participants who live with the patient will be accorded higher priority than those who do
        not live with the patient because they are more likely to be involved as caregivers. The
        preference would be for the participant to be the designated power of attorney; if there is
        no designated power of attorney living with the patient, then the primary informal
        caregiver (identified either by the patient or by the family) would be enrolled; if either
        of these is not available, the default surrogate (defined in figure 1) would be enrolled.
        If no one living with the patient meets these criteria, then family members and informal
        caregivers not living with the patient will be screened for the study. The preference would
        again be for first, the designated power of attorney, then a primary caregiver and a
        default surrogate. An informal caregiver provides care without reimbursement.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding females

          -  Prisoners

          -  Children (age &lt;18 years of age)

          -  Known history of PTSD, dementia, or schizophrenia. Presence of these illnesses will be
             per participant report of physician diagnosis and treatment

          -  If a patient has been transferred from another ICU after an ICU course greater than 24
             hours, or if the patient has had a previous ICU or long term acute care (LTAC)
             admission in the last 90 days, the family member or caregiver will be excluded.

          -  Patients admitted for hospice

          -  Participants who live more than 200 miles away or who have no specified domicile

          -  Non-English speaking
