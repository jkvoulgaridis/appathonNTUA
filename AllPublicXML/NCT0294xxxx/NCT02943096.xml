  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this proposal is to conduct the first pilot study of whether consuming flavanol
      supplements will augment the cognitive and mood benefits of antidepressant medication in
      older adults with Late LifeDepression (LLD). Flavanols represent a specific group of plant
      derived nutrients that are found in cocoa beans, grapes, tea, berries and various other
      fruits and vegetables. The specific flavanols investigated in this study come from cocoa.
      Currently available treatments for LLD (i.e., antidepressant medication) are limited in
      efficacy, especially in individuals who also suffer from cognitive impairment. Recent studies
      performed at Columbia and elsewhere suggest that flavanols may induce beneficial brain
      changes that support cognitive functioning and elevate mood, but their precise clinical
      effects in older adults with combined depression and cognitive impairment remain to be
      evaluated. For this study, the investigators plan to recruit 50 adults aged ≥60 years who
      have Major Depressive Disorder, meet a minimum depressive symptom threshold despite currently
      receiving an adequate trial of an antidepressant, and have a significant cognitive complaints
      without a diagnosis of dementia. Subjects will be randomized to receive 8 weeks of
      augmentation treatment with flavanol capsules (in addition to continuing their
      antidepressant) vs. capsules not containing flavanols. Pre- and post-treatment MRI scanning
      of the brain will be conducted, and comprehensive pre- and post-treatment neuropsychological
      assessment will be performed. Results from this project will allow the investigators to
      evaluate a novel therapeutic approach to LLD, which could have large public health
      ramifications given the prevalence, frequent treatment resistance, and chronicity
      characteristic of LLD.

    <textblock>
      The goal of this proposal is to conduct the first pilot study of whether consuming a diet
      high in flavanols will augment the cognitive and mood benefits of antidepressant medication
      in older adults with Late Life Depression (LLD). LLD affects 3% of community-dwelling adults
      over 60 years old, and 15% of older adults living in the community have clinically
      significant depressive symptoms. Diagnosis with LLD increases an older adult's risk of
      disability by 67-73% over 6 year follow up, causes twice the functional impairment compared
      to those without LLD, and is associated with high rates of completed suicide in individuals
      over 65. Currently available treatments for LLD (i.e., antidepressant medication) are limited
      in efficacy, leading to high rates of recurrence and frequent development of chronicity.
      Cognitive impairment, which is commonly associated with LLD, predicts poor acute response to
      antidepressants, leads to higher relapse rates during the continuation phase of treatment,
      and is associated with the development of adverse age-related health outcomes, including
      increased risk of dementia, dependence in activities of daily living (ADL), and driving
      cessation.

      Novel treatments addressing LLD's underlying neurobiology are critically needed, particularly
      therapies that may also have beneficial effects on the cognitive components of LLD. The most
      extensively studied brain region to be implicated in both the depressive and cognitive
      aspects of LLD has been the hippocampus. Decreased hippocampal volumes are found in depressed
      patients compared to controls, and this finding appears to be particularly pronounced in
      individuals with recurrent depressive illness. Among the subregions comprising the
      hippocampus, evidence suggests that it is decreased neurogenesis within the dentate gyrus
      (DG) specifically that may contribute to the development of depression, and it appears that
      part of the mechanism of action of antidepressants is to enhance neurogenesis in the DG. As
      the DG is also a critical contributor to the cognitive functions of the hippocampus, it
      stands out as a highly significant brain region that may be involved with both the mood and
      cognitive components of LLD.

    <time_frame>Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Scale for depressive symptoms administered by trained rater. The HRSD is the standard measure of depression severity for clinical trials of antidepressants and was chosen as the primary outcome measure over other depression rating scales to ensure compatibility of study results with our meta-analyses and ongoing studies of expectancy. Although the HRSD list 21 items, the scoring is based on the first 24 items. The minimum score is 0 and the maximum score is 74. The higher the number the worse outcome.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>First, participants had to complete an encoding task were they were shown 128 items, ½ objects(2 seconds) and ½ scene (3 seconds). Right after, they were given instructions on a video on how to do the test phase. They were instructed to identified the following images as &quot;old&quot;, &quot;similar&quot;, or &quot;new&quot;. They were then shown 192 items: 64 old items, 64 lures (similar), and 64 foil (new) for 2.5 seconds (objects)/3 seconds (scene). The images were intermixed during the test. The Lure Discrimination Index was calculated as the difference between the rate of &quot;similar&quot; responses give to lure items minus &quot;similar&quot; responses given to foil. This corrected for response bias. Correct responses are those that were identified correctly by the participant. A negative response means that the number of answered correctly was less that those answered incorrectly.</description>

    <measure>Modified-Benton Task (ModBent)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The ModBent assesses pattern separation, a measure of cognitive functioning. The task was created to measure dentate gyrus-dependent cognition. It shows participants patterns for 10 seconds, then presents two patterns afterwards on a different screen. Participants are then asked to determine which of the two patterns is the one they previously studied for 10 seconds. The second component of the task then goes through a series of patterns, one by one - the participant has to then decide whether each pattern was one they previously studied for 10 seconds or not. We analyzed the mean Reaction time for correct rejections.</description>

        <description>First, participants had to complete an encoding task were they were shown 128 items, ½ objects(2 seconds) and ½ scene (3 seconds). Right after, they were given instructions on a video on how to do the test phase. They were instructed to identified the following images as &quot;old&quot;, &quot;similar&quot;, or &quot;new&quot;. They were then shown 192 items: 64 old items, 64 lures (similar), and 64 foil (new) for 2.5 seconds (objects)/3 seconds (scene). The images were intermixed during the test. The Lure Discrimination Index was calculated as the difference between the rate of &quot;similar&quot; responses give to lure items minus &quot;similar&quot; responses given to foil. This corrected for response bias. Correct responses are those that were identified correctly by the participant. A negative response means that the number of answered correctly was less that those answered incorrectly.</description>

        <description>The ModBent assesses pattern separation, a measure of cognitive functioning. The task was created to measure dentate gyrus-dependent cognition. It shows participants patterns for 10 seconds, then presents two patterns afterwards on a different screen. Participants are then asked to determine which of the two patterns is the one they previously studied for 10 seconds. The second component of the task then goes through a series of patterns, one by one - the participant has to then decide whether each pattern was one they previously studied for 10 seconds or not. We analyzed the mean Reaction time for correct rejections.</description>

        <title>Modified-Benton Task (ModBent)</title>
        <description>The ModBent assesses pattern separation, a measure of cognitive functioning. The task was created to measure dentate gyrus-dependent cognition. It shows participants patterns for 10 seconds, then presents two patterns afterwards on a different screen. Participants are then asked to determine which of the two patterns is the one they previously studied for 10 seconds. The second component of the task then goes through a series of patterns, one by one - the participant has to then decide whether each pattern was one they previously studied for 10 seconds or not. We analyzed the mean Reaction time for correct rejections.</description>

        <title>Mnemonic Similarity Task (MST)</title>
        <description>First, participants had to complete an encoding task were they were shown 128 items, ½ objects(2 seconds) and ½ scene (3 seconds). Right after, they were given instructions on a video on how to do the test phase. They were instructed to identified the following images as &quot;old&quot;, &quot;similar&quot;, or &quot;new&quot;. They were then shown 192 items: 64 old items, 64 lures (similar), and 64 foil (new) for 2.5 seconds (objects)/3 seconds (scene). The images were intermixed during the test. The Lure Discrimination Index was calculated as the difference between the rate of &quot;similar&quot; responses give to lure items minus &quot;similar&quot; responses given to foil. This corrected for response bias. Correct responses are those that were identified correctly by the participant. A negative response means that the number of answered correctly was less that those answered incorrectly.</description>
