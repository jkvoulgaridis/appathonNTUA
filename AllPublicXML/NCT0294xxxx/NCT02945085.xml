  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study addresses how to achieve better outcomes for cognitively vulnerable
      community-dwelling older adults and their families. Cognitive vulnerability means living with
      dementia, depression, and/or a recent episode of delirium (the 3Ds). The investigators will
      test the effectiveness of a team care model focused on the 3Ds (Home Based Care Team) guided
      by nurse practitioners with expertise in geriatrics and geriatric psychiatry. Specific aims
      are to determine Home Based Care Team effects on hospitalization or emergency department use,
      and other outcomes including depression, disability, and quality of life.

      This study addresses how to achieve better outcomes for cognitively vulnerable
      community-dwelling older adults and their families. Cognitive vulnerability means living with
      dementia, depression, and/or a recent episode of delirium (the 3Ds). Cognitive vulnerability
      in older adults is often overlooked by primary care and hospital-based providers, and
      represents a marker for overall vulnerability or frailty often missed when disease-specific
      approaches are emphasized in the care for older adults. Such patients often cannot adequately
      self-manage their comorbidities. Many studies of older adults and their families have
      demonstrated the great burden of living with cognitive vulnerability. The investigators will
      test the effectiveness of a team care model focused on the 3Ds (Home Based Care Team) guided
      by nurse practitioners with geriatrics expertise. Other team member disciplines will include
      pharmacy, social work, occupational and physical therapy, nutrition, and community health
      worker. Long-term objectives are to determine whether this care model can become a widely
      available approach for improving healthcare systems for older adults with cognitive
      vulnerability and their families, while improving outcomes of importance to these patients
      and families. A project Steering Committee, including cognitively vulnerable patients and
      family caregivers, will provide extensive input into many aspects of the research process.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>GRID Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (GRID-HAMD), 17-item version.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>This measure yields a score for each individual reflecting both frequency and intensity of all depression-related symptoms included in the structured interview. This outcome will be used for study participants with depression but not dementia or recent episode of delirium at baseline. Individual scores will be aggregated into group mean scores to compare intervention and active comparator groups on this outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Caregiver Assessment of Function and Upset (CAFU)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>This measure yields a score for each individual reflecting level of assistance required to conduct 7 self-care activities of daily living (ADLs) and 8 instrumental ADLs. In a structured interview format, family members report these items for their relatives with dementia and/or a recent history of delirium. Individual scores will be aggregated into group mean scores to compare intervention and active comparator groups on this outcome.</description>

    <measure>Quality of Life-Alzheimer's Disease Scale (QOL-AD)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>This measure, used with individuals with dementia, yields a score for each individual reflecting self-ratings of poor, fair, good, or excellent on 13 items. Individual scores will be aggregated into group mean scores to compare intervention and active comparator groups on this outcome.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-C)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>This measure yields a single score that accounts for both frequency and severity of 14 neuropsychiatric symptoms. Family caregivers provide this information in a structured interview format. Individual scores will be aggregated into group mean scores to compare intervention and active comparator groups on this outcome.</description>

    <description>This measure will be used to determine severity of depression among family caregivers enrolled in the study.This measure yields a score for each individual reflecting frequency of 20 depression-related symptoms within the previous two weeks. Individual scores will be aggregated into group mean scores to compare intervention and active comparator groups on this outcome.</description>
