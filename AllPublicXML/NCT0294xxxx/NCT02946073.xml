  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase III, placebo-controlled, multicenter study with an enriched-enrollment
      withdrawal (EEW) design to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CAM2038 in opioid-experienced
      subjects with moderate to severe CLBP that requires continuous, around-the-clock (ATC) opioid
      treatment ≥ 40 mg morphine equivalent dose (MED). The study includes 5 phases: A Screening
      Phase (up to 2 weeks), a Transition Phase (up to 2 weeks), an Open-Label Titration Phase (up
      to 10 weeks), a Double-Blind Treatment Phase including a Final Study Visit (12 weeks), and a
      Follow-up Phase (4 weeks). The overall duration of participation in the core phase of the
      study (randomized Double-Blind Phase) is up to 30 weeks, from the Screening Phase through the
      Follow-up Phase. Subjects who complete the Double-Blind Treatment Study Phase will be offered
      an opportunity to continue treatment in an open label safety extension for up to 60 weeks.
      Additional subjects may be recruited to open label safety extension to meet the goal of 100
      subjects with 60 weeks of treatment.

             COWS ≥5 and an API pain score over the past 24 hours ≥5 in order to receive a test
             dose of Buprenex.

          2. Passed all baseline criteria, including a normal QTcF, had no change in QTcF &gt;30 ms at
             1 hour after the test dose with Buprenex, and had a COWS score &lt;5 after the test dose
             with Buprenex.

        Note:

          -  Subjects on BPN at Screening are required to participate in the down titration and
             will undergo a washout period prior to the test dose and first on-study treatment.
             Subjects entering the study on BPN will not transition to IR Morphine, but will

             desired washout period.

          -  Subjects on BPN at Screening are still required to follow the same Day 1 procedures
             (e.g., confirmation of pain scores, COWS assessment and Buprenex test dose) as non-BPN
             subjects.

        Criteria for Randomization into the Double-Blind Phase:

             least 2 points below the value at the start of Titration Phase) and is well tolerated
             for 7 days before randomization.

          3. Requires no more than an average of one hydrocodone/acetaminophen 5 mg/325 mg/day
