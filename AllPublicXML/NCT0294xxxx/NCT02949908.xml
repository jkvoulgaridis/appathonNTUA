    <measure>Treatment Satisfaction Score Determined With Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication Version II (TSQM v II)</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>TSQM v II is designed as a general measure of treatment satisfaction with medication, suitable for use across a wide variety of medication types and illness conditions. It consists 11 question items. Participants were asked to assess their level of satisfaction taking all things into account. Participants were to respond about their satisfaction or dissatisfaction with medication they are taking on a scale ranging from 1 to 7, where 1= Extremely Dissatisfied, 2=Very Dissatisfied, 3=Dissatisfied, 4=Somewhat Satisfied, 5=Satisfied, 6=Very Satisfied, 7=Extremely Satisfied.</description>

        <description>TSQM v II is designed as a general measure of treatment satisfaction with medication, suitable for use across wide variety of medication types and illness conditions. It consists 11 question items. Participants were asked to assess their level of satisfaction taking all things into account. Participants were to respond about their satisfaction or dissatisfaction with medication they are taking on a scale ranging 1-7, where 1=Extremely Dissatisfied, 2=Very Dissatisfied, 3=Dissatisfied, 4=Somewhat Satisfied, 5=Satisfied, 6=Very Satisfied, 7=Extremely Satisfied. ARR= number of relapses per year. Relapse= the appearance of a new clinical sign or symptom attributable to MS, or clinical worsening of a previous sign or symptom that had been stable for greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 30 days and that persisted for &gt;=24 hours without fever.</description>
        <time_frame>up to 12 months</time_frame>
        <population>Correlation analysis was not performed because the study was terminated prematurely due to low participants recruitment (only 2 participants enrolled), which did not allow performance of the planned correlation statistical analysis.</population>

Reasons of discontinuation of initial MS treatment were reported.</description>
          <population>Correlation analysis was not performed because the study was terminated prematurely due to low participants recruitment (only 2 participants enrolled), which did not allow performance of the planned correlation statistical analysis.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication Version II (TSQM v II) Subscale Score at Month 6 and Month 12</title>
        <description>TSQM v II is designed as a general measure of treatment satisfaction with medication, suitable for use across wide variety of medication types and illness conditions. It consists 11 question items used for computing 4 subscales: effectiveness, convenience, side effects and global satisfaction. Participants were asked to assess their level of satisfaction taking all things into account. Participants were to respond about their satisfaction or dissatisfaction with medication they are taking on a scale ranging 1-7, where 1=Extremely Dissatisfied, 2=Very Dissatisfied, 3=Dissatisfied, 4=Somewhat Satisfied, 5=Satisfied, 6=Very Satisfied, 7=Extremely Satisfied.</description>

Month 6 data was available for only 1 participant and none had data collected at Month 12, which did not allow performance of planned analysis.
