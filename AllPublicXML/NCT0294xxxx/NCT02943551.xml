  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Unwarranted use of antibiotics for pediatric acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) and
      use of second-line, broad spectrum antibiotics for bacterial ARTIs has contributed to the
      rapid development of resistance in many strains of bacteria. Provider-parent communication
      during pediatric visits for ARTIs strongly influence antibiotic prescribing rates. The
      overall goal of this study is to develop and test a distance learning quality improvement
      (QI) program called Dialogue Around Respiratory Illness Treatment - DART. The DART program
      aims to improve provider communication practices and treatment decisions during pediatric
      ARTI visits, with the ultimate goal being to decrease rates of antibiotic prescribing for
      these illnesses in children.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The specific aims of the study are:1) to test the DART program's effectiveness on a) overall
      antibiotic prescribing rates for all pediatric ARTIs and b) first-line antibiotic prescribing
      rates for bacterial ARTIs (acute otitis media, Group A Streptococcal pharyngitis, and
      sinusitis), 2) to test the DART program's effectiveness in changing providers' communication
      practices during ARTI visits, 3) to determine visit-specific satisfaction levels for parents
      of children seen by study providers and assess how satisfaction changes as a function of
      exposure to the DART program, and 4) to assess the cost of implementing the DART program and
      its impact on health care expenditures.

      To accomplish these aims, we propose a quasi-experimental study utilizing a stepped wedge
      design. In collaboration with two practice-based research networks: the electronic Pediatric
      Research in Office Settings (ePROS) network and the NorthShore Pediatric network, we will
      recruit 20 practices to participate. Over a 20 month period, the intervention will be
      sequentially deployed to 4 groups of practices (5 practices/group). Each practice will
      function as part of the control group until they receive the intervention. The DART program's
      effectiveness will be assessed by examining provider antibiotic prescribing rates for ARTIs
      (both overall and first-line), communication practices, and parent satisfaction both pre- and
      post-intervention exposure using survey and electronic health record data. If the DART
      program is effective for both reducing ARTI antibiotic prescribing to levels consistent with
      bacterial prevalence rates and increasing use of first-line antibiotics for bacterial ARTIs,
      we will have an innovative, highly disseminable QI intervention program to further address
      this critical public health problem.

    <description>Providers exposed to the intervention will have higher parent-reported visit-specific satisfaction scores during exposure to the intervention compared to baseline. To measure satisfaction the investigators will use an adapted version of the 3-item communication composite and the 1-item global visit satisfaction scale from the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems Clinician and Groups (CG-CAHPS®) Survey. The survey items were adapted so that they are addressed to parents of patients rather than patients themselves. Both the 3-item composite and the 1-item global visit satisfaction scale range from 0-100 with higher scores indicating higher levels of satisfaction.</description>

    <description>For each group of practices, during the first month of intervention participation, study staff at Seattle Children's Research Institute will send each participating provider within a group/wedge, via email, a password to access the online tutorial. Participants will be asked to view the 40-minute tutorial at a time that is convenient for them but prior to the first webinar. Investigators will be able to track whether and how often participants access the online tutorial as a measure of engagement in the intervention. PROS will follow up, via email or phone, with providers who have not completed the tutorial within a three week timeframe.</description>

Due to webinar faculty time constraints, we will establish dates/times for the webinar prior to recruitment. Providers will be given information on webinar dates in both the randomization email, as well as include the dates in the study box letter.
The webinars will be recorded to facilitate attendance for those who are unable to make the scheduled date/time. Included in the recording will be the presentation and any questions and answers from participants.</description>

    <description>An online link to the first booster video vignette will be sent to practice participants via email at the beginning of month 5 of intervention participation for each group/wedge. The link will lead to a website in which the provider will need to create a user name and password to access the booster videos. Two additional booster vignettes will be made available for viewing at the beginning of months 7 and 9 of intervention participation.
For each of the three booster sessions, up to three reminders to complete viewing the video vignette will be sent over a 2-week period. The study team will be able to monitor whether participants access and complete the questions at the end of each vignette.</description>

    <description>During the intervention phase, providers will also receive 6 audit and feedback reports given by parents.
The first report will have two parts:
The first part will focus on the provider's overall antibiotic prescribing rates for all ARTIs (viral and bacterial) and rates of using second-line antibiotics for bacterial ARTIs.
The second part will report the rates at which the provider uses the targeted communication practices as well as their average satisfaction scores.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Visits to enrolled providers by children aged 6 months to 10 years with an International
        Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10) diagnosis code for AOM, bronchitis, pharyngitis,
        sinusitis, or upper respiratory infection (URI) will be included in the study. Only
        systemic (oral) antibiotic prescriptions on the same date as the study visit will be
        included in prescribing measures for each ARTI.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        ARTI visits will be excluded from measures of prescribing if there are any competing
        non-ARTI bacterial diagnoses (e.g. urinary tract infection) or any antibiotic prescriptions
        during the 30-days prior to the index visit. Visits by children with allergies to
        penicillin or cephalosporin antibiotics will be excluded from measures of second-line
        prescribing.
