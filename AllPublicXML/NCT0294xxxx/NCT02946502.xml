  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the association between ICU acquired weakness as
      evaluated by dominant handheld dynamometry (handgrip) and the mechanical ventilation weaning
      outcome
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have evidenced that Intensive Care Unit acquired peripheral muscle weakness
      may lead to delayed mechanical ventilation weaning (i.e difficult or prolonged weaning
      according to guidelines). Nevertheless, no study has ever tested the association between
      handgrip strength and extubation outcome. The investigators have generated the hypothesis
      that ICU acquired weakness, as tested by handgrip strength might be associated with
      extubation outcome. The investigators have planned to include 240 patients. Handgrip strength
      will be monitored, along with a full muscular assessment through Medical Research Council
      score by the attending physiotherapist. Physicians in charge of the patients will be blinded
      to these values and the weaning protocol will continue according to guidelines.
