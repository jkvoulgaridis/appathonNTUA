      Prospective, non-comparative, multi-centre, multi-country, observational post-authorization
      study, to correlate predictive factors with number of oocytes in relation to the gonadotropin
      dose administered using a new r-hFSH product (Bemfola®) for ovarian stimulation and
      GnRH-antagonists for pituitary suppression

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective, non-comparative, multi-centre, multi-country, observational
      post-authorization study in Germany and Austria. The study will evaluate the use of
      follitropin alfa (Bemfola®) in controlled ovarian stimulation for IVF/ICSI.

      About 30 ART centres will be involved in the study. Upon site initiation, each investigator
      site will enrol the subjects who meet the inclusion criteria.

      As this is an observational study, there will be no additional treatment or diagnostic
      procedures performed on subjects other than those of the investigators' local routine
      clinical practice. The decision to start ART treatment and to use Bemfola® in controlled
      ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) following a GnRH antagonist protocol will be made
      independently by the investigators as per the ART centre's protocol, preceding patient
      enrollment for this study.

        The study population will comprise 1800 women intending to undergo ovarian stimulation with
        Bemfola® in order to have follicular puncture and oocyte retrieval performed as part of an
        in vitro fertilisation cycle with or without intracytoplasmic sperm injection, for
        reproductive purposes, and who are pituitary-suppressed with a GnRH antagonist.

        About 30 Fertility centres will be involved in the study. Upon site initiation, each
        investigator site will enrol the subjects who meet the inclusion criteria.
