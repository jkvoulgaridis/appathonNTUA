      This study will explore the possible cause of unexplained, or idiopathic, anaphylaxis.
      Anaphylaxis is a rapid, life-threatening, severe reaction that occurs suddenly after contact
      with an allergy-causing substance, usually a particular food, drug or stinging insect. The
      allergen triggers mast cells to release several substances, including histamine. Histamine is
      responsible for many of the symptoms that may occur, such as flushing, hives, swelling of the
      palms and soles or tongue and vocal cords, nasal congestion, itching and tearing of the eyes,
      shortness of breath and wheezing, stomach pain, vomiting, low blood pressure, loss of
      consciousness, shock, and, rarely, death. Severe episodes of anaphylaxis are treated with
      epinephrine (adrenaline), followed by oral antihistamines and steroids. In more than half of
      cases of anaphylaxis, a clear cause is not identified. These cases are called idiopathic
      anaphylaxis. There is no cure or long-term preventive therapy for patients with recurrent
      episodes of idiopathic anaphylaxis.

      People between 13 and 70 years of age who have idiopathic anaphylaxis, or have anaphylaxis
      that is caused by specific allergens such as food, venom, or drugs and medications may be
      eligible for this study.

      Participants are evaluated at the NIH Clinical Center with the following tests and
      procedures:

        -  Medical history, physical examination and blood tests.

        -  Bone marrow biopsy. For this test, the skin over the hipbone and the outer surface of
           the hipbone itself are numbed with local anesthesia. Then, a needle is inserted into the
           hipbone and a small amount of bone marrow is drawn into a syringe. The needle also cuts
           a small core of bone marrow, which is removed for analysis.

        -  Other tests that may be needed for evaluation of the patient s condition.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anaphylaxis is a severe life-threatening systemic hypersensitivity reaction caused by release
      of mediators from mast cells and basophils, characterized by cutaneous, respiratory,
      cardiovascular, or gastrointestinal signs and symptoms. The most common specific causes of
      anaphylaxis are venom, drug, and food allergies (i.e. patients with specific anaphylaxis,
      SA), When a causative factor is not identified in patients are said to have idiopathic
      anaphylaxis (IA). Evidence of an underlying clonal mast cell disease has been found in about
      I in 15 patients with IA in our studies and in about 1 in 12 patientswith venom induced
      anaphylaxis in a European study. (1) The number of patients with anaphylaxis to foods or
      drugs who have a clonal mast cell disease is not known and the number or patients with venom
      induced anaphylaxis in the US with clonal mast cell disease has not been determined. Thus, a
      more complete understanding of the prevalence of clonal mast cell disease in those
      experiencing anaphylaxis and a better understanding of the associated laboratory
      abnormalities and disrupted molecular signaling pathways will have a substantial impact of
      the clinical management of patients who present with anaphylaxis.

      This protocol thus focuses on determining the prevalence of clonal mast cell disorders in
      patients with the anaphylaxis, whether unexplained (IA) or associated with exposure to an
      antigen (SA), and attendant changes in the mast cell compartment. Subjects 13 - 75 years old
      will be evaluated to correlate both clinical and laboratory features of anaphylaxis and to
      identify genetic and molecular pathways that may predispose to these events. Subjects may
      undergo bone marrow examination in addition to supporting laboratory studies when indicated.
      We plan to enroll up to 200 subjects.
