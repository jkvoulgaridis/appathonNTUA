  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the hypothesis that an electric heating device, the Hot Dog warming
      system is as effective as the Bair Hugger forced air heating system.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects undergoing major plastic surgery lasting approximately 5 hours will be randomized to
      either the Hot Dog resistive heating system or the Bair Hugger forced air heating system.
      Core temperature will be measured using a distal esophagus and mean skin temperature. Warming
      will continue until the subjects' core temperature reaches 37°C. Subsequent temperature will
      be adjusted as clinically necessary. Data will be recorded at 15 minute intervals. Core
      temperature will be first measured after intubation when the esophageal temperature probe is
      inserted. The primary outcome will be the rate of core rewarming over the range of 35°C to
      37°C.

          <description>Temperatures during surgery were recorded at 15-min intervals and summarize as time weighted average (TWA) for each patient. The unit of TWA-temperature is °C.</description>
          <population>Medical University of Vienna adults having major maxillary-facial reconstructive surgery expected to last about 5 h. Most had pectoral flap reconstructions after extensive cancer debridement. We did not study patients with Reynaud’s disease, thyroid dysfunction, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, or who were of ASA physical status &gt; 3.</population>
