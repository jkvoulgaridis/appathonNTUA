  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the effect of maintenance treatment with rituximab in comparison with
      observation period (no treatment), in participants with progressive B-cell CLL who have had
      previous first-line induction treatment with rituximab, cladribine and cyclophosphamide (RCC
      regimen). After 6 months of RCC induction therapy, participants will be randomized either to
      receive maintenance treatment with rituximab or to receive no treatment (observation only)
      for 96 weeks. Participants completing maintenance/observation period will be followed-up for
      approximately 3 years.

        <title>PFS Assessed According to the NCI Revised Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of CLL According to Clinical and Biochemical Factors</title>
        <description>PFS: time from date of randomization to date of PD, relapse, or death from any cause. Participants alive with no evidence of PD or relapse were censored at date of last clinical examination. PD: appearance of any new lesion, such as enlarged lymph nodes (&gt;1.5 cm), splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, or other organ infiltrates; an increase of &gt;/=50% in greatest determined diameter of any previous site; an increase in previously noted enlargement of liver or spleen by &gt;/=50%; an increase in number of blood lymphocytes by &gt;/=50% with B-lymphocytes &gt;/=5000/mcL; transformation to a more aggressive histology; or occurrence of cytopenia attributable to CLL. Rai Stage: staging for CLL, based on lymphocyte, red blood cell and platelet counts and size of lymph nodes, spleen, and liver. Rai Stage I or II are intermediate risk CLL and Rai Stage III or IV are high risk CLL. This outcome measure assessed relationship between clinical markers and clinical outcome (PFS) after study treatment.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With CR or PR Assessed According to the NCI Revised Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of CLL According to Clinical and Biochemical Factors at Week 29</title>
        <description>CR was achieved if participants met all of the following criteria &gt;/= 2 months after last treatment: no Ly/ hepatomegaly/ splenomegaly/constitutional symptoms; neutrophils &gt;1500/mcL, PL &gt;100,000/mcL, Hb &gt;11.0 g/dL, BM sample must be normocellular for age with lymphocytes &lt;30% of nucleated cells. PR: a reduction in Ly; a reduction of &gt;/=50% from pre-treatment state in the lymphocytes count, and in enlargement of the spleen or liver; any one of the following: neutrophils &gt;1500/mcL, PL &gt;100,000/mcL (or 50% improvement from baseline), Hb &gt;11.0 g/dL (or 50% improvement from baseline). Rai Stage: staging for CLL, based on lymphocyte, red blood cell and platelet counts and size of lymph nodes, spleen, and liver. Rai Stage I or II are intermediate risk CLL and Rai Stage III or IV are high risk CLL. This outcome measure assessed the relationship between clinical markers and clinical outcome (response) after study treatment.</description>

            <description>Participants received rituximab at a dose of 375 mg/m^2 as IV infusion on Day 1 of Cycle 1 and 500 mg/m^2 as IV infusion on Day 1 of Cycles 2-6, along with cladribine at a dose of 0.12 mg/kg/day as IV infusion on Days 2-4, and cyclophosphamide at a dose of 250 mg/m^2/day as IV infusion over 15-30 min on Days 2-4 of each 28-days cycle for 6 cycles during induction phase. Participants with PR or CR after induction phase were randomized to observation arm (received no intervention) or to maintenance arm (12 weeks after the last induction cycle, participants received rituximab at a dose of 375 mg/m^2 as IV infusion on Day 1 of each 12-week cycle for 8 cycles or until disease progression [up to approximately 96 weeks]).</description>

Rai Stage I or II are intermediate risk CLL and Rai Stage III or IV are high risk CLL. This outcome measure assessed the relationship between clinical markers and clinical outcome (response) after study treatment.</description>
          <population>ITT population. Number Analyzed: participants evaluable for specified category. This outcome was planned to be reported for groups defined by clinical and biochemical factors (i.e. reported categories) among Participants included in Overall IIT population only.</population>

PR: a reduction in Ly; a reduction of &gt;/=50% from pre-treatment state in the lymphocytes count, and in enlargement of the spleen or liver; any one of the following: neutrophils &gt;1500/mcL, PL &gt;100,000/mcL (or 50% improvement from baseline), Hb &gt;11.0 g/dL (or 50% improvement from baseline). Rai Stage: staging for CLL, based on lymphocyte, red blood cell and platelet counts and size of lymph nodes, spleen, and liver. Rai Stage I or II are intermediate risk CLL and Rai Stage III or IV are high risk CLL. This outcome measure assessed the relationship between clinical markers and clinical outcome (response) after study treatment.</description>

        <description>MRD: the presence of tumor cells in bone marrow, using 4-color flow cytometry of CD19/CD5/CD20/CD79b. MRD was assessed in participants who achieved CR or PR. CR (&gt;/=2 months after last treatment): no Ly/ hepatomegaly/ splenomegaly/constitutional symptoms; neutrophils &gt;1500/mcL, PL &gt;100,000/mcL, Hb &gt;11.0 g/dL, BM sample must be normocellular for age with lymphocytes &lt;30% of nucleated cells. PR: a reduction in Ly; a reduction of &gt;/=50% from pre-treatment state in the lymphocytes count, and in enlargement of the spleen or liver; any one of the following: neutrophils &gt;1500/mcL, PL &gt;100,000/mcL (or 50% improvement from baseline), Hb &gt;11.0 g/dL (or 50% improvement from baseline). Rai Stage: staging for CLL, based on lymphocyte, red blood cell and platelet counts and size of lymph nodes, spleen, and liver. Rai Stage I or II are intermediate risk CLL and Rai Stage III or IV are high risk CLL. This outcome measure assessed relationship between clinical markers and MRD after study treatment.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With MRD According to Rawstron Criteria in Participants With CR or PR According to Clinical and Biochemical Factors at Week 129</title>
        <description>MRD: the presence of tumor cells in bone marrow, using 4-color flow cytometry of CD19/CD5/CD20/CD79b. MRD was assessed in participants who achieved CR or PR. CR (&gt;/=2 months after last treatment): no Ly/ hepatomegaly/ splenomegaly/constitutional symptoms; neutrophils &gt;1500/mcL, PL &gt;100,000/mcL, Hb &gt;11.0 g/dL, BM sample must be normocellular for age with lymphocytes &lt;30% of nucleated cells. PR: a reduction in Ly; a reduction of &gt;/=50% from pre-treatment state in the lymphocytes count, and in enlargement of the spleen or liver; any one of the following: neutrophils &gt;1500/mcL, PL &gt;100,000/mcL (or 50% improvement from baseline), Hb &gt;11.0 g/dL (or 50% improvement from baseline). Rai Stage: staging for CLL, based on lymphocyte, red blood cell and platelet counts and size of lymph nodes, spleen, and liver. Rai Stage I or II are intermediate risk CLL and Rai Stage III or IV are high risk CLL. This outcome measure assessed relationship between clinical markers and MRD after study treatment.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants With MRD According to Rawstron Criteria in Participants With CR or PR According to Clinical and Biochemical Factors at Week 129</title>
          <description>MRD: the presence of tumor cells in bone marrow, using 4-color flow cytometry of CD19/CD5/CD20/CD79b. MRD was assessed in participants who achieved CR or PR. CR (&gt;/=2 months after last treatment): no Ly/ hepatomegaly/ splenomegaly/constitutional symptoms; neutrophils &gt;1500/mcL, PL &gt;100,000/mcL, Hb &gt;11.0 g/dL, BM sample must be normocellular for age with lymphocytes &lt;30% of nucleated cells. PR: a reduction in Ly; a reduction of &gt;/=50% from pre-treatment state in the lymphocytes count, and in enlargement of the spleen or liver; any one of the following: neutrophils &gt;1500/mcL, PL &gt;100,000/mcL (or 50% improvement from baseline), Hb &gt;11.0 g/dL (or 50% improvement from baseline). Rai Stage: staging for CLL, based on lymphocyte, red blood cell and platelet counts and size of lymph nodes, spleen, and liver. Rai Stage I or II are intermediate risk CLL and Rai Stage III or IV are high risk CLL. This outcome measure assessed relationship between clinical markers and MRD after study treatment.</description>
          <population>ITT population. Overall Number of Participants Analyzed: participants evaluable for this outcome; Number Analyzed: participants evaluable for specified category. This outcome was planned to be reported for groups defined by clinical and biochemical factors (i.e. reported categories) among All Randomized Participants only.</population>
