      This study is being conducted to find a way to predict how individual schizophrenic patients
      will respond if they are treated with different types of antipsychotic drugs. This could help
      doctors prescribe the medication that will work best for each individual.

      The primary objective of the proposed research project is to identify a practical method of
      predicting differential antipsychotic drug treatment response in patients with schizophrenia.
      In particular, we will examine differential response to two antipsychotic drugs, aripiprazole
      and risperidone, that have contrasting pharmacologic activity at D2-type dopamine receptors,
      i.e., partial agonism vs. antagonism, respectively. A number of candidate predictors will be
      examined, including neuroimaging parameters (regional neuroanatomical and metabolic
      variations, fallypride binding to D2-like receptors), neuropsychological testing, clinical
      features, laboratory measures, and genetic studies.

      Secondary objectives include: (1) extension of our previous efforts to characterize
      abnormalities in cortico-striato-thalamic circuits in unmedicated schizophrenics using PET
      and MR imaging; and, (2) examination of the role of omega-3 fatty acid activity in
      schizophrenics as a predictor of dopaminergic activity.
