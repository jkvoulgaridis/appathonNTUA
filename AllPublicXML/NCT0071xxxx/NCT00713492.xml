  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the reliability of a procedure for self-administering ethanol (alcohol)
      intravenously (through a vein), using a computer-assisted method. People ordinarily
      self-administer alcohol through drinking alcoholic beverages, but blood alcohol levels
      resulting from drinking vary greatly among individuals. For research on alcohol dependence
      and treatment, a tool for achieving precise blood levels is needed. In addition to testing
      this method of alcohol administration, the study will examine self-administration behavior
      and resulting breath alcohol concentration, the effects of alcohol on the participants, and
      differences between men and women in alcohol self-administration.

      Healthy normal volunteers between 21 and 45 years of age may be eligible for this study.
      Participants are assigned to one of two study groups. Group 1 undergoes three 7-hour study
      sessions and group 2 participates in two sessions, each of which includes the following
      procedures:

        -  Breathalyzer and urine tests for alcohol and illicit drug use.

        -  Urine pregnancy test for women.

        -  Light lunch.

        -  Questionnaire about health and recent drinking.

      Alcohol infusion: Subjects are seated in a comfortable chair and instructed on how to use a
      computer to give themselves a short infusion of alcohol through a catheter (plastic tube)
      that has been inserted into a vein in their the arm. Sensors are placed on their chest to
      monitor heart beat and their neck to record skin blood flow. At the start of the session,
      subjects complete questionnaires about any drug effects and urges to drink they may be
      feeling. They are trained on how to use the computer to administer alcohol and are then
      allowed to self-administer alcohol through the catheter any time they like, as long as their
      peak breath alcohol level does not exceed 0.1 g% (a level that would result from ingestion of
      4 to 6 drinks in most people). If that point is reached, the computer automatically
      inactivates self-administration until the level is lowered again. Breathalyzer readings are
      taken every 15 to 30 minutes. Subjects may read, watch television or videos or listen to
      music during the sessions.

      Recovery: At the end of the 2.5 hours of self-administration, the catheter is removed and
      subjects can eat, read, watch television and relax in the clinic until their breath alcohol
      level falls below 0.02 g%, usually after 2.5 to 3 hours, when they can go home by taxi or
      with a pre-arranged designated driver.

      Objective: The goal of this project is to characterize the computer-assisted
      self-administration of ethanol (CASE) paradigm by assessing intravenous (IV) alcohol
      self-administration behavior and the resulting breath alcohol concentration (BrAC) exposure
      and pharmacologic responses in humans. The study will also evaluate the test-retest
      reliability of alcohol self-administration and examine the influence of sex and recent
      drinking history, as well as the effect of acute stress cues on alcohol self-administration.
      Additionally, this study will test whether a novel experimental paradigm can be used to
      evaluate impaired control in

      heavy drinkers.

      Study population: Participants will be 21-60 year-old male and female social drinkers and
      binge drinkers in good health, as determined by medical history, physical exam, ECG and lab
      tests. Participants with Axis-I psychiatric illness (other than alcohol use disorder for
      Group 6) will be excluded.

      Design: The CASE system utilizes a model-based algorithm based on previously published
      methods to achieve and maintain pre-determined BrACs using IV alcohol infusions. The CASE
      system provides flexibility to participants in choosing when to push a button to receive
      alcohol, as well as flexibility to investigators in controlling the subsequent BrAC exposure.
      The CASE system allows the investigator to specify and assure the same BrAC increment across
      all participants, and is set up to prevent the BrAC from exceeding any pre-set upper limit
      (e.g., 120 mg%).

      Following screening, participants will undergo IV ethanol self-administration sessions.
      Participants will be enrolled in four groups: Group 1 will consist of the first 10
      participants who will participate in 3 self-administration sessions (a training session
      followed by 2 test sessions) to assess the test-retest reliability of alcohol
      self-administration behavior. Group 2 will consist of 50 participants, who will each
      participate in 2 self-administration sessions (a training session followed by a test
      session). During each session, participants will first undergo a directed priming period,
      lasting 25 min, where they will be prompted to push a button to receive small standardized
      alcohol infusions. This will be followed by an ad-lib period, lasting up to 2 hrs, where they
      will have free access to standardized IV alcohol infusions. During the session, BrAC will be
      measured, heart-rate and skin blood flow will be continuously recorded, and subjective
      perceptions of alcohol effects and urges will be assessed. Group 3 will consist of 15
      participants, who will undergo two identical progressive work self-administration sessions
      for evaluation of test-retest reliability. During each progressive ratio (PR) schedule
      session, participants will be required to push the button progressively higher number of
      times for each subsequent alcohol infusion over a 2.5 hr period. Group 4 will consist of 100
      participants, who will each participate in 2 sessions: one ad lib self-administration session
      and one PR schedule self-administration session. Group 5 will consist of 40 participants, who
      will undergo a baseline self-administration session followed by an interview session for
      construction of guided imagery scripts. Following this, participants will undergo three
      alcohol self-administration sessions, following exposure to personalized stress-, alcohol- or
      neutral-condition associated scripts, presented in randomized order on separate days. Group
      6a will consist of a maximum of 15 participants who will undergo a baseline
      self-administration session followed by an experimental session in which they will be given
      the opportunity to resist receiving self-infusions of alcohol in return for monetary
      reinforcers. Group 6b will consist of 37 participants who will complete a baseline
      self-administration session followed by two experimental sessions, with and without a priming
      dose of alcohol, and two follow up visits. Group 6 participants will also be given an
      ecological momentary assessment (EMA) device and will complete random assessments of
      real-world measures of impaired control and alcohol consumption per day for the duration of
      the study.

      Outcome measures: The primary endpoint is the BrAC exposure (highest BrAC, average BrAC,
      area-under-the-BrAC-time-curve) achieved during the self-administration session.
      Additionally, changes in subjective perceptions of alcohol effects, as well as changes in
      heart rate will be evaluated. The influence of sex and recent drinking history as well as
      genetic polymorphisms on the self-administration of alcohol will also be examined.
      Furthermore, individual-specific cellular responses to alcohol exposure will be examined
      using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from participants selected based on genotypic
      and phenotypic variation in self-administration measures. Outcome measures for group 5 will
      include stress and alcohol cue-induced craving and self-administration. Human laboratory
      outcome

      measures for Group 6 will include time to lapse during the delay phase, number of infusions,

      peak BrAC, and average BrAC during the ad-libitum phase. EMA outcomes will include

      total alcohol consumption, number of impaired control episodes, and severity of impaired

      control episodes. The CASE paradigm can be a valuable tool for evaluating determinants that
      may underlie self-administration behavior in humans. The effect of pharmacological agents on
      alcohol self-administration can be evaluated as a marker of the clinical effectiveness of
      these agents in the treatment of alcohol-dependence.

             with no experience drinking 5 or more drinks on one occasion in their lifetime.

          8. Regular tobacco users will be excluded from the study in order to avoid nicotine
             withdrawal symptoms. Occasional use of tobacco products (up to 20 cigarettes/week) is
             acceptable. For Groups 3, 4 and 5, participants must be current non-smokers (past
             smokers who have quit for over 1 year can be included).

          9. Positive result on urine drug screen or positive breathalyzer during screening visit
             or at the start of any study visit.

         10. Pregnancy or intention to become pregnant for women. Female participants will undergo

             ranitidine, muscle relaxants, anti-epileptics including phenytoin and phenobarbital
             codeine, and narcotics including propoxyphene, oxycodone and hydrocodone. Drugs known
             to inhibit or induce enzymes that metabolize alcohol should not be used for 4 weeks
             prior to the study. These include chlorzoxazone, isoniazid, metronidazole and
             disulfiram. Cough-and-cold preparations which contain anti-histamines, pain medicines
             and anti-inflammatories such as aspirin, ibuprofen, acetaminophen, celecoxib and
             naproxen, should be withheld for at least 72 hours prior to each study session.

             significant menstrual periods that are heavier or lighter than usual, and/or
             accompanied by significant pain, cramping or nausea and vomiting that requires
             intervention.

        GROUP 6

        Group 6 will include heavy drinkers between the ages of 21 and 60 years, in good health.
        Unfortunately, heavy drinking does not have a universally agreed upon definition and the
        criteria used to define heavy drinking vary from study to study. There is evidence that

        incorporating both amount of alcohol consumed per occasion and amount of alcohol consumed
        per week is relevant to account for risk related to pattern of drinking and total
        consumption. Therefore in our study we will select heavy drinkers using a definition that
        takes into account both pattern of drinking and total consumption. For pattern of drinking,
        we will require our subjects to have on average at least one binge drinking day per week,
        using the NIAAA definition of 5 or more drinks for men and 4 or more drinks for women
        (NIAAA website). For total consumption, we will use an average of 8 or more drinks per week
        for women and 15 or more drinks per week for men as this level of drinking has been shown
        to confer increased risk of mortality.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Male and female participants between 21-60 years of age.

          2. Male participants must have consumed an average of 15 or more standard drinks per week
             and females must have consumed an average of 8 or more standard drinks per week during
             the past 90 days. Average number of drinks per week will be calculated based on total
             number of drinks as measured by the timeline followback (TLFB) (e.g., for 90 days
             worth of data, total drinks divided by 90 and then multiplied by 7 will be the average
             number of drinks per week).

          3. Participants must have on average at least 1 binge drinking day per week during the
             last 90 days, defined as a day in which 4 or more standard drinks were consumed for
             females and 5 or more standard drinks were consumed for males. Average number of binge
             drinking days will be calculated based on total number of binge drinking days from the
             TLFB (e.g. for 90 days worth of data, participants with a total of 13 or more binge
             drinking days will be eligible).

          4. Participants must be able and willing to refrain from consuming alcohol 24 hours prior
             to each alcohol self-administration session.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Current or prior history of serious medical illness, including CNS, cardiovascular,
             respiratory, gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, endocrine, or reproductive disorders.

          2. Positive hepatitis A, B antigen, or C or HIV test at screening.

          3. Abnormal findings on ECG, unless cleared for participation by cardiologist or Licensed
             Independent Practitioner (LIP).

          4. Current history of major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, psychotic disorder,
             obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), eating
             disorder, or any other Axis-I psychiatric disorders requiring intervention.

          5. An aspartate transaminase (AST) or alanine transaminase (ALT) level more than 3 times
             the upper limit of normal.

          6. Current (past 12 months) diagnosis of substance use disorder other than alcohol use
             disorder, unless in early remission (no criteria met for at least 3 months).

          7. Positive result on urine drug screen or breathalyzer test during initial or update
             visit under the screening protocol (14-AA-0181) most proximal to enrollment. Positive
             urine drug screen during more than 1 study visit or breathalyzer reading during more
             than 1 self-administration study visit will result in participant withdrawal from the
             study.

          8. Currently seeking treatment for alcohol use disorder or having undergone inpatient or
             outpatient detoxification or treatment for alcohol problems in the past 6 months.

          9. History of significant withdrawal symptoms or presence of clinically significant
             withdrawal symptoms (Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment (CIWA) score &gt; 8) at
             screening.

         10. Pregnancy, intention to become pregnant, or breastfeeding. Female participants will
             undergo a urine beta-hCG test to ensure that they are not pregnant.

         11. Medication exclusion criteria:

               1. . Daily or regular use of prescription or OTC medications known to interact with
                  alcohol in the 2-week period prior to assessment. These include, but may not be
                  limited to: isosorbide, nitroglycerine, benzodiazepines, warfarin,
                  anti-depressants such as amitriptyline, clomipramine and nefazodone,
                  anti-diabetes medications such as glyburide, metformin and tolbutamide,
                  H2-antagonists for heartburn such as cimetidine and ranitidine, muscle relaxants,
                  anti-epileptics including phenytoin and phenobarbital codeine, and narcotics
                  including propoxyphene, oxycodone and hydrocodone.

               2. Daily or regular use of drugs known to inhibit or induce enzymes that metabolize
                  alcohol in the 4-week period prior to assessment. These include chlorzoxazone,
                  isoniazid, metronidazole and disulfiram. Note that any discontinuation of
                  medications will only be done at the recommendation of a physician.
