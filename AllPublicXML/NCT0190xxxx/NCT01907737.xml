  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebrovascular disease is a major cause of disability worldwide. The catastrophic burden of
      stroke is more dramatic in low- and middle- income countries, and the scarcity of
      evidence-based rehabilitation interventions represents a major challenge to global health
      care. Upper limb weakness is frequent after stroke, but there is no universally accepted
      treatment to effectively improve hand function in patients with moderate and severe motor
      impairment. These are the patients in deepest need of rehabilitative interventions. This
      project addresses this important issue, by testing effects of a novel approach. We will
      non-invasively stimulate the brain and peripheral nerves in order to enhance effects of motor
      training aided by an electrical stimulation device in patients with moderate to severe hand
      weakness. Our hypothesis is that brain stimulation, when added to peripheral nerve
      stimulation, will enhance effects of motor training to a greater extent than brain
      stimulation alone, peripheral stimulation alone, or no stimulation.

      The goal of this study is to compare the effects of FES in close association with either
      transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) alone, peripheral nerve stimulation
      (PNS)alone, tDCS + PNS or sham tDCS + sham PNS, in patients with moderate to severe upper
      limb weakness, in a cross-over design. The working hypothesis of this proof-of-principle
      study is that either tDCS or PNS will enhance effects of functional electrical stimulation
      (FES) to a greater extent than placebo tDCS and PNS, and that the combination of tDCS and PNS
      will further improve motor outcomes than either tDCS or PNS alone.

      The interventions will consist of outpatient motor training of the paretic wrist with FES in
      four experimental sessions separated by two weeks. In each session, either active tDCS + sham
      PNS, active PNS + sham tDCS,active tDCS + active PNS or sham tDCS + sham PNS will be applied.
      PNS will be applied for 2 hours and tDCS will be applied in the last 20 minutes before
      completion of PNS. The order of the sessions will be randomized across patients. Before the
      first session, patients will be familiarized with the FES device.

          <description>In this cross-over study, the primary outcome was measured immediately before and after each session of treatment. In each session, one of the four possible interventions was administered.</description>
          <population>Of twenty two participants who started the study, one participant only participated in one of the four sessions, while the remainder participated in all four. Of the 21 participants who completed four sessions, one was removed from analyses after meeting exclusion criteria</population>

          <description>-1 session of active transcranial direct current stimulation (TDCS) of the hemisphere affected by the stroke and active peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS)
Active tDCS and active PNS: Active tDCS will be applied with the anode positioned over the ipsilesional M1 and the cathode over the contralateral supraorbital region for 20 minutes (1mA).
Active PNS will be administered by 2 pairs of surface electrodes (cathode proximal). One pair will overly the median and ulnar nerves at the wrist, and the other pair will overly the radial nerve. Trains of electric stimulation will be delivered at 1 Hz by using isolation units connected to a square pulse stimulator.</description>
