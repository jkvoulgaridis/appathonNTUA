  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is a clinical trial phase I, single center, non-randomized, uncontrolled, open prospective
      follow-up of a cohort of patients with chronic spinal cord injury (SCI) who were treated with
      autologous stromal cells of the bone marrow administrated locally (subarachnoid and
      intramedullar) by intrathecal microinjection and three months later, by lumbar subarachnoid
      administration. The minimum follow-up duration for each patient is 12 months after the first
      administration, or until death, if it occurs it before.

    <description>Clinical evaluation of possible adverse effects is performed daily at the first week after the first administration of stem cells and weekly until the 6 months follow-up visit and then at month 9 and 12. .
During the first stem cells administration (during surgery): Changes in vital signs (ECG, Blood Pressure (BP), Heart Rate (HR) were evaluated
During the second stem cells administration: Changes in vital signs (BP, HR), headache and meningeal irritation were evaluated
During the first weeks, after the first and the second administrations, the possibility of meningeal irritation, headache and infectious complications were considerate.

    <time_frame>sensitivity before surgery (baseline visit) and 3, 6, 9, 12 months after surgery (follow-up period)</time_frame>
    <description>Sensitivity recovery was measured using the ASIA (American Spinal Injury Association) scale to measure the Surface sensitivity (LTS), pain sensitivity (PPS), and the degree of motor function in key muscles (MS). The sum of MS, LTS, and PPS configure total ASIA score. A minimum possible score is 0 points. A maximum possible score is 224 points for a patient with normal sensation.
ASIA score was obtained before surgery, and 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after surgery. Mean and standard deviation for the 12 patients were obtained at all the time points and statistically analyzed.</description>

The minimum posible score is 0, and the máximum posible score is 48, being a score of 48 a normal functioning across all categories, and 0 a severe degree of functional hándicap (significant impact of daily life).
Pain is classified as no pain; mild pain, ordinary pain killer, effective;severe pain, narcotics required; extreme pain, uncontrolled.</description>

    <description>Changes in the neurophysiological parameters (SSEPs, somatosensory evoked potentials) measured as number of patients WITH SSEPs, each patient through underwent neurophysiological studies before treatment, as well as six and 12 months after surgery, paying attention mainly to the presence or abscence of somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs), the presence or absence of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited by magnetic stimulation over the scalp, and to electromyographic (EMG) recording of motor unit potentials in infralesional muscles. Previous to cell therapy in any of the patients SSEPs were recorded.</description>

    <description>Urodynamic studies in terms of voluntary micturition in flowmetry or in pressure/flow test, increase in bladder compliance. detrusor pressure (decrease on detrusor pressure is considered a clinical improvement). The neurogenic bladder is one of the biggest problems associated with SCI (spinal cord injury), with important personal and social implications.</description>

In general, in the areas of SCI, variable degree of spinal cord atrophy and hiperintense images are observed. These images corresponds to cysts, gliosis and myelomalacia. After cell administration a reduction of supposed cyst and a decrease or disappearance of hyperintense lesions suggest a patient improvement.</description>

             established, when there are no signs of functional recovery after a minimum follow-up
             period of 6 months after the spinal cord injury. The upper age limit is justified by

The sum of MS, LTS, and PPS configure total ASIA score. A minimum possible score is 0 points. A maximum possible score is 224 points for a patient with normal sensation.
ASIA score was obtained before surgery, and 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after surgery. Mean and standard deviation for the 12 patients were obtained at all the time points and statistically analyzed.</description>
