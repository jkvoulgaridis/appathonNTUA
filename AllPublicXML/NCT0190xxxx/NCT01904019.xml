      Comparison of functional outcome at 3 years after trapezio-metacarpal arthroplasty with
      trapeziectomy and trapeziectomy with ligament reconstruction and tendon interposition.

      The primary objective is to compare functional outcome at 3 years after trapezio-metarcarpal
      arthroplasty with trapeziectomy and trapeziectomy with ligament reconstruction and tendon
      interposition. Literature values obtained by a recently published meta analysis1 will be
      used.

      Secondary objectives are:

        -  to compare functional outcome at 1 and at 5 years after trapezio-metarcarpal
           arthroplasty with trapeziectomy and trapeziectomy with ligament reconstruction and
           tendon interposition

        -  to determine pre- and postop HR QOL

        -  Incidence of RLL at each follow up time point. Literature values from the same meta
           analysis1 will be used.

    <description>EQ-5D is a standardized instrument for measuring health status. It is made up for two components.
The description part: health status is measured in five dimensions (5D); mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Mobility dimension asks about the person's walking ability. Self-care dimension asks about the ability to wash or dress by oneself. Usual activities dimension measures performance in &quot;work, study, housework, family or leisure activities&quot;. In pain/discomfort dimension, it asks how much pain or discomfort they have. In anxiety/depression dimension, it asks how anxious or depressed they are.
Visual analogue scale: The patient marks his health status on the day of the interview on a 20 cm vertical scale with end points of 0 and 100. The bottom rate (0) corresponds to &quot; the worst health you can imagine&quot;, and the highest rate (100) corresponds to &quot;the best health you can imagine&quot;.</description>
