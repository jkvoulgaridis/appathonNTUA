  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      City of Hope National Medical Center, located in Duarte, CA, is hosting a clinical study on
      islet cell transplantation, an experimental procedure being evaluated as a treatment for
      patients with type 1 diabetes. Islet cell transplantation involves taking insulin-producing
      cells from organ donors and transplanting them into the liver of a patient with diabetes.
      Once transplanted, the islets produce insulin, which can improve blood sugar control and
      eliminate the need to inject insulin or use an insulin pump.

      Anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) and alemtuzumab (Campath) are anti-rejection medications that
      work by decreasing a patient's T-cells. T-cells are special white blood cells that recognize
      and destroy unwanted things like infections but can also attack transplanted cells and
      organs. Reducing the number of T-cells at the time of transplant may protect islets and
      improve long-term transplant success. In previous research studies, islet transplantation has
      been successful in reducing low blood sugar episodes, improving overall blood sugar control,
      and in some cases, allowing patients with type 1 diabetes to stop taking insulin.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if islet cell transplantation using ATG or
      alemtuzumab, along with additional medications to prevent the body from rejecting the
      transplanted cells, is a safe and effective treatment for type 1 diabetes. Study participants
      may receive up to three islet transplants and will be followed for five years to monitor
      blood sugar control, islet transplant function, and changes in quality of life.
