      This research is being done to study a combination of drugs for relapsed Hodgkin's Lymphoma
      (HL) that may be easier to tolerate than standard therapies and that does not involve an
      autologous blood or marrow transplant (BMT, also called a stem cell transplant).The study is
      for people with HL who have never received treatment for relapsed lymphoma, except for
      radiation therapy. Usually, when HL relapses for the first time, the standard is to receive
      combinations of chemotherapy, including an autologous blood or marrow transplant (BMT, also
      called a stem cell transplant) which has about a 40% cure rate. BMT may cure the HL, but also
      may be associated with serious side effects and risks. This research looks at a combination
      of drugs for relapsed HL that may not have the side effects of standard therapies and that
      does not involve BMT. The goal is to treat the lymphoma effectively with drugs that we expect
      will have fewer side effects, while avoiding a treatment like BMT.

    <description>Brentuximab vedotin:
Will be administered at 1.8 mg/kg IV over 30 minutes is given for up to 10 doses (cycles), with a cycle length of 21 days. Brentuximab vedotin is first given on day 1 of cycles 1, 2, 3, and 4 as a single agent (weeks 0, 3, 6, and 9, respectively). Four cycles are chosen because of the 12-week median time to CR in the pivotal phase 2 trial of brentuximab vedotin after autologous BMT for HL.
Brentuximab vedotin will be administered with Rituximab at 375 mg/m2 IV is given for up to 8 &quot;induction&quot; doses: day 1 of week 6, 7, 8, and 9; day 1 of week 12, 15, 18 and 21. This is followed by rituximab &quot;maintenance&quot; (375 mg/m2 IV once every 3 months x 2 doses) to complete a ~ 1 year total course of therapy.</description>
