  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, sequential cohort, open-label, volume and dose escalation study of
      the safety, tolerability, and distribution of 186RNL given by convection enhanced delivery to
      patients with recurrent or progressive malignant glioma after standard surgical, radiation,
      and/or chemotherapy treatment. The study uses a modified Fibonacci dose escalation, followed
      by an expansion at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) to determine efficacy. The starting
      absorbed dose is 1mCi in a volume of 0.660mL.

    <description>At the time of stereotactic biopsy a catheter will be placed within the tumor using stereotactic guidance. Once the patient has adequately recovered from the procedure as determined by the neurosurgeon, 186RNL will be infused through the catheter at the predetermined dose. Spectroscopic imaging will then be obtained at predefined time points to visualize the distribution of the 186RNL as well as calculated the actual dose retained within the tumor. Patients will be monitored longitudinally for evidence of toxicity and response by MRI.</description>
