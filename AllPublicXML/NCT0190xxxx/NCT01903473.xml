  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The immune system has offensive and defensive capacities. In bone marrow transplantation,
      offensive cells in the donor grafts may attack host's organs, leading to a complication known
      as Graft versus Host Disease (GVDH). At present, patients receive steroid treatment to combat
      this tricky situation. Nevertheless, some patients do not respond to this therapy. Recently,
      it has been shown that immune system cells having defensive capacities can help in preventing
      the occurrence of a GVDH.

      This study aims to evaluate if these protective cells together with a non-standard
      immunosuppressor can improve the clinical condition and suppress the activity of the
      offensive cells in the graft.

      TREATMENT PLAN

      1 Immunosuppressive drugs (DTI and control arms)

        -  Rapa will be started within 2 weeks after inclusion. Rapa will be given at 2-6 mg
           loading dose for one day, followed by approximately 1mg daily to achieve a target trough
           level of 5 to 10 ng/mL. The frequency of trough level measurements will be done
           according to the investigator choice;

        -  Rapa may be discontinued in case of resolution of chronic GVHD ≥ 3 months or in case of
           un-manageable side effects or progression of chronic GVHD.

        -  Calcineurin inhibitor discontinuation within 2 weeks after rapa initiation. No other
           modification of immunosuppressive drugs and in particular no decrease in the dose of
           steroids (unless necessary for side effects).

        -  Evaluation of chronic GVHD 60 days after rapa initiation. DTI will not be given in
           patients who had progression of their GVHD on day 60 nor in those who are in CR of their
           GVHD.

           2. Collection of donor lymphocytes (DTI arm)

        -  Apheresis of the donor will be performed 60-90 days after first day of rapa
           administration to the patient.There will be no particular preparation of the donor prior
           to leukapheresis. After written informed consent, the donor will undergo leukaphereses
           on 1 day. Leukapheresis will be performed using a continuous flow blood cell separator
           and following a mononuclear cell collection protocol. The volume of blood processed will
           be 20 liters. Anticoagulation will be performed with the ACD-A / heparin solution.

           3. Tregselection and infusion (DTI arm)

        -  Treg will be isolated at the LTCG of the CHU of Liège from apheresis product with the
           CliniMACS separation system (MiltenyiBiotec) following a two-step procedure (CD8 and
           CD19 depletion followed by CD25 positive selection)according to the manufacturer's
           recommendation. Aliquots (≈ 3 mL) of the Treg product will be saved for analyses.

        -  Treg will be infused i.v.60-90 days after first day of rapa administration and after
           calcineurin inhibitor discontinuation. No DTI will be performed in the control arm.

        -  Low-dose Il-2 (1x106 IU/day) will be started the day of DTI and will be continued for a
           period of 2months in order to expand infused donor Tregs.
