  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-center, sequential groups, dose-escalation study of CBL0137
      administered intravenously in participants with metastatic or unresectable advanced solid
      malignancies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) and
      recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of CBL0137. The secondary objectives are to describe the
      dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and adverse event profile of CBL0137, to describe the
      pharmacokinetic profile of CBL0137, to document any objective responses to CBL0137. This is a
      study of CBL0137 with a standard &quot;3+3&quot; design. Escalation will proceed to the MTD based on
      DLT in the 1st cycle in 1 of 6 participants in a cohort.

    <description>MTD is defined as dose level at which ≥6 participants have been treated and which is associated with a first-cycle DLT in ≤17% of the participants. Selection of RP2D from within the tolerated dose range will be based on evaluation of short- and long-term safety information together with findings relating to compliance, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and antitumor activity.</description>
