  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many elderly patients undergoing surgical procedures already have impaired cognitive
      (memory/concentration) status. Patients with pre-existing cognitive impairment, or dementia,
      may benefit from modified anesthesia techniques. It is estimated that one in eight people age
      65 and older has Alzheimers disease. More so, nearly half of people that are 85 years or
      older have Alzheimers disease. Currently, both spinal (regional) and inhalational (general)
      anesthesia, are used in patients undergoing common urological, orthopedic, and general
      surgical procedures. Inhalational anesthesia has been associated with higher risk of memory
      impairment in experimental (animal) and human studies. However, currently, there are simply
      no large or good enough studies to be sure that inhalational anesthesia is responsible for
      causing dementia and Alzheimers disease.The proposed study investigates if elderly patients
      (65 years and older) undergoing spinal anesthesia (patient is awake or slightly sedated) are
      less likely to develop dementia and Alzheimers disease for up to 2 years after surgery, when
      compared to inhalational anesthesia (patient is kept asleep with gas anesthetic). The
      investigators will also test all patients for the presence of apolipoprotein (ApoE-Îμ4 type
      of gene that is present in 15-20% of patients), and beta-amyloid tau protein (present in
      cerebrospinal fluid) that are known risk factors for Alzheimers disease. The particular
      strength of this study is that it takes into account whether the frequency and/or severity of
      dementia and Alzheimers disease is different in patients with and without these markers. The
      investigators believe that this study will make a major contribution to better understanding
      of development of Alzheimers disease.

    <intervention_model_description>The proposed study will be a prospective, multicenter, cluster randomization clinical trial comparing two different anesthetic techniques in elderly patients (&gt; 65 years of age) undergoing urology/orthopedic/general surgery. The study will follow a cluster design; patients undergoing orthopedic or vascular surgery will have spinal anesthesia, where standard practice. Patients undergoing urology or general surgery will receive general anesthesia, also where it is standard practice. Patients with severe dementia will be excluded.</intervention_model_description>

A mixture of Air/O2 will be used to maintain adequate oxygenation. Nitrous oxide will not be used.</description>
