  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well sorafenib tosylate and yttrium Y 90 glass microspheres
      work in treating patients with liver cancer that cannot be removed by surgery. Sorafenib
      tosylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell
      growth. Yttrium Y 90 glass microspheres use glass beads to carry radiation directly to tumor
      cells without harming normal cells. Giving sorafenib tosylate with yttrium Y 90 glass
      microspheres may be an effective treatment for liver cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Median progression-free survival (PFS).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Overall survival (OS). II. Time to radiographic progression (TTRP). III. To evaluate the
      safety of the combination of sorafenib (sorafenib tosylate) and Yttrium-90; adverse events
      (National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0
      [NCI-CTAE v 4.0]).

      OTHER OBJECTIVES:

      I. Predictive biomarkers of response to therapy and survival: will assess pre-treatment
      plasma level of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) as above, and assess its predictive
      ability of time to progression (TTP) and OS.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive sorafenib tosylate orally (PO) twice daily (BID). After 4 weeks, patients
      receive yttrium Y 90 glass microspheres intra-arterially (IA). Courses of sorafenib tosylate
      repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.
