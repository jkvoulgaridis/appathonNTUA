  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is the most powerful antidepressant treatment available and
      is often life-saving. There are concerns, however, that standard bitemporal ECT (the most
      commonly used form of ECT worldwide) causes persisting retrograde amnesia. However, clinical
      trials have indicated that high-dose unilateral ECT may be as effective as bitemporal ECT but
      have much less cognitive side-effects.

      The trial aims to test the primary experimental hypothesis: High-dose (6 x ST) right
      unilateral ECT is as effective as (i.e. not inferior to) standard (1.5 x ST) bitemporal ECT
      for severe depression in terms of Hamilton Depression Rating Score (HDRS) at the end of the
      treatment course.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a two-group parallel design randomised controlled non-inferiority trial and has
      been registered (ISRCTN23577151). Consented patients with major depressive disorder (DSM-IV)
      will be randomly allocated to a course of bitemporal (BT) ECT (1.5 x ST) or high-dose right
      unilateral (RUL) ECT (6.0 x ST). To facilitate generalizability of results, the trial takes
      place under &quot;real world&quot; conditions and so both groups continue usual care and medications
      during the treatment phase and thereafter. Patients are followed-up for 12 months after
      completing their allocated course of ECT. Completion of the primary outcome depression-rating
      measure (i.e. HDRS) and the secondary outcome of most interest (autobiographical memory,
      using the AMI-SF) will be prioritised in the data collection.

      Patients, their treating clinicians and raters are blind to treatment; clinicians
      administering ECT are not involved in post randomisation assessments or formal data analysis.
      Success of blinding for patients and raters will be assessed after the second and final
      treatments. The trial statistician is also blinded to allocation status.

      Sample size: In a large series (n = 253) of depressed patients, Petrides et al. (2001) found
      a mean (SD) reduction in 24-item HDRS of 25.6 (9.4) after treatment with bitemporalT ECT (1.5
      x ST). We therefore estimate that 69 patients will be required per treatment group to have
      80% power to demonstrate, using a one-sided equivalence t-test at 5% level, that mean
      reduction in 24-item HDRS achieved using high-dose RUL ECT is no more than 4 points (i.e.
      equivalent to 3 points on 17-item HDRS) less than that achieved using standard BT ECT,
      assuming a common within-group SD of change scores of 9.4 and equal expected group mean
      change scores.

    <measure>Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>HDRS scores were obtained at baseline, end of allocated ECT treatment, and at 3 and 6 month follow-up timepoints.</time_frame>
    <description>The HDRS was originally designed to assess severity of depressive symptoms in patients with a primary depressive illness and is now the most commonly used measure of depression severity. It was first published in a 17-item format with the optional addition of 4 items making up the 21-item version. In addition to the original 21 items, the 24-item HDRS includes items on helplessness, hopelessness and worthlessness; its score range is 0-77, with higher scores reflecting greater burden of depressive symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Columbia Autobiographical Memory Interview-Short Form (AMI-SF)</measure>
    <time_frame>end of allocated ECT course</time_frame>
    <description>The AMI-SF is used to assess retrospective autobiographical memory function. It has six categories, which involve five questions each, about a family member, most recent travel, last New Year's Eve, last birthday, most recent employment and last visit to a doctor for a physical complaint. At baseline interviewers encourage the participant to recall as much information as they can. Responses at baseline can be scored either two points, for a recognisable real memory, or zero for no memory or too little information to constitute a proper memory. Only those questions for which a memory had been retrieved at baseline are examined at follow-up. Follow-up assessments are scored as percentage recall of baseline score, which is scored as 100% irrespective of actual performance..</description>

    <description>ECT is administered twice weekly with hand-held electrodes using the Mecta 5000M device following a standard stimulus dosing protocol. Seizure duration is measured by EEG monitoring. Methohexitone (0.75-1.0 mg/kg) is used for anaesthesia with suxamethonium (0.5-1.0 mg/kg) as muscle relaxant. Seizure threshold (ST) is established by a method of limits at the first session and subsequent treatments will be given at 1.5 x ST for BT ECT and 6.0 x ST for RUL ECT. To reflect routine clinical practice, number of ECT treatments is determined by referring physicians who will be blind to randomisation. The treatment period varies between patients to allow up to 12 administrations of ECT, i.e. up to 6 weeks.</description>

        <title>Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS)</title>
        <description>The HDRS was originally designed to assess severity of depressive symptoms in patients with a primary depressive illness and is now the most commonly used measure of depression severity. It was first published in a 17-item format with the optional addition of 4 items making up the 21-item version. In addition to the original 21 items, the 24-item HDRS includes items on helplessness, hopelessness and worthlessness; its score range is 0-77, with higher scores reflecting greater burden of depressive symptoms.</description>
        <time_frame>HDRS scores were obtained at baseline, end of allocated ECT treatment, and at 3 and 6 month follow-up timepoints.</time_frame>

Seizure duration is measured by EEG monitoring. Seizure threshold (ST) is established by a method of limits at the first session and subsequent treatments will be given at 1.5 x ST for BT ECT and 6.0 x ST for RUL ECT. To reflect routine clinical practice, number of ECT treatments is determined by referring physicians who will be blind to randomisation.

        <description>The AMI-SF is used to assess retrospective autobiographical memory function. It has six categories, which involve five questions each, about a family member, most recent travel, last New Year's Eve, last birthday, most recent employment and last visit to a doctor for a physical complaint. At baseline interviewers encourage the participant to recall as much information as they can. Responses at baseline can be scored either two points, for a recognisable real memory, or zero for no memory or too little information to constitute a proper memory. Only those questions for which a memory had been retrieved at baseline are examined at follow-up. Follow-up assessments are scored as percentage recall of baseline score, which is scored as 100% irrespective of actual performance..</description>

            <description>Twice-weekly high-dose right modified unilateral ECT twice weekly at 6 times the seizure threshold. Methohexitone (0.75-1.0 mg/kg) is used for anaesthesia with suxamethonium (0.5-1.0mg/kg) for muscle relaxation.
Seizure threshold (ST) is established by a method of limits at the first session and subsequent treatments will be given at 6.0 x ST for RUL ECT. To reflect routine clinical practice, number of ECT treatments is determined by referring physicians who will be blind to randomisation. The treatment period varies between patients to allow up to 12 administrations of ECT, i.e. up to 6 weeks.</description>

          <title>Columbia Autobiographical Memory Interview-Short Form (AMI-SF)</title>
          <description>The AMI-SF is used to assess retrospective autobiographical memory function. It has six categories, which involve five questions each, about a family member, most recent travel, last New Year's Eve, last birthday, most recent employment and last visit to a doctor for a physical complaint. At baseline interviewers encourage the participant to recall as much information as they can. Responses at baseline can be scored either two points, for a recognisable real memory, or zero for no memory or too little information to constitute a proper memory. Only those questions for which a memory had been retrieved at baseline are examined at follow-up. Follow-up assessments are scored as percentage recall of baseline score, which is scored as 100% irrespective of actual performance..</description>
