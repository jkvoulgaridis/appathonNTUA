      This study will provide much needed information about how to optimize the quality of care and
      quality of life of Veterans who are survivors of prostate cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although there are nearly 150,000 prostate cancer survivors in the VA, there has been little
      research to understand and improve survivorship care for this large population of Veterans. A
      substantial proportion of prostate cancer survivors in the general population have
      significant side effects from treatment (surgery or radiation therapy) that often persist for
      years, including incontinence, erectile dysfunction, and metabolic syndrome, all of which can
      contribute to decreased quality of life. The investigators' pilot data suggests that VA
      prostate cancer survivors experience similar or worse symptom burden to that of the general
      population of survivors. To address the need to improve patient-centered survivorship care
      management for Veterans with prostate cancer, the investigators propose a 4 year study with
      two aims: 1) to conduct a randomized controlled trial to compare a personally tailored
      automated telephone symptom management intervention for improving symptoms and symptom
      self-management to usual care. The investigators expect that those in the intervention group
      will have more confidence in symptom self-management and better symptom self-management and
      prostate cancer quality of life following the intervention, and that these outcomes will
      translate to more efficient use of services for these Veterans, and 2) to compare utilization
      of services among those in the intervention group to those in the control group.

    <measure>The Expanded Prostate Cancer Index (EPIC) - Urinary Health, Irritative</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The EPIC is a 26-item measure that assesses symptom burden in four domains: urinary symptoms, bowel symptoms, sexual symptoms and vitality. Each domain has a subscale related to function and bother which together contribute to disease specific quality of life. Each domain has a range of possible scores from 0 to 100, with lower scores indicating worse symptom burden. Lower EPIC scores for any one domain are associated with lower function in that domain and lower QOL. Thus higher symptom burden, which reflects both function and bother scores, translate into lower EPIC scores.</description>

    <description>The intervention will consist of two components, both with content design based on established theories for self-management support: 1) automated telephone monitoring of PC survivor symptoms and goals for symptom reduction, based on a patient empowerment approach, and 2) personally tailored newsletters that incorporate elements of CBT to improve survivors' identification with the material, confidence/self-efficacy in symptom management, and to reduce common cognitive distortions related to successful implementation of behavior change. Intervention-group participants will receive four automated assessment and self-management support calls over a 3-month period (at baseline, 1-month, 2-month, 3-months). Information collected during automated phone assessments will be used to construct tailored newsletters, which will be sent following each automated call.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Enhanced Usual Care</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>No Intervention</arm_group_type>
    <description>Because of the strong evidence documenting symptom burden in PC survivors, the investigators believe that providing control subjects with some information about symptom self-management is warranted. The investigators further believe, based on the investigators' prior experience conducting RCTs, that offering some type of educational material for Veterans randomized to the control arm will increase their willingness to enroll in the study (as opposed to a pure usual care arm where they would not receive any such materials). Therefore, survivors randomized to the control condition will receive written material at the time of enrollment designed to educate them about PC symptoms and symptom management. Material will be approximately six pages in length, also written at or below an 8th grade reading level, and will include a summary of common symptoms experienced by prostate cancer survivors.</description>

          <title>IVR Intervention</title>
          <description>The intervention will consist of two components, both with content design based on established theories for self-management support: 1) automated telephone monitoring of PC survivor symptoms and goals for symptom reduction, based on a patient empowerment approach, and 2) personally tailored newsletters that incorporate elements of CBT to improve survivors' identification with the material, confidence/self-efficacy in symptom management, and to reduce common cognitive distortions related to successful implementation of behavior change. Intervention-group participants will receive four automated assessment and self-management support calls over a 3-month period (at baseline, 1-month, 2-month, 3-months). Information collected during automated phone assessments will be used to construct tailored newsletters, which will be sent following each automated call.</description>

        <title>The Expanded Prostate Cancer Index (EPIC) - Urinary Health, Irritative</title>
        <description>The EPIC is a 26-item measure that assesses symptom burden in four domains: urinary symptoms, bowel symptoms, sexual symptoms and vitality. Each domain has a subscale related to function and bother which together contribute to disease specific quality of life. Each domain has a range of possible scores from 0 to 100, with lower scores indicating worse symptom burden. Lower EPIC scores for any one domain are associated with lower function in that domain and lower QOL. Thus higher symptom burden, which reflects both function and bother scores, translate into lower EPIC scores.</description>

Each domain has a subscale related to function and bother which together contribute to disease specific quality of life.

Lower EPIC scores for any one domain are associated with lower function in that domain and lower QOL.

          <description>The EPIC is a 26-item measure that assesses symptom burden in four domains: urinary symptoms, bowel symptoms, sexual symptoms and vitality. Each domain has a subscale related to function and bother which together contribute to disease specific quality of life. Each domain has a range of possible scores from 0 to 100, with lower scores indicating worse symptom burden. Lower EPIC scores for any one domain are associated with lower function in that domain and lower QOL. Thus higher symptom burden, which reflects both function and bother scores, translate into lower EPIC scores.</description>

        <description>The EPIC is a 26-item measure that assesses symptom burden in four domains: urinary symptoms, bowel symptoms, sexual symptoms and vitality. Each domain has a subscale related to function and bother which together contribute to disease specific quality of life. Each domain has a range of possible scores from 0 to 100, with lower scores indicating worse symptom burden. Lower EPIC scores for any one domain are associated with lower function in that domain and lower QOL.

Intervention-group participants will receive four automated assessment and self-management support calls over a 3-month period (at baseline, 1-month, 2-month, 3-months). Information collected during automated phone assessments will be used to construct tailored newsletters, which will be sent following each automated call.</description>

        <title>Perceived Efficacy in Patient-Physician Interactions (PEPPI) - 5-item Short Form</title>
        <description>Self-efficacy in patient-physician interactions was assessed at 5 and 12 months using a five-item short form version of the Perceived Efficacy in Patient-Physician Interactions (PEPPI). The PEPPI was developed to measure older patients' self-efficacy in obtaining medical information and attention to their medical concerns from physicians. Scores range from 0-25 with higher scores indicating higher self-efficacy.</description>

Intervention-group participants will receive four automated assessment and self-management support calls over a 3-month period (at baseline, 1-month, 2-month, 3-months).

Therefore, survivors randomized to the control condition will receive written material at the time of enrollment designed to educate them about PC symptoms and symptom management. Material will be approximately six pages in length, also written at or below an 8th grade reading level, and will include a summary of common symptoms experienced by prostate cancer survivors.</description>
