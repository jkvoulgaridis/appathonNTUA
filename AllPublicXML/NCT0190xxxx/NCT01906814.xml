  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether 3 cycles of chemotherapy(CEV) are as
      effective as 6 cycles of chemotherapy(CEV) in the treatment of Stage I enucleated
      retinoblastoma.

      This study will be a phase â…¢ open label interventional case series. Patients with Stage I
      enucleated retinoblastoma will be randomized to receive chemotherapy(CEV) of 3 cycles or 6
      cycles on a monthly basis. Patients will be followed for 24 months.

    <description>quality of life (PedsQL4.0 scale) before each treatment, and 1,3,6,9,12,18,24 months after the treatment.PedsQL 4.0 questionnaire has two modules (reported by parents and children) with 23 items encompassing the physical domains (8 items), emotional (5 items), social (5 items) and school (5 items). A five scores scale is used, after being asked, ''How much, in the last month, your child has had problems with'' (0 = never a problem; 1 = almost never a problem; 2 = sometimes a problem; 3 = is often a problem and 4 = almost always a problem). The items are reverse-score and linearly transformed to a scale from 0 to 100 (0=100, 1=75, 2=50, 3=25, 4 = 0). So high scores indicate better QoL.</description>
