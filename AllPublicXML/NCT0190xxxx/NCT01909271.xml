  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of the proposed intervention is to reduce stroke disparities by
      overcoming pre-hospital barriers related to emergency stroke treatment and facilitating the
      appropriate response to acute stroke using a novel culturally-tailored and sustainable
      approach developed by an experienced transdisciplinary team. Building on our previous work,
      in which the investigators have identified barriers to increasing stroke literacy and
      behavioral intent to call 911, the investigators will develop and evaluate the effectiveness
      of a novel, culturally tailored intervention using storytelling (narrative persuasion) in the
      form of two professionally produced 12-minute films (in English and Spanish), in minority
      populations in New York City (NYC). Behavioral intent to call 911 will be assessed
      immediately after viewing the film, 6 months later, and one year later.

    <textblock>
      Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability and costs U.S. taxpayers &gt;$60 billion
      annually. Interventions designed to educate patients to seek treatment sooner when a stroke
      occurs may increase low rates of treatment with thrombolysis (current rates 3% national
      average). Thrombolysis can increase the odds of minimal to zero disability from stroke if
      emergency medical system response times and in-hospital response times are optimized (maximum
      time from symptom onset to intravenous thrombolysis is 4.5 hours). Black and Hispanic
      Americans have higher stroke incidence compared to Whites and are less likely to receive
      thrombolysis for acute stroke. The latency to hospital arrival is largely dependent on
      patients' recognition of stroke symptoms, and immediate presentation to the emergency
      department. The investigators have found very low stroke literacy rates among Blacks and
      Hispanics compared to Whites, which may, in part, be responsible for disparities in acute
      stroke treatment.

    <description>The Stroke Action Test (STAT) contains 21 items that name or describe stroke symptoms from all 5 groups of warning signs and 7 items that are nonstroke symptoms. For each item, the respondent selects 1 of 4 options: call 911, call doctor, wait 1 hour, or wait 1 day. For scoring purposes, each correct response receives 1 point; incorrect responses receive 0 points. The total score is reported as percent of correct responses. Scores range from 0% to 100% with a higher score indicating a better outcome.</description>

             diabetes, tobacco, abdominal obesity, heart disease, high cholesterol);

          3. Over age 34 years at onset of intervention (we have selected this age cut off due to
             the large increase in stroke incidence among minority groups at age 34 );

          4. Self-identified as Black or Hispanic; and

          5. Member of a church congregation who lives in a household with a telephone.
