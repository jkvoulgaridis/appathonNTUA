    <textblock>
      This is a two-part, multicenter, open label, non-randomized, phase Ib/II study to assess the
      safety and tolerability, Maximum Tolerated Dose and preliminary efficacy of Givinostat in
      patients with JAK2V617F positive Polycythemia Vera. Part A is the dose finding part while
      Part B is assessing the preliminary efficacy. Patients will be enrolled either in Part A or
      Part B and transition from one part to the other is not allowed.

      Eligible patients for this study will have a confirmed diagnosis of Polycythemia Vera
      according to the revised World Health Organization criteria. Only if the enrolment in Part A
      is slow (i.e. &lt; 5 patients enrolled in 3 months), eligibility for this part of the study may
      be expanded to all patients with chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms.

      Study therapy will be administered in 28 day cycles (4 weeks of treatment). Disease response
      will be evaluated according to the European LeukemiaNet criteria after 3 and 6 cycles (i.e.
      at weeks 12 and 24, respectively) of treatment with Givinostat for both parts of the study.
      All phlebotomies performed in the first 3 weeks of treatment will not be counted to assess
      the clinico-haematological response.

      The study will last up to a maximum of 24 weeks of treatment. However, after completion of
      the trial, all patients achieving clinical benefit will be allowed to continue treatment with
      Givinostat (at the same dose and schedule) in a long-term study.

      Safety will be monitored at each visit throughout the entire duration of the study. Treatment
      will be administered on an outpatient basis and patients will be followed regularly with
      physical and laboratory tests, as specified in the protocol; in case of hospitalization, the
      treatment will be continued or interrupted according to the Investigators' decision.

      This is a two-part, multicenter, open label, non-randomized, phase Ib/II study to assess the
      safety and tolerability, MTD and preliminary efficacy of Givinostat in patients with
      JAK2V617F positive PV.

      Part A is the dose escalation portion of the study and, once the MTD has been established,
      Part B will commence where the preliminary efficacy of Givinostat in PV patients will be
      established. Patients will be enrolled either in Part A or Part B and transition from one
      part to the other is not allowed. Only PV patients from Part A assigned to the dose selected
      for Part B (MTD) may be counted towards the efficacy assessment in Part B.

      Eligible patients for this study will have a confirmed diagnosis of PV according to the
      revised WHO criteria and the JAK2V617F positivity. Only if the enrolment in Part A is slow
      (i.e. &lt; 5 patients enrolled in 3 months), eligibility for this part of the study may be
      expanded to all patients with cMPN.

      After providing informed written consent before undertaking any protocol-related procedure, a
      unique patient identification code (i.e. patient screening ID which will be a combination of
      his/her site ID, study part ID and patient screening number, e.g. IT01-A01) will be assigned
      to each patient and it will identify the patient within his/her enrolment confirmation by
      Italfarmaco S.p.A. or its designee and never be reused in case of screening failure. After
      the enrolment confirmation and the assignation of the dose level before the first drug
      intake, a unique patient identification code (i.e. patient ID which will be a combination of
      patient screening number ID and dose level ID, e.g. IT01-A01-DL1) will be assigned to each
      patient and it will identify the patient throughout his/her participation in the study and
      never be reused in case of premature drop-out.

      Study therapy will be administered in 28 day cycles. In fact, the &quot;cycle&quot; is defined as 4
      weeks of treatment.

      Disease response will be evaluated according to the clinico-haematological ELN criteria after
      3 and 6 cycles (i.e. at weeks 12 and 24, respectively) of treatment with Givinostat for both
      parts of the study. All phlebotomies performed in the first 3 weeks of treatment will not be
      counted to assess the clinico-haematological response.

      The study will last up to a maximum of 24 weeks of treatment. However, after completion of
      the trial, all patients achieving clinical benefit will be allowed to continue treatment with
      Givinostat (at the same dose and schedule) in a long-term study (Study N.: DSC/11/2357/44).

      Safety will be monitored at each visit throughout the entire duration of the study. Treatment
      will be administered on an outpatient basis and patients will be followed regularly with
      physical and laboratory tests, as specified in the protocol; in case of hospitalization, the
      treatment will be continued or interrupted according to the Investigators' decision.

    <time_frame>168 days (up to Cycle 6 Day 28 in Part A).</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluations were performed on the type, incidence and severity of TEAEs, graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v. 4.03, following administration of givinostat for up to 6 cycles of treatment in Part A. Grades 1 through 5 were as follows: Grade 1: Mild; Grade 2: Moderate; Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life threatening or requiring hospitalisation; Grade 4: Life threatening consequences; Grade 5: Death related to AE. Results are reported as number of patients with TEAEs for each of the indicated categories. Definitions: drug-related TEAE / treatment-emergent serious adverse event (TESAE) corresponded to reasonable suspicion that the TEAE / TESAE was associated with the use of the study drug, according to investigator assessment; discontinuation refers to discontinuation from treatment.</description>

    <time_frame>28 days (up to Cycle 1 Day 28 in Part A).</time_frame>
    <description>The MTD of givinostat was based only on Cycle 1 DLTs. A DLT was defined as the following drug-related toxicity:
Grade 4 hematological toxicity, or
Grade 3 febrile neutropenia, or
Grade ≥3 non-hematological toxicity (with the exception Grade 3 diarrhea without adequate supportive care lasting less than 3 days, and Grade 3 nausea or vomiting without adequate supportive care lasting less than 3 days), or
Any drug-related serious AE, or
Any toxicity clearly not related to disease progression or intercurrent illness requiring interruption of dosing for more than 3 days during first cycle.
At end of Cycle 1, for the third patient in each DL, the safety of the 3 patients treated for 1 cycle was reviewed and it was decided if the dose should be escalated or not. Results are reported as the number of patients with DLT events for Cycle 1 in Part A.</description>

      <recruitment_details>This was a 2-part, multisite, open-label, non-randomized study to assess givinostat in patients with JAK2^V617F positive Polycythemia Vera. Part A assessed safety and was the dose escalation portion of study, while Part B assessed preliminary efficacy. Patients were enrolled in 5 countries (France, Germany, Italy, Poland and the United Kingdom).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Patients were enrolled into either Part A or Part B, transition from 1 part to the other was not allowed. 48 patients were enrolled into the study overall: 12 patients in Part A to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and 36 patients in Part B.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Number of Patients Experiencing Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) in Part A of the Study</title>
        <description>Evaluations were performed on the type, incidence and severity of TEAEs, graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v. 4.03, following administration of givinostat for up to 6 cycles of treatment in Part A. Grades 1 through 5 were as follows: Grade 1: Mild; Grade 2: Moderate; Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life threatening or requiring hospitalisation; Grade 4: Life threatening consequences; Grade 5: Death related to AE. Results are reported as number of patients with TEAEs for each of the indicated categories. Definitions: drug-related TEAE / treatment-emergent serious adverse event (TESAE) corresponded to reasonable suspicion that the TEAE / TESAE was associated with the use of the study drug, according to investigator assessment; discontinuation refers to discontinuation from treatment.</description>

          <description>Evaluations were performed on the type, incidence and severity of TEAEs, graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v. 4.03, following administration of givinostat for up to 6 cycles of treatment in Part A. Grades 1 through 5 were as follows: Grade 1: Mild; Grade 2: Moderate; Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life threatening or requiring hospitalisation; Grade 4: Life threatening consequences; Grade 5: Death related to AE. Results are reported as number of patients with TEAEs for each of the indicated categories. Definitions: drug-related TEAE / treatment-emergent serious adverse event (TESAE) corresponded to reasonable suspicion that the TEAE / TESAE was associated with the use of the study drug, according to investigator assessment; discontinuation refers to discontinuation from treatment.</description>

Grades 1 through 5 were as follows: Grade 1: Mild; Grade 2: Moderate; Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life threatening or requiring hospitalisation; Grade 4: Life threatening consequences; Grade 5: Death related to AE. Results are reported as number of patients with TEAEs for each of the indicated categories. Definitions: drug-related TEAE / TESAE corresponded to reasonable suspicion that the TEAE / TESAE was associated with the use of the study drug, according to investigator assessment; discontinuation refers to discontinuation from treatment.</description>

        <description>ORR, CR and PR following administration of givinostat at MTD for 3 cycles in Part B, reported as percentage of patients with a response. Response was evaluated according to the clinico-hematological European LeukemiaNet (ELN) response criteria. If Investigator's clinical response assessment (taking into account the overall medical judgment of the specific patient's case) was not in agreement with exact application of the ELN response criteria, the Investigator's assessment superseded the mathematical application of these criteria and was used for analysis.
CR defined as:

White Blood Cell count ≤10 x10^9/L, and
Normal spleen size, and
No disease-related systemic symptoms (i.e. pruritus, headache, microvascular disturbances).

        <title>Number of Patients Experiencing TEAEs After 6 Cycles in Part B of the Study</title>
        <description>Evaluations were performed on the type, incidence and severity of TEAEs, graded according to CTCAE v. 4.03, following administration of givinostat at the MTD for up to 6 cycles of treatment in Part B. Grades 1 through 5 were as follows: Grade 1: Mild; Grade 2: Moderate; Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life threatening or requiring hospitalisation; Grade 4: Life threatening consequences; Grade 5: Death related to AE. Results are reported as number of patients with TEAEs for each of the indicated categories. Definitions: drug-related TEAE / TESAE corresponded to reasonable suspicion that the TEAE / TESAE was associated with the use of the study drug, according to investigator assessment; discontinuation refers to discontinuation from treatment. Results are reported as number of patients with TEAEs for each of the indicated categories.</description>

            <description>In Part B, patients were assigned to receive the starting dose of givinostat by oral administration at the MTD determined in Part A (i.e. 100 mg b.i.d.). Patients were treated for up to 6 cycles (28 days in each cycle). Based on evaluations performed as part of the visit procedures on Day 28 of each cycle up to Cycle 5 and/or in any necessary additional study visit, the givinostat dose was decreased if appropriate for any patients that met dose reduction criteria.</description>

        <title>Assessment of Area Under Plasma Concentration Versus the Time Curve up to the Last Detectable Concentration (AUClast) of Givinostat and Metabolites (ITF2374 and ITF2375) in Part A of the Study</title>
        <description>PK evaluation of givinostat and metabolites (ITF2374 and ITF2375) by assessment of AUClast following administration of givinostat for 1 cycle in Part A. PK calculations were performed by standard non-compartmental analysis and AUClast was calculated using the linear trapezoidal rule. Results are reported for Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 1 Day 28.
Note: concentration data for ITF2374 (Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 1 Day 28) and for ITF2375 (Cycle 1 Day 1) in the DL0 dose group of Part A were not available for PK analysis.</description>
        <time_frame>Blood samples were collected in Part A on Cycle 1 Day 1: pre-dose and 2, 3 and 8 hours post-dose; and on Cycle 1 Day 28: pre-dose and 1, 2, 4 and 8 hours post-dose.</time_frame>
        <population>The PK analysis set included all SAF patients with at least 1 PK assessment. Only patients with data available for analysis at each time point are presented.</population>

        <title>Assessment of Area Under Plasma Concentration Versus the Time Curve in the Dosing Interval (0-12 Hours) (AUC0-12) of Givinostat and Metabolites (ITF2374 and ITF2375) in Part A of the Study</title>
        <description>PK evaluation of givinostat and metabolites (ITF2374 and ITF2375) by assessment of AUC0-12 following administration of givinostat for 1 cycle in Part A. PK calculations were performed by standard non-compartmental analysis and AUC0-12 was calculated using the linear trapezoidal rule. Results are reported for Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 1 Day 28.
Note:concentration data for ITF2374 (Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 1 Day 28) across all dose groups and for ITF2375 (Cycle 1 Day 1) in the DL0 dose group of Part A were not available for PK analysis.</description>

        <title>Assessment of Cmax of Givinostat and Metabolites (ITF2374 and ITF2375) in Part B of the Study</title>
        <description>PK evaluation of givinostat and metabolites (ITF2374 and ITF2375) by assessment of Cmax following administration of givinostat for 2 cycles in Part B. PK calculations were performed by standard non-compartmental analysis. Following definition of the MTD in Part A, during Part B Cycle 1, givinostat was administered at 100 mg b.i.d. and during Part B Cycle 2 was administered at 100 mg, 75 mg and 50 mg b.i.d. (since dose reductions due to TEAEs were allowed from Cycle 2 onwards, as per protocol). Results are reported for Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 2 Day 28 for the doses administered during Part B.
Note: PK evaluation for the givinostat 75 mg and 50 mg b.i.d. dose groups for Cycle 1 Day 1 was not applicable (since all received givinostat 100 mg b.i.d.). Additionally, concentration data for ITF2375 (Cycle 1 Day 28) in the 50 mg b.i.d. dose group was not available for PK analysis.</description>

        <title>Assessment of Tmax of Givinostat and Metabolites (ITF2374 and ITF2375) in Part B of the Study</title>
        <description>PK evaluation of givinostat and metabolites (ITF2374 and ITF2375) by assessment of Tmax following administration of givinostat for 2 cycles in Part B. PK calculations were performed by standard non-compartmental analysis. Following definition of the MTD in Part A, during Part B Cycle 1, givinostat was administered at 100 mg b.i.d. and during Part B Cycle 2 was administered at 100 mg, 75 mg and 50 mg b.i.d. (since dose reductions due to TEAEs were allowed from Cycle 2 onwards, as per protocol). Results are reported for Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 2 Day 28 for the doses administered during Part B.
Note: PK evaluation for the givinostat 75 mg and 50 mg b.i.d. dose groups for Cycle 1 Day 1 was not applicable (since all received givinostat 100 mg b.i.d.). Additionally, concentration data for ITF2375 (Cycle 1 Day 28) in the 50 mg b.i.d. dose group was not available for PK analysis.</description>
        <time_frame>Blood samples were collected in Part B on Cycle 1 Day 1: pre-dose and 2, 3 and 8 hours post-dose; and on Cycle 2 Day 28: pre-dose and 1, 2, 4 and 8 hours post-dose.</time_frame>
        <population>The PK analysis set included all SAF patients with at least 1 PK assessment. Only patients with data available for analysis at each time point are presented.</population>

(since dose reductions due to TEAEs were allowed from Cycle 2 onwards, as per protocol). Results are reported for Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 2 Day 28 for the doses administered during Part B.
Note: PK evaluation for the givinostat 75 mg and 50 mg b.i.d. dose groups for Cycle 1 Day 1 was not applicable (since all received givinostat 100 mg b.i.d.). Additionally, concentration data for ITF2375 (Cycle 1 Day 28) in the 50 mg b.i.d. dose group was not available for PK analysis.</description>

        <description>PK evaluation of givinostat and metabolites (ITF2374 and ITF2375) by assessment of AUClast following administration of givinostat for 2 cycles in Part B. PK calculations were performed by standard non-compartmental analysis and AUClast was calculated using the linear trapezoidal rule. Following definition of the MTD in Part A, during Part B Cycle 1, givinostat was administered at 100 mg b.i.d. and during Part B Cycle 2 was administered at 100 mg, 75 mg and 50 mg b.i.d. (since dose reductions due to TEAEs were allowed from Cycle 2 onwards, as per protocol). Results are reported for Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 2 Day 28 for the for the doses administered during Part B.
Note: PK evaluation for the givinostat 75 mg and 50 mg b.i.d. dose groups for Cycle 1 Day 1 was not applicable (since all received givinostat 100 mg b.i.d.). Additionally, concentration data for ITF2375 (Cycle 1 Day 28) in the 50 mg b.i.d. dose group was not available for PK analysis.</description>

        <title>Assessment of AUC0-12 of Givinostat and Metabolites (ITF2374 and ITF2375) in Part B of the Study</title>
        <description>PK evaluation of givinostat and metabolites (ITF2374 and ITF2375) by assessment of AUC0-12 following administration of givinostat for 2 cycles in Part B. PK calculations were performed by standard non-compartmental analysis and AUClast was calculated using the linear trapezoidal rule. Following definition of the MTD in Part A, during Part B Cycle 1, givinostat was administered at 100 mg b.i.d. and during Part B Cycle 2 was administered at 100 mg, 75 mg and 50 mg b.i.d. (since dose reductions due to TEAEs were allowed from Cycle 2 onwards, as per protocol). Results are reported for Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 2 Day 28 for the doses administered during Part B.
Note: PK evaluation for the givinostat 75 mg and 50 mg b.i.d. dose groups for Cycle 1 Day 1 was not applicable (since all received givinostat 100 mg b.i.d.). Additionally, concentration data for ITF2374 (Cycle 1 Day 28) across all dose groups and for ITF2375 in the 50 mg b.i.d. dose group was not available for PK analysis.</description>
        <time_frame>Blood samples were collected in Part B on Cycle 1 Day 1: pre-dose and 2, 3 and 8 hours post-dose; and on Cycle 2 Day 28: pre-dose and 1, 2, 4 and 8 hours post-dose.</time_frame>
        <population>The PK analysis set included all SAF patients with at least 1 PK assessment. Only patients with data available for analysis at each time point are presented.</population>
