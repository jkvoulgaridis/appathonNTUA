  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are doing this research study to find out if taking Metformin improves
      walking ability in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). In PAD the arteries
      (blood vessels) in the legs are narrowed because of the build up of plaque. The leg muscle
      can hurt in patients with PAD and this is usually described as a cramp or tiredness. This
      pain is called intermittent claudication. Metformin is an FDA approved medication for the
      treatment of diabetes. The investigators believe that Metformin may help your leg muscles
      work better.

      The investigators will enroll up to 100 subjects in order to find 60 subjects with PAD at
      Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a manifestation of atherosclerosis that affects more than
      7 million adults in the US. The prevalence of PAD increases with age and is estimated to be
      15 20% among individuals 65 years of age and older. Patients with PAD have limited functional
      capacity; they walk more slowly and have less walking endurance than persons who do not have
      PAD, irrespective of whether they have classic symptoms of intermittent claudication or
      critical limb ischemia. This functional impairment adversely affects quality of life.
      Although flow limitation due to atherosclerotic stenosis is necessary for the development of
      symptoms in PAD, the lack of correlation between walking capacity and the degree of
      hemodynamic compromise raises the possibility that alternative mechanisms contribute to
      functional limitations in these patients. Putative mechanisms include inadequate skeletal
      muscle glucose uptake, altered skeletal muscle energetics, and impaired vasomotor tone and
      nutrient delivery mediated by endothelial dysfunction. Metformin, via AMPactivated protein
      kinase (AMPK)-dependent and independent mechanisms, can favorably affect skeletal muscle
      metabolic functions including glucose uptake, fatty acid oxidation, mitochondrial function,
      and consequently cellular energetics, and it also may have a direct salutary effect on
      vascular function via regulation of nitric oxide synthase. It is intriguing, therefore, to
      consider the possibility that metformin would improve skeletal muscle metabolic and vascular
      function in older patients with PAD and translate into functional benefits. Accordingly, the
      investigators seek to elucidate molecular mechanisms through which metformin affects skeletal
      muscle energetics and hypothesize that metformin will lead to advantageous metabolic,
      vascular, and physical functional changes in older patients with PAD.

    <measure>Change in PCr Recovery Time</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>PCr recovery time, measured in seconds, is a measure of skeletal muscle metabolic function. PCr is a transport molecule and reservoir of high-energy phosphate bonds, which is important for cellular energetics. Phosphocreatine regeneration depends upon the skeletal muscle mitochondrial cells capacity for oxidative phosphorylation. We will measure PCr recovery time at baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment with metformin or placebo as an in vivo measure of mitochondrial function. Higher Pcr relative to P(i) during recovery is better and shorter recovery times are better.</description>

    <measure>Change in Flow-mediated Dilation (FMD)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Flow mediated vasodilation of the brachial artery is a measure of endothelium-dependent vasodilation. Higher flow-mediated dilation (FMD), measured as the diameter of the brachial artery in millimeters, and reported as percent change after a flow stimulus compered to basal measurement, is better, indicative of better endothelial function.</description>

        <title>Change in PCr Recovery Time</title>
        <description>PCr recovery time, measured in seconds, is a measure of skeletal muscle metabolic function. PCr is a transport molecule and reservoir of high-energy phosphate bonds, which is important for cellular energetics. Phosphocreatine regeneration depends upon the skeletal muscle mitochondrial cells capacity for oxidative phosphorylation. We will measure PCr recovery time at baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment with metformin or placebo as an in vivo measure of mitochondrial function. Higher Pcr relative to P(i) during recovery is better and shorter recovery times are better.</description>
