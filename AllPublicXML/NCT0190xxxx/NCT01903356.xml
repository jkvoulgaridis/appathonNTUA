  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) After 24 Weeks of Treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome has measured difference between HbA1c values from baseline to 24 weeks post treatment. The term 'baseline' refers to the last observation prior to the administration of any study medication. HbA1c is a form of hemoglobin, a blood pigment that carries oxygen, which is bound to glucose. The term HbA1c also refers to glycated hemoglobin. High levels of HbA1c (Normal range is less than 6%) indicate poorer control of diabetes than level in normal range.</description>

    <measure>Target Effectiveness Response Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>24 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Occurrence of treatment to target effectiveness response is an HbA1c under treatment of &lt; 6.5% after 24 weeks of treatment. This outcome measures percentage of patients achieving HbA1c &lt; 6.5% after 24 weeks.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Relative Effectiveness Response Rate</measure>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This is an observational study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who had been administered with TrajentaDuo® Tablets. The Case Report Forms of 724 subjects investigated by 15 investigators at 14 hospitals were retrieved from November 15, 2012 up to September 13, 2017.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>All patients were screened for eligibility to participate in the trial. Subjects attended specialist sites which would then ensure that all subjects met all inclusion/exclusion criteria. Subjects were not to be enrolled in the study if any one of the specific entry criteria were violated.</pre_assignment_details>
