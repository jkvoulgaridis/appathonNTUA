      The purpose of this trial is to determine the efficacy of spinal cord stimulation to produce
      an effective cough in patients with spinal cord injuries.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with cervical and thoracic spinal cord injuries often have paralysis of a major
      portion of their expiratory muscles — the muscles responsible for coughing — and therefore,
      lack a normal cough mechanism. Consequently, most of these patients suffer from a markedly
      reduced ability to clear airway secretions, a factor which contributes to the development of
      recurrent respiratory tract infections such as pneumonia and bronchitis. Expiratory muscles
      can be activated by electrical stimulation of the spinal roots to produce a functionally
      effective cough.

      The purpose of this trial is to determine if electrical stimulation of the expiratory muscles
      is capable of producing an effective cough on demand. According to the trial researchers, if
      successful, this technique will prevent the need for frequent patient suctioning — which
      often requires the constant presence of trained personnel. It will also allow spinal cord
      injured patients to clear their secretions more readily, thereby reducing the incidence of
      respiratory complications and associated illness and death.

      In the trial, researchers will study 18 adults (18-70 years old) with spinal injuries (T5
      level or higher), at least 12 months following the date of injury. After an evaluation of
      medical history, a brief physical examination, and initial testing, participants will have
      small electrodes (metal discs) placed — by a routine surgical procedure — over the surface of
      their spinal cords on the lower back to stimulate the expiratory muscles and restore cough.

    <description>The incidence of acute respiratory tract infections, defined by a change in the character, color, or amount of respiratory secretions and requiring antibiotic administration was tracked over the 2-year period prior to implantation of the cough system. The occurrence of respiratory tract infections was determined by subject history and corroborated by review of medical records, when available. After implantation of the cough system, the incidence of acute respiratory tract infections was tracked continually.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline (pre-implant) and 1 year follow up (post-implant)</time_frame>
    <description>The degree of caregiver support was determined as the number of times it was necessary for a caregiver to provide the subject with any form of assistive means of secretion clearance including suctioning, manually assisted cough or use of the insufflation-exsufflation device. Caregiver support was evaluated over a 2-week period prior to implantation of the cough stimulation system and continuously over the course of the initial year and again at the 1-year follow-up.</description>

    <description>The expiratory muscle stimulator consists of three small electrodes (metal discs) implanted over the surface of their spinal cords on the lower back to stimulate the expiratory muscles and restore cough. These electrodes are connected to an implanted receiver in the abdomen or chest wall. The device is activated through an external antenna connected to an external control box.</description>
