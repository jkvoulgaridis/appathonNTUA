  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study involving treatment for alcohol dependence (alcoholism). The study will
      combine motivational enhancement therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy (combined
      behavioral intervention, or CBI) and tests the benefits of continued/discontinued treatment
      with naltrexone in a randomized placebo-controlled trial. CBI may have advantages in
      motivating patients to greater medication adherence and may address psychosocial factors that
      may limit the effects of naltrexone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Naltrexone has been established as an efficacious medication to treat alcohol dependence but
      studies thus far have focused mostly on the acute phase of treatment rather than long-term
      management and have not offered alternative treatment strategies when patients do not respond
      to an initial course of naltrexone. For these initial non-responders to naltrexone, it is
      unclear what adjustments to treatment should be made to increase the likelihood of treatment
      success. We are unaware of previous research focused specifically on naltrexone non-response.
      Pilot data from ongoing trials at our center, however, suggest that up to a third of patients
      fail to respond to naltrexone. Moreover, these non-responsive patients go on to have the
      worst outcomes during the next 6 months of treatment if maintained on the same combination of
      naltrexone and medication management (MM). We propose to augment medication management with a
      combination of motivational enhancement therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy (combined
      behavioral intervention - CBI) and to test the benefits of continued/discontinued treatment
      with naltrexone in a randomized placebo-controlled trial. Clinical strategies for second line
      treatments often favor switching treatments rather than augmentation. However, there may be
      synergies between naltrexone and CBI that were not apparent with medication management.
      Specifically, CBI may have advantages in motivating patients to greater medication adherence
      (a leading cause of naltrexone treatment failure) and CBI may address psychosocial factors
      that limited or attenuated the effects of naltrexone.

             per day in males and over 4 drinks per day in females) in this same pre-treatment
             period, prior to intake.

          -  Prior to starting NTX, scores below 8 on the Clinical Inventory of Withdrawal from
             Alcohol (CIWA), and at least 3 consecutive days of abstinence (2 days abstinence will
             be permitted with approval by the principal investigator) directly prior to

             initial visit (a repeat UDSis permitted in cases that are not clear. The repeat UDS
             should be at least 5 days after the initial test)

          -  Has a lifetime DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia or any psychotic disorder. Has a
             current DSM-IV diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTST) or bipolar disorder,
