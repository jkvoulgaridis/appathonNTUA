      RATIONALE: Radiofrequency ablation may be effective in decreasing pain from bone metastases.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of radiofrequency ablation in decreasing
      pain in patients who have bone metastases.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the side effects of radiofrequency ablation in patients with bone metastases.

        -  Determine the effect of this regimen on pain in these patients.

        -  Determine the effect of this regimen on mood in these patients.

        -  Determine the effects of narcotic usage in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the relationship between laboratory and imaging features of this treatment and
           the effects of the treatment in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo percutaneous CT-guided radiofrequency ablation directly to the metastatic
      lesion over approximately 12 minutes.

      Pain and mood are assessed at baseline, daily for 14 days after treatment, and at 1 and 3
      months after treatment.

      Patients are followed at 1 week and then at 1 and 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 75 patients will be accrued for this study within 12.5
      months.

        4.1 Inclusion Criteria

        4.1.1 Histologically or cytologically documented malignant disease with a bone lesion that
        has the clinical and/imaging features of metastatic disease.

        4.1.2 Persistent intractable pain that results in a return visit to the oncologist. The
        measurable pain must be above a pain scale of five (scale of 0-10). (Pain during the last
        week described as &quot;the worst&quot; by the patient on a scale of 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain as bad
        as patient can imagine)).

        4.1.3 The patient's pain must be from a solitary site of metastatic disease in the bone.
        Each site must be amenable to RFA utilizing a percutaneous CT-guided approach. (RF
        electrode can be safely placed under CT guidance without harm to normal structures.) 4.1.4
        The maximum size of the bone metastasis (study site) must be no greater than 8 cm.

        4.1.5 Radiofrequency treatment can be performed within 5 days of baseline evaluations.

        4.1.6 All patients must understand and sign a study-specific informed consent.

        4.2 Exclusion Criteria

        4.2.1 Tumor mass in contact with hollow viscera. 4.2.2 Uncontrolled coagulopathy or
        bleeding diathesis that cannot be corrected with FFP and platelets prior to procedure.
        (Platelets must be â‰¥ 70,000/ul.) 4.2.3 Aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
        medications, antiplatelet medications, or warfarin must be discontinued prior to the
        procedure for a time period that is appropriate given the drug half life and the drugs
        known antiplatelet activity (e.g. aspirin for 7 days and ibuprofen 24 hours). Low molecular
        weight heparin preparations must be discontinued 24 hours prior to procedure.

        4.2.4 Tumor involves a weight-bearing long-bone of the lower extremity. 4.2.5 Site of tumor
        surgically stabilized with metallic hardware. 4.2.6 Previous (within 30 days immediately
        prior to RFA or post RFA) or scheduled concurrent systemic treatment of metastases with
        external beam radiation or radioisotopes. (Chemotherapy will not be allowed within 14 days
        prior to and within 14 days post RFA procedure).

        4.2.7 Patients with primary musculoskeletal malignancies, lymphoma and leukemia will not be
        RFA treatment candidates.

        4.2.8 Spinal metastases that do not have an intact cortex between the mass and the spinal
        canal and exiting nerve roots.

        4.2.8 Patients with a pacemaker.
