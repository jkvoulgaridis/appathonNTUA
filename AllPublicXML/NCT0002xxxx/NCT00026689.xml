      Background:

      -This protocol will provide a means for screening potential candidates for NCI Radiation
      Oncology Branch (ROB) protocols.

      Objectives:

      -To permit evaluation of patients referred to the NCI Radiation Oncology Branch in order to
      identify individuals who will be suitable candidates for Radiation Oncology Branch clinical
      research protocols.

      Eligibility:

      -Patients suspected of having, or with biopsy proven malignant disease or patients with a
      benign condition for whom radiotherapy is a potential treatment.

      Design:

      -This is a screening protocol. No investigational treatments will be administered on this
      protocol.
