  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

        -  This protocol acknowledges that it is in the interest of the NIH and ROB, as well as our
           patients, to continue to follow those who have been treated with radiotherapy at ROB and
           are not otherwise eligible for current active research protocols.

        -  It also provides a mechanism for the correlation and interpretation of disparate data
           for research into the long term side effects and outcomes for a variety of disease
           entities and treatments, such as combined modality treatment, MoAb, PDT, radiation
           modifiers, intraoperative radiotherapy, etc.

      Objective:

      -The primary objective of this protocol is to assess the late effects of treatment and the
      natural history of disease through collection of data from any standard procedures performed
      as part of follow up care on patients previously treated with radiotherapy in the Radiation
      Oncology Branch (ROB).

      Eligibility:

      -Patients who received radiation therapy at the NCI and are not entered on an interventional
      research protocol at the time of enrollment.

      Design:

        -  This is a natural history protocol in which data will be collected from Radiation
           Oncology Branch patients receiving standard of care long-term follow up care and
           evaluation, including NIH consultation services as required.

        -  It will be made clear to patients in the consent form, that data collected during their
           follow-up may be used anonymously for publications concerning the natural history of
           disease processes and long-term effects of treatment.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Radiation Oncology Branch investigator deems that it is in the best interests of the
        patient and the NCI/ROB for the patient to be seen in follow-up in the ROB clinic.

        Patient is able to provide informed consent.

        Patient must have a primary physician in the community to whom records and appropriate
        follow-up management can be given. Social services will be enlisted for any patients who
        lack health insurance, etc.

        Patients who have received radiotherapy in the ROB and may or may not be officially entered
        on a clinical protocol. Some patients treated prior to 1993 may not have been officially
        entered on a clinical protocol.

        Age greater than or equal to 18 years of age

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients who are on an interventional research protocol at NIH at the time of enrollment.
