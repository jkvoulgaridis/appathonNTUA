      This study will try to identify the genetic causes of hereditary hearing loss or balance
      disorders.

      People with a hearing or balance disorder that affects more than one family member may be
      eligible for this study. They and their immediate family members may undergo some or all of
      the following procedures:

        -  Medical and family history, including questions about hearing, balance and other
           ear-related issues, and review of medical records.

        -  Routine physical examination.

        -  Blood draw or buccal swab (brushing inside the cheek to collect cells) Tissue is
           collected for DNA analysis to look for changes in genes that may be related to hearing
           loss.

        -  Hearing tests The subject listens for tones emitted through a small earphone.

        -  Balance tests to see if balance functions of the inner ear are associated with the
           hearing loss In one test the subject wears goggles and watches moving lights while cold
           or warm air is blown into the ears. A second test involves sitting in a spinning chair
           in a quiet, dark room.

        -  Photograph A photograph may be taken as a record of eye shape and color, distance
           between the eyes, and hair color.

        -  Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans These tests show the
           structure of the inner ear. For CT, the subject lies still for a short time while X-ray
           images are obtained. For MRI, the patient lies on a stretcher that is moved into a
           cylindrical machine with a strong magnetic field. The magnetic field and radio waves
           produce images of the inner ear. The radio waves cause loud thumping noises that can be
           muffled by the use of earplugs.

    <textblock>
      Hereditary hearing impairment is a genetically heterogeneous disorder that can be caused by
      mutations in any one of hundreds of different genes. Approximately 20 genes have now been
      identified in which mutations can cause nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss. The
      identification and analysis of these genes and their mutations are providing critical
      insights into the development, structure, and function of the auditory system, as well as the
      molecular mechanisms associated with disruption of these processes. In contrast, the
      molecular mechanisms underlying familial disorders affecting peripheral vestibular function
      appear to be more rare, have not been well described, and are less well understood. The
      peripheral auditory and vestibular systems share many common features in both health and
      disease, and many hereditary hearing loss disorders also affect vestibular function. The
      purpose of this study is to identify genes and mutations causing hereditary disorders of
      hearing, balance, or both. Members of families segregating hereditary disorders of hearing or
      balance will be enrolled in the proposed study in order to: (1) define and characterize the
      phenotypes and natural histories; (2) identify the underlying causative mutations and genes
      by linkage, positional cloning, and/or candidate gene mutation analyses; (3) and correlate
      observed phenotypes with the corresponding mutations and functions of the underlying genes.

        We will be studying up to 750 people with hearing losses or balance problems that are
        thought to be hereditary and, if possible, their family members, either with or without
        hearing or balance problems to participate in our study. A total of up to 400 affected and
        unaffected individuals, including family members and control subjects will be enrolled from
        the Nigerian population.
