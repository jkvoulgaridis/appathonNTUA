  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study has several parts. One part will examine the influence of factors such as
      personality and past experience on reactions to unpleasant stimuli. Others will examine the
      effect of personality and emotional and attentional states on learning and memory.

      When confronted with fearful or unpleasant events, people can develop fear of specific cues
      that were associated with these events as well as to the environmental context in which the
      events occurred via a process called classical conditioning. Classical conditioning has been
      used to model anxiety disorders, but the relationship between stress and anxiety and
      conditioned responses remains unclear. This study will examine the relationship between cued
      conditioning and context conditioning . This study will also explore the acquisition and
      retention of different types of motor, emotional, and cognitive associative processes during
      various tasks that range from mildly arousing to stressful.

      Objective: Fear and anxiety are adaptive responses to different types of threats. Fear is a
      short-duration response evoked by explicit threat cues and anxiety a more sustained state of
      apprehension evoked by unpredictable threat. This protocol studied fear using Pavlovian fear
      conditioning in two studies. Studies 1 and 3. Study 2 focused on anxiety. Studies 1 and 3
      will be discontinued to focus uniquely on the study of anxiety. Specifically, we will examine
      the interactions between anxiety induced experimentally using verbal threat and cognitive
      processes. We will seek to 1) characterize the effect of anxiety on key cognitive processes
      including working memory and attention control and 2) examine the extent to which performance
      of cognitive tasks distract from anxiety.

      Study population: This more-than-minimal-risk protocol will test medically and
      psychiatrically healthy volunteers aged 18-50. Pregnant or nursing women will be excluded.

      Method: Fear and anxiety will be measured using the startle reflex to brief and loud sounds.
      Fear conditioning will be assessed using shock as unconditioned stimulus. Cognitive
      performance will be examined during periods of unpredictable shock anticipation.

      Outcome measures: The study will include cognitive performance and measure of aversive
      states, primarily the startle reflex.
