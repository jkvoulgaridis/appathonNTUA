  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study developed and tested two adjunct components for use in Couples HIV Testing
      and Counseling (CHTC) with gay-male couples: a communication skills training video and a
      substance use agreement module. Phase I of the study involved the creation of intervention
      materials and Phase II was comprised of a small randomized controlled trial comparing the
      additive effects of the novel components to CHTC as usual.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phase I: Utilizing formative qualitative data on the correspondence of sexual agreements,
      drug use, and sexual risk behavior, the study team created two adjunct intervention
      components:

      Communication skills training videos: The team produced a brief (20-minute) communication
      skills training video. The video includes 4 scenes in which a gay couple is depicted
      discussing HIV risk, sexual agreements, or drug use. The scene is viewed twice. The first
      viewing includes common communication errors. The second viewing portrays the use of more
      effective interpersonal communication and a more adaptive outcome.

      Substance use agreement module: The team developed a structured activity to assist couples in
      clarifying their understanding and goals around substance use. The module includes the
      completion of a calendar detailing recent substance use and structured debriefing questions.

      Phase II: A randomized controlled trial to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and
      preliminary efficacy of novel intervention components will be conducted. The trial involves
      70 couples (n = 140 individuals). Half of the couples are randomized to complete the drug
      calendar (the other half do not). Half of the couples are randomized to view communication
      skills training videos, the other half do not. The result is four intervention conditions:

        1. CHTC as usual

        2. CHTC + communication skills training videos

        3. CHTC + substance use module

        4. CHTC + communication skills training videos + substance use calendar

      Participants complete a baseline assessment (either online or in person) prior to their
      intervention session. All intervention sessions are completed with both members of the couple
      together. Follow-up assessments are completed individually online at 1, 3, and 6 months
      post-intervention.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Both members of the couple:

          1. are born male and current male gender identity;

          2. identify as gay, bisexual or same-sex attracted;

          3. read English at 8th grade level or better;

          4. have access to the Internet;

          5. agree to audio and video recording of intervention sessions;

        At least one member of the couple:

          1. reports the use of any drug listed on the DAST-10 in the previous 30 days.

          2. s identified as HIV negative during screening and baseline assessments.

             The couple

          3. has been together for at least 3 months;

          4. has engaged in oral or anal sex with one another in the past 3 months;

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. At baseline either member of the couple reports intimate partner violence (IPV), which
             is defined as serious physical or sexual violence that occurs outside the context of
             consensual bondage or sado-masochistic sexual play, which results in concerns about
             safety.

          2. At the first in-person meeting, staff will be empowered to deem the couple ineligible
             for the intervention if they identify inconsistencies between information provided in
             the eligibility screener and the in-person meeting (e.g., discrepancies in age or
             duration of relationship) or any issues that might hinder participation (e.g.,
             attending meeting high or drunk). The couple may also be deemed ineligible if
             participant responses are sufficiently inconsistent to call into question the validity
             of their individual responses.

            <description>The couple views communication skills training videos together prior to participating in a CHTC session following the CDC approved protocol.
Communication skills training video: This video includes 4 scenes of gay couples discussing issues related to HIV prevention, testing, sexual agreements, and drug use. Each scene is viewed twice. The first viewing includes common communication errors. The second viewing portrays more skillful interpersonal communication and a more adaptive resolution to the conversation.

          <description>The couple views communication skills training videos together prior to participating in a CHTC session following the CDC approved protocol.
Communication skills training video: This video includes 4 scenes of gay couples discussing issues related to HIV prevention, testing, sexual agreements, and drug use. Each scene is viewed twice. The first viewing includes common communication errors. The second viewing portrays more skillful interpersonal communication and a more adaptive resolution to the conversation.
