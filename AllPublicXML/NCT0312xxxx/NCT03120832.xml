    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open-label, parallel design study of PAN-301-1 (SNS-301), a HAAH directed
      nanoparticle vaccine, given intradermally in cohorts of patients with biochemically relapsed
      prostate cancer, using a fixed dose escalation schema every 21 days.

    <textblock>
      Human aspartyl-asparaginyl-β-hydroxylase (HAAH), also known as aspartate-β-hydroxylase, is an
      ~86 kDa type 2 transmembrane protein that belongs to the α-ketoglutarate-dependent
      dioxygenase family. It is a highly conserved enzyme, which catalyzes the hydroxylation of
      aspartyl and asparaginyl residues in epidermal growth factor-like domains of proteins
      including Notch and homologs. HAAH was initially identified in a novel screen to identify
      cell surface proteins up-regulated in liver cancer. It has subsequently been detected in a
      diverse array of solid and blood cancers, including: liver, bile duct, brain, breast, colon,
      prostate, ovary, pancreas, and lung cancers as well as leukemia. HAAH is not found in
      significant quantities in normal tissue or in proliferative disorders.

      The investigators have designed a bacteriophage lambda system to display HAAH peptides fused
      at the C terminus of the head protein gpD of phage lambda. The phage carry 200-300 copies of
      the gpD protein on their head and thus display many copies of an approximately 25 kDa
      molecular weight fragment of HAAH on their surface. The drug substance is one of these HAAH
      bacteriophage lambda constructs: HAAH-1λ (PAN-301-1).

      This study evaluates the safety and immunogenicity of the PAN-301-1 vaccine in patients with
      biochemically-relapsed prostate cancer.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Signed and dated written Ethics Committee approved informed consent

          2. Men aged 21 to 70 years with a histologic diagnosis of prostate cancer with a
             biochemical relapse following definitive local therapy (RP or radiation therapy)

          3. Patients are not eligible or are unwilling to receive additional definitive therapy
             following relapse (either RP or radiation therapy)

          4. No prior cytotoxic chemotherapy for the current cancer

          5. Normal electrocardiogram (ECG) or ECG with no clinically significant findings as
             determined by the Principal Investigator

          6. Presence of biochemically relapsed prostate cancer defined as either: 1) PSA &gt; 2 ng/mL
             1 year following initial definitive treatment for prostate cancer: or, 2) PSA doubling
             time (greater than 0.4 ng/mL) &lt; 12 months; or, 3) PSA velocity &gt; 2 ng/mL/year at any
             time following radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy.

          7. Positive expression of HAAH in either archived tumor tissue or serum

          8. No clinical or radiologic evidence of distant metastatic disease as measured by pelvic
             MRI or CT scan in addition to bone scan. These studies will need to be performed
