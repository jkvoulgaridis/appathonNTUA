    <textblock>
      This is a non-inferiority (10% non-inferiority margin), study to assess the efficacy and
      safety of dolutegravir, DTG (50 mg once daily [QD]) administered in combination with
      tenofovir alafenamide fumarate, TAF (25 mg QD) and emtricitabine, FTC (200 mg QD) compared to
      DTG (50 mg QD) administered in combination with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, TDF (300 mg
      QD) and FTC (200 mg QD) and compared to efavirenz, EFV (600 mg QD) administered in
      combination with TDF (300 mg QD) and FTC (200 mg QD) through 96 weeks in patients with HIV-1
      starting first-line ART.

    <textblock>
      This is an open label randomised, non-inferiority (10% non-inferiority margin), phase 3 study
      to assess the efficacy and safety of DTG (50 mg once daily [QD]) administered in combination
      with TAF (25 mg QD) and FTC (200 mg QD) compared to DTG (50 mg QD) administered in
      combination with TDF (300 mg QD) and FTC (200 mg QD) and compared to EFV (600 mg QD)
      administered in combination with TDF (300 mg QD) and FTC (200 mg QD) through 96 weeks in
      patients with HIV-1 starting first-line ART.

      Approximately 1110 male and female patients infected with HIV-1 who are eligible for
      first-line ART will be randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio (approximately 370 patients per
      treatment group) to Treatment Group 1 (DTG + TAF + FTC) or Treatment Group 2 (DTG + TDF +
      FTC) or Treatment Group 3 (EFV + TDF + FTC). To ensure adequate representation of adolescents
      (12 - 18 years) in any treatment group, randomisation will be stratified according to age
      greater or less than 18 years. The study includes screening and baseline visits, 8 study
      visits from Week 4 to Week 84, and a preliminary end of study visit at Week 96.

      The study will then take patients on Treatment Group 1 (DTG + TAF + FTC) or Treatment Group 2
      (DTG + TDF + FTC) or Treatment Group 3 (EFV + TDF + FTC), who have completed 96 weeks
      successfully, and follow them to 192 weeks, with visits every 24 weeks after enrolment to 192
      weeks. Study medication pill counts will be performed at each follow-up visit.
