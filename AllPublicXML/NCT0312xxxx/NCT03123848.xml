      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety of darunavir
      (DRV) and cobicistat (COBI) after a single oral administration of Prezcobix (DRV/COBI
      fixed-dose combination tablet) in healthy Japanese adult participants.

             psychiatric, metabolic disturbances or any other illness that the investigator
             considers should exclude the participant or that could interfere with the
             interpretation of the study results

          -  Participant has a history of malignancy before screening (exceptions are squamous and
             basal cell carcinomas of the skin and carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or malignancy,

          -  Participant has a history of or current clinically significant skin reactions (such as
             but not limited to Stevens-Johnson Syndrome [SJS], Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN),
             and/or erythema multiforme) or any history of allergies to drugs, such as, but not
             limited to, sulfonamides and penicillins

          -  Participant has been contraindicated DRV and COBI per local prescribing information
