  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study goal is to design an intervention utilizing implementation intentions to help
      participants prospectively plan and visualize ways to increase activity for the next day
      among working adults who do not currently exercise or use an activity monitor. Investigators
      will assess the level of and changes in physical activity, and how this relates to various
      individual factors that are related to exercise and health, including self-efficacy, control
      beliefs, and cognition.

    <textblock>
      The 5-week study consists of a 1-week baseline, where participants are asked to wear a Fitbit
      to document the number of steps taken that day to establish an objective measurement of steps
      before the intervention began. In the intervention condition, after the baseline week, during
      weeks 2 to 5, this condition is prompted with an email each evening for four weeks to review
      their schedules for the following day and identify time slots where they could add activity.
      They are given instructions for providing a detailed calendar of appointments and open slots
      for the next day using a simple daily planner. The planning implementation intention
      manipulation involves recording specific information about when, where, and how they will add
      steps to their day. They are provided with maps near their home and work with specific
      information about distances, estimated time to walk between different points, and number of
      steps for specific routes to help them in planning for specific routes.The control condition
      is matched for how much contact they have with the research staff (called and emailed the
      same amount of times) and also wear the Fitbit daily. The only difference from the
      intervention group is that they do not get the daily planning instructions or maps for the
      implementation intention strategy treatment. All activity data from the Fitbit was
      deidentified and aggregated with an online platform called Fitabase.

    <description>Z-score composite on the Brief Test of Adult Cognition by Telephone (BTACT). Individual tests scores were first standardized to z-scores. The z-score composite was calculated by averaging the z-scores of the 5 tests: word list immediate, word list delayed, backwards counting, digits backwards, and category fluency. Post-test z-scores were standardized based on the mean and s.d. of the pretest scores. A higher z-score is indicative of better cognitive functioning.</description>

Participants will wear a Fitbit Zip for 5 weeks to record their daily activity data. The first week of the study will provide a baseline measurement of activity. After this week, participants will be asked to increase their steps incrementally by 2,000 steps each week for the subsequent four weeks. To help achieve their step goals, they will receive maps of different routes near their home and/or work of varying distances and step counts. They will be asked to review their schedule for the next day and identify times when they could add steps into their schedules, and to record their daily step data in the daily questionnaire.</description>

Post-test z-scores were standardized based on the mean and s.d. of the pretest scores. A higher z-score is indicative of better cognitive functioning.</description>

            <description>Participants will wear a Fitbit Zip to record their daily activity data, which will be deidentified and aggregated with an online platform called Fitabase. Participants in this arm will receive all components of the intervention: scheduling, maps, and activity goals.
Participants will wear a Fitbit Zip for 5 weeks to record their daily activity data. The first week of the study will provide a baseline measurement of activity. After this week, participants will be asked to increase their steps incrementally by 2,000 steps each week for the subsequent four weeks. To help achieve their step goals, they will receive maps of different routes near their home and/or work of varying distances and step counts. They will be asked to review their schedule for the next day and identify times when they could add steps into their schedules, and to record their daily step data in the daily questionnaire.</description>
