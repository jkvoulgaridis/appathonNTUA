  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well venetoclax and ibrutinib work in treating participants
      with high-risk chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as venetoclax, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells,
      either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from
      spreading. Ibrutinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. Giving venetoclax and ibrutinib may work better in treating
      participants with chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the therapeutic efficacy of venetoclax consolidation in patients who have
      detectable chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) after
      receiving ibrutinib monotherapy for at least 12 months and who have high risk CLL.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine complete remission (CR)/complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery
      (CRi) rate after 6, 12, 18 and 24 cycles of combination therapy and to estimate the time to
      best response with this combination.

      II. Determine the cumulative rate of bone marrow minimal residual disease (MRD)-free complete
      responders by an assay method with at least 0.01% sensitivity and median time to
      MRD-negativity.

      III. Determine the safety of combined ibrutinib and venetoclax. IV. Determine the
      progression-free and overall survival.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive venetoclax orally (PO) once daily (QD) and ibrutinib PO QD. Courses
      repeat every 4 weeks for up to 24 courses in the absence of disease progression or unaccepted
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up every 6-12 months.
