  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Every year, millions of Americans are admitted to the intensive care unit. Due to advances in
      critical care, mortality rates are decreasing, increasing the number of ICU survivors.
      Survivors of critical illness, however, often face physical, functional, and cognitive
      deficits that place them at risk for a cycle of re-hospitalization that frequently culminates
      in premature death. Moreover, post-ICU interventions may be resource-intensive and may be
      most cost-effective only in a subgroup of patients at highest risk. Whether a
      multi-disciplinary program to facilitate recovery from critical illness can prevent hospital
      readmission and improve quality of life among high-risk ICU survivors remains unknown. The
      primary aim of this pilot is to examine the feasibility of implementing a multidisciplinary
      ICU Recovery Program and the influence of such a program on process measures including
      contact with the ICU recovery team and attendance of ICU recovery clinic. The secondary aims
      are to compare the effect of an ICU Recovery Program on 30-day same-hospital readmission and
      other clinical outcomes.

    <description>Patients in the usual care group will receive care as dictated by their clinical team. In usual care in the study institution, patients frequently receive medication reconciliation by and ICU pharmacist at the time of transfer out of the ICU to the hospital ward, medication reconciliation by a physician at the time of hospital discharge, and follow up with their primary care physician within two weeks of hospital discharge. Usual care does not currently include an in-person assessment of the patient's cognitive and functional status or anticipated post-ICU needs by a nurse practitioner between ICU transfer and hospital discharge, access to a 24/7 contact line after hospital discharge, or assessment in a multi-disciplinary ICU Recovery Clinic.</description>
