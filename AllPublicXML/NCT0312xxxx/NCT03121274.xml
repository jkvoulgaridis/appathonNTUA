      Nulliparous women in spontaneous or induced labour with term singleton pregnancy are
      randomized into two groups first group (early pushing) in this group patients were allowed to
      push within one hour after full cervical dilatation whether the vertex was visible or not.
      Second group (delayed pushing) patients here were asked not to push for maximum of 3 hours or
      start pushing when the vertex was visible.
