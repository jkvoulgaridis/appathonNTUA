  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study goal is to evaluate user experience with our developed exergame, which was designed
      to increase physical activity, exercise self-efficacy, and social connections among
      caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or related dementias. Participants
      will use this garden-themed exergame for six weeks. Tailoring an exergame for caregivers of
      AD or related dementias has the potential to increase physical activity and to improve
      overall health and well-being in this vulnerable population, which in turn can benefit the
      patients for whom they provide care. All study sessions be held at a location convenient to
      participants. Interested participants can fill out the link below (under detailed
      description) to sign up.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The number of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) caregivers providing informal care for family members
      is rising dramatically, and supportive programs are vitally needed. Caregivers of AD patients
      have relatively high levels of stress and depression and limited physical activity and social
      engagement. Technology-driven programs can offer engaging, sustainable, and scalable
      opportunities to give caregivers critically-needed supports for health and well- being. This
      pilot study uses cognitive behavioral methods to develop an innovative social exergame to
      increase physical and social activity among AD caregivers. Leveraging wearable activity
      monitors, physical activity data collected throughout the day and in varied settings will
      serve as input to the game experience.

      Caregivers will assess the suitability of an exergame prototype with an array of features
      including (1) instructional exercise modules, (2) activity data visualizations, (3) digital
      rewards for physical activity that can be used to create virtual gardens, and (4)
      opportunities to connect virtually with other caregivers to share and comment on their
      creative products.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate enjoyment of the exergame and its feasibility to
      increase moderate and vigorous physical activity, virtual social contact, and exercise
      self-efficacy. A group of approximately 20 caregivers will test the exergame for six weeks on
      an Android smartphone. The findings will be used to develop larger-scale intervention studies
      to test the efficacy of the exergame in the future. Tailoring an exergame for caregivers of
      AD has the potential to increase physical activity and to improve overall health and
      well-being in this vulnerable population, which in turn can benefit the Alzheimer's patients
      for whom they provide care.

      All participants will be given a fitness tracker to keep after the study, a value of over
      $100! Participants will receive $5 Amazon Gift card each week upon completion of each weekly
      questionnaire. Participants can receive up to a $30 of Amazon Gift card upon completion of
      weekly questionnaire. In addition, all study sessions will be held at a location convenient
      to participants within the above regions.

    <description>Participants will use the exergame for 6 weeks, during which time game telemetry data (all interactions with the software) will be automatically logged by the system. The participants will be asked to use the game at least every other day. Caregivers will be sent an email or text message to remind them to use the system if they have not done so within three days. Utilizing two-way text messaging, an experience sampling protocol Â¬will be employed: once per week, participants will be sent brief questions probing their level of satisfaction with the exergame and their level of perceived connectedness to the community of other caregivers using the exergame.</description>

Fitbit Charge HR will be used to measure physical activity and sedentary behavior during waking hours. Each participant will wear a Fitbit for a period of one week at baseline and during the entire 6-week pilot study. Data on step counts, heart rate, and moderate/vigorous activity from the Fitbits will be transmitted wirelessly to our secure research server and will be used to assess changes in physical activity and sedentary behavior over the course of the study. Participants will be instructed to wear the monitor continuously on the wrist. Data will be analyzed using previously validated accelerometer count cut-points for adults after accounting for invalid data and wear time.</description>
