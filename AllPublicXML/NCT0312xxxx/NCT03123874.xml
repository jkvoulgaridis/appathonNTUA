  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The MiLC trial is a randomized control trial of two different breast pump set-ups: mother's
      own and sterile. The objective of this trial is to investigate the bacterial composition of
      human milk pumped and stored in &quot;real-life&quot; conditions. To meet this objective, lactating
      mothers will fully express breast milk from one breast on two consecutive pumping sessions at
      home, once with the participant's own pumps and collection kits (own pump set-up) and once
      with a hospital-grade pump and disposable, sterile collection kits (sterile pump set-up).
      Randomization will be used to determine which pump participants use first. From the total
      volume of milk pumped during each pumping session, the researchers will collect 1 oz. Milk
      from both pumps will be stored at home and sampled on days 0, 2, 4, and 30 after expression
      for analysis of its bacterial composition.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will donate 1 oz of human milk during each of two consecutive pumping sessions,
      for a total volume of 2 oz donated on one day. To collect this human milk, participants will
      be asked to fully express one breast during each pumping session. Participants will pump once
      with the participant's own pump set-up and once with the sterile pump set-up (provided by the
      research team). Women will be randomized to which pump is used first.

      Randomization will be done using stratified randomization as follows: participants were
      stratified by how their infants were fed, namely whether infants were fed human milk only vs.
      human milk and complementary foods). Then, randomization was conducted within each strata.
      The researchers aim to have a minimum of 25 participants in each stratum.

      All human milk collections will occur at participants' homes between 0700 and 1100 hours. The
      second pumping session must begin 3 hours (+/-30 minutes) after the beginning of the first
      pumping session (e.g. the first pumping session at 7:30 am and the second at 10:30 am).
      Participants will elect from which breast to donate human milk and that breast will be used
      for both pumping sessions. Participants will be asked not to nurse from or pump that breast
      during the 2 hours before the first pumping session and not until after the second pumping
      session (a total of ~5.5 hours).

      From the milk produced during each pumping session (which could be up to ~6 oz), researchers
      will collect 1 oz using a sterile, plastic syringe. Participants will keep the remaining
      volume of milk. Each ounce of milk collected will be separated into 5 sterile containers
      (provided). Participants will store donated milk at home until it is picked up by a
      researcher 2, 4, and 30 days after pumping.

    <description>Richness is the total number of different bacterial taxa detected in the sample. This metric will be assessed on data collected via high-throughput sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene present in milk.</description>

    <measure>Bacterial Community Diversity</measure>
    <time_frame>0 days after pumping</time_frame>
    <description>Bacterial community diversity will be assessed using the the Shannon diversity index. The Shannon diversity index is a type of entropy measure and is a function of the distribution of the total number of organisms across all of the species. If S is the total number of species in the sample and p_i is the number of organisms in the i-th species divided by the total number of organisms, then Diversity = −Σ p_i log(p_i). This metric will be assessed on data collected via high-throughput sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene present in milk.</description>
