  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This early phase I trial studies how well tranexamic acid works in reducing the loss of blood
      in patients with pelvic tumors undergoing hemipelvectomy surgery. Tranexamic acid decreases
      blood loss by stabilizing clots and preventing clot lysis in patients undergoing surgery.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if the use of tranexamic acid results in a significant reduction in
      intraoperative and perioperative blood loss.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if use of tranexamic acid lowers the amount of blood products transfused in
      hemipelvectomy surgeries.

      II. To determine if the use of tranexamic acid has an effect on laboratory (lab) measurements
      preoperatively through postoperative day 7.

      III. To determine if use of tranexamic acid has an effect on complication, length of
      intensive care unit (ICU), and hospital stays.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I (TRANEXAMIC ACID): Patients receive tranexamic acid intravenously (IV) over 15 minutes
      30 minutes prior to surgery and continuously during hemipelvectomy procedure in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II (NO TRANEXAMIC ACID): Patients undergo standard of care hemipelvectomy in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 7 days.

    <description>Intraoperative blood loss and perioperative blood loss (total of intraoperative EBL and 1 week drain) will be compared between two groups utilizing two-sample t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Log-transformation will be taken on the blood loss measurements as appropriate. Multivariable linear regression models will be used to compare two treatment groups in intraoperative and perioperative blood loss by adjusting for significant covariates. Model selection technique, including backward elimination, will be implemented.</description>

Modeling techniques including linear regression (amount of blood products transfused, length of ICU, hospital stays), logistic regression (complication), and mixed effects model (repeatedly measured lab data) will be utilized as appropriate.</description>
