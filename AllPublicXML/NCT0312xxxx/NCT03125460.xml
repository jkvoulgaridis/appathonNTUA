    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to establish the performance characteristics of an assay that
      detects the recurrence of bladder cancer in patients previously diagnosed with bladder
      cancer. The study is conducted at locations within and outside of the United States. Testing
      is performed on urine specimens provided by eligible enrolled patients. Results from this
      study will not be used for patient management decisions.

          -  Subject is considered disease positive within 12 months (365 days) of enrollment.

          -  At the time of the enrollment visit, the subject is scheduled for a standard of care
             cystoscopy which will be completed within 3 days of providing a urine specimen.

          -  Subject has agreed to provide at least 60 mL of voided urine for study purposes at the
             enrollment visit.

          -  Subject has agreed to provide at least 60 mL of voided urine for study purposes at
             each subsequent standard of care cystoscopy visit for at least 12 months (365 days)
             following enrollment if the subject will enter the Longitudinal cohort.

          -  Any subject considered anticipatory positive at the initial visit shall be enrolled
