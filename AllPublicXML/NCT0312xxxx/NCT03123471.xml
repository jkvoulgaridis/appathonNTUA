  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study of the
      efficacy and safety of apremilast (CC-10004) in subjects with moderate to severe plaque
      psoriasis of the scalp.

      Approximately 300 subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis of the scalp will be
      randomized 2:1 to receive either apremilast 30 mg twice daily (BID) or placebo for the first
      16 weeks.

    <textblock>
      The study will consist of four phases:

        -  Screening Phase - up to 35 days

        -  Double-blind Placebo-controlled Phase- Weeks 0 to 16 Subjects will receive treatment
           with one of the following:

             -  apremilast 30 mg tablets orally BID or

             -  placebo tablets (identical in appearance to apremilast 30 mg tablets) orally BID

        -  Apremilast Extension Phase - Weeks 16 to 32

             -  All subjects who had received placebo during the placebo-controlled phase will be
                switched to apremilast 30 mg BID (or continue with) apremilast. At Week 16, all
                subjects will maintain this dosing through Week 32.

        -  Observational Follow-up Phase

             -  Four-week Post-Treatment Observational Follow-up Phase for all subjects who
                complete the study or discontinue from the study early.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Scalp Physician Global Assessment (ScPGA) Score of Clear (0) or Almost Clear (1) With at Least a 2-Point Reduction From Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The ScPGA is a measurement of overall scalp involvement by the investigator at the time of evaluation. The ScPGA is a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe), incorporating an assessment of the severity of the 3 primary signs of the disease: erythema, scaling, and plaque elevation. When making the assessment of overall scalp severity, the investigator factored in areas that had already been cleared (ie, had scores of 0), not limited to the evaluation of remaining lesions for severity; consequently, the severity of each sign was averaged across all areas of involvement, including cleared lesions.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The Whole Body Itch NRS scale is an 11-point scale to assess whole body itch. The scale ranges from 0-10, where &quot;0&quot; represents no itch, and &quot;10&quot; represents the worst imaginable itch, and a 4-point change from baseline was shown to be optimal for demonstrating a level of clinically meaningful improvement in itch severity. NRS response was defined as a ≥ 4-point reduction (improvement) from baseline.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Dermatological Life Quality Index (DLQI) Total Score at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>DLQI is questionnaire for use in a dermatology clinical setting to assess limitations related to the impact of skin disease. The instrument contains ten items dealing with the participant's skin. With the exception of Item Number 7, the participant responds on a four-point scale, ranging from &quot;Very Much&quot; (score 3) to &quot;Not at All&quot; or &quot;Not relevant&quot; (score 0). Item Number 7 is a multi-part item, the first part of which ascertains whether the participant's skin prevented them from working or studying (Yes or No, scores 3 or 0 respectively), and if &quot;No,&quot; then the subject is asked how much of a problem the skin has been at work or study over the past week, with response alternatives being &quot;A lot,&quot; &quot;A little,&quot; or &quot;Not at all&quot; (scores 2, 1, or 0 respectively). The DLQI total score was derived by summing all item scores, and has a possible range of 0 to 30, with 30 corresponding to the worst quality of life, and 0 corresponding to the best.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE) During the Placebo-Controlled Phase</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 to Week 16; mean duration of exposure was 14.5 weeks and 14.6 weeks for participants randomized to placebo and apremilast respectively.</time_frame>
    <description>A TEAE is an AE with a start date on or after the date of the first dose of study drug and no later than 28 days after the last dose of study drug. A serious AE (SAE) is any untoward AE that is fatal, life-threatening, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, requires or prolongs existing in-patient hospitalization, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or is a condition that may jeopardize or may require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes above. The severity of AEs was assessed based on the following scale: Mild = asymptomatic or mild symptoms, clinical or diagnostic observations only; Moderate = symptoms cause moderate discomfort; Severe = could be non-serious or serious) = symptoms causing severe pain discomfort.</description>

There is no end date for eligibility to submit a data sharing request for this study.</ipd_time_frame>
    <ipd_access_criteria>Qualified researchers may submit a request containing the research objectives, the Amgen product(s) and Amgen study/studies in scope, endpoints/outcomes of interest, statistical analysis plan, data requirements, publication plan, and qualifications of the researcher(s). In general, Amgen does not grant external requests for individual patient data for the purpose of re-evaluating safety and efficacy issues already addressed in the product labelling. Requests are reviewed by a committee of internal advisors. If not approved, a Data Sharing Independent Review Panel will arbitrate and make the final decision. Upon approval, information necessary to address the research question will be provided under the terms of a data sharing agreement. This may include anonymized individual patient data and/or available supporting documents, containing fragments of analysis code where provided in analysis specifications.

The instrument contains ten items assessed on a QOL scale dealing with the participant's skin. The DLQI total score was derived by summing all item scores, which has a possible range of 0 to 30, with 30 corresponding to the worst quality of life, and 0 corresponding to the best.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Scalp Physician Global Assessment (ScPGA) Score of Clear (0) or Almost Clear (1) With at Least a 2-Point Reduction From Baseline</title>
        <description>The ScPGA is a measurement of overall scalp involvement by the investigator at the time of evaluation. The ScPGA is a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe), incorporating an assessment of the severity of the 3 primary signs of the disease: erythema, scaling, and plaque elevation. When making the assessment of overall scalp severity, the investigator factored in areas that had already been cleared (ie, had scores of 0), not limited to the evaluation of remaining lesions for severity; consequently, the severity of each sign was averaged across all areas of involvement, including cleared lesions.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Dermatological Life Quality Index (DLQI) Total Score at Week 16</title>
        <description>DLQI is questionnaire for use in a dermatology clinical setting to assess limitations related to the impact of skin disease. The instrument contains ten items dealing with the participant's skin. With the exception of Item Number 7, the participant responds on a four-point scale, ranging from &quot;Very Much&quot; (score 3) to &quot;Not at All&quot; or &quot;Not relevant&quot; (score 0). Item Number 7 is a multi-part item, the first part of which ascertains whether the participant's skin prevented them from working or studying (Yes or No, scores 3 or 0 respectively), and if &quot;No,&quot; then the subject is asked how much of a problem the skin has been at work or study over the past week, with response alternatives being &quot;A lot,&quot; &quot;A little,&quot; or &quot;Not at all&quot; (scores 2, 1, or 0 respectively). The DLQI total score was derived by summing all item scores, and has a possible range of 0 to 30, with 30 corresponding to the worst quality of life, and 0 corresponding to the best.</description>

        <description>A TEAE is an AE with a start date on or after the date of the first dose of study drug and no later than 28 days after the last dose of study drug. A serious AE (SAE) is any untoward AE that is fatal, life-threatening, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, requires or prolongs existing in-patient hospitalization, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or is a condition that may jeopardize or may require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes above. The severity of AEs was assessed based on the following scale: Mild = asymptomatic or mild symptoms, clinical or diagnostic observations only; Moderate = symptoms cause moderate discomfort; Severe = could be non-serious or serious) = symptoms causing severe pain discomfort.</description>
