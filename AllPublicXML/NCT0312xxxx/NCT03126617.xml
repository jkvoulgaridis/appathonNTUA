  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At BMS, we work with physicians/investigators to make investigational products available to
      patients with life-threatening diseases that have exhausted other treatment options and where
      there is a reasonable expectation of benefit over risk.

      When contacted by a treating physician, BMS will consider requests for providing early
      patient access to Elotuzumab in patients with multiple myeloma who are residents of Belgium,
      Thailand, Turkey, Argentina, and Colombia.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Specific eligibility criteria must be met for access outside of a clinical trial.

        These inclusion criteria include:

          -  The illness must be serious or life threatening

          -  There are no other viable options (including approved products or active clinical
             trials)

          -  There is sufficient evidence that the potential benefit to the patient would likely
             outweigh the potential risks based on what is known at the time

          -  Other defined inclusion/exclusion criteria could be applicable.
