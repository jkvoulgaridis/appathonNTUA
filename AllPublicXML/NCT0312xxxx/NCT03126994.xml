  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single-center, non-randomized validation study being conducted under a
      non-significant risk study design with the primary aim to evaluate PWV, PR, and BW accuracy
      in a sample of subjects representative of the US general adult population. The primary study
      objective is to demonstrate equivalency when measuring: Pulse Wave Velocity (PWV) and Pulse
      Rate (PR) between the PhysioWave Cardiovascular Analyzer (CA) and AtCor Medical SphygmoCor®
      XCEL PWA &amp; PWV (XCEL), and Body Weight (BW) between the CA and the Detecto Solo Digital
      Healthcare Scale (Detecto).
