  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the Phase 2a study is to: 1) demonstrate that the estimated VentaProst dose is
      safe and equivalent in effect to a dose administered via epoprostenol aerosolization by the
      current off-label-use practice; and 2) demonstrate that an optimum effect can be rapidly
      obtained with VentaProst titration.

      Part I:

      This part of the study is designed to demonstrate the dose equivalence between off-label
      aerosolized epoprostenol and VentaProst using a patient's hemodynamic parameters.

      Part II:

      This part of the study is designed to establish a dose response relationship of VentaProst to
      hemodynamic effect by dose escalation in patients who have had cardiac surgery with CPB.
