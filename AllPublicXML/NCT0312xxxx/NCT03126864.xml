      Any time the words &quot;you,&quot; &quot;your,&quot; &quot;I,&quot; or &quot;me&quot; appear, it is meant to apply to the potential
      participant.

      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn about the safety and tolerability of 3
      different doses of CD33-CAR-T cells (referred to throughout the consent as &quot;T-cells&quot;) in
      patients who have CD33-positive acute myeloid leukemia (AML) that is relapsed (has come back)
      or refractory (has not responded to treatment).

      CD33-CAR-T is made by genetically modifying (changing) your T-cells (a type of white blood
      cell). T-cells are genetically changed to help target leukemia cells.

      This is an investigational study. CD33-CAR-T is not FDA approved or commercially available.
      It is currently being used for research purposes only. The study doctor can explain how the
      study drug is designed to work.

      Up to 39 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.
