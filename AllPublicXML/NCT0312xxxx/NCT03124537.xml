  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to develop a smart phone app to administer a behavior change
      program that helps adults to increase daily steps by planning where, when, and with whom to
      walk. The investigators will test the effectiveness of the walking program app for increasing
      the number of daily steps among sedentary older adults. The investigators also will examine
      the effects on self-efficacy and social integration/support.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Physical activity is broadly beneficial for physical, psychological, and cognitive aspects of
      health, yet only one in five U.S. adults meets the CDC physical activity guidelines. Making
      physical activity accessible and feasible throughout life is an important public health
      policy objective that is within reach with the right kind of behavioral and environmental
      supports. The project aims to provide such supports for an active lifestyle thereby
      contributing to healthy aging. The goal of this project is to increase physical activity
      (i.e., walking) in sedentary older adults by providing the environmental and behavioral
      resources to incorporate additional steps into their daily lives. The investigators will use
      a behavioral approach that fosters a sense of control and facilitates planning by focusing on
      the what, when, where, and with whom aspects of their physical activity. The investigators
      propose a user-friendly, practical way to increase steps. By providing people with specific,
      tailored information about the number of steps one can get by walking a certain distance or
      during a certain amount of time, participants can better plan when, where, and with whom they
      will be able to achieve the desired number of steps, break goals into manageable portions (at
      different times throughout the day or week), and thereby increase the likelihood of goal
      achievement.

      During the app development phase, the investigators will demonstrate the app to 5 to 10 older
      adults to get their input. The goal will be to get their feedback about the app features and
      to make sure it is user friendly. The investigators will ask questions about the ease of
      using the app and their understanding of the app features. The interviewer will record their
      answers to share with the research team and app developer. Modifications to the app will be
      made as needed.

      During the next phase of the study, the investigators will test whether the full app program
      is successful in increasing steps and whether it is more effective than the basic app that
      only includes step counting and goals, similar to a fitness tracker or pedometer. A minimum
      of 30 participants will be randomly assigned to two conditions: the app with step counting
      and goals alone, or the full version of the app with the step counting and goals, schedule,
      maps, and social components. It is predicted that the intervention group will improve more on
      outcome measures than the control group.

    <description>This group will be given the app to 1) count their steps, 2) add walks to their daily schedules, 3) create maps of their walking routes, and 4) text friends to invite them for a walk. Participants are asked to set a daily step goal and they can see how many steps they've taken each day since using the app. 2) There is an interface where participants can create maps based on walking routes. 3) They will also have the option to use a daily schedule to plan certain times in the day that they can walk. 4) The social feature gives participants the option to message friends, co-workers, or neighbors in one's contact list to invite them for a walk.</description>

    <description>This group will receive the app with the first component, the ability to count steps and set daily step goals. This group will also be able to track walks to see the time, distance, and steps of each walk, but not see these walks displayed as a map. This group will monitor their daily steps over a one-month period, and will be asked to use the app as much as possible.</description>
