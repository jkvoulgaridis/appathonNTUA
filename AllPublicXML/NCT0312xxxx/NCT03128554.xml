  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traditional models of smoking cessation focus on delivering advice and counseling to quit and
      providing assistance to patients ready to quit smoking, but do not actively intervene with
      patients who are not ready to quit (NRTQ). This abrupt cessation approach is often not an
      appealing option to those not ready to quit, however, a reduction approach can seem more
      attainable and engaging. In response to this need, this smoking cessation intervention has
      been developed.

      This research is part of a pilot study to assess the feasibility of introducing a NRTQ
      intervention in a primary care setting. This study will also assess the effectiveness of
      increasing the number of smoking reduction interventions delivered, provider confidence and
      satisfaction, relative to control practice. Outcomes will be assessed by a pre-survey and a
      three-month follow-up survey, administered to all study participants. All study participants
      will also be asked to fill out brief NRTQ consult forms for each NRTQ patient they encounter
      for a two-week period. Additionally, participants randomized to the intervention arm will
      receive training, and access to tools and resources.

      3.0 HYPOTHESIS TO BE TESTED The intervention program will be feasible to introduce into
      primary care practices. The intervention program will also be effective in increasing the
      number of smoking reduction interventions delivered and provider confidence, relative to
      control practice. Providers in the intervention condition will be satisfied with the
      intervention and tools provided.

      4.0 RELEVANCE TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF THE TREATMENT OF NICOTINE DEPENDENCE The Ministry of
      Health and Long Term care recently published an updated action plan on smoking cessation in
      Ontario (24). This action plan focuses on smoking prevention and cessation rather than harm
      reduction in smokers not ready to quit, which accounts for the majority of smokers in Ontario
      (24). Previous studies have demonstrated that smoking reduction strategies employing NRT can
      lead to smoking cessation in smokers not yet ready to quit (12). This pilot study aims to
      determine the feasibility of introducing a multi-component intervention program for primary
      care providers to target the unmotivated to quit smoker. If successful it will inform a
      larger trial throughout the OMSC platform to further evaluate the effectiveness of the
      smoking cessation through reduction approach. This might result in a shift in smoking
      cessation culture in Canada to include harm reduction as an approach to engage the smoker who
      is not ready to quit.

      5.0 METHODS TO BE USED 5.1 Design A two-armed, cluster randomized controlled pilot study will
      be conducted. Primary care practices will be randomized to one of two study arms: the
      'control' group or the 'intervention' group. Ten primary care practices will be randomly
      assigned to one of the two arms (5 practices per arm).

      The study design schema and timeline for the collection of outcome data and intervention
      activities is presented in Appendix A -- Study Flow Diagram and Timeline.

      5.2 Setting and Participants Ten primary care practices (5 per study arm) from the existing
      OMSC primary care network will be recruited from within the province of Ontario, over a
      3-month recruitment period. We will recruit ≥ 40 MDs, NPs, RNs, and pharmacists for
      participation.

      5.3 Procedures 5.3.1 Recruitment of OMSC primary care practices A study invitation letter
      [Appendix C -- Study Invitation Letter] will be emailed to OMSC partner sites [Appendix B --
      Participant Recruitment Email] located in the Champlain, South East, or Central East Local
      Health Integration Networks (LHINs), addressed to the lead physician, executive director or
      clinic manager. A member of the research team will place a follow-up phone call approximately
      one week later to inquire about the interest in study participation [Appendix D -- Telephone
      Script]. Once they have agreed to take part in the study, an email will be sent to all
      eligible providers within that clinic, asking them to take part in the study [Appendix E --
      Provider Recruitment Email] with an attached invitation letter [Appendix F -- Study
      Invitation Letter for Providers]. All primary care providers from eligible participating
      practices will provide informed consent [Appendix G -- Telephone Script for Obtaining Verbal
      Consent].

      Participants who wish to withdraw from the study after being consented must provide a letter
      to the PI [Appendix H -- Participant Withdrawal Letter].

      If we are unable to recruit all ten primary care practices within the above-mentioned Local
      Health Integrated Networks (LHINs), we will expand recruitment to all LHINs within Ontario
      [Appendix Q—Eligible Sites for Expansion].

      5.3.2 Allocation to treatment A two-armed, cluster randomized controlled pilot study will be
      conducted. Primary care practices will be randomized to one of two study arms: the 'control'
      group or the 'intervention' group. Randomization will be performed by the UOHI research
      methods group who will not be directly involved in the study. Primary care clinics will not
      be blind to the group assignment however the investigator responsible for statistical
      analysis will remain blinded to group assignment. The Ottawa Health Science Network Research
      Ethics Board (OHSN-REB) will approve this study.

      5.3.3 Data Collection

      5.3.3.1 Pre- and Post-Assessment Survey At baseline, participating primary care providers
      will complete a brief study questionnaire, which will document demographic characteristics of
      providers (age, gender, practice model, geographic location), provider knowledge and
      confidence in addressing smoking cessation with patients not ready to quit, and assess each
      provider's current practice with NRTQ patients. These surveys will be mailed to a contact
      person at the clinic, who will distribute and collect the surveys to return them to the
      Ottawa Model for Smoking Cessation [Appendix K -- Pre-Survey Instructions]. At the 3-month
      follow-up, providers will also complete a second survey which will re-assess provider
      confidence and satisfaction with the intervention program [Appendix I -- Pre and Post
      Provider Surveys]. These surveys will again be mailed out to a contact person at the clinic,
      who will distribute and collect the surveys to return to the Ottawa Model for Smoking
      Cessation [Appendix L -- Post-Survey Instructions].

      5.3.3.2 Not Ready to Quit (NRTQ) Consult Form At the 3-month follow-up, providers will
      complete a brief consult form [Appendix J -- Tools and Resources] for a two week period which
      will document the number of smoking reduction interventions completed with NRTQ patients. The
      consult form will be provided to both the control and intervention groups, and a chart audit
      will assess the number of smoking reduction interventions provided. The consult forms will be
      mailed to a contact person at the clinic who will distribute and collect the packages of
      forms, and return them to the Ottawa Model for Smoking Cessation [Appendix M -- NRTQ Consult
      Form Instructions]. The packages will also contain a letter for providers with instructions
      on how to complete the forms, as well as a form indicating when they started and completed
      NRTQ Consult Forms [Appendix N -- NRTQ Provider Instruction].

      5.3.4 Group Comparators 5.3.4.1 Intervention group The intervention program will focus on the
      sub-population of tobacco users who report they are not ready/motivated to quit smoking in
      the next 30 days but are willing to cut back on smoking over the next 3 months. All providers
      randomized to this group will receive a 2-hour Continuing Medical Education (CME)/Group
      Learning (GLS) training session on the smoking reduction intervention model. The CME/ GLS
      will be delivered by a peer primary care physician. To support delivery of the reduction
      program in primary care settings, providers in the intervention group will receive a not
      ready to quit (NRTQ) consult form, provider resource, and patient handout which may be
      integrated into EMR systems as appropriate. [Appendix J -- Tools and Resources]

      5.3.4.2 Control group Clinics randomized to the control group will not be exposed to the
      intervention program. Providers in this group however receive the NRTQ consult form for data
      collection purposes [Appendix J -- Tools and Resources].

      5.4 Outcome measures

      5.4.1 Participation rate (i.e. Practitioner recruitment). The study will evaluate the number
      of providers who agree to participate divided by the total number of providers who are sent
      an invitation letter. By measuring participation rate, it will inform recruitment for a
      larger study.

      5.4.2 NRTQ consult completion rate. The number of NRTQ consults completed per physician in
      the intervention group and the control group will be evaluated and compared. It is
      anticipated that providers that have received the intervention will have a higher NRTQ
      consult completion rate. This will also evaluate the uptake of the NRTQ consult form by
      health care providers.

      5.4.3 The number of reduction interventions provided by providers. A chart audit of both the
      intervention and control groups will measure the number of reduction interventions provided
      in the NRTQ population. This will assess the feasibility of this intervention in primary care
      as well as act as a surrogate to inform a larger trial of the receptiveness patients have to
      a smoking intervention when they are NRTQ. A chart audit instruction sheet and documentation
      form will be faxed to a contact person at the clinic who will record the total number of NRTQ
      patients seen by each participating provider during their respective two-week period. The
      clinic contact person will return the form via fax to the Ottawa Model for Smoking Cessation
      [Appendix R - Number of Patients NRTQ].

      5.4.4 Provider confidence in addressing tobacco use among patients NRTQ. Provider confidence
      will be measured in a pre and post intervention surveys completed by participating health
      care providers in both the intervention and control groups. This will evaluate if providing a
      2-hour Continuing Medical Education (CME)/Group Learning (GLS) training session on the
      smoking reduction intervention model will alter provider confidence in intervening in the
      NRTQ population and help inform a larger study. If provider confidence is not affected by the
      NRTQ CME/GLS, the intervention will need to be re-evaluated prior to a larger study.

      5.4.5 Provider satisfaction with the smoking reduction intervention program. Provider
      satisfaction with the smoking reduction intervention program will be assessed in the
      intervention group only. Summary statistics on provider satisfaction will help inform a
      larger study as well as identify if the intervention is acceptable for primary health care
      providers.

      5.5 Sample size As this is a feasibility study, the sample size was dictated by available
      resources. We plan to recruit five sites per study arm, and a minimum of four providers per
      site, giving a minimum total of 40 health care providers from which to generate the estimates
      of intervention efficacy (defined as the number of reduction interventions performed,
      excluding dedicated smoking cessation visits and unscheduled visits).

      5.6 Statistical analysis For the primary data analyses, we will compare the mean number of
      NRTQ consults between groups using a t-test that incorporates a variance inflation factor to
      account for the effect of clustering. If there are relevant baseline differences between
      groups, we will use Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) to account for clustering and
      co-variates. Similar analytics will be applied for comparing confidence levels between the
      two groups. Summary statistics will be calculated for provider satisfaction with the
      intervention in the smoking reduction group.

      5. 7 Potential problems and possible approaches for overcoming them There may be concerns
      about the feasibility of primary care practice and provider recruitment, the completion rate
      for the experimental intervention and loss-to-follow-up. Our research team has extensive
      experience conducting clinical trials of smoking cessation interventions (5, 6, 15). There
      are presently 31 eligible primary care practices in the Champlain, South East, and Central
      East LHINs [Appendix O -- Eligible Primary Care Practices], within the province of Ontario,
      which suggests we will be able to recruit the required sample size of ten primary care
      practices with relative ease.

      5.8 Ethical issues relating to the involvement of human subjects Trial design and conduct has
      been informed by Good Clinical Practice (GCP), an international ethical and scientific
      quality standard for designing, conducting, recording and reporting trials that involve the
      participation of human subjects. Compliance with this standard provides public assurance that
      the rights, safety and well-being of trial subjects are protected, consistent with the
      principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki, and that the clinical trial
      data are credible. The final study protocol will be reviewed and approved by the Ottawa
      Health Science Network Research Ethics Board REB. The trial will be reported in accordance
      with CONSORT guidelines for cluster randomized trials (23), and will be registered with
      clinicaltrials.gov.

    <description>This outcome is measured by the completion of the NRTQ forms and a chart audit. The chart audit will determine how many not ready to quit patients were seen by the provider as compared to how many of those patient received a reduction intervention. A reduction intervention is tracked by the provider using the &quot;Not Ready to Quit&quot; consult form. The language &quot;reduction&quot; is important to keep in our study because the word &quot;change&quot; is not specific enough. We are measuring the amount of reduction smoking cessation interventions specifically - meaning gradual cessation as compared to abrupt cessation.</description>
