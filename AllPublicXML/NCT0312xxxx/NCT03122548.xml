  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether CRS-207 in combination with pembrolizumab
      is safe and effective in adults with recurrent or metastatic gastric, gastroesophageal
      junction, or esophageal cancer who have received one or two prior chemotherapy regimens for
      advanced disease.

    <measure>Objective Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>BOR was assessed from the first post-baseline tumor assessment until documented disease progression, starting of a new cancer treatment, death, or study termination, whichever is earlier, assessed up to 15 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>ORR was evaluated based upon the best overall response (BOR) for individual study subjects. BOR was determined by the highest post-baseline qualitative response value for each evaluable subject as measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) and given the following hierarchy of overall response results: complete response (CR) &gt; partial response (PR) &gt; stable disease (SD) &gt; progressive disease (PD) &gt; not evaluable (NE). The protocol-specified ORR was defined as the percentage of evaluable subjects with a BOR of CR or PR; however, this percentage was not calculated per the final study Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). Therefore, the number of evaluable subjects with BOR RECIST v1.1 values of CR, PR, SD, PD, and NE are provided for this outcome measure. .</description>

    <description>Number of weeks from the date of first dose of study treatment to the first date of objectively determined progressive disease (PD) according to RECIST v1.1 or death from any cause, estimated using Kaplan-Meier (KM) methods with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

    <description>Number of weeks from the first date a study subject achieved an objective disease response of CR or PR according to RECIST v1.1 to the date a study subject exhibited PD or death due to any cause, estimated using KM methods with 95% CIs.

    <description>CRS-207 and pembrolizumab will be administered in 3-week cycles. For Cycle 1, pembrolizumab (200 mg) will be administered by intravenous (IV) infusion over 30 minutes on Day 1 and CRS-207 (starting dose 1 Ã— 10e9 colony-forming units [CFU]) will be administered by IV infusion over 1 hour on Day 2. If the infusions are well tolerated, pembrolizumab and CRS-207 may be administered on the same day (Day 1) for subsequent cycles. After 4 cycles, pembrolizumab will continue to be administered on Day 1 at each treatment cycle (every 3 weeks); CRS-207 will be administered once every 6 weeks (every other cycle). Treatment will continue for up to 35 cycles as long as there is adequate safety and potential for clinical benefit.</description>

        <title>Objective Response Rate (ORR)</title>
        <description>ORR was evaluated based upon the best overall response (BOR) for individual study subjects. BOR was determined by the highest post-baseline qualitative response value for each evaluable subject as measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) and given the following hierarchy of overall response results: complete response (CR) &gt; partial response (PR) &gt; stable disease (SD) &gt; progressive disease (PD) &gt; not evaluable (NE). The protocol-specified ORR was defined as the percentage of evaluable subjects with a BOR of CR or PR; however, this percentage was not calculated per the final study Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). Therefore, the number of evaluable subjects with BOR RECIST v1.1 values of CR, PR, SD, PD, and NE are provided for this outcome measure. .</description>
        <time_frame>BOR was assessed from the first post-baseline tumor assessment until documented disease progression, starting of a new cancer treatment, death, or study termination, whichever is earlier, assessed up to 15 weeks.</time_frame>
        <population>Analysis based upon subjects who received at least 1 dose of CRS-207 and had at least 1 evaluable post-baseline RECIST v1.1 tumor response assessment or were discontinued due to toxicity (the Evaluable Analysis Set [EAS]). 2 subjects did not have post-baseline tumor response assessments and could not be evaluated for this outcome measure.</population>
