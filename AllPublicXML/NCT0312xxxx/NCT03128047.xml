      The purpose of this study is to determine if the Optune NovoTTF-200A device can be safely
      used in combination with chemotherapy in pediatric patients with recurrent high-grade glioma
      and ependemoma.

      This phase I trial will utilize a standard 3+3 design to determine the safety and
      tolerability of the Optune NovoTTF-200A System in pediatric patients with recurrent
      high-grade glioma end ependemomas.

      Patients will receive treatment with the Optune NovoTTF-200A System along with Temozolomide
      and Bevacizumab and will consist of children with recurrent high-grade gliomas and
      Ependamomas. Patients enrolled will receive treatment with the Optune NovoTTF-200A with
      200kHz for a minimum of 18 hours per day in 28 day cycles as monotherapy. Phase I safety
      evaluation will take place over the initial two cycles (56 days) of treatment. Following the
      completion of the safety evaluation period, patients will continue to receive treatment in 28
      day cycles, which may be repeated continuously without therapy interruption for 12 cycles or
      until clinical criteria for discontinuation are met. Patients how appear to benefit from this
      treatment may be allowed to continue treatment beyond 12 cycles if approved by the study
      Principle Investigator.

             contraindicated.

          -  Recurrent high-grade glioma patients must begin therapy within four weeks of
             documented tumor progression by MRI scan.

          -  Patients must have a Lansky or Karnofsky performance status score of ≥ 50%,
             corresponding to ECOG categories of 0, 1 or 2. Use Karnofsky for patients &gt; 16 years

             because of paralysis, but who are up in a wheelchair will be considered ambulatory for
             the purpose of assessing the performance score.

          -  Able to undergo adequate tumor imaging, via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan to
             evaluate disease evolution.

          -  Adequate hematologic, renal, liver function as demonstrated by laboratory values: ANC
             ≥ 1,000/ul Hemoglobin ≥8.0 gm/dl Platelet count ≥ 100,000/ul

        Adequate Liver Function Defined As:

          -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) for age, and

          -  SGPT (ALT) &lt; 2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) for age. Adequate Renal Function

                  &lt; 1000 mg for patient enrollment.

        Note: UPC ratio of spot urine is an estimation of the 24 urine protein excretion - a UPC
        ratio of 1 is roughly equivalent to a 24-hour urine protein of 1000 mg. UPC ratio is
        calculated using one of the following formula:

          -  [urine protein]/[urine creatinine] - if both protein and creatinine are reported in
             mg/dL

          -  [(urine protein) x0.088]/[urine creatinine] - if urine creatinine is reported in
