    <textblock>
      This is a study with the purpose of studying the safety and efficacy of the study drug
      Atezolizumab in patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). Atezolizumab
      could shrink cancer but it could also cause side effects. This study will also test any good
      and bad effects the study drug. Other aims include studying biomarkers that will help
      researchers understand how the drug works.
