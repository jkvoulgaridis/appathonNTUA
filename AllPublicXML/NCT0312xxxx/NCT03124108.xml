    <measure>Change From Baseline in 5D-Itch Scale Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12 (Endpoint)</time_frame>
    <description>5 dimensional (5D)-Itch Scale is a reliable, multidimensional measure of itching that has been validated in participants with chronic pruritus to detect changes over time. It consists of 5 domains: duration, degree, direction, disability, and distribution. The duration, degree and direction domains each include one item, while the disability domain has four items (sleep, leisure/social, housework/errands, work/school). All items of the first four domains were measured on a 5-point Likert scale. The distribution domain included 16 potential locations of itch, including 15 body part items (head/scalp, soles, face, palms, chest, abdomen, back, buttocks, thighs, lower legs, tops of feet/toes, tops of hands/fingers, upper arms, groin, forearms) and one point of contact with clothing or bandages. Scores of each of five domains are achieved separately and then summed together to obtain a total 5-D score. 5-D scores can potentially range between 5 (no pruritus) and 25 (most severe pruritus).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Pruritus as Assessed by Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12 (Endpoint)</time_frame>
    <description>The VAS is a reliable and validated method of pruritus assessment. The VAS is adequate in assessing the severity of the symptom; it does not take into account other aspects of pruritus, such as the relative impact of pruritus on quality of life. The VAS, for pruritus assessment, requires the participant to use abstract thought processes to convert their itch severity to a mark on a continuum. A participant draws a line anywhere on the scale ranging from 0 to 10 (where 0 represents 'no itching' and 10 represents 'worst possible itching') that best represents the severity of participant's itching and the scoring involves manual measuring of the mark with a ruler on range of 0 to 100 millimeter (mm). Higher scores indicate worse itching.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12 (Endpoint)</time_frame>
    <description>PBC-40 QoL Questionnaire is a patient-derived, disease-specific QoL measure developed and validated for use in PBC. It consists of 9 domains with total 40 questions as: 1) digestion and diet (questions 1-3, total score range: 3-15); 2) experiences (questions 4-7, total score range: 4-20); 3) itching (questions 8-10, total score range: 3-15); 4) fatigue (questions 11-18, total score range: 8-40); 5) effort and planning (questions 19-21, total score range: 3-15); 6) memory and concentration (questions 22-27, total score range: 6-30); 7) affects you as a person (questions 28-33, total score range: 6-30); 8) affects your social life (questions 34-37, total score range: 4-20); 9) overall impact on your life (questions 38-40, total score range: 3-15). PBC-40 QoL Questionnaire has 40 questions, each scored on scale of 1-5 (1 = least impact, 5 = greatest impact). For each domain, scoring involved summing individual question response scores. Higher scores indicate poorer quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Serious Treatment Emergent Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation patient administered a pharmaceutical (investigational) product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. A Serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization/prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, is another medically important condition. TEAEs is defined as (1) it is not present when active phase of study (time of first dose) begins and is not a chronic condition that is part of patient's medical history, or it is present at start of active phase or as part of patient's medical history, but severity/frequency increases during active phase.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in 5D-Itch Scale Total Score</title>
        <description>5 dimensional (5D)-Itch Scale is a reliable, multidimensional measure of itching that has been validated in participants with chronic pruritus to detect changes over time. It consists of 5 domains: duration, degree, direction, disability, and distribution. The duration, degree and direction domains each include one item, while the disability domain has four items (sleep, leisure/social, housework/errands, work/school). All items of the first four domains were measured on a 5-point Likert scale. The distribution domain included 16 potential locations of itch, including 15 body part items (head/scalp, soles, face, palms, chest, abdomen, back, buttocks, thighs, lower legs, tops of feet/toes, tops of hands/fingers, upper arms, groin, forearms) and one point of contact with clothing or bandages. Scores of each of five domains are achieved separately and then summed together to obtain a total 5-D score. 5-D scores can potentially range between 5 (no pruritus) and 25 (most severe pruritus).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Pruritus as Assessed by Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) Total Score</title>
        <description>The VAS is a reliable and validated method of pruritus assessment. The VAS is adequate in assessing the severity of the symptom; it does not take into account other aspects of pruritus, such as the relative impact of pruritus on quality of life. The VAS, for pruritus assessment, requires the participant to use abstract thought processes to convert their itch severity to a mark on a continuum. A participant draws a line anywhere on the scale ranging from 0 to 10 (where 0 represents 'no itching' and 10 represents 'worst possible itching') that best represents the severity of participant's itching and the scoring involves manual measuring of the mark with a ruler on range of 0 to 100 millimeter (mm). Higher scores indicate worse itching.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Pruritus as Assessed by Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) Total Score</title>
          <description>The VAS is a reliable and validated method of pruritus assessment. The VAS is adequate in assessing the severity of the symptom; it does not take into account other aspects of pruritus, such as the relative impact of pruritus on quality of life. The VAS, for pruritus assessment, requires the participant to use abstract thought processes to convert their itch severity to a mark on a continuum. A participant draws a line anywhere on the scale ranging from 0 to 10 (where 0 represents 'no itching' and 10 represents 'worst possible itching') that best represents the severity of participant's itching and the scoring involves manual measuring of the mark with a ruler on range of 0 to 100 millimeter (mm). Higher scores indicate worse itching.</description>
          <population>The mITT analysis set included all randomized participants who received at least one study drug dose with available baseline value and at least one post baseline value for the primary endpoint. Here 'N' (number of participants analyzed) signifies number of participants evaluable for this outcome measure.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Primary Biliary Cholangitis -40 (PBC-40) Quality of Life (QoL) Questionnaire Scores</title>
        <description>PBC-40 QoL Questionnaire is a patient-derived, disease-specific QoL measure developed and validated for use in PBC. It consists of 9 domains with total 40 questions as: 1) digestion and diet (questions 1-3, total score range: 3-15); 2) experiences (questions 4-7, total score range: 4-20); 3) itching (questions 8-10, total score range: 3-15); 4) fatigue (questions 11-18, total score range: 8-40); 5) effort and planning (questions 19-21, total score range: 3-15); 6) memory and concentration (questions 22-27, total score range: 6-30); 7) affects you as a person (questions 28-33, total score range: 6-30); 8) affects your social life (questions 34-37, total score range: 4-20); 9) overall impact on your life (questions 38-40, total score range: 3-15). PBC-40 QoL Questionnaire has 40 questions, each scored on scale of 1-5 (1 = least impact, 5 = greatest impact). For each domain, scoring involved summing individual question response scores. Higher scores indicate poorer quality of life.</description>

        <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation patient administered a pharmaceutical (investigational) product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. A Serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization/prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, is another medically important condition. TEAEs is defined as (1) it is not present when active phase of study (time of first dose) begins and is not a chronic condition that is part of patient's medical history, or it is present at start of active phase or as part of patient's medical history, but severity/frequency increases during active phase.</description>
