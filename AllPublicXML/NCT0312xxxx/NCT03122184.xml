  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled pilot trial in approximately 50 acute coronary syndrome
      patients to determine if a 12 week, telephone-delivered, combined positive
      psychology-motivational interviewing intervention is feasible and more effective than a
      motivational interviewing health education program at improving health behaviors and other
      outcomes. The investigators hypothesize that the intervention will be associated with better
      mental and physical health outcomes and better health behavior adherence compared to the
      motivational interviewing health education program.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The initial study visit will occur in-person two weeks after discharge from the hospital.
      Participants will meet with a member of the study staff (the study &quot;trainer&quot;) and complete
      self-report questionnaires assessing health behavior adherence and mental and physical
      health. Then, participants will be randomized to receive the positive psychology +
      motivational interviewing or the motivational interviewing health education interventions. A
      study interventionist will provide a treatment manual specific to their condition, review the
      rationale for the initial exercise, and assign the first exercise. If the participant is in
      the positive psychology + motivational interviewing condition, the trainer will explain the
      rationale for both the positive psychology and goal-setting portions of the program, and will
      be assigned the first exercise. Similarly, if the participant is randomized into the
      motivational interviewing health education program, the interventionist will introduce them
      to the program and assign the first exercise. Participants in both groups will then be given
      an accelerometer, which they will be asked to wear for 7 days to ensure that they are
      comfortable with the device and that useable data can be obtained from the participant.
      Participants in both groups will then complete twelve 30-minute weekly phone sessions with a
      study trainer. The phone sessions primarily will include a review of the prior week's session
      content and a discussion of the rationale and assignment of the next week's
      exercise/assignment. Upon the completion of these calls, and again at a final follow-up
      timepoint at 24 weeks, a blinded member of the study staff will call participants to
      administer self-report outcome measures. Participants will also be asked to wear an
      accelerometer at each of these follow-up timepoints as an objective measure of physical
      activity, which they will return by mail to the study staff.

Positive Psychology + Motivational Interviewing: For the positive psychology portion of the intervention, the study trainer will (a) review the week’s positive psychology exercise, (b) discuss the rationale of the next week’s positive psychology exercise through a guided review of the positive psychology manual, and (c) assign the next week’s positive psychology exercise. For the motivational interviewing portion, participants will (a) review their physical activity goal from the prior week, (b) discuss techniques for improving physical activity, and (c) set a physical activity goal for the next week. Study trainers will use motivational interviewing techniques to facilitate goal setting.</description>

          <title>Motivational Interviewing Health Education</title>
          <description>Participants will speak on the telephone each week with a study trainer. During these calls, the trainer will provide education about a health behavior (physical activity, medication adherence, diet, stress reduction) and assign an activity related to one health behavior each week. Motivational interviewing techniques will be used throughout to facilitate health behavior changes.
Motivational Interviewing Health Education: Each week, participants will learn about a different health behavior topic related to cardiac health. They will also be introduced to motivational interviewing topics in concert with the health behavior education topics. The intervention is divided into five sections, focusing on five different important cardiac health-related topics (recovery from an acute cardiac illness, physical activity, a heart-healthy diet, medication adherence, and stress reduction).</description>

          <title>HADS-D Score</title>
          <description>The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale will be used to measure depression and anxiety. This is a well-validated scale with few somatic symptom items that can confound mood/anxiety assessment in medically-ill patients.(Range: 0-21). Higher scores indicate worse outcome (i.e. greater levels of depression). This measure was used at Baseline, Week 12, and Week 24.</description>

        <description>ActiGraph GT3X+ step counters are validated as measures of physical activity and have been used in numerous studies of physical activity in patients with medical illness. In this trial, participants will wear the accelerometer for one week at 12 weeks, and another week at 24 weeks to assess the feasibility of doing so and to ensure adequate capture of physical activity. In our analysis, data on pre-ACS activity was collected using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) to control for baseline activity.</description>

            <description>Participants will speak on the telephone each week with a study trainer. During these calls, the trainer will provide education about a health behavior (physical activity, medication adherence, diet, stress reduction) and assign an activity related to one health behavior each week. Motivational interviewing techniques will be used throughout to facilitate health behavior changes.
Motivational Interviewing Health Education: Each week, participants will learn about a different health behavior topic related to cardiac health. They will also be introduced to motivational interviewing topics in concert with the health behavior education topics. The intervention is divided into five sections, focusing on five different important cardiac health-related topics (recovery from an acute cardiac illness, physical activity, a heart-healthy diet, medication adherence, and stress reduction).</description>

          <description>ActiGraph GT3X+ step counters are validated as measures of physical activity and have been used in numerous studies of physical activity in patients with medical illness. In this trial, participants will wear the accelerometer for one week at 12 weeks, and another week at 24 weeks to assess the feasibility of doing so and to ensure adequate capture of physical activity. In our analysis, data on pre-ACS activity was collected using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) to control for baseline activity.</description>

They will also be introduced to motivational interviewing topics in concert with the health behavior education topics. The intervention is divided into five sections, focusing on five different important cardiac health-related topics (recovery from an acute cardiac illness, physical activity, a heart-healthy diet, medication adherence, and stress reduction).</description>

          <description>The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale will be used to measure depression and anxiety. This is a well-validated scale with few somatic symptom items that can confound mood/anxiety assessment in medically-ill patients.(Range: 0-21). Change was calculated by subtracting the score at baseline from the score at 12 and 24 weeks. Higher scores indicate worse outcome (i.e. greater levels of depression).</description>

          <description>Participants will complete weekly positive psychology exercises and will systematically set goals related to physical activity. Study trainers will review the positive psychology exercises on the phone each week and will use motivational interviewing techniques to facilitate goal setting.
Positive Psychology + Motivational Interviewing: For the positive psychology portion of the intervention, the study trainer will (a) review the week’s positive psychology exercise, (b) discuss the rationale of the next week’s positive psychology exercise through a guided review of the positive psychology manual, and (c) assign the next week’s positive psychology exercise. For the motivational interviewing portion, participants will (a) review their physical activity goal from the prior week, (b) discuss techniques for improving physical activity, and (c) set a physical activity goal for the next week. Study trainers will use motivational interviewing techniques to facilitate goal setting.</description>

          <title>Motivational Interviewing Health Education</title>
          <description>Participants will speak on the telephone each week with a study trainer. During these calls, the trainer will provide education about a health behavior (physical activity, medication adherence, diet, stress reduction) and assign an activity related to one health behavior each week. Motivational interviewing techniques will be used throughout to facilitate health behavior changes.
Motivational Interviewing Health Education: Each week, participants will learn about a different health behavior topic related to cardiac health. They will also be introduced to motivational interviewing topics in concert with the health behavior education topics. The intervention is divided into five sections, focusing on five different important cardiac health-related topics (recovery from an acute cardiac illness, physical activity, a heart-healthy diet, medication adherence, and stress reduction).</description>
