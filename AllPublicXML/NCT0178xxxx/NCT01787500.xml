      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of vemurafenib when given together
      with cetuximab and irinotecan hydrochloride in treating patients with solid tumors that have
      spread to other parts of the body or cannot be removed by surgery. Vemurafenib and irinotecan
      hydrochloride may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for
      cell growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab, may help the body's
      immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow
      and spread. Giving vemurafenib with cetuximab and irinotecan hydrochloride may be a better
      treatment for solid tumors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of vemurafenib when used in combination with
      cetuximab and irinotecan (irinotecan hydrochloride).

      II. To define the safety profile of this combination. III. To determine the antitumor
      activity of this combination specifically in patients with advanced solid malignancies with
      positive v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF) (V600)/negative Kirsten rat
      sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (K-RAS) mutation. (Part II-expanded cohort) IV. To determine
      the antitumor activity of this combination in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer with
      positive BRAF (V600)/negative K-RAS mutation. (Part II-expanded cohort)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate clinical response signals of the combination. II. To assess the
      pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) profile of the combination.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of vemurafenib.

      Patients receive vemurafenib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-14, cetuximab
      intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes, and irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 90 minutes on day 1.
      Courses repeat every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.
