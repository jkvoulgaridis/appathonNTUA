  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of raltegravir
      (RAL) when given to HIV-1-exposed, normal birth weight newborn infants at risk of acquiring
      HIV-1 infection. (PK is the study of the time course of absorption, distribution, metabolism,
      and excretion of drugs in the body.) The primary goal of this study was to determine a dose
      of RAL that was safe and met the PK targets for infants when administered during the first 6
      weeks of life in addition to standard of care antiretroviral (ARV) agents for prevention of
      perinatal transmission.

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I multi-center, open label, non-comparative study to evaluate the safety and
      PK of RAL administered to HIV-1-exposed full-term (≥37 weeks of gestation) infants when
      administered during the first 6 weeks of life in addition to the infants' standard HIV-1 ARV
      prophylaxis.

      IMPAACT P1097 (NCT01828073) demonstrated that RAL crossed the placenta from mother to fetus
      after maternal dosing during pregnancy and RAL was slowly eliminated by the newborn after
      birth. Therefore, for P1110, within each cohort, infants were stratified into the &quot;RAL-naive&quot;
      or &quot;RAL-exposed&quot; groups depending on infants' in utero exposure to maternal RAL. The study
      stratification with respect to in utero RAL exposure allowed for adjustment of the initial
      RAL dosing (i.e. timing and/or dose size).

      Study participants were enrolled in two sequential cohorts with the following actual dosing
      of RAL in addition to their local standard of care ARV agents for prevention of perinatal
      transmission. PK and safety data from Cohort 1 (two single doses) provided information for
      the starting dosing for Cohort 2 (daily dosing through 6 weeks of life).

      Cohort 1: Two single RAL doses: first dose within 48 hours of birth and second dose at 7-10
      days of life.

        -  Cohort 1, RAL-naive: 3 or 2 mg/kg within 48 hours of birth and 3 mg/kg at 7-10 days of
           life. (P1110 V1.0 Clarification Memorandum #3, dated January 15, 2015, adjusted the
           first dose from 3 mg/kg to 2 mg/kg based on available PK data.)

        -  Cohort 1, RAL-exposed: 1.5 mg/kg within 48 hours of birth and 3 mg/kg at 7-10 days of
           life.

      Cohort 2: Daily RAL dosing through 6 weeks of life.

        -  Cohort 2, RAL-naive: Daily dosing through 6 weeks of life with initial RAL dosing within
           48 hours of birth: 1.5 mg/kg once daily during Days 1-7 of life, 3.0 mg/kg twice daily
           during Days 8-28 of life, and 6.0 mg/kg twice daily during Days 29-42 of life.

        -  Cohort 2, RAL-exposed: Daily dosing through 6 weeks of life with initial RAL dosing
           between 12-60 hours of birth: 1.5 mg/kg once daily during Days 1-7 of life, 3.0 mg/kg
           twice daily during Days 8-28 of life, and 6.0 mg/kg twice daily during Days 29-42 of
           life.

      Target enrollment was approximately 50 infants and their mothers in order to have a minimum
      of 12 and 20 PK evaluable infants in Cohorts 1 and 2, respectively. Cohort 1 and Cohort 2
      RAL-naive infants (and their mothers) were enrolled under protocol Version 1.0. Cohort 2
      RAL-exposed infants (and their mothers) were enrolled under protocol Version 2.0.

      Infants and their mothers were enrolled within 48 and within 60 hours of delivery under
      protocol Versions 1.0 and 2.0, respectively. Infants were followed through 24 weeks of life
      and their mothers were followed until discharge from the labor and delivery unit.

      Infant PK samples were collected as follows:

      Cohort 1:

        -  Dose #1 (within 48 hours of birth) intensive PK sampling: Within 30 min pre-dose, and
           1-2 hours post-dose, 4-8 hours post-dose, 12 (±1) hours post-dose, and 24 (±1) hours
           post-dose.

        -  One random PK sample at 3-4 days of life.

        -  Dose #2 (7-10 days of life) limited PK sampling: Within 30 min pre-dose, and 1-2 hours
           post-dose and 24 (±1) hours post-dose.

      Cohort 2:

        -  Initial dose (within 48 and 12-60 hours of birth for RAL-naive and RAL-exposed infants,
           respectively) intensive PK sampling: Within 1 hour pre-dose, and 1-2 hours, 6-10 hours,
           20-24 hours post-dose.

        -  PK sampling for second dose: 3-6 hours post-dose.

        -  PK sampling at 6-9 days of life: Within 1 hour pre-dose of initiating 3mg/kg twice
           daily.

        -  Intensive PK sampling at 15-18 days of life: Within 1 hour pre-dose, and 1-2 hours
           post-dose, 4-6 hours post-dose, and 8-12 hours post-dose.

        -  PK sampling at 28-32 days of life: Within 1 hour pre-dose of initiating 6 mg/kg twice
           daily.

        -  PK sampling at 33-42 days of life done at Week 5-6 visit: Within 1 hour pre-dose, and
           3-6 hours post-dose.

      Protocol defined infant safety evaluations were done at:

      Cohort 1: Entry, 3-4 days of life, 7-10 days of life, 2 weeks of life, 6 weeks of life and 24
      weeks of life.

      Cohort 2: Entry, 2-4 days of life, 6-9 days of life, 15-18 days of life, 28-32 days of life,
      5-6 weeks of life, 8-10 weeks of life and 24 weeks of life.

      Infant safety data included death, signs/symptoms, diagnoses and laboratory test results.
      Laboratory test results included results from evaluations specified in the protocol and
      evaluations done as part of the infant's clinical care which the sites considered relevant.

      PK evaluable infants were those determined by the protocol pharmacologist to have PK results
      which provide analyzable data on the primary PK parameters of interest. Infants who were PK
      unevaluable were replaced for PK analysis but continued with the study safety follow-up
      visits.

      Infants were evaluable for safety analysis if they received at least one dose of RAL. The
      safety analyses were based on data from all safety evaluable infants, regardless of whether
      they were evaluable for PK analysis.

      The study initially opened accrual to Cohort 1 RAL-naive group. The PK and safety data from
      IMPAACT P1110 Cohort 1 RAL-naive group and from IMPAACT P1097 were used to determine the
      starting dose for the Cohort 1 RAL-exposed group. Opening accrual to the Cohort 2 RAL-naive
      group was contingent upon infants enrolled in Cohort 1 RAL-naive and RAL-exposed groups
      successfully meeting safety criteria and providing adequate PK data to determine a regimen to
      be tested for daily dosing through 6 weeks of life for the Cohort 2 RAL-naive group. The
      initial dosing regimen for the Cohort 2 RAL-naive group was determined using population PK
      modeling and simulations incorporating IMPAACT P1110 Cohort 1 data, along with data from the
      following IMPAACT studies: P1097, P1066 (NCT00485264) (Cohorts IV and V) and P1026s
      (NCT00042289). Since the PK results of Cohort 1 RAL-naive and exposed groups were similar
      except in the first 1-2 days of life and P1097 Cohort 1 results suggested that maternal RAL
      readily crosses the placenta and results to washout RAL exposure in neonates, Cohort 2
      RAL-exposed group was determined to receive the same dose of RAL as Cohort 2 RAL-naive group,
      except the initial dose for RAL-exposed was delayed to within 12 to 60 hours of life.

Events with onset dates prior to the first RAL dosing and congenital anomalies assessed as baseline by the study team were considered baseline events and not AEs. SADRs are AEs assessed as definitely related, probably related or possibly related to RAL.</description>
          <population>All infants who received at least one dose of RAL. Excluded was one Cohort 2 RAL-naive infant who received one dose of RAL at study entry but was off study right after study entry and thus had no post entry safety data.</population>
