  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a three-arm, randomized, open label, multi-center phase II study investigating the
      combination of everolimus (10mg daily) with exemestane (25mg daily) versus everolimus (10mg
      daily) versus capecitabine (1250mg/m2 twice daily for 14 days, 3-week cycle) in patients with
      estrogen-receptor positive, HER2 negative, advanced breast cancer after recurrence or
      progression on letrozole or anastrozole.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The reference therapy (control arm) used in the course of this trial was the combination arm
      of everolimus plus exemestane. The investigational therapies in the context of this study
      were everolimus monotherapy and capecitabine monotherapy. All treatments were taken orally
      until disease progression, intolerable toxicity or withdrawal of patient's informed consent.
      Patients were randomly assigned with equal allocation to one of the treatment arms:

        1. Exemestane (25mg daily) in combination with everolimus (10mg daily)

        2. Everolimus (10mg daily)

        3. Capecitabine (1250mg/m2 twice daily) orally for two weeks, followed by a one week rest
           period in 3-weeks cycles.

      Treatment assignment was stratified by the presence of visceral disease (yes vs. no).
      Visceral refered to lung, liver, heart, ovary, spleen, kidney, adrenal gland, malignant
      pleural or pericardial effusion or malignant ascites.

    <measure>Progression Free Survival (PFS) - Everolimus plus exemestane versus everolimus alone</measure>
    <time_frame>28 months after first patient randomized or once approximatly 150 PFS have occurred</time_frame>
    <description>Progression Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the time from date of randomization to the date of first radiologically documented progression or death due to any cause. If a patient did not progress or die at the time of the analysis data cut-off or start of new antineoplastic therapy, PFS was censored at the date of the last adequate tumor assessment before the earliest of the cut-off date or the start date of additional anti-neoplastic therapy. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria RECIST v1.1, as 20% increase in the sum of diameter of all measured target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of diameter of all target lesions recorded at or after baseline and/or unequivocal progression of the non-target lesions and/or appearance of a new lesion. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.</description>

    <description>Overall Response Rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of participants with best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on local investigator's assessment according to RECIST 1.1. ORR was analyzed in the full population. Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) for target/non target lesions: Complete Response (CR), disappearance of all target/non target lesions (all lymph nodes assigned as non-target lesions must be non-pathological in size (&lt; 10 mm short axis)); Partial response (PR), &gt;=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions ; Overall Response (OR)= CR+PR. Only descriptive analysis.</description>

    <description>Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) is defined as the proportion of participants with a best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) or Non-CR/non-PD lasting more than 24 weeks based on local investigator's assessment according to RECIST 1.1. Only descriptive analysis.</description>

    <measure>Time to definitive deterioration in Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 1, every 6 weeks for approximately 8 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status is a scale used to assess how a patient's disease is progressing, assess how the disease affects the daily living abilities of the patient, and determine appropriate treatment and prognosis. The ECOG Performance Scores has 5 grades: 0 = fully active, able to carry on all pre-disease performance without restriction, 1 = restricted in physically strenuous activity but ambulatory and able to carry out work of a light or sedentary nature, e.g., light housework, office work, 2 = ambulatory and capable of all self-care but unable to carry out any work activities, up and about more than 50% of waking hours, 3 = capable of only limited self-care, confined to bed or chair more than 50% of waking hours, 4 = completely disabled, cannot carry on any self-care, totally confined to bed or chair and 5 = dead. Definitive deterioration is defined as no improvement in the ECOG status following observation of the deterioration.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to 10% definitive deterioration in the global health status/Quality of life per EORTC-QLQ-C30</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, every 6 weeks for approximately 8 months</time_frame>
    <description>The global health status/QoL scale score of the QLQ-C30 is identified as the primary PRO variable of interest. Physical Functioning (PF), Emotional Functioning (EF) and Social Functioning (SF) scale scores of the QLQ-C30. The time to definitive 10% deterioration is defined as the time from the randomization date to the date of an event, which is defined as a worsening (decrease) in score by at least 10% compared to baseline, with no later increase above this threshold observed during the course of the study or death due to any cause. All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level. A high score for a functional scale represents a high /healthy level of functioning, a high score for the global health status / QoL represents a high QoL.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean change in Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM) between Week 3 and Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 3, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The TSQM was developed and validated as a general measure for treatment satisfaction. It contains 14 items assessing the following 4 domains: effectiveness (sum of scores for questions 1 - 3), side effects (sum of scores for questions 4 - 8), convenience (sum of scores for questions 9 - 11) and Global Satisfaction (sum of scores for questions 12 - 14). The scores of the domain were added together and an algorithm was used to create a score of 0 to 100. Higher scores indicated greater satisfaction. A positive change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>
