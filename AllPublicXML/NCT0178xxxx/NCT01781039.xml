  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Understanding speech is essential for good communication. Individuals with hearing loss and
      poor speech discrimination often have little success with hearing aids because amplifying
      sound improves audibility, but not clarity of the speech signal. The purpose of this study is
      to determine the relative importance of the sensory cells of the inner ear and auditory
      neurons on speech discrimination performance in quiet and in noise. This information may be
      used as a predictor of hearing aid benefit. The investigators expect to find decreased speech
      understanding ability resulting from both loss of sensory cells and the loss of auditory
      neurons.

    <description>Subjects with normal OHC function and who will be undergoing an previously scheduled anesthetized procedure will be assigned into 2 groups based on their self-perceived HIN difficulty (high and low difficulty), and then undergo a test battery consisting of auditory threshold tests, objective HIN assays, OHC measurements, cognitive processing, and central auditory processing evaluations. Immediately after anesthetization, electrocochleography (ECochG) will be used to measure CAP amplitudes, which will be correlated with measurements obtained from unanesthetized subjects as described below. This aim will determine the optimal CAP recording method with the strongest correlation with HIN performance in humans</description>

    <description>Subjects with hfPTAs ranging from 0-55 dB HL will be recruitedwith 100 persons self-reporting difficulty HIN (&gt; 50% of the time), and 100 persons reporting little difficulty HIN (&lt; 50% of the time) will be randomly assigned to one of five groups (n = 200) based on enabled HA features using an online random assignment tool. Unaided HIQ and HIN assessments will be conducted in the sound field, and baseline DPOAE and CAP assessments will be measured. Subjects will be fit with binaural premium level receiver-in-the canal HAs (Phonak B90 or equivalent model at the start of the study) with 56 dB SPL gain receivers, using closed domes, and programmed to NAL-NL2 target gain, and randomly assigned to the groups.</description>
