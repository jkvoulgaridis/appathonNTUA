  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure how much of the study drug or insulin glargine gets
      into the blood stream and how long it takes the body to get rid of it. The effect of exercise
      will also be evaluated.

      This study has two parts. In Part A, each participant will receive a daily injection of
      LY2605541 or insulin glargine for about 15 days. Some participants may continue into Part B.
      In Part B, participants will receive a daily injection of LY2605541 or insulin glargine with
      or without exercise. Part B lasts about 6 days.

      Participants will remain on their regular physician-prescribed mealtime insulin throughout
      the study.
