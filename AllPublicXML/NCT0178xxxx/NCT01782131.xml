  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of posaconazole (POS) versus
      voriconazole (VOR) in the treatment of adults and adolescents with invasive aspergillosis
      (IA). The primary hypothesis is that the all-cause mortality through Day 42 in the POS
      treatment group is non-inferior to that in the VOR treatment group.

    <description>Participants will start therapy with a posaconazole loading dose of 300 mg intravenously (IV) twice per day (BID) on Day 1, and then will receive posaconazole IV 300 mg once per day (QD) starting on Day 2 until clinically stable when participants will transition to oral therapy with posaconazole 300 mg tablets QD for up to a total of 12 weeks of treatment. Participants with renal insufficiency or without central venous catheter access may start study treatment with a loading dose of oral posaconazole 300 mg tablets BID on Day 1, and then 300 mg QD for up to a total of 12 weeks of treatment.</description>

             post-randomization

          -  Must have a central line (e.g., central venous catheter, peripherally-inserted central
             catheter, etc.) in place or planned to be in place prior to beginning IV study
