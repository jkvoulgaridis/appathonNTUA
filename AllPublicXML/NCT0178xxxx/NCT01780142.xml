      Background:

      - Asthma is a lung condition that causes difficulty breathing and decreased lung function.
      Some people with asthma have more severe disease symptoms. They may be less responsive to
      standard treatments such as steroids. Researchers want to compare severe asthmatics with mild
      or moderate asthmatics or people without asthma over a long period. This information may help
      identify new treatments for people whose asthma is not well controlled by standard
      medications.

      Objectives:

      - To compare severe asthmatics with mild or moderate asthmatics, and healthy volunteers, to
      study the progression and outcomes of the disease.

      Eligibility:

        -  Individuals at least 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with asthma for at least 1
           year.

        -  Healthy volunteers at least 18 years of age.

      Design:

        -  This study will involve an initial visit to the NIH Clinical Center for all
           participants. Selected participants may be asked to return for repeat visits over a
           number of years. The test results from participants with asthma will be compared with
           those from the healthy volunteers.

        -  All participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history.

        -  Participants may (but will not necessarily) have the following tests at each visit:

        -  Complete medical history and physical exam

        -  Blood, urine, sputum, and nasal cell samples

        -  Breath tests and heart and lung function tests

        -  Six-minute walk test to measure ability to exercise

        -  Imaging studies such as chest x-rays, bone density scans, and sinus scans

        -  Allergy skin testing

        -  Vocal cord exam

        -  Overnight sleep study

        -  Participants may remain on the study for as long as they are willing to participate and
           do not develop health problems that will interfere with the study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a common disease and a significant public health problem, affecting one in every 10
      individuals, nearly 30 million people in the US alone. About 5-10% of asthmatics have severe
      disease that is difficult to control with standard therapies. Severe asthmatics are
      considered to be relatively resistant to corticosteroids, a mainstay of therapy in asthma.
      Furthermore, chronic corticosteroid therapy often results in side effects that adversely
      affect outcomes. Thus, more effective treatment options, which are safe, cost-effective and
      easy to administer, are needed for severe asthmatics.

      As our understanding of asthma evolves, it is becoming clearer that there are distinct
      phenotypes that differ regarding demographic factors such as age, sex and race, but also,
      perhaps more importantly, with regards to clinical, physiologic and biologic characteristics.
      This heterogeneity may reflect distinct pathogenic mechanisms that result in airflow
      obstruction and the clinical presentation of asthma. In turn, a better understanding of the
      different factors that contribute to disease severity and pathogenesis will be necessary to
      identify new, personalized treatment and management approaches for severe asthmatics. Our
      goal is to gain a better understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms that differentiate severe
      asthma from mild to moderate asthma, including the role of the above-mentioned factors on
      disease control. In so doing, we hope to discover novel pathways that can be manipulated to
      achieve our primary aim of developing new therapies for severe asthmatics.

        Recruitment of subjects will be aimed at selecting our study population of interest, severe
        asthmatics of both genders and all races over the age of 18 years. Mild and moderately
        severe asthmatics, as well as age (+/- 10 years) and gender matched healthy volunteers
        (non-asthmatics), will be enrolled for comparison to severe asthmatics. Asthmatics with
        other concomitant conditions, e.g. other lung diseases such as COPD, which may confound the
        data collected, may be excluded from the study.

      <textblock>
        -  All volunteer subjects must be at least 18 years of age and must be able to provide
             informed, written consent for participation in this study. Subjects will be recruited
             irrespective of age, sex, race or ethnicity. Eligibility in the study is determined on
             the basis of the following inclusion and exclusion criteria.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA - ASTHMATICS:

          -  Subjects must be over 18 years of age.

          -  Subjects must have had a diagnosis of asthma, as defined by the American Thoracic
             Society, for at least one year to enter this study.

          -  Subjects must have a history of reversible airflow obstruction, as defined by a
             positive response to inhaled bronchodilators or a positive methacholine
             bronchoprovocation challenge by ATS criteria. Severe, refractory asthma will be
             defined by the 2000 ATS workshop consensus criteria. Refractory asthmatics will meet
             one or both of the major criteria and at least two minor criteria as outlined in the
             Protocol. This definition is applicable only to patients in whom (1) other conditions
             have been excluded, (2) exacerbating factors have been optimally treated, and (3) poor
             adherence does not appear to be a confounding issue. Compliance or medication
             adherence will be assessed at the initial and subsequent visits by questioning the
             subjects about their medication use (self-report).

          -  If asthmatic subjects do not fulfill the criteria for severe asthma, they will be
             classified as mild to moderate asthmatics.

          -  Subjects must have the ability to provide informed consent.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA - NON-ASTHMATICS:

          -  Subjects must be at least 18 years of age without a clinical diagnosis of asthma.

          -  Subjects must have no evidence of obstructive airway disease, as defined by ATS
             criteria on spirometry, and a negative methacholine bronchoprovocation challenge.

          -  Subjects must have the ability to provide informed consent.

          -  Subjects will be matched to asthmatics by gender and age (+/- 10 years).

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        -Any concurrent condition (medical, social or behavioral) that, in the opinion of the
        research team, would preclude or confound acquisition or interpretation of data or delivery
        of care.
