  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this project is to use technology to improve adherence to antiretroviral
      therapy (ART)and increase access to ART adherence care for those HIV+ persons living in rural
      areas. The LIVE Network audio music program mobile application (app) is innovative,
      practical, portable, and could be rapidly scaled up to address the adherence self-management
      needs of rural groups nationwide. If successful, the impact on HIV care will be immense and
      could transform the delivery of HIV self-management and adherence education by overcoming
      barriers of geographic isolation, transportation, stigma and confidentiality in this
      vulnerable group.

      The project has two primary aims and one exploratory aim. 1.0 Revise and adapt the Live
      Network (LN) program and manual for rural persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) and develop
      into a mobile application.

      2.0 Conduct a randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of the program. When compared
      with an educational music control condition at 3, 6, and 9 months post-baseline, those
      randomized to the LN will have: H1: Significantly higher mean antiretroviral therapy (ART)
      adherence rates (measured by pill counts, self report).

      H2: Significantly higher mean levels of ART drug levels in hair sample analyses.

      H3: Significantly better clinical indicators: higher mean CD4 lymphocyte counts and percents,
      a larger proportion achieving virologic suppression (proportion with HIV RNA PCR &lt;50
      copies/ml), and smaller proportion with evidence of drug resistance, all as measured by
      medical record review.

      3.0 Explore: a) the effects of LN on symptoms and symptom management; b) the roles of
      self-efficacy, outcome expectancies, and personal goal setting as mediators, and depression
      and health literacy as moderators of adherence.

    <description>Adherence rate was measured with the Antiretroviral General Adherence Scale (AGAS) which measures the general ease and ability to take one's medication as prescribed in the past 30 days. It includes 5 items scored 1 to 6, with the possible scores for this instrument ranging from 5 to 30, and higher scores reflect better adherence.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months post-intervention, 6 months post-intervention, 9 months post-intervention, 9 to 12 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>CD4 count is a test that measures the number of CD4 cells in your blood. CD4 cells, also known as T cell lymphocytes, are white blood cells that fight infection and play an important role in your immune system. A CD4 count is used to check the health of the immune system in people infected with HIV (human immunodeficiency virus). The count measures the number of CD4 cells in a small sample of blood. The percent of CD4 cells measure the percentage of all lymphocytes that are CD4 cells. The study assesses the percentage of CD4 lymphocytes over time.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months post-intervention, 6 months post-intervention, 9 months post-intervention, 9 to 12 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Change in number of participants with viral load presented as number of copies if &lt;50 copies versus ≥ 50 copies. Subjects were coded as having non-detectable viral loads if the &quot;load&quot; was &lt; 50 copies. The analyses performed reflects the number of subjects with non-detectable load (&lt;50) at Baseline, 3 months post-intervention, 6 months post-intervention, 9 months post-intervention, 9 to 12 months post-intervention.</description>

        <title>Clinical Indicator: Change in Mean CD4 Percentage</title>
        <description>CD4 count is a test that measures the number of CD4 cells in your blood. CD4 cells, also known as T cell lymphocytes, are white blood cells that fight infection and play an important role in your immune system. A CD4 count is used to check the health of the immune system in people infected with HIV (human immunodeficiency virus). The count measures the number of CD4 cells in a small sample of blood. The percent of CD4 cells measure the percentage of all lymphocytes that are CD4 cells. The study assesses the percentage of CD4 lymphocytes over time.</description>
