      The Metabolism, Infection and Immunity (MINI) Study is a longitudinal natural history study
      at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) that aims to define the relationship between
      infection, immunity and clinical decline in individuals with mitochondrial disease.
      Mitochondrial diseases are a group of disorders caused by problems with the cell s ability to
      produce energy. Infection in individuals with mitochondrial disease can lead to worsening
      clinical symptoms, particularly neurologic symptoms.

      Goals:

      The main goal of our study is to understand the relationship between infection and clinical
      decline in patients with mitochondrial disease. Mitochondrial diseases can affect many
      different parts of the body, including the immune system and its ability to respond to
      infection. Therefore, we perform a comprehensive evaluation of participants including a
      detailed immunologic assessment.

      We are not testing any new medicine or procedure to treat or cure IEM or mitochondrial
      diseases. However, by understanding the relationship between infection and mitochondrial
      disease, we hope to develop treatments in the future. At the NIH, we are interested in
      research. Although we do provide advice and care for people enrolled in our study, we are not
      able to take over the long-term care of participants. To enroll in our study, you (your
      child) must already have a confirmed diagnosis of a mitochondrial disease. We are not able to
      provide a &quot;first time&quot; diagnosis or regular metabolic care.

      What is involved?

      Once you contact our team members, you will be asked to provide medical records to determine
      eligibility. Our team will review the records and notify you if you (your child is) eligible
      to join the study.

      -Onsite participation: You (your child) will be invited to visit the National Institutes of
      Health in Bethesda, Maryland. This first visit will typically last 3-5 days. Depending on the
      level of participation, additional visits may be requested. Our team members will work with
      you and your child to coordinate the supports needed during your stay at NIH. Study
      participants may be seen in the clinic, day hospital or inpatient setting.

      When you (your child) arrive at the NIH we will have an informed consent discussion to
      confirm willingness to participate, answer questions and review the risks and benefits of the
      study. You (your child) will meet with a physician who will ask about medical and family
      history and do a physical exam (like in any doctor's office). We will ask all study
      participants to allow us to collect urine, draw blood, swab your (your child s) nose, and
      perform a detailed assessment. We may suggest additional evaluations or specialty consults
      for some participants based on clinical manifestations, age and level of independence. We
      will explain these studies to you (your child). They may include items such as- imaging
      studies, DEXA or MRI scan, energy expenditure or metabolic testing, developmental
      neuropsychological logical testing, physiatry, ophthalmology, or other consults. In some
      cases, we may request a skin biopsy (if one has not been done). You will receive the results
      of your (your child's) clinical testing and notes from any clinical consultations.

      -Remote participation: If you (your child) are unable to travel, you (your child) may be
      enrolled remotely for records review, questionnaires, and telethealth exams. Blood or other
      samples collection may be requested in coordination with local providers or lab testing
      companies

      The biochemical perturbations in children with inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) may affect
      their immune response. As a result, this will not only increase risk for infection but also
      hamper their ability to develop protective immunity after vaccination. Characterizing
      perturbations in immunity and the ability of vaccines to provide protective immunity in IEM
      is critical. Immune deficiencies and the immunogenicity of vaccines have not been well
      characterized in IEM.

      Viral infections play a significant role in precipitating life-threatening acute
      decompensations in various IEM. Seasonal variation of respiratory and gastrointestinal
      viruses places this vulnerable population at significant risk. The standard of care for these
      patients is routine childhood vaccination as well as vaccination for seasonal influenza
      viruses. However, nutritional deficiencies and their underlying IEM enzymopathies may affect
      the efficacy of vaccination.

      In this protocol, we will clinically evaluate the immunologic states of patients with IEM.
      Routine inpatient and outpatient admissions will last 2-3 days and may involve blood drawing,
      radiological procedures, nutrition assessment and biometrics. Immune challenge may be
      performed using vaccinations for seasonal influenza and pneumococcus (PPV23). Follow-up
      appointments will be scheduled at the end of the study period.

      The study objectives will be to describe the immune deficiencies seen, in this patient
      population, describe vaccine seroconversion in this patient population, and search for new
      genes in rare families that have evidence for an unknown class of IEM. The population will
      consist of patients previously evaluated at NIH, physician referrals, and families directed
      to the study from clinicaltrials.gov as well as the patient advocacy groups. All patients
      will be evaluated at the NIH Clinical Center.

        -  INCLUSION and EXCLUSION CRITERIA

        Patients of any gender and ethnicity age 2 years and older are eligible to enroll in this
        protocol. Patients will be diagnosed based on a determination of several parameters that
        may include: plasma ammonia, acylcarnitine profile, amino acid and/or organic acid
        patterns. Some will have their DNA mutation or enzyme analysis known or pending.
        Participants need to be medically and/or nutritionally managed by a local metabolic
        provider. We will obtain written consent from the patient to review medical records from
        their home physician to confirm eligibility.

        Healthy volunteers of any gender and ethnicity 2 years and older will also be eligible to
        enroll in the vaccination arm of the protocol. These individuals will be vaccinated and
        have blood collected in an outpatient setting on visits 1 and 2. Influenza vaccination is
        normally offered seasonally to the public. Volunteers will be compensated for their
        participation in the study. Healthy volunteers may be from the local community, or family
        members of patients with IEM.

        Patient and healthy volunteer exclusion criteria include: less than 2 years of age,
        inability to travel to NIH because of their medical condition, and recent vaccination. The
        Principal Investigator may decline to enroll a patient for other reasons based on clinical
        judgment. Other criteria that may lead to exclusion include, for example, residing in a
        hospital, any patient who is being treated for an intercurrent infection with antibiotics
        or has evidence of an acute infection. Furthermore for IEM patients, any patient who does
        not have a regular/local metabolic, genetic or endocrine physician and/or a family
        physician, pediatrician, or internist will also be excluded. For IEM patients, Dr. McGuire
        will contact each potential patient s local metabolic physician to discuss the patient s
        past medical history, details of their last visit, and their current metabolic status to
        determine whether the patient is an appropriate candidate for this protocol. Closer to a
        scheduled visit, Dr. McGuire will confirm the details of the patient s formula recipe and
        medications.

        Lastly, each family will be contacted by Dr. McGuire or a member of the study staff one
        week prior to a pending inpatient admission to confirm that the patient is metabolically
        stable and ready to visit the NIH in a state of relative health, with an adequate supply of
        special formulas, medications and supplements.
