    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well ruxolitinib phosphate and azacytidine work in treating
      patients with myelofibrosis or myelodysplastic syndrome/myeloproliferative neoplasm.
      Ruxolitinib phosphate may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as azacytidine, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from
      dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving ruxolitinib phosphate and azacytidine
      may be an effective treatment for myelofibrosis or myelodysplastic
      syndrome/myeloproliferative neoplasm.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the efficacy of the combination of RUX (ruxolitinib phosphate) with AZA
      (azacytidine) in patients with myelofibrosis (MF) (primary myelofibrosis, post polycythemia
      vera myelofibrosis, or post essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis [PMF, post- PV MF, or
      post - ET MF]) in achieving objective improvements in disease status.

      II. To determine the efficacy of the combination of RUX + AZA in patients with
      myelodysplastic syndromes/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/MPN) including chronic
      myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (breakpoint cluster region
      [BCR]-c-abl oncogene 1, non-receptor tyrosine kinase [ABL1] negative: aCML), and
      myelodysplastic syndromes/myeloproliferative neoplasms, unclassifiable (MDS/MPN-U), in
      achieving objective improvements in disease status.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety of the RUX + AZA combination in patients with MF and MDS/MPN.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore time to response (TTR) and duration of response (DOR). II. To explore the
      effect of the combination on anemia and transfusion dependence in patients with MF and
      MDS/MPN.

      III. To explore the impact of baseline mutational profile on International Working Group
      (IWG)-Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Research and Treatment (MRT) response and overall survival
      in patients with MF and MDS/MPN.

      IV. To explore the impact of baseline anemia on overall survival in patients with MF and
      MDS/MPN.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I (MF): Patients with MF receive ruxolitinib phosphate orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on
      days 1-28. Beginning course 4, patients also receive azacytidine subcutaneously (SC) or
      intravenously (IV) for 5 days. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 15 courses in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II (MDS/MPN): Patients with MDS/MPN receive ruxolitinib phosphate and azacytidine as in
      Arm I.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days and up to 5 years.
