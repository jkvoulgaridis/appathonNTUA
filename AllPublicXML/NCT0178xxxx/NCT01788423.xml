      The purpose of this study is to compare the outcomes for two different hearing-aid delivery
      models. In one model, the audiologist selects and fits the hearing aid and, in the other
      model, the consumer does this directly.

      The objectives of this study were to determine efficacy of hearing aids in older adults using
      audiology best practices, to evaluate the efficacy of an alternative over-the-counter (OTC)
      intervention, and to examine the influence of purchase price on outcomes for both
      service-delivery models. The design of this study was a single-site, prospective,
      double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trial with three parallel branches: (a) audiology
      best practices (AB), (b) consumer decides OTC model (CD), and (c) placebo devices (P).
      Outcome measures were obtained after a typical 6-week trial period with follow-up 4-week
      AB-based trial for those initially assigned to CD and P groups.

      Older adults from the general community were recruited via newspaper and community flyers to
      participate at a university research clinic. Participants were adults, ages 55-79 years,with
      mild-to-moderate hearing loss. Intervention(s): All participants received the same
      highenddigital mini-behind-the-ear hearing aids fitted bilaterally.AB and P groups received
      best-practice services from audiologists; differing mainly in use of appropriate (AB) or
      placebo (P) hearing aid settings. CD participants self-selected their own pre-programmed
      hearing aids via an OTC model. Primary outcome measure was a 66-item self-report, Profile of
      Hearing Aid Performance/Benefit. Secondary outcome measure was the Connected Speech Test
      benefit.

    <measure>Profile of Hearing Aid Performance Benefit (PHAB)</measure>
    <time_frame>two times: at hearing-aid fit and at 6-weeks post-fit</time_frame>
    <description>Change from unaided to aided performance on the Profile of Hearing Aid Performance with the difference in aided and unaided scores labeled Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit (PHAB), a self-report measure of benefit. The aided and unaided PHAP scores are proportions of time difficulties encountered in various listening situations. Low PHAP scores indicate less frequent difficulties. When subtracting aided from unaided PHAP scores, a positive PHAB score reflects less frequent problems when wearing a hearing aid compared to without. The range of possible PHAB scores are -1.0 to +1.0 with 0.0 indicating no difference between aided and unaided performance.
There are seven subscales of the PHAP/PHAB and the scores reported are based on the arithmetic means of the five subscales that deal with speech communication, PHABglobal. These include the following subscale scores: EC (Ease of Communication), FT (Familiar Talkers), BN (Background Noise), Reverberation (RV) and Reduced Cues (RC).</description>

    <measure>Connected Speech Test (CST) Benefit</measure>
    <time_frame>two times: at hearing-aid fit and at 6-weeks post-fit</time_frame>
    <description>A standardized speech-perception test, based on meaningful sentences and keyword scoring, the Connected Speech Test (CST) was administered unaided and aided. Each CST score represents the percentage of keywords (out of 50) repeated correctly following presentation via loudspeakers. Scores can range from 0 to 100% correct with higher scores indicating better speech perception. For the CST benefit scores reported below, unaided CST scores are subtracted from aided scores such that positive values represent better performance for aided than unaided listening. The possible range of CST benefit scores is -100 to +100 with 0 representing no difference between unaided and aided speech-perception performance.</description>

      <recruitment_details>The trial commenced November 2, 2012, and data collection ended August 31, 2016. Participants were recruited primarily by ads posted in the local newspapers and around the community. All testing of this volunteer sample took place in a university research clinic at Indiana University, Bloomington.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Of the 323 participants enrolled for assessment of eligibility, 135 were excluded because they did not meet inclusion criteria and 25 declined to participate, leaving 163 to be randomly allocated to one of the three intervention groups.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Profile of Hearing Aid Performance Benefit (PHAB)</title>
        <description>Change from unaided to aided performance on the Profile of Hearing Aid Performance with the difference in aided and unaided scores labeled Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit (PHAB), a self-report measure of benefit. The aided and unaided PHAP scores are proportions of time difficulties encountered in various listening situations. Low PHAP scores indicate less frequent difficulties. When subtracting aided from unaided PHAP scores, a positive PHAB score reflects less frequent problems when wearing a hearing aid compared to without. The range of possible PHAB scores are -1.0 to +1.0 with 0.0 indicating no difference between aided and unaided performance.
There are seven subscales of the PHAP/PHAB and the scores reported are based on the arithmetic means of the five subscales that deal with speech communication, PHABglobal. These include the following subscale scores: EC (Ease of Communication), FT (Familiar Talkers), BN (Background Noise), Reverberation (RV) and Reduced Cues (RC).</description>

        <title>Connected Speech Test (CST) Benefit</title>
        <description>A standardized speech-perception test, based on meaningful sentences and keyword scoring, the Connected Speech Test (CST) was administered unaided and aided. Each CST score represents the percentage of keywords (out of 50) repeated correctly following presentation via loudspeakers. Scores can range from 0 to 100% correct with higher scores indicating better speech perception. For the CST benefit scores reported below, unaided CST scores are subtracted from aided scores such that positive values represent better performance for aided than unaided listening. The possible range of CST benefit scores is -100 to +100 with 0 representing no difference between unaided and aided speech-perception performance.</description>
