  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over 85,000 Canadians live with a spinal cord injury (SCI). The vast majority experience
      chronic pain from neuropathic or musculoskeletal origins, with many reporting the pain to be
      more physically, psychologically and socially debilitating than the injury itself. Currently,
      pharmaceuticals are the front line treatment recommendation for SCI pain, despite having many
      side-effects and giving minimal relief. Alternatively, studies conducted in controlled lab
      and clinical settings suggest that exercise may be a safe, effective behavioural strategy for
      reducing SCI-related chronic pain. Two ways in which exercise may alleviate pain are by
      reducing inflammation and increasing descending inhibitory control. To date, no study has
      tested the effects of exercise, performed in a home-/community-setting, on chronic pain in
      adults with SCI. Furthermore, information on the exercise dose required to alleviate chronic
      SCI pain is virtually non-existent, making it impossible for clinicians and fitness trainers
      to make evidence- informed recommendations regarding the types and amounts of exercise to
      perform in order to manage SCI pain. Recently (2018), an international team published two
      scientific SCI exercise guidelines: one to improve fitness and one to improve cardiometabolic
      health. These scientific guidelines have been translated into Canadian community SCI exercise
      guidelines and provide the exercise prescription for the proposed study.

      The investigators' overarching research question is: can home-/community-based
      exercise—prescribed according to these new SCI exercise guidelines and supported through a
      theory-based behavioural intervention— significantly reduce chronic pain in adults with SCI?

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PROPOSED TRIAL. Using an integrated knowledge translation framework (iKT), the primary aim of
      this pragmatic Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) is to examine the effects of 6 months of
      home-/community-based exercise, prescribed according to the SCI exercise guidelines, on
      chronic bodily pain experienced by adults with SCI. Secondary aims are to test for 1)
      differential effects on musculoskeletal and neuropathic pain; 2) changes in inflammation and
      inhibitory control as pathways by which exercise reduces pain; 3) effects of chronic pain
      reductions on subjective well-being; and 4) economic benefits of the intervention.

      TRIAL MANAGEMENT. The experienced team of researchers has SCI-specific expertise in exercise
      psychology and physiology, pain and physiatry as well as health sciences expertise in
      immunology, biostatistics, health economics, and pragmatic RCT design and management. The
      team includes knowledge users representing local, provincial and national organizations, and
      a collaborator with lived experience of SCI.

      SIGNIFICANCE. The investigators' novel idea is that home-/community-based exercise performed
      according to the SCI exercise guidelines can be an effective behavioural strategy for
      reducing chronic pain in adults with SCI. Critically, this will be the first SCI exercise RCT
      to use chronic bodily pain as the primary outcome and to assess potential pathways by which
      exercise may alleviate pain. Furthermore, this will be the first pragmatic RCT of exercise as
      a behavioural pain management strategy conducted among adults with SCI. Importantly, our
      community-engaged, iKT approach will ensure rapid translation and dissemination of findings
      to Canadian and international end-users including clinicians, fitness programmers, people
      living with SCI and the community organizations that support them.

    <intervention_model_description>The trial design is a two-arm, single-blinded ( i.e. assessors and analysts blinded to allocation), RCT with a 6-month intervention period and 6-month follow-up (Exercise condition only). After baseline assessments, participants will be randomly allocated to 6 mos of exercise (&quot;Exercise&quot;) or a wait-list (&quot;Control&quot;) using a 1:1 ratio. The trial is designed to be comparable to usual care and maximize PRECIS scores, while providing insight on mechanisms that may explain intervention effects.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>This test measures the extent to which the application of a painful conditioning stimulus changes the perceived painfulness of a test stimulus. The test stimulus will be delivered by using a pressure algometer (contact area 1 cm2; Algomed Computerized Algometry; Medoc AMS), whereby the threshold for pressure induced pain will be measured on an upper extremity site that has sensory innervation, in 3 series of slowly increasing stimulus intensities (0.5 kg/s, corresponding to ca. 50 kPa/s). Participants will report the instant when pain is initially perceived, over and above the application of pressure. Pain threshold will be determined as the arithmetic mean of the 3 series (in kPA). Inhibitory control is calculated as the change in pain ratings for the test stimulus, from before to after application of the conditioning stimulus (bigger decreases in pain ratings indicate better inhibitory control/pain modulation).</description>

    <description>The intervention is a personalized exercise prescription based on the International Scientific Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) Exercise Guidelines. Participants begin at the Starting Level guideline: 20 min aerobic exercise, 2x/wk, at 70% of heart rate reserve (or a Borg Continuous Ratio 0-10 rating of 6), &amp; 3 sets of 10 repetitions of strengthening exercises (each major functioning muscle group at 50-80% of 1-rep max), 2x/wk. Participants will gradually increase aerobic exercise to 30 min, 3x/wk (i.e. the Advanced Level guideline). Exercise implementation will be supported by a fitness trainer and an exercise counsellor with SCI-specific training and experience.</description>
