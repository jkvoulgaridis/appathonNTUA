  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research is to explore abilities to learn word meanings from overheard
      conversations in children with ASD (and, as a control, typically developing children).

      Specific Aim 1 (Experiment 1): Subaim 1a: Identify child characteristics associated with
      learning from overhearing. In a prior study, the investigators found that 13 children with
      ASD were able to learn the meanings of novel words that they heard used in a conversation
      involving two adults. In the current study, the investigators aim to study a larger sample to
      identify what child characteristics are associated with good learning in an overhearing
      situation as compared to a situation in which the child is directly taught the new word.
      Subaim 1b: Assess retention and generalization of words learned from overhearing. The
      investigators will re-test children on their knowledge of the word meanings after a 10-minute
      delay to see if they both retain the word meanings and can generalize the new words to new
      situations.

      Specific Aim 2 (Experiment 2): Determine whether children with ASD can learn from addressed
      and overheard teaching via videoconferencing. The investigators will use a similar procedure
      to Study 1, except that both overheard and directed teaching will take place on video.

      Specific Aim 3 (Experiment 3): Determine whether children with ASD can learn verbs and
      pronouns by overhearing. Most prior work on learning from overheard speech has focused on
      learning nouns that label objects. This experiment extends this work to study other kinds of
      words.
