  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The preparation of ICU Diary, conducted by the Hospital care team towards the patient, has
      been suggested as an effective and low-cost strategy to enhance the patient's experience in
      the intensive care unit, as well as to prevent anxiety, depression and Posttraumatic Stress
      Disorder (PTSD). New-found researches in Brazilian ICUs indicates the pervasiveness of these
      symptoms in patients who have been hospitalized in the unit, however, there are no randomized
      trials that evaluate the impact of Diaries in the Brazilian context. The aim is to explore
      the effects of providing an ICU Diary in the symptoms of anxiety, depression and PTSD within
      patients who were hospitalized in the unit. Refers to a randomized controlled trial that is
      being conducted in two ICUs in a general-purpose hospital in Porto Alegre, Brazil.

      The Diaries will be filled voluntarily by the professionals who provide the patient care -
      psychologists, nutritionists, nursing technicians, nurses, physicians and physiotherapists.
      In addition, the patient's family members who wish to participate and collaborate with the
      Diaries may ask anyone on the team to assist them. The Diaries will be available at the
      bedside and may be filled with objective and subjective data on the patient's clinical
      condition and daily evolution, as well as remarkable events. Examples of entries
      possibilities are messages, pictures, drawings, photographs, thoughts, sayings, and wishes.
      Photographic records aim to provide the patient memories of the environment and of his
      advances in treatment. They will be attached to the Diary only if the patient wishes.

      The predicted sample is composed of 102 intensive care patients, aged above 18 years old,
      that require mechanical ventilation and remained in the ICU more than 72 hours.

      All patients who meet the inclusion criteria will have their Diary drawn up by the team and
      will be randomized one week after discharge from the ICU. All patients will have their memory
      assessed at 1 week deadline after critical care discharge, and at this moment, the
      intervention patients will receive their ICU Diary along with psychological support. One
      month after the ICU discharge, all the patients will be evaluated by phone and checked in
      symptoms of depression, anxiety and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PSTD).

      The final assessment of the development of the symptoms will be at the deadline of 3
      months.The patients in the control group will be invited to withdraw their Diary after the
      end of the survey. In case of readmission in the ICU, in a period less than 72h of discharge,
      the Diary used will be reactivated. In cases of death, the researchers will offer the
      responsible parent the opportunity to receive the Diary. During this period, the Diaries will
      be stored by the researchers confidentially, in a previously defined location.

    <description>number of patients with PTSD assessed by Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL-5) - PCL-5
A 20-item selfreport measure designed to assess the DSM-5 symptoms of PTSD. Responders are asked to rate how bothered they have been by each item in the past month on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0-4. A provisional PTSD diagnosis can be made by treating each item rated as 2 = &quot;Moderately&quot; or higher as a symptom endorsed, then following the DSM-5 diagnostic rule which requires at least: 1 Criterion B item (questions 1-5), 1 Criterion C item (questions 6-7), 2 Criterion D items (questions 8-14), 2 Criterion E items (questions 15-20). According the authors, a PCL-5 cut-point of 33 it's a reasonable value to use for provisional PTSD diagnosis.</description>
