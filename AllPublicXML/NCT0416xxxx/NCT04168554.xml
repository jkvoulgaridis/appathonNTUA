      Pediatrician does physical examination through telemedicine and in real life to see whether
      the telemedicine consultation corresponds with the real life examination.

      Goal is to determine:

        1. Check practical feasability

        2. Check whether there are no great objections for a larger study (ie. in case telemedicine
           consultation is much more unreliable to do a physical examination a larger study is
           deemed unsafe)

      40 pediatric patients seen by a general practitioner (GP) whom the GP has referred or wants
      to refer to a pediatrician for clinical evaluation are included in this study.

      Study is designed in 2 parts. Part 1 is at the emergency room in the hospital Part 2 is at
      the GPs office

      The pediatrician sees the patient through a telemedicine consultation. Then sees the patient
      in real life to see if what was seen during telemedicine corresponds with the real life
      consultation.

      With telemedicine and real life consultation the pediatrician rates the patient as either a
      candidate to go home or to be admitted. With the telemedicine consultation there is also an
      option &quot;in doubt: i want to see the patient in real life&quot;.

      Also with both telemedicine and real life examination the pediatrician scores the patient
      using the respiratory observation scale (Siew et al, 2016)

      Goal is to:

        1. Check practical feasability

        2. Check whether there are no great objections for a larger study (ie. in case telemedicine
           consultation is much harder to do a physical examination
