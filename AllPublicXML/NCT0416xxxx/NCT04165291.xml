  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized trial will test a newly developed intervention aimed at fathers who have a
      history of family violence compared to a standard batterer intervention program.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will expand on Fathers for Change (F4C), a novel intervention for fathers with
      histories of perpetrating intimate partner violence (IPV). F4C is designed to meet a
      significant unmet intervention need for fathers who have a history of family violence who are
      not helped by currently available batterer intervention programs (BIPs). BIPs that are
      currently available nationally have shown limited efficacy with high rates of repeat
      violence.

      This project will provide needed data to further develop F4C and move to a Stage II efficacy
      trial by: 1) revising the BIP group intervention manual to be delivered in an individual
      treatment format; 2) develop a fidelity measure for F4C and the BIP; 4) conduct a stage 1b
      randomized trial (consistent with the stage model of intervention development) to show
      initial feasibility, acceptability and intervention signal with the targeted population.

      Sixty fathers with a history of IPV who have already failed a treatment as usual group BIP
      will be randomly assigned to F4C or an individually delivered comparable dose of BIP.
      Reflective functioning and emotion regulation will be examined as the mechanisms through
      which Fathers for Change reduces IPV and child maltreatment risk behaviors.

    <measure>Reflective Functioning</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Reflective functioning will be assessed using the Parent Development Interview-Revised (PDI). The PDI is a 40-item semi-structured interview that assesses reflective functioning through questions about child-rearing and the ways respondents are like or unlike their own parents. Interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim for scoring.</description>

    <measure>Emotional Regulation</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Emotional regulation will be assessed with the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS). The DERS is a 36-item self-report measure scored on a 5-point Likert-type scale where higher scores indicate greater difficulty in emotional regulation.</description>

    <description>Fathers for Change (F4C) focuses on: 1) the fathering role to facilitate engagement, 2) RF to understand self, partner and children and emotion regulation skills to reduce IPV and child maltreatment. F4C focuses on understanding of emotional experiences, how they impact thinking and behaviors related to partners, co-parents and children. F4C clients will meet individually with their F4C therapist for 50 minutes per week over 16 weeks.</description>

    <description>The Batterer Intervention Program (BIP) is a psychoeducational intervention that will be delivered in 50- minute individual weekly sessions over 16 weeks. The intervention focuses on the impact of violence on victims, power and control tactics, and societal influences supporting men's violence toward women. The intervention includes didactics and experiential exercises including role plays to teach anger management skills.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A reported an incident of IPV (pushing, slapping, kicking) within the last 12 months
             prior to screening (based on court/police records, partner or self- report);

          -  have at least one biological child aged 6 months to 7 years with whom they have
             contact in person or by phone/facetime etc. at least monthly;

          -  are able to complete assessments in English;

          -  agree to have their female coparents (mother of the youngest child) contacted as
             collateral informants and for consent for participation of their shared child.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Men who have an active full/no contact protective order pertaining to their child
             since this will preclude participation in the father-child play assessment (many men
             will have full no-contact orders with their partners, but it is more common for men to
             still be allowed at least supervised contact with their children even with a full/no
             contact order with their partner);

          -  physiological addiction to a substance that requires detoxification. Fathers will be
             evaluated using the Addiction Severity Index and urine toxicology screens. If fathers
             report difficulties with physiological withdrawal from substances (e.g. delirium
             tremens, shaking, nausea) they will be referred for detox services. They can be
             re-evaluated following a detox program with documentation from the detox center of
             successful completion and clean urine screen.;

          -  anyone with a cognitive impairment that will not allow for understanding of the study
             interventions (a mini mental state score &lt;25);

          -  anyone with a current untreated psychotic disorder;

          -  anyone currently suicidal or homicidal based on screening using the BSI.
