    <textblock>
      Evaluate the long-term safety of maralixibat (MRX) in subjects with cholestatic liver disease
      including, but not limited to, Alagille Syndrome (ALGS) and Progressive Familial Intrahepatic
      Cholestasis (PFIC)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label study of maralixibat in subjects diagnosed with cholestatic
      liver disease (including, but not limited to ALGS or PFIC) who have previously participated
      in a maralixibat clinical study. All subjects will receive maralixibat in this study.

        Inclusion Criteria Subjects will need to meet all criteria below to be considered eligible
        for the study.

          1. Provide informed consent and assent (as applicable) per the Institutional Review
             Board/Ethics Committee (IRB/EC).

          2. Previously participated in a maralixibat study and with approval of the Medical
             Monitor. Previous participation is defined as:

               -  Having completed the EOT Visit, for subjects coming from the maralixibat Phase 2
                  studies.

               -  Having completed the entire duration of the study (i.e., core and extension, if
                  applicable), for subjects coming from the maralixibat Phase 3 studies.

          3. Males, and females of non-childbearing potential. Males and non-pregnant,
             non-lactating females of childbearing potential who are sexually active must agree to
             use acceptable contraception during the study and 30 days following the last dose of
             the study medication. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy
             test.

          4. Caregivers (and/or age appropriate subjects) must have access to email or phone for
             scheduled remote visits if applicable.

          5. Subject and caregiver willingness to comply with all study visits and requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria

        A subject will be excluded from the study if any of the following exclusion criteria are
        met:

          1. Experienced an AE or SAE related to maralixibat during the lead-in protocol that led
             to permanent discontinuation of the subject from maralixibat.

          2. Any conditions or abnormalities (including laboratory abnormalities) which, in the
             opinion of the Investigator or Medical Monitor may compromise the safety of the
             subject or interfere with the subject participating in or completing the study.

          3. History of non-adherence to medical regimens, unreliability, medical condition, mental
             instability or cognitive impairment that, in the opinion of the Investigator or
             Sponsor medical monitor, could compromise the validity of informed consent, compromise
             the safety of the subject, or lead to non-adherence with the study protocol or
             inability to conduct the study procedures.
