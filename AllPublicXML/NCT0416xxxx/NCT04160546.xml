  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the present study is to determine the rate of successful treatment-free
      remission (TFR) within the first 52 weeks following cessation of ponatinib treatment in
      patients who achieved MR4. Eligible patients had been previously treated with TKI and when
      patients achieved an optimal molecular response, TKI treatment was discontinued. After loss
      of response, patients were treated again with a TKI treatment and have documented MR4 for one
      year at the time of switch to ponatinib to study entry. MR4 is defined as BCR-ABL transcript
      level ≤ 0.01% IS or undetectable BCR-ABL levels with sample sensitivity of at least 4 log.
