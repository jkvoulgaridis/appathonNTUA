  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to compare the progression-free survival (PFS) in two
      groups of combined therapy of GB221/ capecitabine tablets versus combined therapy of
      placebo/capecitabine tablets; the secondary objective is to evaluate the objective response
      rate (ORR),time to progression (TTP) from treatment period to week 12; overall survival (OS),
      safety, immunogenicity (anti-drug antibody), PFS of subjects during continued treatment
      period.
