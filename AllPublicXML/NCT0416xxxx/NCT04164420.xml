  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to explore if oral neuromuscular training is superior to orofacial
      sensory-vibration stimulation in patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia.

      Four weeks after stroke onset, patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia and pathological
      swallowing according to the timed water swallow test (TWST) will be randomized 1:1 into a
      5-week oral neuromuscular training with an oral device in addition to orofacial
      sensory-vibration stimulation with an electrical toothbrush (intervention group) or orofacial
      sensory-vibration stimulation only (control group). The participants will be examined with a
      TWST, lip force test, and videofluoroscopy (VFS) of oropharyngeal swallowing before
      (baseline), after 5-weeks training (end-of-training) and at a 12-18 months follow-up. The
      primary endpoint is changes in TWST at the end-of-training compared with baseline, and at
      late follow-up based on intention-to-treat analyses. The secondary endpoints are the
      corresponding changes in lip force and aspiration frequency at VFS.

      This study aims to explore if oral neuromuscular training is superior to orofacial
      sensory-vibration stimulation in patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia.

      Study design: This 2-center study is an intension-to-treat prospective randomized open-label
      trial with blinded evaluators (PROBE) design. Evaluations are made at baseline, at end of
      training, and at late follow-up after a period without training to investigate if any lasting
      positive training effect was present.

      Inclusion criteria: First-ever stroke and a pathological timed water swallow test (TWST) at
      four to five weeks after stroke onset.

      Exclusion criteria: Inability to cooperate, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG),
      neurological diseases other than stroke, known history of dysphagia, prominent horizontal
      overbite, hypersensitivity to the acrylate in the oral device.

      Study procedure: Four weeks after stroke onset, patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia and
      pathological swallowing according to the timed water swallow test (TWST) will be randomized
      1:1 into a 5-week oral neuromuscular training with an oral device in addition to orofacial
      sensory-vibration stimulation with an electrical toothbrush (intervention group) or orofacial
      sensory-vibration stimulation only (control group). The participants will be examined with a
      TWST, lip force test, and videofluoroscopy (VFS) of oropharyngeal swallowing before
      (baseline), after 5-weeks training (end-of-training) and at a 12-18 months follow-up. The
      primary endpoint is changes in TWST at the end-of-training compared with baseline, and at
      late follow-up based on intention-to-treat analyses. The secondary endpoints are the
      corresponding changes in lip force and aspiration frequency at VFS.

      Sample size: In order to detect a critical change with a power of 80 %, a sample size of 44
      patients (22 in the intervention group and 22 in the control group) that fulfilled the study
      protocol was required for a type I error of 5 %.

    <description>Intensive training with oral neuromuscular training and orofacial sensory-vibration stimulation for 5 weeks. The oral neuromuscular training is performed three times per session, and three times daily before eating. Regarding the orofacial sensory-vibration stimulation, the instructions is given on how to stimulate the buccinator mechanism, lips, external floor, and the tongue three times daily before a meal by using a toothbrush.</description>

    <description>Oral neuromuscular training is performed by using an oral device. The device is placed pre-dentally behind closed lips, and the participant is sitting in an up-right position. The participant is the instructed to hold the device against a gradually-increasing horizontal pulling force for 5-10 s, whilst trying to resist the force by tightening the lips and pressing the head backward against a head rest.</description>
