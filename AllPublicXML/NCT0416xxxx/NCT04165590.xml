  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is: 1) to evaluate the effectiveness and extended safety of the
      Plasmodium immunotherapy for the advanced malignant solid tumors. 2) To explore the safe and
      effective course of the Plasmodium immunotherapy for the advanced malignant solid tumors. 3)
      To explore the possible indications of Plasmodium immunotherapy for advanced malignant solid
      tumors.

      The treatment will last 5-10 weeks from the day of successful infection and will be
      terminated by antimalarial drugs.

      This study is planed to enroll 60 patients. Each patient will be vaccinated with 2 ml of P.
      vivax-infected red blood cells, containing approximately 0.1-1.0 × 10^7 Plasmodium parasites.
      The treatment will last for 5-10 weeks from the day of successful infection. During the
      period of Plasmodium immunotherapy, doctor will use artesunate to control the P. vivax
      erythrocyte infection rate at a low level, so as to prevent the severe adverse event. After
      5-10 weeks, parasitemia will be terminated by antimalarial drugs for ending the treatment of
      Plasmodium immunotherapy (the immunological treatment effect may persist after the
      termination of Plasmodium infection). After the treatment, patients will be followed up for 2
      years.
