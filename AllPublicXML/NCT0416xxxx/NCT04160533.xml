      The study will be conducted using the arterial hypertension registry method, which is a
      computer program with remote access that allows online collection medical data from medical
      primary care system. To minimize operator errors, doctors was trained before the work with
      the arterial hypertension registry. User's guide was developed and the rights of users was
      determined. Data of examination and treatment of patients from 18 years and older with an
      established diagnosis of hypertension will be added from outpatient cards into the registry
      of the arterial hypertension. The information is received by the Institution in an impersonal
