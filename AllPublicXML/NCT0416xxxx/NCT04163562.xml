    <textblock>
      Multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase I/II study to determine the
      safety, tolerability, potential efficacy and dose finding of INP20, an oral immunotherapy in
      peanut-allergic patients. The overall study design consists of two sequential periods of Part
      A and Part B.

      Part A is a dose escalation study in patients from 12 to 65 years old with a history of
      immediate hypersensitive reaction to peanut protein. Six diferent oral-dose of INP20 will be
      administered to 6 cohorts of patients once daily for 2 weeks.

      Part B is a 6-month double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized and parallel groups study.
      Patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio into three (3) different treatment groups,
      including placebo and the two doses of peanut protein selected from Part A. They will recieve
      INP20 once daily for 6 months.
