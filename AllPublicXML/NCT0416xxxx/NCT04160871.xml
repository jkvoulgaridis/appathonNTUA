      The aim of this study is to validate an intervention for relatives of people with borderline
      personality disorder in Spanish population in a randomized control trial.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Family members of patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) often experience high
      levels of suffering, anxiety, stress, burden and helplessness. The treatment program with the
      most empirical support is &quot;Family Connections&quot;. It is one of the first programs specifically
      designed to help relatives of patients with BPD. The program is an adaptation of multiple
      strategies of Dialectical Behavioral Therapy. It consists of 12 sessions with an approximate
      duration of two hours each. The results of these studies and their subsequent replications
      showed an improvement in family attitudes and perceived burden. The investigators have
      translated and adapted the program so that it could be applied to the Spanish population. The
      aim of the present study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the adaptation of &quot;Family
      connections&quot; in Spanish population through a controlled clinical trial. The first hypothesis
      of the study is that &quot;Family Connections&quot; will be more effective (significant reduction in
      the primary outcome variables), compared with a Treatment As Usual (TAU), in the posttest
      time and in the follow-ups of 3 and 6 months. In addition, a second hypothesis is that
      &quot;Family Connections&quot; will be more efficient (fewer abandonments, better opinion on the part
      of the patients) than TAU.

    <time_frame>Changes will be assessed from pre-treatment to immediately after the intervention, and also at 6-month-follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>Family Assessment Device - Global Functioning Scale (FAD-GFS) is a self-report questionnaire (Epstein, Baldwin &amp; Bishop, 1983). It consists of 60 items about family functioning. It is composed of seven subscales: Problem-Solving, Communication, Roles, Affective Responsiveness, Affective Involvement, Behavior Control and General Functioning. Items are rated on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (totally agree) to 4 (totally disagree), and higher scores indicate unhealthy functioning. Cronbach's alphas ranges from .72 to .83 for the subscales and general functioning is .92 (Miller, Epstein, Bishop &amp; Keitner, 1985) and test-retest for the FAD scales were adequate (Miller, Epstein, Bishop &amp; Keitner, 1985).</description>

    <description>Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS) have 42 items about negative emotional symptoms (Lovibond &amp; Lovibond, 1995). Lovibond &amp; Lovinbod (1995) proposed that a part of these subscales for can become part of a short version creating a new questionnaire of 21 items. Items are rated on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (It did not happen to me) to 3 (It happened to me a lot or most of the time), and higher scores indicate worse symptoms of depression, anxiety or stress. DASS-21 showed fantastic factor structures. Regarding to the internal consistency, Cronbach's alphas were excellent for the DASS-21 subscales: Depression (α = .94), Anxiety (α = .87) and Stress (α = .91) (Antony, Bieling, Cox, Enns &amp; Swinson, 1998).</description>

    <time_frame>Changes will be assessed from pre-treatment to immediately after the intervention, and also at 6-month-follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>We used the spanish version of the instrument Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS), developed by Gratz y Roemer (2004), with the aim to assess the emotional regulation problem. The scale was adapted to spanish and it was reduced from 36 items to 28 items (Hervás &amp; Jódar, 2008). In this version, they figured on 5 scales instead 6 considering that &quot;difficulties in the impulse control&quot; and &quot;limited access to regulation strategies&quot; were joined into one named &quot;emotional lack of control&quot;. The subscales are life interference, emotional confusion, emotional rejection, emotional lack of control and lack of emotional attention. Items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (rarely) to 5 (almost always), and higher scores indicate greater impairment or dysregulation. The psychometric properties show high consistency were Cronbach's alphas of the subscales range from .73 to .91 and .93 for the total scale (Hervás &amp; Jódar, 2008).</description>

    <description>Family Empowerment Scale (FES) consists of 34 items divided in three subscales: family, service system, and involvement in community that is refered to three ways of empowerment, attitudes, knowledge, and behaviors (Koren, DeChillo &amp; Friesen, 1992). Items are rated on a scale of 1 (completely false) to 5 (totally true), and higher scores indicate a greater sense of empowerment. The psychometric properties are the following: regarding to the internal consistency of FES subscores, the coefficients ranged from .87 to .88 and validity and reliability are adequated (Koren, DeChillo &amp; Friesen, 1992).</description>
