  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although inpatient treatment provides immediate stabilization and crisis management for
      suicidal patients, the risk of suicide post-discharge is substantial, with approximately one
      third of all suicides by individuals with mental disorders occurring in the 90 days following
      hospitalization. These data highlight the importance of establishing an empirically-supported
      inpatient treatment for suicide prevention. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a strong
      candidate, given that CBT reduces risk in suicidal outpatients. In addition, an open trial
      was completed that 1) adapted the strongest outpatient CBT protocol for an inpatient setting,
      2) demonstrated high levels of feasibility and acceptability, and 3) obtained preliminary
      estimates of efficacy. The objective here is to conduct a largescale randomized controlled
      trial (RCT) comparing CBT (n = 100) to treatment as usual (TAU, n = 100) to firmly establish
      efficacy and collect pilot data on treatment implementation metrics. This study aims to
      determine the efficacy of inpatient CBT on suicidal behavior, suicidal ideation/intent, and
      readmission post-treatment and over a 6-month follow-up period. The central hypothesis, based
      on strong outpatient data, is that inpatient CBT will reduce suicidal behavior, suicidal
      ideation/intent, and inpatient readmission over 6 months post-discharge, compared to TAU.
      Participants will be recruited after inpatient admission following a suicide attempt. An
      Independent Evaluator (IE) will conduct a clinical assessment that includes
      diagnostic/symptom assessments, assessment of suicide risk, and an Implicit Association Test
      (IAT), and participants complete self-report measures on substance use, clinical traits, and
      symptoms. Participants will receive four CBT sessions and will be assessed by the IE again
      within 24 hours prior to discharge. Participants will receive a questionnaire and IAT on a
      monthly basis for 6 months postdischarge. The proposed study will inform best practices
      treatment for hospitalized suicidal patients by establishing for the first time, and
      ultimately disseminating, an empirically-validated inpatient treatment for suicide
      prevention.

    <intervention_model_description>Participants will be randomly assigned (using a computer-generated randomization schedule) to either CBT or TAU using stratified block randomization on Substance Use Disorder (SUD).

    <time_frame>Assessed at baseline, at completion of inpatient treatment (average of 16 days), and on a monthly basis for 6 months follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>Suicidal behavior will be assessed using the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS), a widely used suicide assessment measure. Several suicidal behaviors are assessed on the C-SSRS including the presence or absence of each of the following: suicide attempt, interrupted attempt, aborted attempt, and preparatory acts or behaviors. Scores on this scale will be the number of each behavior.</description>

    <time_frame>Assessed at baseline, at completion of inpatient treatment (average of 16 days), and on a monthly basis for 6 months follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>Suicidal ideation and intent will also be assessed using the same Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). Two subscales as described by Posner and colleagues will be extracted: severity and intensity. The severity subscale is a single score rated from 1-5, with 5 being the most severe type of ideation/intent that the participant has endorsed. The intensity subscale contains 5 questions to be rated from 1-5, with 5 representing more severe intensity.</description>
