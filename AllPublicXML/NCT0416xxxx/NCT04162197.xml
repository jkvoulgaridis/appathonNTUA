  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over the last years, the introduction of robotic technologies in gait rehabilitation of
      stroke patients has aroused great interest. Some studies have been conducted to evaluate the
      effects of robot-assisted training compared to conventional gait rehabilitation in patients
      with subacute stroke but no studies seem to investigate the effects of a combined robotic
      treatment (gait plus balance).

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a combined gait and balance robotic
      rehabilitation compared robotic gait training alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is not only the third cause of death after cardiovascular disease and cancer, but also
      the first cause of disability in the world with a significant impact on individuals, their
      families and finances. Post-stroke disability involves mobility and balance, muscle strength,
      control of movement, and gait pattern functions. Although the majority of stroke patients
      learns to walk independently by 6 months after stroke, gait and balance problems persist
      through the chronic stage and may have a significant impact on patients' quality of life.
      Accordingly, the restoration and improvement of walking functions is a primary concern to
      obtain independence in daily life. For this reason, gait recovery is a realist goal in the
      rehabilitation of almost all patients with stroke. The recovery of a more fluid, safe and
      correct execution of motor tasks such as gait and stair climbing are a prerequisite for the
      patients to become autonomous in the activities of daily living.

      Over the last years, the introduction of robotic technologies in gait rehabilitation of
      stroke patients has aroused great interest. Some studies have been conducted to evaluate the
      effects of robot-assisted training compared to conventional gait rehabilitation in patients
      with subacute stroke. The main results were obtained using robotic exoskeletons or a
      treadmill training with partial body weight support and only a few studies used an
      end-effector device. Preliminary studies have shown that end-effector Robot-Assisted Gait
      Training (RAGT) has produced promising effects on motor and functional outcomes in chronic
      and subacute strokes patients comparing with conventional treatment. Moreover, safe gait
      needs a continuous dynamic balance than it is possible that in gait robotic rehabilitation
      could be included a rehabilitation treatment of static and dynamic balance with a robotic
      proprioceptive platform. The hypothesis of the study is that a combined robotic treatment
      (gait plus balance) could produce more effects than just one robotic gait training.

      Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of gait and balance robotic
      rehabilitation in subacute stroke patients in terms of clinical outcomes, balance measures
      and gait kinematics, comparing them with robotic gait training alone.

      The patients following first ever stroke in sub-acute phase will be recruited and assessed
      both clinically and instrumentally (Gait Analysis and Balance evaluation) at baseline (T0),
      after 12 sessions (T1) and at the end of the training program (24 sessions: T2). The patients
      will be randomized into 2 groups and will conduct two different types of rehabilitation
      training: one group will perform, gait training using an end-effector robotic device for RAGT
      (Gait Group, GG); and the other group will receive a combined robotic treatment program with
      the same end-effector robotic system and a robotic proprioceptive platform (Balance Group,
      GHG). The rehabilitation program of both groups will be combined with conventional
      physiotherapy.

    <measure>Change in Berg Balance Scale (BBS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (T0), Session 12 (4 weeks) (T1), Session 24 (8 weeks ) (T2)</time_frame>
    <description>The Berg Balance Scale is a widely used clinical test of a person's static and dynamic balance abilities. The test takes 15-20 minutes and comprises a set of 14 simple balance related tasks, ranging from standing up from a sitting position, to standing on one foot. The degree of success in achieving each task is given a score of zero (unable) to four (independent), and the final measure is the sum of all of the scores.</description>

    <description>This test will assess the patient's speed during gait. Patients will be asked to walk at their preferred maximum and safe speed. Patients will be positioned 1 meter before the start line and instructed to walk 10 meters, and pass the end line approximately 1 meter after. The distance before and after the course are meant to minimize the effect of acceleration and deceleration. Time will be measured using a stopwatch and recorded to the one hundredth of a second (ex: 2.15 s). The test will be recorded 3 times, with adequate rests between them. The average of the 3 times should be recorded.</description>

    <description>The TCT assesses the motor impairment in stroke patients and it's correlated with eventual walking ability. Testing is done with the patient lying on a bed: (1) roll to weak side. (2) roll to strong side. (3) balance in sitting position on the edge of the bed with the feet off the ground for at least 30. (4) sit up from lying down. Total score: 0-100.</description>

    <measure>Change in Neuropathic Pain Screen (ID PAIN)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (T0), Session 12 (4 weeks) (T1), Session 24 (8 weeks ) (T2)</time_frame>
    <description>The Neuropathic Pain Screen is used to evaluate presence of neuropathic pain. Ask the older adult the questions below and score as noted. It is a numeric scale to rate the pain from -1 to 5; higher scores are more indicative of pain with a neuropathic component. A score of 3 or higher indicates likely presence of neuropathic pain and justifies a more detailed evaluation. If the older adult has more than one painful area, they are to consider the one area that is most relevant to them. Conditions that might have a neuropathic pain component include diabetic or peripheral neuropathy, back pain, post-herpetic neuralgia, complex regional pain syndrome, leg/foot pain, large joint pain, and fibromyalgia.</description>

    <measure>Change in Barthel Scale/Index (BI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (T0), Session 12 (4 weeks) (T1), Session 24 (8 weeks ) (T2)</time_frame>
    <description>The Barthel Scale/Index (BI) is an ordinal scale used to measure performance in activities of daily living (ADL). Ten variables describing ADL and mobility are scored, a higher number being a reflection of greater ability to function independently following hospital discharge. Time taken and physical assistance required to perform each item are used in determining the assigned value of each item. The Barthel Index measures the degree of assistance required by an individual on 10 items of mobility and self care ADL.</description>

    <measure>Change in Six-Minute Walking Test (6MWT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (T0), Session 12 (4 weeks) (T1), Session 24 (8 weeks ) (T2)</time_frame>
    <description>The 6MWT measures the distance a subject covers during an indoor gait on a flat, hard surface in 6 minutes, using assistive devices, as necessary. The test is a reliable and valid evaluation of functional exercise capacity and is used as a sub-maximal test of aerobic capacity and endurance. The minimal detectable change in distance for people with sub-acute stroke is 60.98 meters. The 6MWT is a patient self-paced walk test and assesses the level of functional capacity. Patients are allowed to stop and rest during the test. However, the timer does not stop. If the patient is unable to complete the test, the time is stopped at that moment. The missing time and the reason of the stop are recorded. This test will be administered while wearing a pulse oximeter to monitor heart rate and oxygen saturation, also integrated with Borg scale to assess dyspnea.</description>

             injuries, pain, severe osteoporosis, or severe spasticity)

          -  cognitive and/or communicative disability (e.g. due to brain injury): inability to
             understand the instructions required for the study

          -  cardiac pathologies, anxiety or psychosis that might interfere with the use of the
             equipment or testing
