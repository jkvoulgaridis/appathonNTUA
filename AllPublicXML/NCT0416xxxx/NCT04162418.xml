    <measure>Secondary Efficacy: Rutherford class</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The second secondary efficacy measurement is change in Rutherford class score at 3, 6 and 12 months. Rutherford score is a classification system for patients with peripheral vascular disease.
Categories are numbered from 0 to 6, with 0 being asymptomatic, and 6 being major tissue loss, functional foot no longer salvageable. Higher values are therefore considered a worse outcome.
Rutherford class zero: No symptoms; Rutherford class 1: Mild Claudication (minimal leg pain with ambulation) symptoms; Rutherford Class 2: Moderate Claudication (moderate leg pain with ambulation); Rutherford Class 3: Severe claudication (severe leg pain with ambulation); Rutherford Class 4: Ischemic Rest pain (leg pain at rest); Rutherford Class 5: Minor tissue loss (nonhealing ulcer, focal gangrene, diffuse pedal ischemia); Rutherford class 6: Major tissue loss (extending above the transmetatarsal TM level, functional foot no longer salvageable.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Secpndary Efficacy: Wound healing</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The third secondary efficacy endpoint is wound healing for subjects with Rutherford class 5 at 6 and 12 months, as assessed by the investigator using WIfI score and descriptive characteristics, including change in wound size measured by any decrease in wound surface area.
The WIfI classification scoring system is a grading system using a composite score of wound (W), ischemia (I), and foot infection (fi). These three different categories are graded from 0 to 3 with 0 being the best and 3 being the worst.
The total score will be provided (clinical stage 1-5), which is used to estimate the risk for major amputation at one year. Patients with a score of 1 are considered low risk, and patients with a score of 5 are considered high risk (foot not salvageable). Therefore, higher values are considered a worse outcome.
The composite score is calculated by adding up the score from each category.</description>

          4. Subjects must have symptoms of limb ischemia, determined by clinical symptoms of
             Rutherford class 3-5, including severe, life-limiting claudication (R 3), rest pain (R
             4), and/or minor tissue loss (R5), that in the opinion of the investigator are not
             amenable to conservative medical therapy and require endovascular intervention for
             alleviation of symptoms and tissue preservation

          5. Stenotic, restenotic, or occlusive lesions located in the infrapopliteal vessels, with
             target lesion that can be successfully crossed with a guidewire.

          6. Target lesion must meet lesion-specific criteria in pre-screening by angiography at
             time of procedure (prescreening with CTA, MRA or selective angiography may be
             performed prior to the index procedure).

          7. Target vessel(s) reconstitute(s) at or above the ankle, with the target treated
             segment extending no more than 10 mm beyond the ankle.

             Note:

             If the anterior tibial or posterior tibial arteries are treated, there must be inline
             flow to the foot.

             If the peroneal artery is treated, there must be at least one collateral supplying the
             foot.

          8. Target lesion must begin no higher than the tibial trifurcation (popliteal artery
             excluded).

          9. Target vessel reference diameter is measured to be between 2.0 mm to 4.5 mm in
             diameter, assessed by one of the following methods after successful completion of
             guidewire crossing of the lesion site:

               1. Intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS)

               2. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)

               3. Quantitative Vascular Angiography (QVA)

         10. Lesion length must be &gt; 30 mm and &lt; 200 mm.

         11. Only one limb may be enrolled per subject. Up to two vessels may be treated per
             subject; if required, a second modality may be used for treatment in the non-target
             infrapopliteal vessel. Any treatment of the non-index vessel must be performed prior
             to the use of the investigative device and only one artery may be treated with the
             investigative device

         12. The treated segment is defined as the total length of artery treated with the
             investigational device. Target treatment length is &lt;250 mm with a maximum segment of
             200 mm separated by 30 mm of healthy tissue between treated lesions.

         13. Successful pre-dilatation of the target lesion as outlined in the procedure
             instructions, defined as resulting in stenosis &lt;50%, without resulting flow limiting
             (Type D or greater) dissection, thrombus, or aneurysm by angiography prior to the
             insertion of the investigative device.

         14. Iliac, SFA and popliteal inflow lesions can be treated using standard angioplasty
             and/or drug coated balloon and/or an approved stent (no atherectomy) during the index
             procedure or &gt;30 days prior. Inflow lesions treated intraprocedure must be treated
             first, prior to consideration of treatment of infrapopliteal lesions. If pre-screening
             with duplex ultrasound, angiography, CTA, or MRA has been performed &lt; 365 days prior
             to the procedure, intra-procedure angiography of the aorto-iliac vasculature is not
             required, however, the femoropopliteal inflow must still be imaged using angiography
             during the index procedure. Inflow lesions must have a healthy vessel segment of &gt;30
             mm between the study lesion and the treated segment, defined as less than 50% stenosis
             without aneurysmal segments.

         15. Retrograde access (in the infrapopliteal arteries) is permitted for lesion crossing,
             however, the Temporary Spur Stent System must be deployed from antegrade access.

         16. For subjects with bilateral disease, planned treatment of the contralateral limb must
             either be performed &gt;30 days prior to the index procedure or &gt; 14 days following the
             index procedure.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject unwilling or unlikely to comply with the appropriate follow up time for the
             duration of the study in the opinion of the investigator.

          2. Subject is pregnant or planning to become pregnant during the course of the trial.

          3. Subject has an active infection that is not controlled at the time of the procedure,
             including septicemia or bacteremia.

          4. Subject has osteomyelitis proximal to the phalanges. Osteomyelitis in the digit(s) of
             the target foot is permitted.

          5. Subject has a heel wound, unless osteomyelitis has been ruled out with MRI, MRA, or
             nuclear medicine bone scan

          6. Planned major (above the ankle) amputation of the target limb. A planned or previous

         12. Inability to tolerate dual antiplatelet and/or anticoagulation therapy.

         13. Known allergies or sensitivities to heparin, antiplatelet drugs, other anticoagulant
             therapies which could not be substituted, drug balloon coatings and their excipients,
             including, but not limited to, paclitaxel, sirolimus, or zotarolimus, or an allergy to
             contrast media that cannot be adequately pre-treated prior to the index procedure.

         14. The subject is currently enrolled in another investigational device or drug trial that
             interferes with the study endpoints.

         15. Known allergy to nitinol or nickel.

         16. Prior stent(s) within the target vessel, or bypass surgery of or within the target

         17. Target lesion is located within an aneurysm or associated with an aneurysm in the
             vessel segment either proximal or distal to the target lesion. Inflow must also be
             free of aneurysmal segments.

         18. Previous treatment failure of inflow arteries (Iliac, SFA and popliteal) which
             required a surgical procedure. Prior bypass above the level of the infrapopliteal

             Academic Research Consortium (PARC) score or the Peripheral Arterial Calcium Scoring
             System (PACSS) that, in the investigator's opinion, would not be amenable to PTA (see
             Appendix I for definitions).
