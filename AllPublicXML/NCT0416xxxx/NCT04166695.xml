  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tooth-coloured fixed restorations are becoming increasingly popular with patients and
      dentists. If high-strength all-ceramics such as zirconia are used as the restoration
      material, a maximum of two adjacent missing teeth can be replaced with the aid of fixed
      partial dentures (FPDs). For the replacement of a missing anterior or posterior tooth by
      FPDs, a very good clinical performance similar to that of metal-based, ceramic-veneered
      restorations can be expected. However, evidence-based statements on the clinical performance
      of long-span all-ceramic FPDs are difficult because there are only very few studies on this
      topic, which are also inhomogeneous with regard to the study conditions. Randomized studies
      to compare monolithic (consisting only of the high-strength framework material) or partially
      veneered (weaker veneering ceramics in esthetically relevant tooth areas) all-ceramic and
      classic (completely veneered) metal-ceramic FPDs are lacking. The aim of the current
      explorative, prospective, randomized, two-arm clinical interventional study is therefore to
      compare the clinical performance of long-span FPDs (≥ 4 Pontics) made of monolithic /
      facially veneered zirconium dioxide with a gold standard (completely veneered cobalt chromium
      (CoCr)-based FPDs). Forty patients will be recruited. Once all inclusion criteria have been
      established, including the signed informed consent of the patients informed of the content,
      effort, advantages and disadvantages of the study, patients are assigned to the two study
      groups by stratified block randomization (main strata: tooth-supported /
      (tooth-)implant-supported). After placement of the restorations, follow-up examinations are
      performed after 1 week (baseline) and after half a year, one year, two years and three years.
      In addition to the main target criterion (veneering defects), further complications (related
      to FPDs or supporting tissues / structures) and parameters of oral health are recorded.
      Depending on the distribution and structure of the data, parametric and non-parametric
      statistics are used. Group differences with respect to the main target criterion ceramic
      defects are to be investigated by log-rank and chi-square tests. The significance level is
      set at α &lt; 0.05. Since this is an explorative study, all p-values are descriptive.
