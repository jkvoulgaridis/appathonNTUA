  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and efficacy of ultrasound combined with CT-guided sympathetic
      ganglion block for refractory pain caused by sympathetic neuropathy of the lower extremities.
      Patients with lumbar sympathetic block were enrolled and randomized to a conventional
      CT-guided group and an ultrasound-guided CT-guided group. By comparing the traditional CT
      guided and ultrasound combined with CT guided two programs, the radiation dose, block success
      rate, treatment time, etc. received by patients with lumbar sympathetic block were observed
      to understand whether ultrasound combined with CT guidance is a way to reduce radiation
      exposure. Under the premise of the dose, the method of blocking the success rate can still be
      guaranteed.
