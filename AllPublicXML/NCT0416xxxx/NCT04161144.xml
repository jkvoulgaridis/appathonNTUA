  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of rapamycin (sirolimus) versus a
      placebo, an inactive substance, on responses to smoking cues in individuals with nicotine
      dependence. Rapamycin (sirolimus) is a FDA-approved antibiotic and immunosuppressive drug
      that is currently used to (a) prevent organ transplant recipients from rejecting their
      transplants (b) treat cardiovascular diseases, and (c) treat some forms of cancer. Rapamycin
      (sirolimus) is not FDA-approved for smoking cessation. The use of rapamycin (sirolimus) in
      this study is investigational, meaning that the study medication is not a proven treatment
      for nicotine dependence, however this study will examine the medication's use as a potential
      future treatment for nicotine dependence.

      The proposed study will employ 58 ND treatment-seeking smokers who will be randomly assigned
      to receive either 15-mg of sirolimus or placebo (group n's=29) immediately after the first of
      two smoking cue exposure sessions scheduled to occur on consecutive days. The first session
      will serve as a Retrieval session during which smoking (e.g., handling and lighting of a
      cigarette) cue exposure will elicit retrieval and reconsolidation of smoking-related
      memories; the second session will be a Test session to examine the potential modulatory role
      of sirolimus on the reconsolidation of memories putatively elicited during the retrieval
      session. Participants will be required to refrain from smoking the night before (bedtime)
      their first laboratory (i.e., Retrieval) session and will remain abstinent from smoking until
      the completion of the second laboratory (i.e., Test) session. It is posited that changes in
      reactivity during the test session will reflect medication effects on memory reconsolidation
      that occurred following the retrieval session. Measures of subjective responses (i.e.,
      craving) and physiological reactivity (i.e., heart rate &amp; skin conductance) will be obtained
      before, during and after cue presentations in both sessions. The durability of any observed
      treatment effects will be assessed in a Follow-up session performed 7-days following
      completion of the test session. Treatment effects on self-report measures of smoking behavior
      during the 7-days preceding the Follow-up session will also be assessed.
