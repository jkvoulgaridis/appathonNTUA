      A phase II trial of TisaGenlecleucel (Kymriah®) in Elderly Patients with First-Relapsed or
      Primary Refractory Agressive B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, prospective, multicenter phase-II trial for elderly patients with aNHL
      failing 1st-line treatment with immunochemotherapy containing rituximab and anthracycline,
      who are not eligible for either autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation, defined
      as age &gt; 65 years, or &gt; 60 years old with HCT-CI score &gt;2. This trial evaluates the CMR rate
      12 weeks after tisagenlecleucel (Kymriah®) infusion, the incidence and severity of adverse
      events, progression-free survival, and overall survival after one and two years after
      tisagenlecleucel (Kymriah®).
