  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is investigating whether acute administration of citalopram is associated with a
      decrease in stress reactivity in healthy volunteers, compared to placebo administration.
      Using a parallel-group double-blind design, participants will be randomised to receive either
      an acute dose of citalopram or placebo. All participants will have come in for a screening
      visit. On the day of the research visit (following drug administration) participants will
      have completed a number of widely used computer-based cognitive tasks measuring emotional
      processing biases. They will then complete the Oxford Cognition Stress Task, a web-based
      acute stress induction paradigm, which is designed to induce mild transient increases in
      stress and arousal. Identifying early changes in stress reactivity following antidepressant
      treatment will increase the investigator's knowledge of how antidepressants operate, and
      provide putative targets to identify early response to antidepressants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the Oxford Cognition Stress Task (OCST), participants are presented with a series of
      mental arithmetic, verbal (anagrams) and visuospatial (visual search) challenges on a
      computer screen. There is a time limit for completing each challenge, which is displayed on
      the screen as a time bar. To induce a high failure rate, the timing and difficulty of the
      challenges is automatically varied to ensure participants are correctly complete only 20-40%
      of the challenges within the time, and some of the verbal challenges (anagrams) are
      impossible to solve. Participants are given feedback on their performance on the screen which
      indicates that they are performing badly. Heart rate will be measured continuously during the
      OCST, and during pre- and post- task periods. Baseline and post-OCST measures of blood
      pressure and samples of saliva (for cortisol analysis) will be taken. Participants will also
      complete Visual Analogue Scales pre- and post-OCST to give a subjective measure of stress and
      mood. Participants will not be told the extent to which becoming stressed (and finding the
      task difficult) is intended. At the end of the test session, participants will be fully
      debriefed as to the nature of the OCST.
