  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the role of BAT in aging-induced impairments in
      metabolism and cardiac function. This study could have a transformative effect in identifying
      both a unique role for BAT in aging and as a potential therapeutic target to reduce mortality
      from senescence. Studying the role of BAT will potentially help us understand and prevent an
      accelerated aging process, which will help researchers better understand metabolic and
      cardiac health in the elderly.

    <description>Older sedentary participants will undergo 8 weeks of exercise training. The exercise program will be supervised by a certified exercise physiologist and will take place at the AdventHealth Translational Research Institute (TRI) exercise training facility. Exercise compliance will be monitored for exercise training 4 days per week (32 total sessions). Aerobic training will be 30 minutes of brisk walking, jogging, cycle ergometry. Walking will be the primary mode of aerobic exercise given its widespread popularity and ease of administration across a broad segment of the older adult population. Walking will be at a moderate intensity and determined based on Heart Rate (50-70% of Maximal Heart Rate from most recent VO2max) and rating of perceived exertion using Borg's scale (ranges from 6 to 20).</description>

             substances that could modulate glucose metabolism, or are considered anabolic, or
             reduce weight (fat mass) in the opinion of the PI or Physician, starting two weeks
             prior to enrollment and over the entire course of the study. These include
             progestational agents, steroids, growth hormone, dronabinol, marijuana,

             study.

             no need for a pregnancy test prior to DEXA procedures. Females currently on hormone
             replacement therapy can participate in the study if they have been on a stable dose of
             Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) for at least 6 months and will continue to be on HRT
             during the study.

         21. Potential participants taking stable doses of medications for the last 30 days prior
             to screening for Blood pressure, cholesterol, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
             may be permitted to participate.
