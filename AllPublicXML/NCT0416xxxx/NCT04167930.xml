      Retrospective data will be extracted using electronic medical records and computerized data
      of hospitalized patients. Based on this, investigators will conduct research in the form of
      prospective survey and analyze the causal relationship and factors using the two data.

      The hospital's medical records will be used to analyze the patient's condition during the
      hospitalization period and to determine the situation after the end of treatment through
      questionnaire. The questionnaire will be developed after consultation with experts from
