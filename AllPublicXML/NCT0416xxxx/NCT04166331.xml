  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis induces both a systolic and diastolic cardiac dysfunction. The prevalence of this
      septic cardiomyopathy ranges between 30 and 60% according to the timing of assessment and
      definition used. Although the prognostic role of septic cardiomyopathy remains debated,
      sepsis-induced left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction may be severe and associated with
      tissue hypoperfusion, while it appears to fully recover in survivors. Accordingly,
      optimization of therapeutic management of septic cardiomyopathy may contribute to improve
      tissue hypoperfusion in increasing oxygen delivery, and to reduce related organ dysfunctions
      in septic shock patients.

      Echocardiography is currently the recommended first-line modality to assess patients with
      acute circulatory failure.

      Current Surviving Sepsis Campaign strongly recommends Norepinephrine as the first-choice
      vasopressor in fluid-filled patients with septic shock. In contrast, the use of Dobutamine is
      only suggested (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence) in patients with persistent
      tissue hypoperfusion despite adequate fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support.
      Levosimendan, an alternative inodilator, has failed preventing acute organ dysfunction in
      septic patients and has induced more supraventricular tachyarrhythmias than in the control
      group. Data supporting Dobutamine in this setting are scarce and primarily physiologic and
      based on monitored effects of this drug on hemodynamics and indices of tissue perfusion.

      No randomized controlled trials have yet compared the effects of Dobutamine versus placebo on
      clinical outcomes. In open-labelled, small sample trials, the ability of septic patients to
      increase their oxygen delivery during Dobutamine administration appears to be associated with
      lower mortality.

      The tested hypothesis in the ADAPT trial is that Dobutamine will reduce tissue hypoperfusion
      and associated organ dysfunctions in patients with septic shock and associated septic
      cardiomyopathy. In doing so, it may participate in improving clinical outcomes.
