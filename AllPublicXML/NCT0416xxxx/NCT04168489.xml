    <textblock>
      Based on the pain threshold and visual simulation score, primary dysmenorrhea patients will
      be divided into treatment effective group or non-effective group.According to the functional
      magnetic resonance imaging, the investigators investigate whether there is characteristic or
      secondary brain features before and after rTMS intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Long term primary dysmenorrhea may induce a series of disorders involving psychology, lower
      quality of life, or even developing chronic organic lesion or chronic pain. Effective symptom
      improvement is urgently needed. During the Non-pharmaceutical interventions, repetitive
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is received preliminary approval because of its
      noninvasive and safe analgesic effect. In this randomized single blind longitudinal study,
      the investigators investigate the analgesic effect of rTMS in long term moderate-to-severe
      primary dysmenorrhea women. Based on the pain threshold and visual simulation score, primary
      dysmenorrhea patients will be divided into treatment effective group or non-effective group.
      According to the functional magnetic resonance imaging, the investigators investigate whether
      there is characteristic or secondary brain features before and after rTMS intervention. By
      combining pre and post performances of the degree of dysmenorrhea, behavioral data and
      sensitive hematological indicators, the investigators intend to build an association model
      between brain and pain development curve. Using correlation and multiple regression analysis
      method, the investigators intend to find sensitive neuroimaging biomarkers in predicting the
      analgesic effect of rTMS. The current study is not only contributing to improve the central
      nervous systematic mechanism of rTMS in chronic pelvic pain, but also significant for
      clinical effective treatment based on neuroimaging predictive markers.
