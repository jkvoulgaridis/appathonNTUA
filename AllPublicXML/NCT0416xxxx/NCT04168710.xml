  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a prospective randomized double blinded placebo controlled clinical trial
      using ultrasound guided erector spinae plane block as an analgesic adjunct among adult
      emergency department (ED) patients with rib fractures using mean morphine milligram
      equivalents as the primary outcome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aim 1: Given the novelty of the erector spinae plane nerve block and limited data from
      anesthesia literature, aim 1 is to obtain preliminary data regarding quantity of mean
      morphine equivalents received by control and experimental groups for an initial subset of 50
      patients to improve sample size calculation and better power the study.

      Aim 2: Evaluate efficacy of ED performed ultrasound guided ESP block in delivering analgesia
      by evaluating difference in morphine milligram equivalents (MME) as well as pain scores
      during ED stay and hospital admission between the experimental and control groups.

      Aim 3: Evaluate adverse event rates related to ultrasound guided ESP block placement as well
      as rates of rib-fracture related complications between control and experimental groups.
