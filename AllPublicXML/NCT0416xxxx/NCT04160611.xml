  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to determine whether premedication with midazolam before oocyte
      aspiration in IVF procedures affects the amount of (oxidative) stress in women undergoing IVF
      and whether stress is also transmitted to the follicular fluid of aspirated follicles. The
      primary endpoint is the impact of stress during aspiration on the success of medically
      assisted fertilization (IVF / ICSI in the stimulated cycle).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The procedure of in vitro fertilisation (IVF) is used to treat the infertility problems. The
      procedure includes ovary aspiration, to isolate oocytes. During the aspiration the patient is
      sedated with short-term intravenous aesthetic. Premedication is often used in
      anaesthesiology, and includes drugs application 30 minutes prior to procedure to sedate and
      treat the anxieties of the patient. One of the most often used drugs in premedication is
      midazolam. As the procedure is quite stressful for the patients, our aim is to investigate
      the influence of midazolam premedication on the stress release during the oocyte aspiration
      procedure, as well as its influence on the whole IVF procedure. Therefore, patients will be
      divided into two groups, control and midazolam. Blood samples will be taken before and during
      the procedure. Stress, antioxidant parameters (with glutathione and catalase) and oxidative
      status will be monitored in serum and follicular fluid.

      The results will be correlated with subjective stress levels in the two groups in an effort
      to establish ties with IVF results.

    <description>All patients in the midazolam group will be sampled with 5 ml venepuncture prior to midazolam administration, just before the procedure, 2 hours after the procedure. A follicular fluid sample will be taken at the procedure. Samples will be stored in the freezer at -80⁰C. The total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and total oxidation capacity (TOC) of commercially available kits will be determined from plasma and follicular fluid. Whole blood will determine total glutathione and catalase activity. In addition to the total oxidation capacity, the amount of HNE-protein conjugates will be determined from the follicular fluid as an indicator of lipid peroxidation, and the Patients will be monitored after the aspiration procedure, and the success of the procedure of medically assisted fertilization, ie number of pregnancies, in the test and control group will be monitored.</description>

    <description>Patients will be randomly divided into two groups, control and midazolam. The midazolam group will receive midazolam premedication in such a way that 7.5mg midazolam will be taken orally 30 minutes before the aspiration procedure. Because midazolam causes sedation, the woman will be monitored by midazolam after medical premedication to avoid possible complications and will not be allowed to get out of bed on her own for 30 minutes. After 30 min, all women, both test and control group, will begin aspiration under the control of transvaginal ultrasound of one or more mature follicles (TUGOR - transvaginal ultrasound guided oocyte retrieval) under short term general anesthesia.</description>
