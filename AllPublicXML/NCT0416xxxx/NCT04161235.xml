  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Post-Market Evaluation of the Zephyr Valve 5.5-LP EBV to assess Treated Lobar
      Volume Reduction (TLVR), changes in lung function and the safety profile of the Zephyr Valve
      treatment with the use of at least one Zephyr Valve 5.5-LP EBV.

    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, single-arm, prospective, observational study. Approximately 70 study
      participants undergoing Zephyr Valve treatment with the use of at least one Zephyr Valve
      5.5-LP EBV will be enrolled and followed out to 3 months. Assessments will be conducted at 45
      days and 3 months. The evaluation will be conducted at up to 6 sites.

      Patients prescribed Zephyr Valve treatment for their emphysema will be consented and will be
      enrolled only after: 1) determination of little to no collateral ventilation between target
      and ipsilateral lobes and 2) implantation of at least one Zephyr Valve 5.5-LP EBV. Baseline
      data will be collected retrospectively after enrollment of a patient in the Post-Market
      Evaluation. Performance and safety of the Zephyr Valve treatment with the use of at least one
      Zephyr Valve 5.5-LP will be evaluated post-treatment based on data collected until 3 months
      after the treatment.
