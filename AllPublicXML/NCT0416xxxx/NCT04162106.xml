  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This post-market clinical study is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of the Ultravision™
      System when compared to the Airseal® iFS within an approved indication for use, namely
      laparoscopic cholosystectomy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary hypothesis being tested in this study is that Ultravision facilitates the
      utilization of lower pneumoperitoneal pressures whilst maintaining an adequate visual field
      throughout the procedure with low demand for CO2 replenishment to maintain pneumoperitoneal
      pressure. Comparisons in terms of surgical field visualization, procedure times, and CO2
      consumption will be conducted in order to determine whether or not any clinical benefits are
      derived from the use of the Ultravision™ System compared to the Airseal® iFS. Low pressure
      laparoscopy for this study is set at 10mmHg. This is a prospective, open-label, randomized
      controlled study. The study will include two study arms. Patients undergoing laparoscopic
      cholecystectomy will be randomized to either &quot;Ultravision&quot; (study arm 1) or Airseal® iFS
      (study arm 2). Both groups will conduct the procedure at 10mmHg, considered to be low
      pressure/low impact laparoscopic surgery. The study will enroll 30 patients, 15 per group.
      Both devices are being used according to their cleared label claims.
