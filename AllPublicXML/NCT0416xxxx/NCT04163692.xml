    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effects of progressive relaxation exercises on artralgia, quality of
      life and anxiety in breast cancer survivors receiving aromatase inhibitors. Half of the
      participants will receive supervised progressive relaxing exercises, while other half will
      not receive any exercise but only advice about relaxing.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aromatase inhibitors (AI) can cause musculoskeletal problems and increased risk of fracture
      as side effects in breast cancer (BC) survivors. In particular, arthralgia can be observed in
      almost 50% of patients receiving AI. Moreover; cognitive dysfunctions , decreases in quality
      of life , anxiety and depression , sleep problems and fatigue can be seen in some of patients
      receiving AI. According to these possible side effects, evaluation and treatment of such
      health profiles, pain and symptoms is important in terms of improving the quality of life of
      the patients.

      Progressive muscle relaxation exercises (PRE) were first described by Jacobson in 1938. PRE
      are in use today with different arrangements and updates. It was well defined physiological,
      perceptual and behavioral positive findings of muscle relaxation.(15) PRE was thought to be
      effective on artralgia, quality of life and anxiety in BC survivors receiving AI.

      The patients have been founded from the medical records of oncology department of Florence
      Nightingale Hospital. Necessary permissions to use this data was provided from medical
      coordinator of the hospital and from the coordinator of Breast Cancer department.

    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluates the multidimensionel quality of life in patients with breast cancer and is available in many languages . The questionnaire includes 5 sub-scales that assess physical, social, emotional, functional and other anxiety status. It has 27-item general and 10-item breast cancer specific scale in which patients evaluate their status. Patients determine an appropriate expression for themselves in the last 7 days, with a 5 point scale as 0: none, 1: very little, 2: slightly, 3: quite, 4: too much. Higher scores indicate higher quality of life</description>
