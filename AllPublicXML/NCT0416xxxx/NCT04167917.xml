    <textblock>
      NTX-301 is a DNMT1 inhibitor. The drug is an oral drug with preclinical data that has shown
      preclinical anti-leukemic efficacy. This is the first clinical trial using NTX-301 in

                  b) Renal:

               -  estimated glomerular filtration rate (by CKD-EPI method) ≥ 40 mL/min/1.73 m2 c)

                  limit of normal by either ECHO or MUGA at entry.

          5. Patients must have recovered to grade 1 or less from prior toxicity or adverse events
             (exception of myelosuppression - neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia - and
             alopecia). Note: Participants with treatment-related toxicities that are unlikely to
             resolve per the investigator may be enrolled on a case-by-case basis after discussion
             with the medical monitor

          6. Patients must have completed any chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or biologic therapy
             specific to their myeloid neoplasm ≥ 2 weeks or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer)

          8. Expected life ≥ 4 months

          9. Participants with a prior history of stem cell transplant (autologous and/or
             allogeneic) are allowed if all of the following are met:

               -  90 days or more have elapsed from the time of transplant

               -  subject has been off systemic immunosuppressive medications (including but not
                  limited to: cyclosporine, tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, or corticosteroids)
                  for at least 30 days prior to the first dose of NTX-301. Topical steroids are
                  permitted

               -  no signs or symptoms of acute graft versus host disease, other than Grade 1 skin
                  involvement.

               -  there are no signs or symptoms of chronic graft versus host disease requiring
                  systemic therapy

         10. Women of child-bearing potential (according to recommendations of the Clinical Trial
             Facilitation Group [CTFG], CTFG 2014) must not be pregnant or breastfeeding and must
             have a negative pregnancy test at screening. A woman is considered of childbearing
             potential (ie, fertile) following menarche and until becoming postmenopausal, unless
             permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization methods include hysterectomy, bilateral
             salpingectomy, and bilateral oophorectomy. A man is considered fertile after puberty
             unless permanently sterile by bilateral orchidectomy.

         11. Subjects and their partners with reproductive potential must agree to use 2 highly
             effective contraceptive measures during the study and must agree not to become
             pregnant or father a child for 3 months after the last dose of study treatment.
             Contraceptive measures that may be considered highly effective comprise combined
             hormonal contraception (oral, vaginal, or transdermal) or progestogen-only hormonal
             contraception (oral, injectable, implantable) associated with inhibition of ovulation,
             intrauterine device, intrauterine hormone-releasing system, bilateral tubal occlusion,
             sexual abstinence, and surgically successful vasectomy. Abstinence is acceptable only
             if it is consistent with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic
             abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or post-ovulation methods) and
             withdrawal are not acceptable methods of birth control.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis or presence of any of the following:

               -  acute promyelocytic leukemia

               -  extramedullary leukemia

               -  symptomatic or untreated Central Nervous System (CNS) disease [note that lumbar
                  puncture (LP) is not required for study enrollment unless there is clinical
                  suspicion for CNS disease; patients with history of CNS disease are permitted to
                  enroll if they have previously received appropriate therapy and CNS remission has
                  been; participants on maintenance intrathecal chemotherapy may be enrolled and
                  continue to receive therapy]

          2. Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.

          3. Pregnant women and women who are breastfeeding are excluded from this study.

             the study, including, but not limited to:

               -  severe or uncontrolled infection

               -  known HIV infection requiring protease inhibitor therapy

               -  known Hepatitis B; defined as presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)

               -  known Hepatitis C; if Hepatitis C antibody is positive, then this is defined as
                  positive Hepatitis C RNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (or comparable test)

               -  uncontrolled diabetes and/or hypertension, symptomatic congestive heart failure,
                  unstable angina pectoris, myocardial infarction within the past 6 months,
                  uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that
                  would limit compliance with study requirements in the opinion of the investigator

               -  Malabsorption syndrome or other conditions that would interfere with intestinal
                  absorption.

          5. History of a second malignancy, excluding non-melanoma skin cell cancer, within the
             last three years. Participants with second malignancies that were indolent, in situ or
             definitively treated may be enrolled even if less than three years have elapsed since
             treatment. Consult the monitor if there are any queries.
