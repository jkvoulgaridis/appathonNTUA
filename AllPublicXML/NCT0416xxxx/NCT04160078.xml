      The study investigates the effects of a mindfulness intervention on sleep and subsequent
      cardio-metabolic risk in an adult Atlanta population aged 18 and older.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus has been identified as a leading cause of death in the United
      States. This problem is alarmingly higher in southern state, including Georgia. Sleep, a
      modifiable health behavior, may be a target for reducing the burden of diabetes. This
      research study will enroll adults from the community to participate in a mindfulness-based
      stress reduction program (MBSR) via an app on his/her cellular phone. Participants will also
      wear a wrist monitor to estimate activity and sleep as well as provide a blood sample before
      and after the MBSR. Following the 6-week intervention program, participants will provide
      information via focus groups to obtain feedback on his/her experiences during the program.

      This pilot study will enroll (N=20) racially diverse men and women who are 18 years and older
      and reside in Atlanta. Participants will be recruited from the community via advertisements,
      community events and existing community partnerships. Trained research assistants will screen
      potential participants. Eligible participants will be contacted via phone and scheduled to
      attend a baseline visit to collect a blood sample and attend a sleep education session.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in average nightly sleep duration from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 7 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep duration will be measured in hours and minutes using a sleep 7-day actigraphy (Philips Respironics Actiwatch Spectrum Plus) on the non-dominant wrist, and concurrently a sleep diary to facilitates interpretation and assessment of actigraphy</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in sleep timing from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 7 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Change in sleep schedule will be expressed in hours and minutes and recorded using a sleep 7-day actigraphy (Philips Respironics Actiwatch Spectrum Plus) on the non-dominant wrist, and concurrently a sleep diary to facilitates interpretation and assessment of actigraphy</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in sleep quality from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 7 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep quality/efficiency will be measured using a self-reported instrument (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is a self-rated questionnaire which assesses sleep quality and disturbances over a 1-month time interval.I n scoring the PSQI, seven component scores are derived, each scored 0 (no difficulty) to 3 (severe difficulty). The component scores are summed to produce a global score (range 0 to 21). Higher scores indicate worse sleep quality.
Poor sleep quality is defined as a score of 5 or greater on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in average high-density lipoproteins (HDL) Cholesterol from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 7 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The difference in levels of HDL at baseline and at 7 weeks post-intervention will be measured. HDL are reported in mg/dL and a range of 40 to 59 mg/dL is normal, but it could be higher. Having HDL under 40 mg/dL increases your risk of developing heart disease and stroke.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in triglycerides from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 7 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The difference in levels of triglycerides in the bloodstream at baseline and at 7 weeks post-intervention will be measured. Triglycerides are reported in mg/dL. Less than 150 milligrams per deciliter is normal, and higher levels of triglycerides have been linked to atherosclerosis, heart disease and stroke.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in fasting blood glucose</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 7 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The difference in fasting blood glucose at baseline and at 7 weeks post-intervention will be measured. Fasting blood glucose is reported in mg/dL. A fasting blood sugar level less than 100 mg/dL is normal. A fasting blood sugar level from 100 to 125 mg/dL is considered prediabetes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 7 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The difference in the levels of HbA1c at baseline and at 7 weeks post-intervention will be measured. The A1C test result is reported as a percentage. The higher the percentage, the higher a person's blood glucose levels have been. A normal A1C level is below 5.7 percent.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Blood pressure from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 7 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Blood pressure is the pressure of circulating blood on the walls of blood vessels, and it is measured in mm Hg.
Three seated blood pressure measurements will be made using an electronic sphygmomanometer. An average of the last two readings will be used to assess systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Blood pressure numbers of less than 120/80 mm Hg are considered within the normal range.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in C-reactive protein from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 7 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>C-reactive protein (CRP) is a protein made by the liver and it is a marker of inflammation in the body. Normal CRP levels are below 3.0 mg/L (the normal reference range often varies between labs). CRP will be assessed at baseline and 7 weeks post intervention.</description>
