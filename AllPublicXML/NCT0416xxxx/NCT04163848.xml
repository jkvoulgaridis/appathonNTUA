  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Assessing the impact of anesthesia practice on global warming and carbon footprint becomes
      part of the standard of care and is growing concern within the anesthesia community. Global
      Warming Potential (GWP) is a measure of how much a given mass of greenhouse gas contributes
      to global warming over a specified time period. Inhaled anesthetics have various GWP20: 349
      for sevoflurane and 3714 for desflurane. However, GWP20 and CDE20 alone are not sufficient to
      evaluate the environmental impact of anesthetic gases. Other parameters must be included in
      the analysis: fresh gas flow (FGF), carrier gas (air, O2, N2O) and potency of the anesthetic
      gas. Unfortunately, the majority of trials did not fully consider the FGF reduction and the
      fact that desflurane can be administered with new closed or very low-flow anesthesia circuits
      as opposed as the recommended 2L/min that must be used for sevoflurane according to its
      monography in Canada. Most of the calculations were made on a purely theoretical approach
      that could be different from actual measurements based on a strictly monitored anesthesia
      practice. When continuous and accurate gas monitoring and analysis is used as recommended
      nowadays, the use of closed or semi-closed-circuit anesthesia with very low FGF might allow
      for a reduction of more than 80% of the anesthetic gas administration and its consequent
      pollution. By properly monitoring the anesthesia depth and analgesia adequacy, the
      investigators can reduce the gas consumption. The proposed study will aim at determining
      whether with the help of high-quality monitoring (BIS and NOL) and high-end ventilators that
      allow minimal fresh gas flow, the use of desflurane remains more polluting than sevoflurane.
