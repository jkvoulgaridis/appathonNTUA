    <textblock>
      This cross-over clinical trial is being conducted to evaluate the difference in urinary
      messenger RNA (mRNA) biomarkers of mineralocorticoid receptor activation following a
      low-sodium diet, as compared to a high-sodium diet. The study team will collect urine and
      blood samples from each participant to study mineralocorticoid receptor-regulated mRNA
      biomarkers following the consumption of each diet.

      The study team will instruct the participants to consume 8 days each of high- (300 mmol/day)
      and low- (10 mmol/day) sodium meals. The order in which the participants will eat the two
      study diets will be randomly determined. In between the high- and low-sodium diets, the
      participants will have a wash-out period of 6 days, during which they will be encouraged to
      consume their usual diet. Participants will be asked to provide the study team with 24-hour
      urine samples, random urine samples, and blood samples throughout their participation in this
      clinical trial.
