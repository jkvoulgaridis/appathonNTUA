    <textblock>
      Primary dysmenorrhea is defined as cramping pain in the lower abdomen occurring just before
      or during menstruation, in the absence of other diseases.

      About 50-90% of the women experience menstrual pain, and approximately 15% of them suffer
      from a severe level of pain It is a common cause of absenteeism and reduced quality of life
      in women.

      From 21% to 96% of women with menstrual pain, reported to practice self-treatment either by
      pharmacological or nonpharmacological interventions. However, there are adverse events
      associated with the use of these drugs, including stomach ache, diarrhea, nausea, cutaneous
      reactions, liver or kidney damage or cardiovascular risk after discontinuing medication .
      Therefore, many patients with menstrual pain usually seek complementary and alternative
      techniques.

      Medical taping concept is an alternative treatment that use elastic adhesive tape, which is
      applied to the patient's skin under tension.

      It has the characteristic to cause elevation of the epidermis and thereby reduce the pressure
      on the mechanoreceptors below the dermis. This would have the effect of reducing nociceptive
      stimuli.

    <time_frame>Participants will be followed for 6 menstrual cycles. Evaluations will be performed at the end of each treatment, when menstrual pain disappears (4-5 days after the beginning of the menstrual bleeding).</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will note the self-care applied to relief menstrual pain indicating the VAS is a method of representing subjects' satisfaction with treatment on a 10 cm linear scale. In this study, a score of 0 means 'a very low degree of satisfaction with treatment' and 10 means 'a very high degree of satisfaction with treatment</description>

    <description>Medical taping will be applied as a self-treatment. All participants will be instructed in an indvidual session and will receive a tutorial video to remember the kinesiotaping procedure. 3 band of a special and hypoallergenic tape (Kinematix Tex) will be attached to the abdominal (2 strips) and lower back (1 strip).
Patients will be taped for four days. It will start at the beginning of pain associated to the menstruation.</description>

    <description>For the medical taping group, a piece of Kinesio tape 5 cm in width and 7-8 cm in length will be applied right from below the navel and will reach to where the pubic hair begins, and another piece of tape 10 cm in length will be applied to make a cross shape with the first piece. A tape of 20cm in length will be placed horizontally to the lower back.</description>
