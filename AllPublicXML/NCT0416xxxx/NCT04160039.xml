  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Critically-ill patients with liver disease are at high risk of developing sarcopenia and
      intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired weakness, which are associated with mortality and other
      poor outcomes. Early physical rehabilitation has shown benefit in ICU settings, but has not
      been studied in ICU patients with acute and chronic liver failure. Cycle ergometry, or
      stationary cycling in passive and active modes, may be especially beneficial to such patients
      due to their high prevalence of severe physical deconditioning and variable mentation. The
      aim of this study is to examine the feasibility, safety, and benefit of cycle ergometry over
      standard physical and occupational therapy (PT/OT) in critically-ill patients who have acute
      or chronic liver disease.

      A single-blinded randomized controlled trial will be conducted in a transplant intensive care
      unit (TICU). Eligible adult patients will be enrolled within 72 hrs after TICU admission and
      randomly allocated to either (1) standard PT/OT care, or (2) PT/OT care and cycle ergometry
      sessions with trained PT/OT therapists or technicians. The outcome measures, tests of
      strength and function, will be assessed at baseline, every 14 days, and upon TICU discharge
      by a blinded PT/OT therapist.
