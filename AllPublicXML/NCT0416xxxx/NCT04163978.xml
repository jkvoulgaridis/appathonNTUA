  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This a single center, randomized controlled trial to evaluate safety &amp; efficacy of topical
      nitric oxide releasing sinus irrigation (NOSi) as compared to budesonide-Saline (Control) in
      the management of biofilm-associated recalcitrant chronic rhinosinusitis (RCRS). It is
      hypothesized that a daily treatment of NOSi over a 6-week period will be safe and effective
      at reducing clinical symptoms associated with RCRS.

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single center, Phase 2, double-blinded, randomized, controlled,
      parallel group trial study. Up to fifty-four (54) participants will be enrolled (based on
      power analysis based on outcomes from a previous dose-tolerance study. Screening data will be
      reviewed to determine participant eligibility. Participants who meet all inclusion criteria
      and none of the exclusion criteria will be entered into the study and randomized in to the
      Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) or Non Investigational Medicinal Product (NIMP) at a
      2:1 ratio (NOSi:Budesonide). Each participant will be managed as an outpatient for the 42
      days of the study. Participants will be administered NOSi or budesonide in saline by
      self-administration, at home, as a sinus irrigation to their nasopharynx and sinuses once a
      day. Participants will be asked to return to the clinic for evaluations on Day 21(±2), Day
      43(±2) and Day 63 (±2) following the start of study interventions.

             1);

          8. Suffers from a condition, which, in the opinion of the medical investigator, would
             compromise their safety and / or their adherence to the study protocol

          9. Systemic antibiotics, corticosteroids or antifungals within 30 days of randomization

         10. Intranasal or irrigation with antibiotics, antifungals or antiseptics or any other
