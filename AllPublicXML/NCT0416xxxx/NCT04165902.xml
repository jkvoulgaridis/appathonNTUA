  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Using double-blind, randomized controlled design to compare the immediate, short-term and
      intermediate-term additional therapeutic effects of ultrasound-guided corticosteroid
      injection and dextrose injection of hyaluronic acid injection on patients with knee
      osteoarthritis, under the basis of International Classification of Functioning, Disability,
      and Health.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 60 patients will be collected. The participants will be randomized into two
      groups, including hyaluronic acid combined corticosteroid group and hyaluronic acid combined
      dextrose group. The balance, physical activity (10 meters normal and fast walk, up and
      downstairs, and 5 repeated chair-rising time, timed up and go test), functional performance
      and knee-related quality of life (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis
      index„ÄÅKnee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score) will be evaluated. All the evaluations
      will be re-evaluated at one week after injection, one month after injection, three months
      after injection, and six months after injection. Subjects and evaluators will be both blinded
      to the group's classification during the whole course of study.
