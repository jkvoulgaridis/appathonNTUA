  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to develop a non-invasive test to diagnose intensive care unit
      (ICU) acquired weakness that can be administered to both responsive and non-responsive
      patients. Study participation will involve the measurement of muscle fatigue during a single
      30 minute session. Skeletal muscle will be stimulated with an FDA approved clinical
      electrical stimulator and accelerations will be passively recorded with an accelerometer.

      The primary purpose of this study is to develop a procedure to identify intensive care unit
      (ICU) acquired weakness. This condition occurs in a subset of people admitted into the ICU,
      and is associated with a 30% increased risk of death before discharge from the ICU. There are
      currently major limitations in the ability to diagnose ICU acquired weakness, making it
      difficult to study. The goal is to develop a non-invasive test that can be administered to
      both responsive and non-responsive patients. The current proposal will focus on replicating
      the results of previous research using motion detecting accelerometers to measure fatigue in
      human skeletal muscles. This study is designed to test out the procedures in patients who
      have been transferred from the ICU to a lower level of care so that follow-on studies can be
      designed to help mitigate this condition in the ICU.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Peak Acceleration</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>The highest acceleration over a single muscle twitch will be used as the peak acceleration. Peak acceleration will be measured in acceleration in number of times gravity (g). Higher twitch acceleration is a better response.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Peak Acceleration</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>The time, in seconds, until peak acceleration is reached will be assessed. There is not a reference range for the time to peak force and at this time it is unclear if a shorter or longer time to peak force indicates a more desirable state of health.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>End Acceleration</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>End acceleration is the twitch acceleration averaged over 5 twitches over the last second of stable twitches within the stimulation period. A reference range has not yet been established for this measurement.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Fatigue Ratio</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Fatigue ratio is the ending acceleration divided by peak acceleration during a given stimulation period. A reference range has not yet been established for this measurement.</description>

    <intervention_name>Clinical Electrical Stimulator</intervention_name>
    <description>Conductive electrodes will be on the skin at each end of the tested muscle(s). Each subject will have two target muscle groups tested (extensor carpi radialis longus, and tibialis anterior). Each muscle will be stimulated at three separate stimulation frequencies (2 Hz, 4 Hz, and 6Hz) over 3 minutes each, for a total of 9 minutes of stimulation per muscle. The clinical electrical stimulator will deliver mild electrical stimulations to the muscle (20-100 mA).</description>
