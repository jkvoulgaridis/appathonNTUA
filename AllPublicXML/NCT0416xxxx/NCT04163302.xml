      This is a single center, non-randomized, open-label, phase 2 study to evaluate the efficacy
      and safety of CD19-PD1-CART cells therapy for patients with relapsed/refractory B Cell
      Lymphoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lymphoma is a malignant tumor originating from lymph nodes or other lymphoid tissues. It can
      be divided into B cells, T cells, and NK cell lymphomas depending on the origin of different
      lymphocytes. Among them, B cell lymphoma accounts for about 90% of lymphoma.

      Chimeric antigen receptor T (CART) cells is a promising treatment for lymphoma. T lymphocytes
      from patients are separated and engineered with CD19-CAR, to specifically recognize and
      eliminate CD19-positive tumor cells. At present, many CD19CART cells therapy studies are in
      the stage of clinical research and have achieved significant clinical effects.

      Although there are some CD9CART cells clinical trials, the therapeutic effect on lymphoma is
      significantly lower than that of acute leukemia. One of the reasons is that lymphoma has the
      nature of solid tumors, whichi has a certain immunosuppressive microenvironment. The clinical
      trials of anti-PD-1 antibody drugs against lymphoma also show good therapeutic efficacy.
      Therefore, the combination of anti-PD-1 or PD-L1 antibody and CD19CART is one of the ways to
      improve the therapeutic effect of CART cells.

      The investigators screened PD-1 mutants that have high bind with the PD-L1 ligand, and
      prepared CD19CART which secretes the mutant PD-1Fc fusion protein. Preclinical studies have
      shown that CD19CART cells secreting mutant PD-1Fc fusion protein have a superior killing
      effect to CD19CART cells which does not express PD-1 fusion protein.

      The trial was conducted to explore the safety and efficacy of CD19-PD1-CART cells in
      Relapsed/Refractory B Cell Lymphoma.

    <intervention_model_description>This study was a single-center, open-label, single-arm, non-randomized clinical trial, which was divided in 3 groups by different infusion dose level. Firstly, each dose group has 3 patients. The pretreatment regimen of cyclophosphamide (25mg/m2 for 3 consecutive days) and fludarabine (10mg/kg for 3 consecutive days) was given before CART cells were reinfused. CART cells were reinfused on the third day after the pretreatment. If no serious side effects emerges in the group, then the next group uses the subsequent higher dose. If serious side effects emerges in a single patients in any dose level, 3 more patients will be enrolled to the same dose level. After 9 or more patients, the investigators select the safest dose and recruit more patients for CART test to explore its effectiveness.</intervention_model_description>
