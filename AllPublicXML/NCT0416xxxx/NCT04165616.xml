  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will contribute to the field of stroke rehabilitation research by expanding the
      investigator's understanding of the neural mechanisms responsible for the development and
      expression of abnormal flexion synergy, a primary movement impairment due to stroke. The
      study will longitudinally evaluate motor tract morphology and motor impairment/function in an
      attempt to develop early neuroimaging-based predictors of the development of flexion synergy
      and its impact on reaching and hand recovery (6 month). The study will utilize quantitative
      motor testing (kinematics and kinetics) to measure motor impairment and reaching and hand
      function. Both neuroimaging and quantitative motor testing will be conducted within 96
      hours-, 2 weeks-, 3 months-, and 6 months-post stroke. The knowledge gained by this study
      will provide crucial structural and functional neuroimaging evidence that demonstrates the
      timeline of progressive ipsi- and contralesional motor pathway (including bulbospinal
      pathways) changes and the associated development of flexion synergy that grossly impacts
      reaching and hand function in individuals with moderate to severe stroke.

Data sharing will occur through the primary repositories of Northwestern University DigitalHub (https://digitalhub.northwestern.edu/) and Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/). Data will be exported from the internal RedCap study data base in spreadsheet format and will be deidentified and coded. Data will be available through speaking engagements and publications, presentations at scientific symposia and seminars. Data sharing in the above repositories will be phased in time with acceptance for publication of the primary outcome paper near the end of the fifth year and then with each subsequent publication.
