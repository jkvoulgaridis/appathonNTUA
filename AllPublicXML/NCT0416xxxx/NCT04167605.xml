  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bone metastases represent a frequent complication of some solid tumours, particularly
      prostate, breast and lung carcinomas. Bone metastases can cause pain and give rise to the
      so-called &quot;Skeletal-related Events&quot; (SRE) such as pathological fractures and nerve
      compression. Despite advances in cancer treatment in general, treatment options for bone
      metastases remain inadequate and generally palliative. It is therefore necessary to identify
      patients at &quot;high risk&quot; of developing metastases at an early stage of neoplastic disease in
      order to counteract it. Therefore, the identification of changes in the expression of
      proteins that could be variously involved in the progression of breast cancer is of primary
      importance since they could act as prognostic factors and therefore address the therapeutic
      strategy. The aim of the investigators is to clarify the role of de-regulation of
      post-translational events (such as SUMOylation) in the progression of breast cancer.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The most serious aspect of neoplastic disease is the spread of cancer cells to secondary
      sites, often distant from the primary site of growth. Bone is a breeding ground for many
      types of cancer, especially those derived from breast, prostate and lung. Despite the
      enormous progress in diagnosis and therapeutic strategies, bone metastases still have a
      profound impact on quality of life and survival, being often responsible for the outcome of
      the disease. To improve the outcome of patients with poor prognosis, a deep knowledge of the
      mechanisms underlying dissemination, colonization and progression of cancer cells in the bone
      is necessary.

      The investigators therefore intend to clarify some pathogenic mechanisms involved in the
      growth of bone metastases, and to uncover predictive signs that underlie the spread of breast
      cancer cells to bone.

      Primary aim of the investigators is to deepen the role of the de-regulation of
      post-translational events, such as Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier- (SUMO) SUMO-ylation in the
      progression of breast cancer. The expression of SENP1 (a member of the SUMO-specific protease
      family) in bone metastatic and non-metastatic mammary carcinomas will be evaluated. The
      evaluation of the expression of SENP1 in bone metastases will be finalised to define a
      possible use as a therapeutic target. SENP1 could be a potential prognostic indicator of the
      neoplastic progression of breast cancer and a potential therapeutic target, but data on its
      participation in the process of metastasis to bone are still scarce. Moreover, the
      investigators try to deepen the knowledge of the interaction between tumour cells and bone
      microenvironment and the role of immunosurveillance as an important part of the immune
      response against to neoplastic cells. Finally, the investigators will analyze the role of
      autophagy and apoptosis in the dissemination and growth of metastases due to the capacity of
      autophagy to provide energy, nutrients and resistance to anoikis, and to promote the
      dissemination of cancer cells and metastatic growth.

        The population consists of 30 subjects who underwent surgery for bone metastases from
        breast cancer disease. Within the waste material collected during surgery intervention, it
        is expected to have 24 samples with an adequate content of metastatic tissue. For 12 of
        these patients it will be possible to retrieve the sample of the primary breast cancer, and
        then insert it into the study design. The control group will consist of 12 breast cancer
        samples that have not shown metastatic development after long follow up and will instead be
        found in commerce.
