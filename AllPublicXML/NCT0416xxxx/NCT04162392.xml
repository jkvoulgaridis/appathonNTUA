  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality
      worldwide. Patients require good communication with the physician to improve control illness.
      Shared decision making is a good option to improve physical activity barriers in acute
      exacerbated COPD patients during the hospitalization period.

    <measure>Health related quality of life: EQ-5D</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 9 days and after discharge 3 months follow up</time_frame>
    <description>European Quality of Life questionnaire consists of the EQ-5D visual analog scale and the EQ-5D index. The visual analog scale has a rating scale of 0-100 (0 worst possible health, and 100 best possible health). The questionnaire has 5 domains: mobility, self-care, usual activity, pain, and anxiety-depression. For each item, the subject selects one of 3 descriptive health states (from good to poor).</description>

    <description>The International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) short form measures walking, moderate- and vigorous intensity, and total PA and daily time spent sitting on weekdays. PA was reported in MET·minutes/week and days per week and was scored using standardized IPAQ scoring protocols to yield total metabolic equivalent minutes (MET·minutes/week) of PA per week. Sitting time was reported as the amount of time in hours and/or minutes participants spent sitting on a weekday during the past seven days.</description>

    <measure>Barriers to Being Active Quiz</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 9 days and after discharge 3 months follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The Barriers to Being Active Quiz is a 21-item scale that provides a measure of 7 self-reported barriers to being physically active.This instrument uses a 4-point Likert scale for individuals to identify if they would say or think any of the statements would be true for them, with 0 being very unlikely to 3 being very likely. Per instrument instructions, each barrier has 3 items that are summed for scoring, with a range of 0 to 9 for each.</description>
