    <textblock>
      Ventricular tachycardia (VT) contributes to over 350,000 sudden deaths each year in the US.
      Malignant VTs involve an electrical &quot;short circuit&quot; in the heart, formed by narrow channels
      of surviving tissue inside myocardial scar. Current treatment for VT consists of either
      implantable defibrillators (ICDs), suppressive drug therapy, catheter ablation or a
      combination of all 3.

      Implantable Defibrillators (ICDs) reduce sudden death and can terminate some ventricular
      tachycardia (VT) without shocks, but they don't prevent VT. The occurrence of â‰¥1 ICD shock is
      associated with reductions in mental well-being and physical functioning, and increases in
      anxiety and sometimes depression. Further, ICD shocks have been consistently associated with
      adverse outcomes, including heart failure and death. Furthermore, the most important
      predictor of ICD shocks is a history of prior ICD shocks.

      Therapies to suppress VT include antiarrhythmic drug therapy and catheter ablation, neither
      however is universally effective. When VT recurs despite antiarrhythmic drug therapy and
      catheter ablation, novel yet invasive, approaches may be required. Such invasive procedures
      carry consequent risks of cardiac and extra-cardiac injury.

      Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is a non-invasive technique that delivers high doses of
      radiation precisely to specified regions in the body, while minimizing exposure to adjacent
      tissue. This technique is currently, and commonly used in the treatment of cancer.
      Conventional application of SBRT has made use of its ability to spare non-target tissue,
      including for treatment of tumors near the heart. More recently, clinicians have changed the
      paradigm, by focusing radioablative energy on ventricular scar responsible for ventricular
      tachycardia. Pre-clinical studies have supported the concept and were followed by
      first-in-human VT therapeutic experience in 2017. Subsequent studies have had encouraging
      results for patients who failed or were unable to tolerate conventional treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single centre single arm prospective cohort study. 12 patients with
      ventricular tachycardia will be recruited from those who have failed or were unable to
      tolerate conventional therapy. These patients will be recruited from the cardiology clinic
      where they will already be under the care of a heart rhythm/heart function specialist.
      Clinical imaging data, medical history and previous ablation data will be collected and use
      towards planning their treatment with SBRT. Patients will undergo further imaging (unless
      recently done clinically), including: 4D cardiac CT (cCT), cardiac MRI (cMRI) and a planning
      CT (pCT). MRIs will only be performed on patients with ICDs for whom it is considered safe to
      do so. Using the imaging and electroanatomic substrate mapping data collected from a previous
      ablation attempt, a volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) treatment plan will be
      established. This treatment plan will be generated in consultation between the cardiac
      electrophysiologist, radiation oncologist and medical physicist; and will define the target
      volume (TV) of myocardial tissue to be treated.

      Once a TV has been established and verified, patients will be set up on a TrueBeam 1 linear
      accelerator where the treatment will be administered. The actual time for treatment
      administration is approximately 30 minutes.

      After the procedure, at 6 &amp; 12 weeks, 7.5 months then every 6 months, a follow-up will occur
      as a part of standard care where outcome data regarding the chronic success of the ablation
      procedure will be collected and ICD interrogation will be performed. No imaging or mapping is
      planned at the follow-up. Patients will be followed for a minimum of 7.5 months to a maximum
      of 2 years depending on when they are enrolled.
