    <textblock>
      OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of concurrent training (CT) of an eight-week on strength,
      power and cardiorespiratory fitness on muscle condition, balance, load distribution in the
      lower limbs and aerobic capacity in patients with unilateral transtibial amputation (UTA).
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-six individuals with prosthesis over 3-months were selected.
      Patients were randomly divided into two groups. Group 1 (n = 17) denominated UTA who
      performed the evaluation and training recommended by the prosthesis (bodybuilding vs. aerobic
      interval-training on the exercise cycle ergometer). Group 2 (n = 9) denominated untrained
      unilateral transtibial (UUT) amputees who after the evaluation were not included for the
      recommended training. All patients were evaluated at the baseline time of randomization and
      eight weeks after

      unilateral transtibial (UUT) amputees who after the evaluation were not included for the
      recommended training. All patients were evaluated at the baseline time of randomization and
      eight weeks after. The evaluation consisted of anamnesis (inclusion criteria), clinical and
      functional evaluation, cardiopulmonary exercise testing, isokinetic knee testing, static and
      dynamic posturography. The age of the group was 28.5 ± 7.1 years old, BMI 25 ± 4.8 kg.m-2,
      amputation time 22 ± 27.5 months, 83% were men and 57% with amputation on the left side, 11%
      used antidepressants and 11% antihypertensive medicine.

    <description>Time-up and Go Test (TUGT) - patient sit in a standard chair (40 centimeters high, 45 centimeters wide and backrest 90 degrees), trunk resting on backrest, after a verbal command has to stand up, walk for three meters (m) turn, return and sit in the chair as fast as possible; measured in time - seconds (sec).</description>

    <measure>Muscular strength- Isokinetic Dynamometry</measure>
    <time_frame>This measure will be performing before and after the innervation (8 weeks of concurrent training 3 times a week.).</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation of muscular strength improvement - Isokinetic dynamometry will be use to determine knee extension and flexion strength using the Biodex Multi-Joint System 3 (Biodex MedicalTM, Shirley, NY, USA). The isokinetic variables used were maximum peak torque corrected for body weight (%), and total work (J).</description>

    <measure>Exhaled gas analyze - Ergospirometry</measure>
    <time_frame>This measure will be performing before and after the innervation (8 weeks of concurrent training 3 times a week.).</time_frame>
    <description>An exercise bike exercise test (Biocycle 2600 Electromagnetic Moviment, Brazil) was performed using the modified Astrand protocol which recommends a speed of 60 revolutions per minute (rpm) with progressive load increase (w). Two minutes (min) and the load was increased by 25 by 25 watts (w) in a stepwise fashion until maximum effort was achieved. Exhaled gas analysis was performed using the computerized metabolic gas analyzer (CPX / Ultima, MedGraphics®, St. Paul, Minnesota, USA). The maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max in ml / kg / min) was mainly evaluated.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Dynamic and static balance-Balance platform</measure>
    <time_frame>This measure will be performing before and after the innervation (8 weeks of concurrent training 3 times a week.).</time_frame>
    <description>Static and dynamic balance was evaluated by the Balance Master System version 8.1 (NeuroCom International, Inc. Clackamas, OR). The system consists of a dual force platform coupled to a microcomputer. Platform force sensors measure ground reaction force (° / s) while performing tasks such as sitting and rising from a chair by measuring the force distribution between the lower limbs in percent (%). The variables will be the mean weight transfer index (%), mean movement time (s) and mean impact index.</description>
