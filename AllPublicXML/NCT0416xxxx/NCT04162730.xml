  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to translate the Pain Sensitivity Questionnaire, which was
      developed to determine the level of pain sensitivity of individuals, to Turkish and to
      evaluate the validity and reliability of the Turkish version of the scale on knee
      osteoarthritis patients, and as well as to perform cultural adaptation. Pain sensitivity
      assessment is used to predict treatment or surgical outcomes of individuals. IPain
      Sensitivity Questionnaire is a frequently used scale that correlates with experimental pain
      tests and is used in studies conducted in different patient groups. We believe that adding
      this scale to our language will contribute to other studies in this field.

    <description>The Pain Sensitivity Questionnaire was developed to visualize 17 situations that may feel pain in daily life and to indicate possible pain severity. The patient determines the pain severity level from 0 to 10, with 0 indicates no pain, and 10 indicates the most severe pain. The total score of the Pain Sensitivity Questionnaire and the two subscale scores, PSQ-minor and PSQ-moderate, can be calculated. The PSQ-moderate and PSQ-minor subscales consist of 7 items and the total score is calculated on 14 items. The other 3 items were excluded from the scoring of the scale as they normally indicate painless conditions. Total and subscale scores ranged from 0 to 10, and higher scores indicate increased pain sensitivity.</description>
