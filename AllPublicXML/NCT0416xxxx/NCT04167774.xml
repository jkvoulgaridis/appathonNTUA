    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the efficacy and safety of Camrelizumab in
      combination with nb-Paclitaxel in treating patients with recurrent/metastatic non-small-cell
      lung cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Camrelizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody against Programmed death 1(PD-1).
      Albumin-bound paclitaxel is a new nano-paclitaxel drug coated with human albumin. Patients
      with recurrent/metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer after the failure of platinum-based
      therapy will received Camrelizumab 200mg((3mg/kg for underweight patients) iv and
      nb-Paclitaxel 260mg/m2 iv every 3 weeks. The efficacy and safety will be observed.
