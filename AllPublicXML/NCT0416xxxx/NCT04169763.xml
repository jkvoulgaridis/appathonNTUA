    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of nelfinavir when given together
      with cisplatin and external beam radiation therapy in treating patients with vulvar cancer
      that has spread to nearby tissue or lymph nodes (locally advanced) and cannot be removed by
      surgery. Nelfinavir is an antiviral drug normally used to treat human immunodeficiency virus
      (HIV). Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by
      stopping them from spreading. Radiation therapy uses high energy beams to kill tumor cells
      and shrink tumors. Giving nelfinavir, cisplatin, and external beam radiation therapy may work
      better than giving only cisplatin and external beam radiation therapy in treating patients
      with vulvar cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and dose limiting toxicities of nelfinavir in combination with
      cisplatin plus inguinal +/-pelvic radiation therapy for treatment of patients with
      unresectable T2-4, N0-3 vulvar carcinoma.

      II. To determine the recommended phase II dose of nelfinavir combined with chemoradiotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine recurrence site (local/distant), progression-free survival and overall
      survival.

      II. To determine the levels of Akt activity (and downstream effectors such as pGSK3, pEBP1)
      and p16INK4A in addition to the presence of human papilloma virus (HPV) 16 and 18, and E6/E7
      ribonucleic acid (RNA) in vulvar biopsy specimens of patients at up to two(2) different time
      points (1. pre nelfinavir, pre-radiation, 2. while on nelfinavir, pre-radiation).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive nelfinavir orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for up to 8 weeks. Starting week 2,
      patients also receive cisplatin intravenously (IV) over 60-90 minutes once weekly during
      weeks 2-8. Patients undergo external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) for 5 consecutive days
      between weeks 2-8. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-6 months for 1 year.

    <description>Defined as the dose for which the isotonic estimate of the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) rate is closest to the target DLT rate of 30%.

    <description>Results from the dose escalation phase of study will be summarized by a tabulation of the number of patients treated and the number who experience a DLT at each dose level tested. Comprehensive safety data on all toxicities will be tabulated by type, grade, duration, attribution to treatment, and administered dose level. A patient level summary by worst grade toxicity will be included. Laboratory data and concomitant medications associated with episodes of toxicity will be summarized. Will also report the number of patients who discontinue therapy and the reasons for discontinuation.</description>
