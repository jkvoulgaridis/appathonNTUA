  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to determine the feasibility of a new supportive
      intervention, called Pathways, for patients with metastatic lung cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, investigators will first test the Pathways procedures with 6 patients to
      identify any improvements that need to be made. Then, investigators will test the feasibility
      of the Pathways intervention with 20 patients who are undergoing cancer treatment for
      metastatic lung cancer. Pathways is designed to help patients set and pursue personal goals
      during lung cancer treatment. In this study, investigators want to see if they can recruit
      patients with lung cancer who are being treated at the University of Kentucky Markey Cancer
      Center to participate in the Pathways intervention.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Acceptability: ratings</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Mean acceptability ratings on individual items of acceptability developed by study team (e.g., satisfaction with intervention, perceived helpfulness; scores of at least 7/10 on intervention acceptability) and items from the Acceptability of Intervention Measure, Intervention Appropriateness Measure, and Feasibility of Intervention Measure (Weiner 2017)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>PROMIS Satisfaction with Participation in Social Roles - Short Form 8a</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Brief measure of satisfaction with ability and participation in activities and roles (e.g., work at home, regular personal and household responsibilities, do things for family) Higher scores indicate more satisfaction with participation. Raw scores range from 8 to 40. 8 items are responded to on a scale of 1 = not at all to 5 = very much.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hope - State Hope Scale (Snyder)</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Brief measure of agency and pathways thinking. 6 items responded to on a scale of 1 = definitely false to 8 = definitely true. Items are summed for a total score and a subscale score (agency, pathways). Higher scores indicate higher hope.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Purpose - PROMIS Meaning and Purpose 4a</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Brief measure assessing one's sense of purpose and that there are reasons for living; 4 items responded to on a scale of 1 = not at all to 5 = very much. Higher scores indicate greater meaning and purpose.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Distress - PROMIS Depression Short Form 6a (Cancer Normative Sample)</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Brief measure assessing sense of worthlessness, helplessness, depression, etc. 6 items are responded to on a scale of 1 = never to 5 = always. Higher scores indicate greater distress. Items are scored online using a cancer normative sample.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Lung Cancer Stigma - Lung Cancer Stigma Inventory (Hamann)</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>measure of lung cancer stigma. 25 items with three subscales (perceived stigma, internalized stigma, and constrained disclosure). Items are responded to on a scale of 1 = not at all to 5 = extremely. Items are summed, with a higher score indicating greater lung cancer stigma. Clinical cutoff of 37.5 is suggested in literature.</description>

    <description>Goal-setting intervention to help patients identify personal values, value-consistent goals, and ways to pursue goals and address goal obstacles. Although potential refinements may occur based on aim 1 (refining procedures and content with 6 patients), Pathways is designed to consist primarily of 2 in-person sessions (~30-60 minutes) delivered when patients are in clinic for cancer treatment, with supporting phone calls and contact in between sessions.</description>
