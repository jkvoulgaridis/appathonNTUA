      The New Families (NF) program will improve quality of existing services, secure personalised
      service and early intervention in Child Health Service (CHS) in Oslo. The study will: 1)
      Measure the effects of a primary prevention family-centered healthcare intervention in
      Norwegian CHS, 2) Create case studies from CHS praxis advancing Public Health Nurse (PHN)
      training and education in Oslo and Norway, 3) Establish a model for how to include users in
      service development in CHS, 4) Enhance the knowledge base of the PHN practice in CHS
      Anticipated results: The project will bolster the knowledge base for education and
      professional practices within the service by strengthen the existing research within the
      field. The anticipated results of the project are that the intervention will increase
      maternal and parental self-efficacy, reduce the risk of postpartum depression among
      first-time mothers, reduce parental stress, increase social support, improve maternal
      attachment, improve generic health status, improve partner relationship and improve child
      development compared with usual care. The intervention research in this project can be a
      future model for service improvement in the CHS.
