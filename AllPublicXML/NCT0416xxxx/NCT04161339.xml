  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this randomized double-blinded clinical trial, 400mg of hydroxychloroquine will be given
      daily to people over the age of 65 years with moderate-severe obstructive sleep apnea for 8
      weeks. The aim of this study is to test whether hydroxychloroquine can improve endothelial
      function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sleep apnea and coronary artery disease are prevalent and relevant diseases due to their
      morbidity and mortality. The mechanism by which sleep apnea leads to coronary artery disease
      remains unclear. It is known that intermittent hypoxia, the main characteristic of sleep
      apnea, leads to inflammation and consequently may lead to endothelial dysfunction.
      Endothelial dysfunction precedes the development of atherosclerotic disease and the
      occurrence of cardiovascular events. Agents that potentially act to improve endothelial
      function may assist in the prevention of cardiovascular events. Patients using
      immunomodulators due to rheumatic diseases have a lower prevalence of cardiovascular
      diseases. However, the cardioprotective effect of these drugs in patients without autoimmune
      diseases is not known. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is an immunomodulator used in the treatment
      of rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. In addition to its
      anti-inflammatory properties, HCQ reduces cholesterol and glycemia levels and has
      antithrombotic effects. The drug is inexpensive and widely available. The adverse effects of
      HCQ are rare and occur more frequently when using high doses.

    <measure>Change in endothelial function measured by peripheral artery tonometry in the reactive-hyperemia index (RHI) scale</measure>
    <time_frame>before and after eight weeks of treatment with hydroxychloroquine</time_frame>
    <description>The reactive-hyperemia index (RHI) scale ranges from -0.4 to 1.6. Below -0.51 being endothelial dysfunction, a higher score indicates a better endothelial function</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in endothelial function measured by flow-mediated dilation (%FMD-response)</measure>
    <time_frame>before and after eight weeks of treatment with hydroxychloroquine</time_frame>
    <description>The FMD-response will be calculated as the variation in post-hyperaemia brachial artery diameter from baseline, measured in relative (percentage) change. A mean improvement in flow mediated dilatation of at least 2% would usually be required to detect a treatment benefit.</description>

    <time_frame>before and after eight weeks of treatment with hydroxychloroquine</time_frame>
    <description>The risk of developing cardiovascular disease is quantified as follows:
low: CRP level under 1.0 mg/L average: between 1.0 and 3.0 mg/L high: above 3.0 mg/L</description>

    <measure>Change in neutrophils lymphocytes ratio (NLR)</measure>
    <time_frame>before and after eight weeks of treatment with hydroxychloroquine</time_frame>
    <description>calculated by dividing the number of neutrophils by number of lymphocytes. The mean range of healthy adult subjects is between 0.78 and 3.53.</description>

    <measure>Change in Autonomic Nervous System</measure>

    <description>The data will be collected through the system of acquisition of pressure waves in a continuous and non-invasive way by the Finometer® system, through a cuffing installed in the middle finger, taking this signal to an analog-to-digital signal converter. The pulse pressure signal will be acquired at 1000 Hz, continuously and non-invasively, supine (10 minutes) in a quiet environment, with controlled temperature (± 23 ° C) and illumination. The collected data will be saved in the software BeatsScope® and LabChart®, from which will be extracted the systograms for analysis.</description>
