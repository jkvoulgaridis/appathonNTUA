  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to examine the utility of neuroimaging technique to evaluate
      pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) promotion messages for men who have sex with men (MSM) at
      risk of HIV in Baltimore.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the utility of neuroimaging technique to evaluate PrEP promotion
      messages for MSM at risk of HIV in Baltimore. The investigators hypothesize that participants
      viewing top messages developed via open contests will show higher brain activation in the
      Medial Prefrontal Cortex (MPFC) regions than those viewing messages developed by a social
      marketing approach. The investigators further hypothesize brain activation in the MPFC
      regions is significantly more correlated with PrEP behavioral intention, initiation, and
      action than self-reported message effectiveness.

    <description>questions on willingness and behavioral intention to take PrEP. Participants will be asked, &quot;Suppose that PrEP is at least 90% effective in preventing HIV when taken daily. How likely would you be to take PrEP if it were available for free?&quot; with responses ranging from &quot;I would definitely take it&quot; to &quot;I would definitely not take it.&quot; Participants will be asked, &quot;PrEP is currently available with a prescription from your doctor and research has shown that a majority of insurance companies cover most or all of the costs of PrEP. Do you plan to begin PrEP?&quot; Response options range from &quot;Yes, I will definitely begin taking PrEP&quot; to &quot;No, I definitely will not begin taking PrEP.&quot;</description>
