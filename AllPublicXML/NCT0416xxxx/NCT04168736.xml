      Prospective cohort study to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of using standardized
      educational and communication tools to assist in communication of genetic test results to
      family members. A pre and post test will be administered to consented patients before and
      after genetic counseling .

      This will be a prospective cohort study to evaluate 1) the feasibility and acceptability of
      using standardized educational and communication tools to assist in communication of genetic
      test results to family members, 2) utility of the communication tool, and 3) the impact of a
      patient focused information sheet on the knowledge of genetic testing in women who attend the
      women's oncology clinic. Genetic counseling is recommended for all women with a diagnosis of
      ovarian cancer, most patients with pre-menopausal diagnosis of breast cancer, and in younger
      women with uterine or other gynecologic malignancies. Women with a diagnosis of breast or
      gynecologic cancer who elect to undergo genetic testing will be approached to participate in
      this study. If they consent, they will be provided with two information handouts (FORCE
      sharing worksheets) and family letter template. Participants will complete a baseline
      knowledge survey prior to receipt of these materials. At a second visit, they will complete
      the knowledge survey again. Knowledge surveys will be scored and pre and post test scores
      will be compared with a paired t-test. Feasibility will be assessed by tracking the number of
      patients approached to participate, the number who sign consents, and the number who complete
      the study.

        It is estimated that up to 24% of ovarian cancers are hereditary in nature, with the BRCA
        genes accounting for 15-18% of cases. Women with BRCA mutations have an up to 65% lifetime
        risk of breast cancer and an increased risk of uterine serous cancer. With implications for
        prognosis and treatment, the NCCN and the SGO recently endorsed universal BRCA testing for
        all women with ovarian cancer. Genetic counseling is recommended for women with triple
        negative breast cancers, pre-menopausal breast cancer with certain risk factors.
        Additionally, these results have implications for a patient's family. In a patient with a
        positive BRCA mutation, first-degree relatives have 50% chance and second-degree relatives
        have a 25% chance of carrying the mutation.
