  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a worldwide health problem. It has been proved that the
      persistence of HBV is associated with the failure to stimulate an efficient HBV-specific
      immune response. T101, the Chinese counterpart of TG1050, is a replication-defective
      adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) expressing multiple HBV-specific antigens (core, polymerase and
      envelope) and is used as therapeutic vaccine for chronic hepatitis B patients. The
      application of T101 aims at inducing a broad HBV-specific cellular immune response and
      ultimately eliminating HBV infection.

      This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single dose (SD) and multiple
      dose (MD) administration study.

      Primary Objective: Safety and tolerability;

      Secondary Objective:

        1. Antiviral activity of T101 (HBsAg levels).

        2. Cellular (HBV-specific) and humoral (AD5 neutralizing antibodies, NAd5) immune responses
           to T101.

      Key Inclusion Criteria:

        1. Chronic hepatitis B patients with positive HBsAg.

        2. Patients must be receiving antiviral treatment with nucleoside analogs and have negative
           HBV DNA (defined as HBV DNA &lt;20 IU/mL).
