  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1 study of atezolizumab in combination with D2C7-IT, a dual-specific
      monoclonal antibody (mAB) with a high affinity for both EGFRwt- and EGFRvIII-expressing
      cells, in patients with recurrent World Health Organization (WHO) grade IV malignant glioma
      at the Preston Robert Tisch Brain Tumor Center (PRTBTC) at Duke.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately eighteen patients with recurrent WHO grade IV malignant glioma will receive
      atezolizumab and D2C7-IT to determine the impact of the combination of D2C7-IT and
      atezolizumab on safety. D2C7-IT will be delivered intratumorally by Convection Enhanced
      Delivery (CED) using an intracerebral catheter placed within the enhancing portion of the
      tumor.

      Atezolizumab will be administered according to the FDA-approved dosing schedule of 1200 mg
      intravenously every 3 weeks, beginning ~2 weeks after the D2C7-IT infusion.

      Toxicity will be carefully monitored for each patient while they are on study for at least a
      year after D2C7-IT treatment or for at least 30 days after the final dose of atezolizumab if
      the patient continues atezolizumab on-study for longer than a year post-D2C7-IT. Of
      particular interest will be the incidence of adverse events that occur during the first 28
      days after D2C7-IT treatment and the inflammatory events that occur during the first year
      after D2C7-IT treatment.

      The most common risks associated with D2C7-IT are effects related to tumor necrosis,
      neurologic changes (including changes in function, new or increased seizures, swelling of the
      brain, and injury to blood vessels), effects related to catheter placement or removal, and
      effects related to fluid infusion into the brain. The most common risks associated with
      atezolizumab are fatigue, decreased appetite, diarrhea, and nausea. Because atezolizumab
      works with the immune system, it can cause the immune system to attack normal organs or
      tissue and affect how they work.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have a recurrent supratentorial WHO grade IV malignant glioma based on
             imaging studies

          -  Prior histopathology confirmed recurrent supratentorial WHO grade IV malignant glioma

          -  Patient or partner(s) meets one of the following criteria:

               1. Non-childbearing potential (i.e. not sexually active, physiologically incapable
                  of becoming pregnant, including any female who is post-menopausal or surgically
                  sterile, or any male who has had a vasectomy). Surgically sterile females are
                  defined as those with a documented hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy or
                  tubal l ligation. Postmenopausal for purposes of this study is defined as 1 year
                  without menses; or,

               2. Childbearing potential and agrees to use one of the following methods of birth
                  control: approved hormonal contraceptives that do not contain estrogen (e.g.,
                  birth control pills, patches, implants, or infusions), an intrauterine device, or
                  a barrier method of contraception (e.g., a condom or diaphragm) used with
                  spermicide.

          -  Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dl prior to biopsy

          -  Platelet count ≥ 100,000/µl unsupported is necessary for eligibility on the study;
             however, because of risks of intracranial hemorrhage with catheter placement, platelet
             count ≥ 125,000/µl is required for the patient to undergo biopsy and catheter
             insertion, which can be attained with the help of platelet transfusion

          -  Neutrophil count ≥ 1000 cells/mm3 prior to biopsy

          -  Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) range prior to biopsy

          -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN prior to biopsy, s (Exception: Patient has known Gilbert's
             Syndrome or patient has suspected Gilbert's Syndrome, for which additional lab testing
             of direct and/or indirect bilirubin supports this diagnosis. In these instances, a
             total bilirubin of ≤ 3.0 x ULN is acceptable.)

          -  AST (aspartate aminotransferase)/ALT (alanine aminotransferase) ≤ 2.5 x ULN prior to
             biopsy

          -  Prothrombin and Partial Thromboplastin Times ≤ 1.2 x ULN prior to biopsy. Patients
             with prior history of thrombosis/embolism are allowed to be on anticoagulation,
             understanding that anticoagulation will be held in the perioperative period per the
             neurosurgical team's recommendations. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is
             preferred. If a patient is on warfarin, the international normalized ratio (INR) is to
             be obtained and value should be below 2.0 prior to biopsy.

          -  At the time of biopsy, prior to administration of D2C7-IT, the presence of recurrent
             tumor must be confirmed by histopathological analysis

          -  Patients may not have received chemotherapy or bevacizumab ≤ 4 weeks [except for
             nitrosourea (6 weeks) or metronomic dosed chemotherapy such as daily etoposide or
