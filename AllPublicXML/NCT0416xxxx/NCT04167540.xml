  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this Phase 1b investigation is to evaluate the safety and potential clinical
      effect of AAV2-GDNF delivered to the putamen in subjects with either a recent or a
      long-standing diagnosis of PD.

    <measure>The incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE) assessed clinically by physical and neurological examinations</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation of the safety and tolerability through the assessment of incidence of TEAE, identified by MedDRA preferred term and grouped by MedDRA System Organ Class, as well as clinically meaningful changes in clinical exams or laboratory assays.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Motor symptoms as assessed by the Movement Disorder Society's Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in the MDS-UPDRS. The MDS-UPDRS contains 4 subscales: Part I, non-motor aspects of experiences of daily living (13 items); Part II, motor aspects of experiences of daily living (13 items); Part III, motor examination (33 scores based on 18 items); Part IV, motor complications (6 items). The rating for each item, or sub-item, is from 0 (normal) to 4 (severe). The total score for each Part is obtained from the sum of the corresponding item scores.</description>

    <measure>Non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease as assessed by the Non-Motor Symptom Scale (NMSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in the NMSS. The NMSS evaluates 9 domains of non-motor of severity and frequency of PD symptoms associated with cardiovascular health, sleep and fatigue, mood and cognition, perceptual problems and hallucinations, attention and memory, gastrointestinal tract, urinary, sexual function, and a miscellaneous domain for other common non-motor conditions. Severity x frequency scores range 0-108, with 0 being less severe and less frequent.</description>
