             multidisciplinary treatment for local advanced disease;

          5. Patients must have disease progression or recurrence after receiving first line
             systemic therapy for advanced or metastasis disease: 1) Maintenance therapy after
             platinum based chemo-doublet shall not be considered as a separated treatment regimen,
             2)Patients who had received neo-adjuvant/adjuvant therapy or radical chemo-
             radiotherapy for local advanced disease and relapsed after 6 month or later, must have
             failed first line treatment for recurrent disease before enrollment;

          6. ECOG PS 0-1, with expected survival over 3 months;

          7. Patients shall have at least one leision eligible for radiation, e.g. bone metastasis,
             intrapulmonary node, adrenal disease, etc. Patient must have at least one disease
             (other than radiation target) according to RECIST 1.1: 1) Patient must have received
             radiation for 1 location after disease progression or recurrence after first line
             treatment for advanced or metastasis disease, 2) Time between first dose of sintilimab
             and last radiation shall be no longer than 3 weeks

          8. Adequate marrow and organ function as per baseline CBC/CMP/Urine test;

          9. Prior anti-tumor therapy should be completed at least 4 weeks before enrollment, and

          4. Patients with unstable CNS metastasis or require corticosteroids to control CNS
             symptoms. Patients with stable brain metastasis after radiation (3 weeks) will be
             eligible;
