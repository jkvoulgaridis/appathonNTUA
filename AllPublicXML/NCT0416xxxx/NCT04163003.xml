    <textblock>
      The overall aim of Dr. Levenson's research proposal is to test the acceptability,
      feasibility, and preliminary outcomes of a sleep promotion program delivered to 13-15 year
      olds who report insufficient sleep. Dr. Levenson will examine the feasibility and
      acceptability of the program through a randomized pilot trial (n=40) that uses a two-period,
      wait-list control design. Then, Dr. Levenson will test whether the program is associated with
      changes in sleep, motivation, and four outcome domains: academic functioning, attention, risk
      behavior, and affect. Such a broadly relevant program has the potential for enormous public
      health impact by improving sleep and facilitating healthy development across a range of
      domains among typically-developing adolescents who are highly vulnerable to adverse
      consequences.

      General Description:

      This study has two sub-studies: one for youth who experience behaviorally insufficient sleep
      syndrome (BISS) and one for youth who obtain sufficient sleep. This includes a randomized
      controlled trial for youth who obtain insufficient sleep (BISS), and a universal education
      (UE) only intervention for youth who obtain sufficient sleep.

      All participants will complete a pre-consent screen. Those with sufficient sleep will
      complete consent/assent, a baseline assessment, watch a sleep education video (UE), and
      complete a follow-up assessment about one month later.

      Those who pre-screen as insufficient sleepers will complete consent/assent, complete a full
      screening process, and watch a sleep education video (UE). Those who remain eligible after
      the full screening process will complete a baseline assessment. Then, youth will be
      randomized to the TAPAS intervention or to a wait-list control (monitoring only). After
      completing the post-period 1 follow-up assessment, participants will switch to the other arm,
      via a cross-over design. After this period, participants will complete the post-period 2
      follow-up assessment.

      Detailed Description:

      Participants. Youth ages 13-15 will be recruited from the waiting room of the Children's
      Hospital of Pittsburgh Center for Adolescent and Young Adult Health (CAYAH), and through
      other recruitment methods. Among those screened, the investigators will deliver universal
      education about sleep and conduct baseline and follow-up assessments among n=22 sufficient
      sleepers. Investigators will randomize n=50 with insufficient sleep to the TAPAS intervention
      or wait-list control (monitoring only). Overall, investigators plan to collect complete data
      on n=40 participants, after attrition.

      Baseline assessments will include: measures of sleep (sleep diary and actigraphy), academic
      functioning, attention, affect, motivation, and risk behavior.

      TAPAS Intervention. Program goals are to increase knowledge about healthy sleep practices, to
      increase sleep duration by going to bed earlier (sleep extension), and to increase regularity
      in sleep timing over the week by limiting oversleeping on the weekends. During the 45-60
      minute in-person session, the youth and clinician will discuss the youth's sleep timing and
      quality and explore the youth's attitudes and social influences on sleep. The clinician will
      develop discrepancies between current sleep behavior and the youth's values and goals.

      It is proposed that the 4-week text messaging/web-based portion of the intervention will
      begin immediately after the clinician session. Participants will receive twice-weekly
      summaries of their sleep based on diary entries. Participants will then be asked via the web
      if they'd like to modify their sleep, providing them with autonomy in their answer.
      Investigators will rely on strategies for extending and regularizing sleep.

      Wait-List Control (monitoring only) Condition. The wait-list is proposed to last the same
      duration as the targeted intervention. Participants will monitor sleep with the sleep diary,
      but they will not receive feedback or any other information on their sleep.

      Participants will repeat the baseline assessments and 7 days of actigraphy at the end of
      Period 1 prior to crossing to the other study arm. Youth will also repeat assessments after
      completing the second study arm.

      Follow-up assessments will include: measures of sleep (sleep diary and actigraphy), academic
      functioning, attention, affect, motivation, and risk behavior.

    <description>Participants will participate in the TAPAS intervention first, and then will participate in sleep monitoring only. TAPAS will consist of one in-person engagement session with a therapist and 4 weeks of web-based automated intervention prompts. The program will utilize empirically supported approaches for promoting sleep health, delivered in-person and via text-message, focusing on: tailored psychoeducation, motivation and efficacy to change sleep, extending sleep duration, and regularizing sleep timing across the week. Sleep monitoring is proposed to last the same duration as the TAPAS intervention. Participants will monitor sleep with sleep diary, but they will not receive feedback or any other information on to sleep.</description>
