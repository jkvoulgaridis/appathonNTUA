      In this phase II study, the investigators are aiming to explore lenalidomide combined with
      R-CHOP (R2-CHOP) in newly diagnosed double-expressor Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma patients
      (DLBCL)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Double expressor lymphoma is a subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma defined as having
      increased expression of MYC and BCL-2 by immunohistochemistry. Patients with double-expressor
      lymphomas have a poor prognosis when treated with standard chemoimmunotherapy and have
      increased risk of progression and recurrence. The investigators conducted this study to
      evaluate the efficacy of lenalidomide combined with R-CHOP (R2-CHOP) in newly diagnosed
      double-expressor, untreated Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma patients (DLBCL). Lenalidomide is
      the second-generation immunomodulatory drug, and its anti-tumor mechanism may involve
      immunomodulatory, antiinflammatory, and antiangiogenic effects and suppression of tumor
      necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In this phase II
      study, the investigators are aiming to explore lenalidomide combined with R-CHOP (R2-CHOP) in
      newly diagnosed double-expressor Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma patients (DLBCL), in order to
      find a potential promising way to treat this kind of disease.
