  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study intends to explore the effect of dynamic compliance guided individualized positive
      end-expiratory pressure titration strategy on reducing the level of postoperative atelectasis
      in obese patient who have laparoscopic bariatric surgery.The results of the study are to
      assess the effects of this intervention on the incidence，duration of postoperative
      atelectasis and other complications including hypoxemia etc. after laparoscopic bariatric
      surgery.And reducing the burden of postoperative atelectasis on patients and their families,
      hospitals and public resources.

Bacis ventilation: Volume-controlled ventilation mode with positive end expiratory pressure（PEEP） of 8cm H2O after induction of anesthesia，
Recruitment maneuver : Pressure-controlled ventilation mode increasing PEEP from 10 to 25cmH2O.
PEEP-titration maneuver:At this PEEP level, a decremental PEEP-titration maneuver will be started in volume-controlled ventilation mode, decreasing PEEP to 5cmH2O to confirm the highest dynamic lung compliance.
After titration:A new recruitment maneuver will be performed and the final PEEP will be the one related to the highest dynamic lung compliance plus 2cm H2O.
Randomized :Subsequently patient was randomized , the PEEP was then maintained (individualized PEEP arm) until extubation.
After discharged from postoperative anesthesia care unit：A chest CT will be performed to reassess percentage of atelectasis and compared with preoperative CT.</description>

PEEP-titration maneuver:ventilation parameters reset as bacis ventilation with PEEP still 25cmH2O.Decrease PEEP to 5cmH2O in step of 2cmH2O per 10 respiratory cycles to confirm the highest dynamic lung compliance(Cdy).
After titration:A new RM will be performed and the final PEEP will be the one related to highest Cdy plus 2cm H2O.
Randomized after the second RM.Individualized PEEP arm:maintain PEEP;PEEP8 arm:reduce PEEP to 8cm H2O.
