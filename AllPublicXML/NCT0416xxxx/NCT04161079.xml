  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Single-center clinical investigation is to evaluate long-term safety and performance of the
      Medtentia Annuloplasty Ring (MAR) in 11 patients who underwent successful mitral valve (MV)
      surgery using Medtentia's MAR system in clinical investigation 2010-040 performed during June
      2011 - April 2016.
