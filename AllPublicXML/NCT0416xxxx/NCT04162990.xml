  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The specific study aims:

        1. To investigate whether the brain function is affected by the past life experiences, such
           as lifestyle and physiology-related factors in SMC.

        2. To examine whether the lifestyle remodeling could improve SMC's cognitive function and
           modulate the reactivity of inflammatory factors, leading to significantly slow down the
           disease progression to MCI or dementia.

        3. To investigate the lasting duration of the intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although there is much evidence showing age-related reduction of cognitive function, many
      researchers point out a more optimistic viewpoint that aging is not a progressive loss. By
      remodeling the lifestyle, or/and monitoring the physical factors, the risk to develop
      dementia could be reduced. The above statements are mostly based on the epidemiological
      research, while it remains unclear how the aging modulates the brain changes. In previous
      study, the investigators have found that individuals with subjective memory complaint (SMC)
      showed altered brain changes in terms of resting-state connectivity when compared to those
      without SMC. The present study further aims to examine whether the brain function is affected
      by the past life experiences, such as lifestyle and physiology-related factors in SMC. More
      importantly, this study aims to clarify whether the lifestyle remodeling could improve SMC's
      cognitive function and modulate the reactivity of inflammatory factors, leading to
      significantly slow down the disease progression to MCI or dementia.

      In summary, the present study aims to understand how the lifestyle remodeling affects SMC's
      brain function and biochemical indicators. Before and after the intervention, this study will
      use neuropsychological tests to assess all the aspects of cognitive functions, use
      Electroencephalogram to investigate the brain activation patterns, and use biochemical
      analyses to quantify the reactivity of inflammation, toxic as well as neurotrophic factors.
      Through the follow-up design, this study also plan to investigate the lasting duration of the
      intervention and the how the neural reorganization occurs as function of time.
