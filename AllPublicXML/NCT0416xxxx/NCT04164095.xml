  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For the patients with early gastric cancer (T1), preoperative evaluation (gastroscope,
      ultrasound gastroscope and abdominal enhanced CT) showed that the tumor was located in the
      body of the stomach, and the margin was enough to retain the pylorus and non lymph node
      metastasis (N0). Lappg (D1 + lymph node dissection) and traditional laparoscopic distal
      gastrectomy (BII type anastomosis, D1 + lymph node dissection) were included A control study
      was conducted to evaluate the influence of two surgical methods on the long-term quality of
      life of patients after operation
