  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the present project, we will a evaluate a new, motivational interviewing (MI)
      intervention for increasing bystander behaviors to prevent sexual violence. In the
      intervention, motivational interviewing will be used to build each participant's unique
      motivation for engaging in bystander intervention behaviors. To assess the efficacy of the
      intervention, we will utilize the Bystanders in Sexual Assault Virtual Environments (B-SAVE),
      a virtual reality measure of bystander behaviors, along with self-report measures examining
      relevant bystander behaviors and attitudes. We will also examine key moderators of
      intervention efficacy to provide valuable knowledge (e.g., whom the intervention is most
      effective for) for further tailoring of the intervention.

      This study will provide a comprehensive examination of Motivate-The-Bystander and provide
      information about whom the intervention is most effective for. Specifically, at T1,
      participants will be randomly assigned to the MTB condition, a motivational interviewing
      intervention designed to increase participants' bystander intervention behaviors, or an
      assessment only control condition. All participants will complete a battery of self-report
      measures, including our three proposed moderators (gender, alcohol use, and rape myth
      acceptance). Participants assigned to the MTB condition will also engage in a motivational
      interviewing intervention designed to build each participant's unique motivation for engaging
      in bystander intervention behaviors. Approximately two months later, at T2, participants will
      complete a battery of self-report measures assessing their bystander behaviors and attitudes
      over the past two months. Then, all participants will complete the B-SAVE, where they provide
      open ended verbal responses to a series of sexually risky and non-risky interactive scenes
      they witness in the virtual environment.

    <intervention_model_description>Individuals will be randomly assigned to complete either a motivational interviewing intervention to increase bystander behaviors or an assessment only control condition. The outcome variables are post-treatment bystander behaviors, measured through both self-report measures and a virtual realty assessment of bystander behaviors. The primary analyses will consist of a series of multiple regressions with intervention group (0 = control, 1 = MI training) interacting with each of the moderators to predict post-treatment bystander behaviors (self-reported and B-SAVE).</intervention_model_description>

    <description>MTB is a motivational interviewing intervention designed to increase bystander intervention behaviors. During MTB, participants will discuss their knowledge and experiences with bystander intervention. Participants will then create a plan to increase their bystander intervention behaviors in the future. The interviewer will utilize a variety of motivational interviewing techniques to help guide the conversation towards change (e.g., asking questions in an open-ended manner, reflecting participants' personal values).</description>
