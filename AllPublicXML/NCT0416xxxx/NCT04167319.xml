  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is among the most feared side effects to
      cancer treatment. The development of CIPN can lead to discontinuation or omission of
      antineoplastic drugs, possibly affecting efficacy of cancer treatment. There is a lack of
      knowledge about the natural course of CIPN and to this date, there are no available methods
      for the early detection of CIPN. With no effective prevention or treatment options, the
      condition has severe impact on patient quality of life and healthcare expenditure.

      This study will investigate the natural course of paclitaxel- and oxaliplatin induced
      peripheral neuropathy using novel diagnostic techniques. Multi-frequency vibrational
      technology has provided an objective method for the early detection of diabetic neuropathy.
      Our study will test the feasibility of this method within the field of clinical oncology and
      CIPN.
