      The aim of this study is to observe the efficacy and safety of lenvatinib in preventing
      high-risk recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma patients after liver transplantation.The
      cases are from patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who underwent liver transplantation in
      the liver surgery department of Shanghai Renji Hospital. Patients enrolled in the study were
      randomly allocated in the lenvatinib group (54 patients) and the control group (54 patients)
      after stable condition.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The research is an open, randomized, single-center study. Patients with high-risk recurrence
      of hepatocellular carcinoma who underwent liver transplantation are included according to the
      criteria of admission. After operation, the regimen of calcineurin inhibitors, mycophenolate
      mofetil, sirolimus or everolimus with glucocorticoids removed at an early stage are used.
      Patients enrolled in the study were randomly allocated in the lenvatinib group (54 patients)
      and the control group (54 patients) after stable condition. Patients in the control group are
      given supportive treatment and regular follow-up. Patients in the lenvatinib group are given
      lenvatinib within 1-2 months after operation (dose: body weight &lt; 60 kg: 8 mg/day, body
      weight ≥ 60 kg 12 mg/day). The baseline data of patients are collected before allocation.
      Serum and imaging examination are checked regularly every month to monitor the recurrence of
      hepatocellular carcinoma and the side effects of lenvatinib. The efficacy and safety of
      lenvatinib in patients of high-risk hepatocellular carcinoma are observed, and the
      clinicopathological factors affecting the efficacy of lenvatinib are analyzed. When side
      effects of lenvatinib occur, the dosage can be reduced according to the patients' condition
      until discontinuation. When tumor recurrence occurs, a multidisciplinary team will draw up
      specific treatment plans according to the patients' condition, including surgical resection,
      interventional therapy, radiofrequency therapy, radiotherapy and targeted therapy (Patients
      in the control group can add lenvatinib, and patients in the lenvatinib group can decide
      whether to continue using it according to the patients' condition).
