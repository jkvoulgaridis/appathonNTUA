  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many guidelines at home and abroad advocate that arteriovenous fistula should be the first
      choice of permanent vascular access, but it is easy to form thrombus in a short time after
      arteriovenous fistula molding, resulting in internal fistula stenosis or occlusion. In this
      study, the investigators plan to screen the patients with arteriovenous fistula in the blood
      purification center of our hospital. Through the study design of random grouping and open
      label, the investigators will discuss the use of low molecular weight heparin or warfarin to
      prevent thrombosis in a short period of time after arteriovenous fistula operation. According
      to the research results, the investigators will understand efficacy and safety of short-term
      postoperative anticoagulant therapy to prevente thrombosis in arterovenous fistula.

    <intervention_model_description>we plan to recruite the patients with arteriovenous fistula in the blood purification center of our hospital. After recruitment, the patients were randomly assigned to anticoagulant therapy group or non anticoagulant therapy group. anticoagulant therapy group: during hospitalization, patients began to use low molecular weight heparin subcutaneously after arteriovenous fistula operation, once or twice a day, 4000iu-8000iu a day. After discharge, the patients took warfarin sodium tablets orally, 1.25mg on dialysis day, 2.5mg on non dialysis day, for a total course of 4 weeks. non anticoagulant therapy group: no anticoagulant was used after operation, but both groups could take antiplatelet drugs.Efficacy and safety of short-term postoperative anticoagulant therapy to prevente thrombosis were evaluated.</intervention_model_description>
