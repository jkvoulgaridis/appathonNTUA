  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicentric, non comparative study, with a retrospective data
      collection aiming at evaluating the efficacy and safety of bulevirtide in patients with
      chronic HBV/HDV co-infection with severe fibrosis injuries, or moderate fibrosis injuries
      associated with persistent increase of ALT.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic hepatitis delta represents the most severe form of chronic viral hepatitis.The
      current treatment of hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infection consists in the use of interferon
      and is largely unsatisfactory. Bulevirtide is an entry inhibitor which has demonstrated
      significant virologic and biochemical activity in patients with HDV infection in clinical
      trials.

      The ANRS HDEP01 BuleDelta study is an observational cohort, embedded in the french
      bulevirtide ATU program.

      After their inclusion, patients will be followed according to the ATU protocol during
      treatment within the cohort ATU and according to the usual recommendations during treatment
      within the nominative ATU (if needed) and after the end of bulevirtide treatment. The
      patients included will be followed during 48 weeks after the end of their treatment.
