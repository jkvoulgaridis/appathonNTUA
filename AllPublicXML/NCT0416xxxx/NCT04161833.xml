    <textblock>
      In this phase II, multicenter, self-controlled clinical trial, we will evaluate the safety
      and efficacy of OPERA® for treating anti-aromate inhibitors (AIs) induced arthralgia. The
      diagnosis of arthralgia will be based on the NCI-CTCAE v4.0 grade of ≥ 1 , A disorder
      characterized by a sensation of marked discomfort in a joint, mild pain (grade 1). Arthralgia
      will be assessed at the enrollment and every two months until the sixth month.

      Aromatase Inhibitors (AIs) are recommended for the adjuvant treatment of hormone receptor
      positive breast cancers in the post-menopausal population. Compared with Tamoxifen, third
      generation aromatase inhibitors have been shown to significantly improve disease free
      survival (DFS), and include the steroidal inhibitor exemestane, and the nonsteroidal
      inhibitors, anastrozole and letrozole. Although the AIs are associated with fewer
      thromboembolic events and endometrial abnormalities than is tamoxifen, approximately 25% of
      postmenopausal women on AI report arthralgia, skeletal, and muscle pain. The multicentre
      double-blind placebo-controlled ma.17 trial by the National Cancer Institute of Canada
      Clinical Trials Group revealed marked increases in arthralgia (25% vs. 21%) and myalgia (15%
      vs. 12%) in patients on letrozole as compared with those on placebo. The Intergroup
      Exemestane Study shown a link between arthralgia and the ai exemestane (5.4% exemestane vs.
      3.6% tamoxifen).The Arimidex, Tamoxifen Alone or in Combination (atac) trial, after 68
      months' median follow-up, showed that the incidence of arthralgia was significantly higher in
      the anastrozole group than in the tamoxifen group [1100 of 3092 (35.6%) vs. 911 of 3094
      (29.4%) patients]. Currently, evidences of drugs efficacy to reduce these side effects are
      sparse.OPERA® (GAMFARMA srl, Milan, Italy) is a new dietary supplement where α-Lipoic acid
      (240mg), BS (40mg), MSM (200mg) and Bromelain (20mg) are combined together in a single
      hard-gelatin capsule. The aim of this prospective study is to determine the efficacy and
      safety of OPERA® supplementation in a series of patients affected by arthralgia during AI
      treatment.
