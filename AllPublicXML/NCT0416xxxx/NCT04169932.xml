    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, open-label study to evaluate the safety, tolerance and efficacy of CD20
      CAR-T Cells in patients with relapsed and refractory B cell non-Hodgkin Lymphoma. Subjects
      receive a single intravenous infusion of CD20-CART cells per treatment course.

      The maximum dose was determined according to the dose escalation test. Based on the number of
      CART cells per kg body weight which was proved to be safe and effective, all the subjects
      were treated with one single dose of CD20 CART cells per treatment course. The dose
      escalation test was designed to evaluate the four dose levels of CD20-CART (1 × 10 ^ 6
      cells/kg,2 × 10 ^ 6 cells/kg,4 × 10 ^ 6 cells/kg,8 × 10 ^ 6 cells/kg). Each CD20-CART
      infusion will be carried out on day 0. Each subject was observed for at least 4 weeks after
      the last infusion. If there was no dose-limited toxicity (DLT), it is necessary to continue
      multiple treatment courses at this dose level. The detailed administration time and dose were
      decided by the researchers. The observation period was 4 weeks after the end of the course of
      treatment. If 2 or more cases of DLT occurred at a certain dose level, the prior dose level
      was the maximum tolerable dose of (MTD). If one case of DLT occurred, 3 subjects were added
      to the group. If there were no DLT in 3 cases, the next dose level would be estimated. If at
      least 1 case of DLT occurred in the 3 cases, the prior dose was the maximum tolerated dose of
      (MTD). If there were no DLT at the maximum dose, the maximum tolerant dose was the maximum
      dose.
