  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) is a spinal cord injury of traumatic origin with its main etiology
      being violence, which constitutes one of the greatest social and health problems worldwide.
      One of the complications with the greatest impact in people with SCI is Neuropathic Pain
      (NP). Pain, mainly chronic pain, has an effect on emotional states, cognition regarding pain
      and anticipation which leads to the catastrophization of the pain. This form of pain is
      related to chronic diseases that develop with pain of poor prognosis and are detrimental to
      quality of life therefore having enormous impacts on health systems. The physiological
      mechanisms of Hydrotherapy on pain are clear and there is evidence of its use in the
      management of painful syndromes of difficult treatments such as that for fibromyalgia and
      chronic lumbar pain, as well as its positive effect on pain perception. However, the effects
      of hydrotherapy on the NP of patients with SCI are unknown.

      Randomized, controlled clinical trial of parallel groups. A randomized sequence will be
      carried out in balanced blocks to assign the intervention (Hydrotherapy) or the control
      (Standard Physical Therapy), to a sample of 28 participants, 14 for each group. Each of the
      interventions (hydrotherapy and physical therapy) will last 9 weeks, for a total of 18
      sessions (2 weekly sessions). Two measurements will be made, baseline (pre-intervention) and
      a second time one month after the end of the intervention. The validated Spanish scales will
      be used: NP-4 (NP Screening), Numerical Pain Scale (END), PCS (Pain Catastrophization), SF-36
      (Health-related quality of life) and WHODAS 2.0 (Disability). The primary outcome is the
      level of NP and its catastrophization, and the secondary outcomes are level of disability and
      quality of life. With 28 participants fully measured, it is possible to have 80% power to
      find differences between the groups with respect to the primary outcomes. All information
      will be analyzed using average comparisons with 95% confidence. The analysis will be carried
      out by Intention to Treat (ITT) taking all the randomized participants. Missing data will be
      processed through multiple imputation chains. Generalized mixed linear models will be used
      comparing the standardized baseline and post-intervention averages of each group and between
      each group, obtaining 95% confidence intervals and p-values. Subgroup analysis will be
      performed adjusting confounders and interactions. A significant difference will be considered
      when the value of p is less than 0.05. Cohen´s D will be calculated to identify the size of
      the intervention effect.

      Discussion: The results will reflect the effect of the hydrotherapy on NP in patients with
      SCI. They will also permit the identification of potential changes in functionality levels or
      quality of life in the intervened population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pain, quality of life and functionality are associated with each other, and patients with SCI
      are affected by each (4, 5) thus producing limitations in the participation of daily
      activities and self-care. Pain, mainly chronic pain, has an effect on emotional states as
      well as cognition regarding pain and anticipation which lead to catastrophization. The
      previously mentioned is broadly related to chronic diseases that present pain of poor
      prognosis and are detrimental to quality of life and risk of suicide (6-9) thus having
      enormous impacts on health systems.

      The effects of hydrotherapy in patients with NP secondary to SCI are unknown which is why
      this study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of hydrotherapy in the decrease of NP,
      catastrophization of pain, quality of life and disability in a group of patients with SCI.

      The main hypothesis of the study is that (i) hydrotherapy is effective in reducing
      neuropathic pain in patients with NP secondary to SCI. Likewise, another hypothesis to prove
      is that (ii) hydrotherapy decreases the catastrophization of neuropathic pain in patients
      with NP secondary to SCI compared to standard physical therapy, and that (iii) hydrotherapy
      improves the quality of life and the disability of patients with NP secondary to SCI compared
      to standard physical therapy.

      This study is a randomized controlled clinical trial of parallel groups under conditions of
      usual clinical practice. Participants will be selected from the list of patients attending
      the Spinal Trauma Clinic of the Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Unit of a Specialized
      Trauma Center.

      Those eligible for the study are patients whose clinical evaluation and physical examination
      result in a diagnosis of neuropathic pain secondary to trauma according to the International
      Spinal Cord Injury Pain (ISCIP), and those that meet the following criteria: over 18 years of
      age and a DN-score 4 (Douleur Neuropathique-4) equal to or greater than 4 and level of injury
      below C3.

      Those eligible for the study are patients whose clinical evaluation and physical examination
      result in a diagnosis of neuropathic pain secondary to trauma according to the International
      Spinal Cord Injury Pain (ISCIP), and those that meet the following criteria: over 18 years of
      age and a DN-score 4 (Douleur Neuropathique-4) equal to or greater than 4 and level of injury
      below C3.

      Te population requires a medical evaluation, when it is finished, the participants will be
      randomized into the control and intervention groups. The patient will be informed and
      reminded via phone call about the first day of therapy initiation.

      The comparison groups will be: Intervention Group (Hydrotherapy) and Control Group (Standard
      Physical Therapy). Participants will be assessed at the following times (Figure 2. Timeline):

        1. Measurement 1 - Baseline - At the beginning of the intervention (Both groups start in
           their respective groups, for 9 weeks).

        2. Measurement 2 - At the end of the intervention (one month after the end of the
           interventions).

      The participants assigned to the intervention (hydrotherapy) will receive the treatment for 9
      weeks (2 days per week) , resulting in a total of 18 sessions of Hydrotherapy. Each session
      will be held for a duration of 45 minutes to 1 hour. Likewise, the control group will have 18
      standard physical therapy treatment sessions during the same 9 weeks, with the same duration
      for each session as the hydrotherapy group.

      The instruments that will be used are validated worldwide. The DN-4 (Douleur Neuropathique-4
      items, to identify the presence of neuropathic pain, scale of catastrophization of pain and
      intensity of neuropathic pain. Pain Catastrophization Scale (PCS - Pain Catastrophizing
      Scale) and the Numerical Pain Scale (END) will be used to catastrophization of pain and
      intensity of neuropathic pain.
