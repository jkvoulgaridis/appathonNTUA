  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The frequency of IUGR is between 3 and 10% of births. The etiologies and mechanisms of IUGR
      are multiple. The placental insufficiency, that is the defect of perfusion, is, however, the
      principal mechanism, far in front of other maternal or fetal causes. This placental
      insufficiency is also now recognized as an essential risk factor for cardiovascular and
      metabolic diseases, such as diabetes, in adulthood. The interest in understanding in utero
      development is thus further increased by the short-, medium- and long-term consequences of
      placental dysfunction. However, there are few ways to evaluate uteroplacental vascularization
      in vivo. MRI is an imaging technique used routinely in the exploration of the fetus in
      addition to ultrasound. Its safety on the fetus and the mother is largely demonstrated at
      1.5T. There are also MRI sequences used daily in the clinic to evaluate perfusion and organ
      structure in children and adults (brain, kidney, heart, etc.). Their application for
      evaluation of perfusion and placental structure, although still confined to research, is very
      promising. The investigator's team has extensive experience, in animals or in children, in
      the use of these sequences that could be used to evaluate placental function in vivo. The ASL
      (Arterial Spin Labeling) in particular is the most encouraging functional imaging technique
      because it allows today to measure an organ blood flow quantitatively and without injection
      of contrast medium.

      The inclusion will take place at the earliest at 20 weeks after the completion of the
      standard morphological ultrasound of the 2nd trimester (carried out at 20-24SA) and at the
      latest at 35 SA, within the framework of one of the 2 clinical subgroups of patients
      considered (high risk and low risk).

      The objectives of this study will be achieved by the prospective setting up of a LUMIERE
      cohort on PLACENTA.
