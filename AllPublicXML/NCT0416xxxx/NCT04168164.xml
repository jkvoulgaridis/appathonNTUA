  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare the relative effectiveness of three different treatment
      groups for improvements of postural control and for improvements of balance in these patients
      using aquatic therapy.

      Forty-five patients diagnosed with acquired brain injury, with over one year's evolution and
      independent gait over a distance of 10 meters, with our without the use of an orthopedic aid,
      were selected and randomized in 3 groups. Dry land therapy group (DT group), which received
      sessions including exercises for gait, trunk mobility and exercises involving the upper and
      lower limbs; Experimental group (EG group) , which received Ai Chi aquatic therapy; Combined
      group (DT+EG group), which received alternate sessions of therapy on dry land and aquatic
      therapy with Ai Chi.

    <measure>Berg Balance Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The test consists of sitting, getting up, maintaining the standing position and changing positions, with a total of 14 items. The total possible score is 56 points, The scores on the Berg balance scale were classified as follows: high risk of falls (0-20), moderate risk (21-40) and low risk (&gt; 41) with higher scores indicating that the person has better balance.</description>
