    <textblock>
      This retrospective study uses the Canadian LMC Diabetes Registry to describe the current
      health status of Canadians with type 1 diabetes. The study provides a detailed report of the
      demographic composition, treatment regimens, self-care approaches, health status, metabolic
      outcomes, and glycemic control of a large Canadian community-based, specialist-led cohort of
      patients with type 1 diabetes. Specific study outcomes will also be evaluated in a subgroup
      of patients using continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) therapy.
