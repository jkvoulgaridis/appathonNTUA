  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Outpatient surgical management has been developing in recent years and High Authority of
      Health recommendations in French for this type of management is a postoperative pain score of
      less than 3 on the VAS.

      The feasibility and safety of laparoscopy is well established, particularly in the field of
      gynecology, but this technique often causes postoperative pain. Techniques are being
      developed to reduce postoperative pain in laparoscopic surgery. Low pressure insufflation (7
      to 10 mmHg) compared to standard pressure insufflation (12 to 15 mmHg) significantly reduces
      postoperative pain. Microcoelioscopy (use of 3 mm trocars instead of 5 to 12 mm trocars in
      standard laparoscopy), by reducing the size of incisions, also significantly reduces
      postoperative pain.

      The Low Impact Laparoscopy is a minimally invasive technique that combines low pressure
      insufflation and microcoelioscopy which would have the advantage of reducing postoperative
      pain. This technique would therefore, by reducing postoperative pain, to improve outpatient
      management, particularly in cases of hysterectomies for which the outpatient management rate
      could be increased.

      The hypothesis is that using the Low Impact Laparoscopy concept would increase outpatient
      management rate compared to conventional laparoscopy in gynecological surgeries for
      hysterectomy.

      The study aims to compare the Low Impact Laparoscopy concept with conventional laparoscopy in
      terms of ambulatory care rates in patients undergoing surgery for hysterectomy.
