  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, open label, randomized study of durvalumab in combination with pemetrexed
      and carboplatin in eligible adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell
      lung cancer. The study will focus on the efficacy of two alternative staggered dosing
      regimens.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial will evaluated two different schedules of concurrent chemoimmunotherapy while
      simultaneously measuring immune activation, immune resistance and host factors. Both arms
      will consist of concurrent chemoimmunotherapy with durvalumab, pemetrexed and carboplatin,
      but in arm 1 the chemotherapy will precede the immunotherapy by a week and in arm 2 the
      immunotherapy will precede the chemotherapy by a week. Staggering these therapies still
      allows concurrent administration while allowing some degree of temporal isolation to better
      understand the contributions by chemotherapy and immunotherapy in this setting. Host and
      laboratory factors will be measured during treatment. We hypothesize that staggered dosing of
      immunotherapy in combination with chemotherapy can improve clinical benefit.
