  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hookwire and microcoil are currently the most widely used localization instruments. Although
      their success rate is relatively high in preoperative localization attempts, they may lead to
      consequences that negatively affect patient outcomes, such as pain because of the metal's
      hardness, localization failure due to wire detachment, and the presence of permanent traces
      of metal and foreign bodies .

      To overcome these disadvantages, we designed an absorbable semi-barbed suture to localize
      small intrapulmonary nodules (patent number: ZL201821444387.X).

      The results of the previous animal experiments were satisfactory, and it is now necessary to
      recruit 10 patients for clinical trials.
