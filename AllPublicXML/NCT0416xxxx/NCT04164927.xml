  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Significant trauma and muscular tightness often result during Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA)
      surgery and thus act to restrict tissue fluid movement resulting with lower extremity edema.
      Kinesio Taping® is applied directly on the skin for restoration of normal fluid perfusion,
      removing congestion of lymphatic fluid or hemorrhages. In addition Manual Lymphatic Drainage
      (MLD) enhances blood circulation and stimulates the lymphatic movement and unblocks lymphatic
      territories. The aim of the study was to investigate the effectiveness of Kinesio Taping® and
      MLD in reducing postoperative edema and pain in the early stage after TKA.

      Procedures: Patients who underwent unilateral TKA were randomized as Kinesio Taping® group,
      MLD group and control group. For all patients, postoperative rehabilitation program included
      early mobilization and physical therapy twice a day during the stay in orthopedic
      traumatology department. On the second day after surgery, lymphatic correction method was
      used on the Kinesio Taping® group patients and a standardized 30-minute MLD treatment was
      applied to the MLD group patients. Control group received only physiotherapy treatment.
      Circumference measurements were applied on preoperatively and the second, third, fourth day
      and 6th weeks after surgery. Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) was used to
      determine the functional outcomes on the 6th weeks after surgery. Repeated measures of
      variance analysis was used to determine time differences between groups.
