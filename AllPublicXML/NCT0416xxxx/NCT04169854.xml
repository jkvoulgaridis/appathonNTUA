    <textblock>
      Postcraniotomy pain remains a common phenomenon in the neurosurgery field. Managements for
      postcraniotomy pain are to be standardised and optimized. In the proposed study, the
      investigators aim to provide a novel regional non-invasive prophylactic strategy for
      postcraniotomy pain by utilizing Lidocaine 5% plaster.

    <textblock>
      Postcraniotomy pain remains a common phenomenon in the neurosurgery field. Insufficient
      control of postcraniotomy pain may lead to unexpected clinical outcomes. The current
      management for postcraniotomy pain mainly involves systemic intravenous or oral medication
      and regional anaesthetic injection.

      The investigators intend to compare pre-emptive lidocaine 5% plaster incision covering to a
      placebo for prophylaxis of postcraniotomy pain. In the proposed study, the effectiveness and
      safety of lidocaine 5% plaster for postcraniotomy pain control will be examined compared with
      those of placebo. The investigators aim to provide a novel regional non-invasive prophylactic
      strategy for postcraniotomy pain.

    <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) contains 19 self-rated questions which measures seven aspects of sleep: (1) subjective sleep quality, (2) sleep latency, (3) sleep duration, (4) habitual sleep efficiency, (5) sleep disturbances, (6) use of sleeping medication, and (7) daytime dysfunction. The 19 self-rated items are combined to form seven component scores, each of which has a range of 0-3 points (0 indicates no difficulty, while 3 indicates severe difficulty). The seven component scores are then summed to yield one global score, with a range of 0-21 points (0 indicating no difficulty, and 21 indicating severe difficulties in all the seven areas of sleep quality).</description>
