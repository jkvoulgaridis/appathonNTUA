  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study examined the influence of an acute weight stigma exposure on cardiovascular
      reactivity among women with obesity and high blood pressure and women with obesity and normal
      blood pressure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current study examined the influence of two video exposures, one containing scenes of
      weight stigma (STIGMA) and the other non-stigmatizing neutral (NEUTRAL) scenes, on
      cardiovascular reactivity as assessed by resting BP and ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) and
      heart rate (HR), among women with obesity and high BP (HBP) or normal BP (NBP). The
      investigators hypothesized that as a result of STIGMA compared to NEUTRAL, cardiovascular
      reactivity would be significantly greater immediately upon watching the video and persist
      outside of the laboratory over ambulatory conditions in women with obesity and HBP compared
      to women with obesity and NBP.

    <primary_purpose>Prevention</primary_purpose>
    <masking>Single (Participant)</masking>
    <masking_description>Due to the nature of the experimental manipulation in this study and to maintain validity, mild deception was necessary. Participants were told that the study was examining BP, HR, mood, and behavioral responses to various forms of media and were not informed specifically of the purpose until after they completed the study. In order to verify that the participants were unaware that their cardiovascular reactivity to a weight stigma exposure was being measured, a manipulation check was implemented wherein participants were asked to report what they believed the study purpose to be. No participants reported the true purpose of the study during the manipulation check. At the conclusion of the study, participants were debriefed about the true purpose of the study.</masking_description>
