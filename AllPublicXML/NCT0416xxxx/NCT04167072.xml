  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will compare the outcomes of patients with gallstone related cholecystitis who are
      poor surgical candidates undergoing EUS guided cholecystoenterostomy via a lumen apposing
      metal stent (LAMS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will include patients with stone related cholecystitis that are not adequate
      surgical candidates that will be treated with EUS guided cholecystoenterostomy with
      endoscopic stone extraction. Patients will be randomized to stent removal immediately after
      gallstones have been removed or to observation for 1 year with the stent in place. Outcomes
      to be measured include recurrence of stone disease and rate of complications from the
      procedure in both groups
