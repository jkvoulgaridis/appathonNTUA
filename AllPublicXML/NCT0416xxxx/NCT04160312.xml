  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, two-period, crossover, randomized, open labelled study enrolling 100
      healthy subjects to evaluate the Urolithin A producer status and to compare bioavailabilty of
      direct dietary supplementation with Mitopure™ (proprietary Urolithin A) to dietary exposure
      with pomegranate juice
