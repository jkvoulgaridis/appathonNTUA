  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mitochondrial diseases, estimated prevalence 1 in 4,300 adults, is caused by pathogenic
      mutations in genes finally encoding for mitochondrial proteins of the various enzyme
      complexes of the OXPHOS. Among these mutations, the 3243A&gt;G nucleotide change in the
      mitochondrially encoded transfer RNALeu(UUR) leucine 1 gene (MT TL 1) is the most prevalent
      one. The OXPHOS dysfunction resulting from such mutations leads to increased production of
      reactive oxygen species (ROS), ultimately leading to irreversible oxidative damage of
      macromolecules, or to more selective and reversible redox modulation of cell signaling that
      may impact (adult) neurogenesis.

      Despite advances in the understanding of mitochondrial disorders, treatment options are
      extremely limited and, to date, largely supportive. Therefore, there is an urgent need for
      novel treatments. KH176, a new active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), is an orally
      bio-available small molecule under development for the treatment of these disorders (see
      Section 1.4). The current study will further evaluate the effect of KH176 in various
      cognitive domains and evaluate the effect of different doses of KH176 (See Section 1.5).

      In view of the growing recognition of the importance of mitochondrial function in maintaining
      cognitive processes in the brain, as well as the understanding of the safety profile and
      pharmacokinetics of KH176 following the two clinical studies described above, a more detailed
      study is indicated of the effects of KH176 in various cognitive domains, using the confirmed
      safe and well-tolerated KH176 dose of 100 mg bid, as well as a lower dose of 50 mg bid. The
      primary objective is an evaluation of KH176 in the attention domain of cognitive functioning,
      as assessed by the visual identification test score of the Cogstate computerised cognitive
      testing battery.

      For this study, a 3 x 3 crossover design will be applied, i.e., with 3 treatments, 3
      sequences and 3 periods, employing a Latin square assignment. Using this design, each subject
      will function as his/her own control. This will reduce variability and thus increase the
      chances of observing true effects between treatment periods (effects of treatment compared to
      placebo). In each treatment period, assessments will be performed at baseline prior to dosing
      and post dosing, enabling a change from baseline analysis and enabling the possibility to
      compare baseline conditions for each treatment period. The treatment period in each treatment
      is 28 days (4 weeks), which is supported by the pre-clinical toxicology program. In mouse
      studies, a 4-week period was sufficient to observe clinically relevant effects.

    <intervention_model_description>The study will be a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, multi-centre, three-way cross-over study. Twenty-seven subjects, with a confirmed mitochondrial DNA tRNALeu(UUR) 3243A&gt;G mutation and with clinical signs of mitochondrial disease including attentional dysfunction, and fulfilling pre-defined cardiac exclusion criteria, will be randomised over three treatment sequences as assigned by Latin-square. Each group will have 3 treatment periods of 28 days each, separated by 14-day washout periods between treatments. During the 28-day treatment periods, subjects will receive bid oral administration of 50 mg KH176,100 mg KH176, or placebo in the sequence as applicable for the group.</intervention_model_description>

                  diagnostic criteria B-D:

        B. Headache attacks lasting 4-72 hours (untreated or unsuccessfully treated)

        C. Headache has at least two of the following four characteristics:

        female subject is of childbearing potential and does not use any of these methods, male sex
        partners must use condoms plus spermicide, or must be confirmed azoospermic after
        vasectomy.

        Note 1: Natural family planning methods, female condom, cervical cap or diaphragm are not

                  month before first dosing and remaining stable throughout the study.

                  Note: thus, mitoQ and any medication negatively influencing mitochondrial
                  functioning are allowed as long as the dose has been stable for at least one
