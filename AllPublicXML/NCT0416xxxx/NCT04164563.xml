      Evaluating impact of use of Even-Up shoe wear device for patients treated in CAM boot walker
      for an ankle fracture. Randomized controlled trial, randomizing patients into control group
      with boot treatment only versus boot treatment with Even-Up device on contralateral
      extremity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A variety of foot and ankle injuries can be treated effectively through the use of a
      controlled ankle movement (CAM) walker boot. CAM walker boots protect the injured area by
      restricting foot and ankle motion, providing a stable platform to distribute forces while
      bearing weight, and allowing the user to rollover the foot during ambulation because of a
      rocker bottom-shaped sole. Such qualities lend the CAM walker boot to provide ankle support
      that can be advantageous compared with other commonly used methods. Despite their utility,
      CAM walker boots create a simulated leg-length discrepancy (LLD), which can result in altered
      biomechanics during ambulation. Additionally, a LLD can be associated with lower back and
      joint pain.

      We have previously conducted a study that suggests a relationship exists between CAM walker
      boot treatment and pain at sites other than the extremity being treated. There have been
      several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining a relationship between the correction
      of inherent LLD with insole inserts and lower back pain. Furthermore, there has been a past
      RCT and there is a current RCT examining a relationship between the use of the EVENup
      orthotic shoe lift to correct CAM walker boot simulated LLD and pain at sites other than the
      extremity being treated. However, these studies were not conducted with patient populations
      with uniform injuries. To the best of our knowledge, an RCT has not been conducted with the
      EVENup orthotic shoe lift to examine this relationship in a uniform patient population with
      nonoperative ankle fractures. This RCT aims to assess the efficacy of the EVENup orthotic
      shoe lift, towards reducing and even preventing such pain that may be associated with this
      common course of treatment.
