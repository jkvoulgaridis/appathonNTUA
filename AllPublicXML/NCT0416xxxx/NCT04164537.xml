  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite experiencing higher rates of depressive symptoms and similar rates of Major
      Depressive Disorder (MDD), Latina (female) adolescents in the U.S. are significantly less
      likely than their non-Latina White peers to receive treatment for MDD. The purpose of this
      study is to identify facilitators of and barriers to depression treatment engagement among
      Latina adolescents across patient-, family-, and healthcare provider-levels from the
      perspectives of these individuals. Latina adolescent-parent dyads and healthcare providers
      will be recruited from community and healthcare settings. Separate individual semi-structured
      interviews will be conducted with Latina adolescents (n=12) and their parents (n=12). Two
      focus groups will be conducted with primary care providers (n=6) and mental health providers
      (n=6) who frequently care for Latina youth. Qualitative content analysis will be used to
      analyze the transcripts to determine common themes in facilitators and barriers across
      stakeholder groups.
