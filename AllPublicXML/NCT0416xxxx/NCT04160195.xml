    <textblock>
      Background:

      CD19 and CD20 are often found on certain cancer cells. Researchers think that a person s T
      cells can be modified in a lab to kill cells that have CD19 and CD20 on the surface.

      Objective:

      To see if it is safe to give anti-CD19 and anti-CD20 CAR T cells to people with a B cell
      cancer or Hodgkin lymphoma.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 18 and older with a B cell cancer or Hodgkin lymphoma that has not been
      controlled with standard therapies

      Design:

      Participants will be screened under protocol 01C0129 with:

      Medical history

      Physical exam

      Blood and heart tests

      Bone marrow biopsy: A needle is inserted into the participant s hip bone to remove a small
      amount of marrow.

      Scans

      Participants will have apheresis: Blood will be removed through a vein. The blood with
      circulate through a machine that removes the T cells. The rest of the blood will be returned
      to the participant.

      Once a day for 3 days before they get the T cells, participants will receive chemotherapy
      through a vein.

      Participants will receive the T cells through a vein. They will stay in the hospital for at
      least 9 days.

      Participants may have a lumbar puncture: A needle will remove fluid from the spinal cord.

      Participants may have a tumor biopsy.

      Participants will repeat the screening tests throughout the study.

      Participants will have follow-up visits 2 weeks after infusion; monthly for 4 months; at 6,
      9, and 12 months; every 6 months for 3 years; and then annually for 5 years. Participants
      will then be contacted annually for 15 years.

      Background:

        -  Improved treatments for a variety of treatment-resistant malignancies including B-cell
           lymphomas, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and Hodgkin lymphoma are needed.

        -  A particular need is development of new treatments for chemotherapy-refractory B-cell
           malignancies.

        -  T cells can be genetically modified to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) that
           specifically target malignancy-associated antigens.

        -  Autologous T cells genetically modified to express CARs targeting the B-cell antigen
           CD19 have caused complete remissions in patients with leukemia or lymphoma. These
           results have established anti-CD19 CAR T cells as an important therapy for relapsed
           lymphoma, but only about 40% of patients receiving anti-CD19 CAR T cells have durable
           complete remissions.

        -  Most B-cell malignancies express CD19 and CD20, but expression of CD19 and CD20 can be
           lost or diminished.

        -  The malignant cells of Hodgkin lymphoma, Hodgkin Reed-Sternberg cells, originate from B
           cells, which is the rationale for treating Hodgkin lymphoma with T cells targeting CD19
           and CD20.

        -  CD19 and CD20 are not expressed by normal cells except for B cells and some plasma
           cells.

        -  We have constructed a novel gene therapy construct that encodes a fully-human anti-CD19
           CAR with a CD28 domain and a fully-human anti-CD20 CAR with a 4-1BB domain.

        -  T cells expressing this CAR construct, called Hu1928-Hu20BB, can specifically recognize
           CD19 and CD20-expressing target cells in vitro and eradicate CD19 or CD20-expressing
           tumors in mice.

        -  One CAR expressed in this CAR construct, Hu19-CD828Z has been tested in humans before.
           The other CAR in the total construct, Hu20-CD8BBZ, has not been tested in humans before.

        -  Possible toxicities include cytokine-associated toxicities such as fever, hypotension,
           and neurological toxicities. Elimination of normal B cells is probable, and unknown
           toxicities are also possible.

      Objectives:

      Primary

      Determine the safety and feasibility of administering T cells expressing a novel fully- human
      anti-CD19 and anti-CD20 CAR construct to patients with advanced B-cell malignancies and
      Hodgkin lymphoma.

      Exploratory

        -  Evaluate serum cytokine levels and associations with anti-malignancy efficacy and
           toxicity

        -  Evaluate clinical predictors of anti-lymphoma responses and toxicity.

        -  Evaluate phenotype of infused CAR T cells and CAR T cells from the blood of patients.

      Eligibility:

        -  Patients must have any B-cell lymphoma, or CLL/SLL, Gray-zone lymphoma, nodular
           lymphocyte-predominance Hodgkin lymphoma, or classical Hodgkin lymphoma with any CD19 or
           CD20 expression on Reed-Sternberg cells. Lower grade lymphomas transformed to DLBCL are
           potentially eligible as is primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma and all other subtypes of
           DLBCL. Burkitt and mantle cell lymphoma are potentially eligible.

        -  Patients must have malignancy that is measurable on a CT scan or by flow cytometry of
           bone marrow or blood.

        -  Patients must have a creatinine of 1.5 mg/dL or less and a normal cardiac ejection
           fraction.

        -  An ECOG performance status of 0-1 is required.

        -  No active infections are allowed including hepatitis B or hepatitis C.

        -  Absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1000/micro Liters, platelet count
           greater than or equal to 50,000/ micro Liters, hemoglobin greater than or equal to 8g/dL

        -  Serum ALT and AST less or equal to 3 times the upper limit of the institutional normal
           unless liver involvement by malignancy is demonstrated.

        -  At least 14 days must elapse between the time of any prior systemic treatment (including
           corticosteroids) and protocol-required leukapheresis or CAR T-cell infusion. Thirty days
           must elapse from therapy with antibodies targeting CD19 or CD20 and CAR T-cell infusion.

        -  The patient s malignancy will need to be assessed for CD19 and C20 expression by flow
           cytometry or immunohistochemistry performed at the NIH. If unstained, paraffin- embedded
           bone marrow or lymphoma tissue sections are available from prior biopsies, these can be
           used to determine CD19 and CD20 expression by immunohistochemistry; otherwise, patients
           will need to come to the NIH for a biopsy to determine CD19 and CD20 expression. The
           sample for CD19 and CD20 expression must come from a biopsy obtained after any CD19 or
           CD20-targeted therapies such as monoclonal antibodies if such antibodies or CAR T-cell
           therapies have been received by the patient.

      For classical Hodgkin lymphoma only, a biopsy from any time from any institution that shows
      any CD19 or CD20 expression on Reed-Sternberg cells is adequate for eligibility. CD19 or CD20
      expression on the Reed-Sternberg cells that is weak or only present on some Reed-Sternberg
      cells by immunohistochemistry is compatible with protocol eligibility.

      -For all lymphoma types except for classical Hodgkin lymphoma, either CD19 or CD20 expression
      must be uniform . Uniform CD19 or CD20 expression is defined as no obvious lymphoma
      population lacking antigen expression can be present. Antigen expression can be assessed by
      either immunohistochemistry or flow cytometry.

      Design:

        -  This is a phase I dose-escalation trial

        -  Patients will undergo leukapheresis

        -  T-cells obtained by leukapheresis will be genetically modified to express the Hu1928-
           Hu20BB CAR construct.

        -  Patients will receive a lymphocyte-depleting chemotherapy conditioning regimen with the
           intent of enhancing the activity of the infused CAR-expressing T cells.

        -  The chemotherapy conditioning regimen is cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m^2 daily for 3 days
           and fludarabine 30 mg/m^2 daily for 3 days. Fludarabine will be given on the same days
           as the cyclophosphamide.

        -  Two days after the chemotherapy ends, patients will receive an infusion of anti-CAR-
           expressing T cells.

        -  The initial dose level of this dose-escalation trial will be 0.66x10^6 CAR^+ T cells/kg
           of recipient bodyweight.

        -  The cell dose administered will be escalated until a maximum tolerated dose is
           determined.

        -  Following the T-cell infusion, there is a mandatory 9-day inpatient hospitalization to
           monitor for toxicity.

        -  Outpatient follow-up is planned for 2 weeks, and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, and 12 months after
           the CAR T-cell infusion; less frequent follow-up is required more than 1 year after
           infusion. Long-term gene-therapy follow-up for a total of 15 years after infusion is
           required.

             exceptions to this criterion: successfully treated non-metastatic basal cell or
             squamous cell skin carcinoma.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential who are pregnant or breastfeeding because of the
             potentially dangerous effects of the preparative chemotherapy on the fetus or infant.

        Pregnant women are excluded from this study because study therapy can cause fetal harm.
        Because there is potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
        treatment of the mother with study therapy, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the
        mother is treated with study drugs.

          -  Active uncontrolled systemic infections (defined as infections causing fevers and
             infections requiring intravenous antibiotics when intravenous antibiotics have been
             administered for less than 72 hours), active coagulation disorders or other major
             uncontrolled medical illnesses of the cardiovascular, respiratory, endocrine, renal,
             gastrointestinal, genitourinary or immune system, history of myocardial infarction,
             history of ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation, active cardiac
             arrhythmias (active atrial fibrillation is not allowed, resolved atrial fibrillation
             not requiring current treatment is allowed (anticoagulants count as current treatment)
             ), active obstructive or restrictive pulmonary disease, active autoimmune diseases
             such as rheumatoid arthritis.

          -  Hospitalization within the 7 days prior to enrollment.

          -  Any form of primary immunodeficiency (such as Severe Combined Immunodeficiency
             Disease).

          -  Prior allogeneic stem cell transplant

          -  Systemic corticosteroid steroid therapy of any dose greater than 5 mg/day or more of
             prednisone or equivalent is not allowed within 14 days prior to the required
             leukapheresis, or the initiation of the conditioning chemotherapy regimen.
             Corticosteroid creams, ointments, and eye drops are allowed.

          -  History of severe immediate hypersensitivity reaction to any of the agents used in
             this study.

          -  Patients on systemic anticoagulant therapy except aspirin.

          -  Active central nervous system metastases or cerebrospinal fluid malignancy. Patients
             with known brain metastases will be excluded from this clinical trial because of their
             poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that
             would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.
