  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are two choices of restorations and implant abutments connection now: cemented and
      screw-retained.The excess cement, which would be difficult to completely remove, might lead
      to series of biological complications. The angulated screw channel (ASC) abutments, which
      recently introduced by Nobel Biocare , largely address the problem with visible screw access
      that may compromise esthetics. However, all of the present studies were clinical reports,
      thus the clinical efficacy of ASC abutments still needs the verification of evidence-based
      medicine with larger sample. Therefore, we designed a randomized controlled clinical trial
      study, aiming to verify the clinical efficacy of the ASC abutments by comparing
      screw-retained (with ASC abutments) single implant crowns with cemented ones in esthetic
      region.
