      The purpose of this research study was to test the acceptance and efficacy of a smartphone
      app (DynamiCare Rewards) for patients with substance use disorder (SUD) who are in active
      treatment and recovery at BrightView (www.brightviewhealth.com). Patients performed
      self-tracking of their recovery behavior (e.g., counseling attendance, abstinence from drugs
      and alcohol) addiction recovery behavior using the DynamiCare app, which follows Contingency
      Management (CM) model of incentivizing positive behavior.

      CM is shown as a highly effective, evidence-based methodology for improving substance use
      disorder (SUD) outcomes. It does so by activating the brain's reward and inhibitory systems
      through both positive and negative reinforcement using immediate, concrete incentives in a
      progressive reinforcement schedule. CM involves setting frequent (&gt;1/week), objective goals
      (usually abstinence or participation in treatment), which patients can achieve to earn
      tangible rewards (such as cash or vouchers). The DynamiCare smart phone app (iOS/Android)
      uses CM to incentivize patients to attend scheduled appointments and to submit negative
      alcohol and drug tests as they are rewarded for these behaviors. The intentions of this
      project were to assess whether use of the smartphone app as an add-on to treatment as usual
      could increase treatment retention, increase the percentage of appointments that were kept,
      and if substance use could be reduced for patients using the app.

      Patients were enrolled in the study on a rolling basis from Jan 25, 2019 to March 29, 2019
      until the desired cohort group # was reached (n=108). The intervention period (period of time
      when patients actually used the DynamiCare app) lasted four months from the date of their
      enrollment.

    <description>Study procedures related to the DynamiCare Rewards intervention were conducted via smartphone. Research visits included collection of urine samples and medical exams. Participants assigned to the DynamiCare Rewards group received: 1) the app on their smartphone, 2) drug testing devices when indicated (pocket-sized breathalyzer), and a reloadable debit card for receiving the financial incentives (the PEX debit card). Global Positioning System (GPS) tracking was used to track whether patients had attended their scheduled appointments but was not used at any other times. All information was uploaded from the app onto the DynamiCare Analytics website, which treatment providers could view. The information reported was: attendance status of appointments, the status of all alcohol and drug testing, and incentives earned. Each patient's intervention period (period of time when they used the app) lasted four months from the date of their enrollment.</description>
