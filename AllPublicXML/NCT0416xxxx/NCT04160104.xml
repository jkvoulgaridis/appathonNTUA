  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bowel preparation is closely llined to the quality of colonoscopy, inadequate bowel
      preparation (IBP) could lead to higher miss rate of adenomas, patients' discomfort and higher
      health expense. For the patients with possible IBP before the examination, it may be better
      to cancel the colonoscopy and repeat bowel preparation through modified or enhanced
      strategies. Thus, it is important to set up a model to predict the quality of bowel
      preparation individually.

    <description>Patients were asked to complete a questionnaire before colonoscopy. Bowel preparation was subsequently assessed by single endoscopist in each center using Boston bowel preparation quality score (BBPS). Both univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify high-risk factors associated with IBP and a predicting model with the bowel preparation score (BPS) was developed in the training cohort.</description>
