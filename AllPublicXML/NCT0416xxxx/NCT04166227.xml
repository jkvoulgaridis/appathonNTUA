  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the proposed study is to perform a comparative pilot, randomized controlled trial
      of hip arthroscopy versus definitive total hip replacement (THR) for the treatment of early
      hip osteoarthritis (TÃ¶nnis Grade 1-2) in patients between the ages of 40-60 years.

      The purpose of this pilot study is to determine study feasibility. Specifically, the
      investigators aim to:

        1. estimate the proportion of eligible patients providing consent,

        2. estimate the magnitude of the between-groups difference in the primary outcome (Hip
           Dysfunction and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score - HOOS) to aid in sample size calculation
           for the full study,

        3. estimate the compliance in completing the proposed outcome measures to determine the
           burden of questionnaire completion.

    <measure>3-dimensional gait analysis to provide walking characteristics (gait velocity, step length, stride length), kinematics (hip joint angles, pelvic tilt, lateral trunk lean) and kinetics (hip joint moments)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks, 3, 6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>12-camera, motion capture system, and a synchronized floor-mounted force platform will be used. Passive-reflective markers are placed on patients using a 22-marker, modified Helen Hayes marker set. Patients will be instructed to walk barefoot across an 8-m walkway at their typical self-selected walking speed, until at least five successful force plates strikes are collected for each limb. Three-dimensional joint angles and moments are calculated from the kinematic and kinetic data using commercial software (Orthotrak 6.6; Motion Analysis Corporation, Santa Rosa, CA) and custom post processing and data reduction techniques</description>

    <description>Patients in the Hip Arthroscopy group will undergo arthroscopy in the supine position under general anesthesia, with all procedures performed by two subspecialty-trained hip arthroscopists. An algorithmic surgical approach will be utilized to sequentially address pathology in the central and peripheral compartments of the hip based on both preoperative imaging findings and intraoperative findings. Emphasis will be placed on labral preservation and refixation, with osseous decompression under fluoroscopic guidance.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Patients randomized to the Total Hip Replacement (THR) group will undergo THR via a direct anterior approach. A slightly oblique skin incision measuring approximately 8 cm will be used, starting 3 cm distally and laterally to the anterosuperior iliac spine. The intervals between tensor fascia lata (TFL) and sartorius will be developed superficially, and between rectus femoris and gluteus minimus deeper. Capsulotomy will be performed. A double osteotomy of the femoral neck will be performed to facilitate removal of the head followed by traditional preparation of the acetabulum using an offset reamer and the acetabular component will be inserted. Next, the superior capsule will be released to elevate the femur to allow access to the femoral canal, followed by standard preparation by use of an offset broach and the stem will be implanted</description>
