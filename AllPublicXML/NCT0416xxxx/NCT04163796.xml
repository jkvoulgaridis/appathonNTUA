  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with higher level of spinal cord injury have limitations to using exoskeletal-assisted
      walking devices due to restrictions of trunk stability, functional use of the upper
      extremities and hand grip. With increasing sedentary time in wheelchairs, people with SCI
      have a high risk for developing secondary complications. A powered wheelchair has recently
      been developed for use in persons with spinal cord injury that provides a solution for
      placing the user in an upright, standing position while maintaining the overground mobility
      features of the powered wheelchair; providing the ability to engage in society in either a
      standing or seated position. The purpose of this study is to verify user performances of the
      upright powered wheelchair and to identify obstacles that are difficult, or prevent use.
      Additionally, the option to have upright posture throughout the day may have the potential to
      improve some of the secondary medical conditions associated with the extreme sedentary
      lifestyle.

      This study will determine change from baseline after 12 weeks of use for safety, tolerance,
      medical, physical and quality of life outcomes. The intervention will consist of 3.5 hours
      per session, 3 times per week for 12 weeks. During each session, participants will be asked
      to stand at least 5 minutes during every 15 minutes. To our knowledge, there is no existing
      empirical data on intermittent standing during the day in persons with higher levels of SCI
      who cannot otherwise stand and whether this approach will improve health related outcomes.

    <time_frame>Evaluations - Baseline/After session 18 (up to 6 weeks) /After session 36 (up to 12 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be in the supine position on a bed or elevated gym mat and beat-to-beat HR will be recorded for 60 seconds, followed by passive re-positioning to the seated position on a bed or elevated gym mat with the hip and knee at a 90° angle and the lower leg hanging off the side. Passive repositioning will be accomplished by one staff member lifting the participant's torso by the shoulders, while supporting the head and neck, and a second staff member shifting the subject perpendicular to the bed and allowing the participant's legs to hang off the side. Participants will be instructed not to assist in the passive movement during this transition, and will be supported by staff.</description>

    <measure>Pulmonary function tests - Spirometry</measure>
    <time_frame>Evaluations - Baseline/After session 18 (up to 6 weeks) /After session 36 (up to 12 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>While seated in the chair and after a mouth piece and nose clip are applied, the subject will be asked to breathe normally for 3 to 6 breaths. They will then be instructed to forcibly inhale until their lungs are filled. After a brief pause, they will then be instructed to forcibly exhale the air in their lungs and hold the maneuver for approximately 6 seconds. After a brief rest, the maneuver will be repeated a minimum of three times to ensure reliability.</description>

    <measure>Pulmonary function tests - Static Lung Volumes</measure>
    <time_frame>Evaluations - Baseline/After session 18 (up to 6 weeks) /After session 36 (up to 12 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The volume of air in the lungs will be assessed using the nitrogen washout technique. The nitrogen washout technique, which takes about five minutes to perform, will begin while a subject is seated in his/her wheelchair and after a mouth piece and nose-clips have been applied. The subject will then be asked to breathe room air into and out of the mouthpiece for 3-6 breaths. The air exhaled, which normally contains mostly nitrogen, will be collected and analyzed by the pulmonary function cart. Once a participant has completed the 3-6 breaths, s/he will be asked to take a slow deep breath in and to exhale until the lungs are empty, after which the participant returns to a normal breathing pattern. Following an additional 3-6 regular breaths, the pulmonary function cart will begin delivering 100% oxygen through the mouthpiece. The subject will continue to inhale 100% oxygen while taking normal breaths until oxygen is the only gas measurable in his/her exhaled air.</description>

    <description>Resting breathing pattern will be measured by abdominal and thoracic respiratory inductive plethysmography. The participant will be asked to wear two chest straps for a designated period of time. Signals from the participant's chest wall excursions are analyzed for indices of resting breathing pattern such as tidal volume and timing and derivatives of these measurements.</description>
