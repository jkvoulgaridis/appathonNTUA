  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Gastrointestinal cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide. Researchers think an
      unmet need exists to understand and improve treatment options. They want to see if a
      combination of drugs can help people with metastatic colorectal cancer.

      Objective:

      To see if using a combination of VB-111 and nivolumab is safe and will cause colorectal
      tumors to shrink.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 18 and older with microsatellite stable colorectal cancer that has spread to the
      liver

      Design:

      Participants must consent to sample collection protocol 11C0112.

      Participants will be screened with:

      Blood tests

      Scans

      Tumor samples. If these are not available, participants will have a biopsy.

      Before they start treatment and with every treatment cycle, participants will have:

      Physical exams

      Blood tests

      Heart tests

      Before they start treatment and every 4 cycles, participants will have CT or MRI scans. For
      these, they will lie in a machine that takes pictures of the body. For the MRI, a soft
      padding or coil will be placed around their head.

      Participants will have biopsies before they start therapy. They will have them again after 2
      6 weeks on study.

      On day 1 of 14-day cycles, participants will get one or both study drugs by vein.

      After they finish treatment, participants will have monthly visits for 3 months. They will
      have a physical exam and blood tests.

      If participants stop treatment for reasons other than their disease getting worse, they will
      have scans about every 8 weeks. This will continue until their disease gets worse.

      Participants will be contacted by phone or email every 6 months. This will continue for life.

      Background:

        -  Immune based approaches in GI cancers have unfortunately- with the notable exception of
           immune checkpoint inhibition in microsatellite instable (MSI-H) disease and gastric
           cancer-been largely unsuccessful. The reasons for this are unclear but no doubt relate
           to the fact that in advanced disease GI cancer appears to be less immunogenic, as
           evidenced by the lack of infiltrating lymphocytes with advancing T stage as well as an
           immunosuppressive tumor micro environment.

        -  VB-111 is an anti-angiogenic agent comprising of a nonreplicating E1 deleted adenovirus
           type 5 which contains a modified murine preproendothelin (PPE) promoter and Fas-chimera
           transgene

        -  VB-111 has been tested and shows promise in glioblastoma, ovarian and thyroid tumors

        -  Nivolumab is a human monoclonal antibody directed against PD-1.

        -  The aim of this study is to study the effects of VB-111 in colorectal cancer (CRC) and
           to evaluate whether the antitumor immunity induced by VB-111 therapy can be enhanced by
           PD-1 inhibition.

      Objectives:

        -  To determine the safety and tolerability of VB-111 in combination with nivolumab in
           patients with refractory, metastatic CRC

        -  To determine Best Overall Response (BOR) (partial response (PR) + complete response
           (CR)) according to Response Evaluation Criteria (RECIST v1.1) of combined treatment of
           VB-111 and nivolumab in patients with refractory, metastatic CRC.

      Eligibility:

        -  Histopathological confirmation of colorectal cancer metastatic to the liver

        -  Patients must have progressed on &gt; 2 lines of standard of care chemotherapy for
           colorectal cancer or been intolerant of chemotherapy or refused prior chemotherapy.

        -  Patients tumors must be documented to be microsatellite stable (MSS).

        -  Patients must have at least 1 focus of metastatic disease that is amenable to pre-and
           on-treatment biopsies and be willing to undergo this.

        -  All patients enrolled will be required to have measurable disease by RECIST v 1.1
           criteria.

      Design:

        -  The proposed study is a phase II study of VB-111 in combination with immune checkpoint
           inhibition (nivolumab) in patients with metastatic CRC

        -  Treatment will be delivered in cycles consisting of 2 weeks with VB-111 given every 6
           weeks and nivolumab given every 2-week until progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Disease status evaluation will be done every 8 (+/- 1) weeks after the start of study
           therapy.

          -  Patients with signs of liver failure, e.g. clinically significant ascites,
             encephalopathy, or variceal bleeding within 6 months prior to enrollment.

             with a biliary stent can be included.

          -  Patients with active autoimmune disease or history of autoimmune disease that might
             recur, which may affect vital organ function or require immune suppressive treatment
             including systemic corticosteroids. These include but are not limited to patients with
             a history of immune related neurologic disease, multiple sclerosis, autoimmune
             (demyelinating) neuropathy, Guillain-Barre syndrome or CIDP, myasthenia gravis;
             systemic autoimmune disease such as SLE, connective tissue diseases, scleroderma,
             inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn s, ulcerative colitis, hepatitis; and patients
             with a history of toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson syndrome, or
             phospholipid syndrome. Such diseases should be excluded because of the risk of
             recurrence or exacerbation of disease.

        Of note, patients with vitiligo, endocrine deficiencies including thyroiditis managed with
        replacement hormones including physiologic corticosteroids are eligible. Patients with
        rheumatoid arthritis and other arthropathies, Sjogren s syndrome and psoriasis controlled
        with topical medication and patients with positive serology, such as antinuclear antibodies
        (ANA), anti-thyroid antibodies should be evaluated for the presence of target organ
        involvement and potential need for systemic treatment but should otherwise be eligible.

             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations (within timeframes identified in
             the bullets below) that would limit compliance with study requirements.

             therapeutic anticoagulation)

          -  History of abdominal fistula or gastrointestinal perforation

          -  HIV-positive patients are excluded because HIV causes complicated immune deficiency
             and study treatment can possess more risks for these patients.

          -  Prior autologous or allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplant.

          -  Subjects with ascites.

          -  Patients with unhealed surgical wounds for more than 30 days.

             composition to nivolumab or VB-111.

          -  History of severe hypersensitivity reaction to any monoclonal antibody.

          -  Prior invasive malignancy (except non-melanomatous skin cancer) unless disease free
             for a minimum of 3 years prior to enrollment.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because nivolumab and VB-111 potential for
             teratogenic or abortifacient effects are unknown. Because there is an unknown but
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the
             mother with nivolumab and VB-111, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother
             is treated with nivolumab and/or and VB-111.
