    <textblock>
      This study is an observational study, without intervention. Using a tablet application that
      developed for this study. In addition, sensors are used to examine the possibility of using
      the system to assess the risk of suicide. It should be noted that this is a pilot study, only
      for a wider study involving a larger number of patients.

      The system developed for the benefit of this study is based on a smartphone application
      installed on a standard Smartphone device that will be found in the ED or by the examiner.
      The system collects data from five channels one by one (the information collected from each
      channel is collected separately).

      The data recorded from the various channels is saved on the tablet device. Then, the
      information transferred to the database using a cable. A statistical analysis of the data
      from the various channels is carried out in order to assess suicidal behavior.

      After the statistical analysis, correlations will be examining between the results of the
      measurements and the results of the accepted questionnaires for the assessment of
      suicidality, which will be performed simultaneously.

      Note that the duration of participation is the duration of the measurements, ie a single
      session that lasts up to two hours The duration of the participants in the study is
      determined by the time of the measurements, ie a single session lasting up to two hours.
