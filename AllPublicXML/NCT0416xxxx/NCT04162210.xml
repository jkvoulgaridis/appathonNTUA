  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, randomized study for evaluating the efficacy and safety of single agent
      belantamab mafodotin when compared to pom/dex in participants with RRMM. Participants will be
      randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either single agent belantamab mafodotin or pom/dex.
      Belantamab mafodotin will be administered intravenously at 2.5 milligram (mg)/kilogram (kg)
      on Day 1 (D1) of an every 3 weeks (Q3W) schedule. Pomalidomide will be administered orally at
      the approved starting dose of 4 mg daily on Days 1 to 21 of each 28-day cycle, with
      dexamethasone administered orally at a dose of 40 mg once weekly (Days 1, 8, 15, and 22).
      Participants in both arms will be treated until disease progression, death, unacceptable
      toxicity, withdrawal of consent, and lost to follow-up or end of study, whichever comes
      first. Approximately up to 380 participants will be randomized (320 + 60 to fulfill regional
      country requirements).
