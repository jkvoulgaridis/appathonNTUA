      Participants in prophylaxis arm will receive a weekly prophylactic dose of BIVV001 for 52
      weeks. Participants in on-demand arm will receive BIVV001 on demand for 26 weeks followed by
      a switch to weekly prophylaxis for another 26 weeks.

          -  Other known coagulation disorder(s) in addition to hemophilia A.

          -  History of hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis associated with any FVIII product

          -  Positive inhibitor results, defined as ≥0.6 BU/mL at Screening. History of a positive
             inhibitor test defined as ≥0.6 BU/mL. Family history of inhibitors will not exclude
             the participant.

          -  Use of Emicizumab within the 20 weeks prior to Screening
