  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sacroiliac joint as a potential source of low back pain is an overlooked problem. Yet, in the
      existing years there has been an increasing interest in sacroiliac joint as a pain originator
      and more attention is being paid into its assessment and treatment in the current literature.
      Muscle imbalance due to postural dysfunction involves mainly gluteus medius and hamstring;
      however the role of quadratus lumborum working on compensatory mechanism and its treatment
      effect in the management of sacroiliac joint dysfunction is yet not discovered.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Going through current literature, it is evident that sacroiliac joint dysfunction as a
      postural dysfunction is highly prevalent among adult population. This dysfunction due to
      major muscle imbalances if not treated timely can result in serious consequences later in
      life where it becomes the permanent dysfunction involving the major changes in the joint
      itself. Muscle imbalance due to postural dysfunction involves mainly gluteus medius and
      hamstring; however the role of quadratus lumborum working on compensatory mechanism and its
      treatment effect in the management of sacroiliac joint dysfunction is yet not discovered. All
      patients will be assessed and screened by consultants as indicated and will refer to
      physiotherapy with diagnosed non- specific chronic back pain.Patients will further be
      screened for SIJ dysfunction by physiotherapist.Only those patients who fulfill the criteria
      of Quadratus lumborum tightness &amp; Gulteus medius weakness will randomly be selected and the
      sample of 70 will finally be selected for intervention.Written consent form will be taken
      from all study participants.Simple randomization technique will be used through
      &quot;Randomization Main&quot; software and randomization sheet will be generated. Patients will be
      further be assigned equally into two groups as per randomization sheet.Treatment will be
      performed three sessions per week for 4 weeks with postural advice and home exercise program
      with daily record of home diary. The selected outcome measures will be taken on initial visit
      (pre intervention), session 6 and final session 12 (post intervention).
