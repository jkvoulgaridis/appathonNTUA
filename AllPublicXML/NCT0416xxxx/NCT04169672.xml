  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, single arm, open-label, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of Surufatinib combined with Toripalimab in patients with advanced solid tumors.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study population is about 200 patients with advanced solid tumors, who fails or cannot
      tolerate standard therapies, or for whom no effective standard therapy is available, or who
      refuses standard therapies. Surufatinib 250 mg once a day (QD) will be orally administrated
      and Toripalimab 240mg will be intravenously administered every 3 weeks up to documented
      disease progression, development of unacceptable toxicity, participant request, or withdrawal
      of consent. For Toripalimab, the upper time limit for treatment is 2 years. The primary
      objective is safety of safety run-in (about 6 patients) and objective response rate (ORR) of
      Surufatinib combined with Toripalimab in patients with advanced solid tumors.
