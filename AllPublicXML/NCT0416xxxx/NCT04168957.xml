    <textblock>
      KX-ORAX-008 is an extension study of patients who completed KX-ORAX-007 without disease
      progression as defined by (RECIST) v 1.1 and who wish to continue Oraxol treatment.

      This is a multicenter, open-label, extension study offering the option of further Oraxol
      treatment to breast cancer patients who have completed the KX-ORAX-007 Oraxol study with CR,
      PR, or SD, and who wish to continue further Oraxol treatment. The study contains 3 periods:
      the Screening Period, the Treatment Period, and the Follow-up Period. A Final Visit will
      occur within 7 days of the last dose of study treatment.
