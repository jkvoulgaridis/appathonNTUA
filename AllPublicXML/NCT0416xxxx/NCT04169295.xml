  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will examine the hypothesis that women who are given their personalized
      IVF-prognosis are less likely to overestimate their IVF-live birth rate, as compared to women
      who do not receive a personalized IVF-prognosis.

      Control group: At the time of their fresh embryo transfer couples will receive a document
      with a photo of their transferred embryo(s) and the number of cryopreserved embryos.

      Intervention group: At the time of their fresh embryo transfer couples will receive a
      document with the following feedback: a photo of their transferred embryo, the number of
      cryopreserved embryos, the quality rating of the transferred embryo's, and couple's
      personalized IVF-prognosis (i.e. their chance on a live birth from the current IVF-cycle,
      including the transfer of fresh and if available cryopreserved embryos, calculated by
      entering eight background characteristics and five IVF-laboratory results into a prognostic
      model).

      Primary outcome:

      The proportion of women expecting their IVF-live birth rate to be double their calculated
      IVF-prognosis, directly after their fresh embryo transfer.

      Secondary outcomes:

      The proportion of men expecting their IVF-live birth rate to be double their calculated
      IVF-prognosis, directly after their fresh embryo transfer.

      Women's and men's anxiety will be assessed with the reliable 'State-Anxiety Inventory,
      (STAI-state)' questionnaire, disseminated in coded paper-pencil format on the day of the
      fresh embryo transfer.

      Patient's infertility-specific distress will be assessed with the reliable 'Infertility
      Distress Scale (IDS)' questionnaire, within two days of the conclusive pregnancy test after
      the transfer of the last (fresh or cryopreserved) embryo of the studied IVF-cycle.
