  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized clinical trial aimed at patients with a diagnosis of residual
      hemiparesis due to ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke. Its objective is to evaluate the effects
      of the mirror therapy and cognitive therapeutic exercise, both in combination with
      task-oriented motor learning, to achieve maximum functionality of the affected upper member,

      Objective: To assess the effect at 3 months of the of the mirror therapy and cognitive
      therapeutic exercise, both in combination with task-oriented motor learning, applied for 30
      days in the functionality of the affected upper member, cognitive performance, emotional
      state, performance of daily living activities and quality of life in stroke patients.

      Design and setting: A randomized clinical trial of three parallel groups.

      Population: 152 patients with residual hemiparesis due to ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke will
      be included, selected by consecutive sampling at the Neurological Service and Stroke Unit of
      the University Hospital of Burgos (HUBU).

      Measurements and intervention: Functionality of the affected upper member, cognitive
      performance, emotional state, performance of daily living activities and health-related
      quality of life will be evaluated. The intervention groups will receive a treatment based
      either on mirror therapy or on congnitive therapeutic exercise, both combined with
      task-oriented motor learning for 30 days. No additional intervention with the participants of
      the control group will be completed.
