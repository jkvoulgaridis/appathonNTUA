      A PROSPECTIVE, RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED STUDY TO EVALUATE DEVICE EFFICACY BETWEEN THE HELIXAR
      ELECTROSURGICAL GENERATOR (HEG) VS. CONVENTIONAL ELECTROSURGICAL COAGULATION (CEC) FOR
      CUTTING AND/OR COAGULATION OF TISSUE DURING MASTECTOMY PROCEDURES

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate device efficacy between the HelixAR
      Electrosurgical Generator (HEG) and Conventional Electrosurgical Coagulation (CEC) Systems
      for cutting and/or coagulation of tissue during mastectomy procedures and reconstructive
      surgery.

      The study is designed and powered to demonstrate the superiority of the HEG to CEC in
      relation to a key efficacy measure: post-mastectomy procedure time to hemostasis. Secondary
      outcome measures include: infection, drain duration, total drain output, blood loss, and
      device related adverse events. These outcomes will be evaluated in a controlled population
      undergoing mastectomy procedures.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. 18 to 80 years of age;

          2. Capable and willing to give informed consent;

          3. Acceptable candidate for a unilateral or bilateral mastectomy and reconstruction. All
             subjects enrolled and consented will undergo mastectomy with a breast reconstruction
             procedure, if it is in the subject's best interest.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Advanced refusal of blood transfusion, if necessary;

          2. Active systemic or cutaneous infection or inflammation;

          3. Pre-existing immunodeficiency disorder and/or chronic use of systemic steroids;

          4. Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus

          5. Known, significant history of bleeding diathesis, or coagulopathy, or Von Willebrand's
             disease or current platelet count &lt; 100,000 cells/mm3, or baseline INR ≥1.8, or
             fibrinogen level less than 150 mg/dl (if received a fibrinolytic agent within prior 24
             hours);

          6. Severe co-existing morbidities having a life expectancy of less than 30 days;

          7. Currently involved in any other investigational clinical studies that could influence
             outcomes;

          8. Significant anemia with a hemoglobin level less than 10 g/dL or a hematocrit less than
             30%;

          9. Renal insufficiency (serum creatinine of &gt; 2.5 mg/dl);

         10. Females who are pregnant, planning to become pregnant within 3 months of the
             procedure, or lactating;

         11. Patients who have had previous partial mastectomies with scar tissue affecting the
             area to be resected.
