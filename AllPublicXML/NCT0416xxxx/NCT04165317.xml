      CREST: Combination of sasanlimab and alternative BCG Regimens to Evaluate outcomes with
      Subcutaneous anti-PD-1 Treatment

      Phase 3 Design with 3 study Arms (A, B and C). Arms A and B consists of two study drugs,
      PF-06801591 plus BCG. Arm C consists of one study drug, BCG.

      The study is designed to demonstrate that PF-06801591 plus Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG)
      (induction and maintenance periods) is superior to BCG alone (induction and maintenance
      periods) in prolonging event free survival (EFS) in participants with high-risk naïve
      non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) and to demonstrate that PF-06801591 plus BCG
      (induction period only) is superior to BCG alone (induction and maintenance periods) in
      prolonging EFS in participants with high-risk NMIBC.

             Association of Urology

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence of muscle-invasive, locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer or
             concurrent extravesical, non-muscle invasive TCC of the urothelium

          -  Intravesical BCG therapy within 2 years prior to randomization. Prior intravesical
             chemotherapy for NMIBC is allowed

          -  Prior immunotherapy with anti PD-1, anti PD-L1, anti PD-L2, or anti cytotoxic
             T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) antibody

          -  Prior treatment with immunostimulatory agents including interleukin (IL)-2, IL-15,
             interferon (INF)

          -  Prior radiation therapy to the bladder
