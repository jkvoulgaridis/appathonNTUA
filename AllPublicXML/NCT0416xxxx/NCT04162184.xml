  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will utilize mixed methods to develop and assess the impact of a linkage navigator
      intervention designed to connect patients in medication assisted recovery to reproductive
      health services. Investigators hypothesize that intervention participants will be more likely
      to receive reproductive health services and will have greater reproductive health knowledge,
      and ability to meet desired family planning needs as compared to participants in standard
      care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Developing effective reproductive health interventions for individuals in treatment for
      opioid use disorder is an important public health priority. In the US nearly half (45%) of
      all pregnancies are unplanned and studies have consistently found this rate to be much higher
      among individuals in substance treatment, almost 90%. There is a paucity of research on
      interventions to support the family planning care of this population. The primary goal of
      this project is to identify an innovative delivery model to address the family planning needs
      of individuals of reproductive age in treatment for opioid use disorder at an urban
      integrated safety-net health system. Through the use of mixed methods this study will address
      the following objectives: 1) adapt an existing linkage navigator intervention to be inclusive
      of all patients of reproductive age in medication assisted recovery regardless of pregnancy
      desire; and 2) assess the acceptability, feasibility and impact of the intervention.
      Intention to treat analyses will be used to assess the impact of the intervention and
      investigators hypothesize that individuals randomized to the intervention will be more likely
      to have a family planning visit and will have increased knowledge and ability to meet desired
      family planning needs as compared to individuals in standard care. If found to be effective,
      a navigator model such as this is generalizable and could be easily integrated into a variety
      of settings.

    <description>We will assess the proportion of participants in each condition that have a family planning visit with a health educator and/or medical provider within 3 months of the baseline interview where there is a discussion of reproductive health care (e.g., family planning, preconception health, sexually transmitted infection (STI) education/screening). The outcome will be measured via self-report (follow-up surveys with participants) and electronic health record data.</description>

    <description>The research assistant will connect participants assigned to the intervention condition to the linkage navigator immediately after the baseline interview, if possible. The linkage navigator will maintain a worklist with all participants randomized to the intervention and will engage participants in person at the clinic and/or by phone. This engagement process will be finalized during the formative phase and will be similar to navigator standard work across the organization. The linkage navigator will then implement the intervention (intervention manual to be revised during formative phase). The current intervention consists of 2 sessions. The linkage navigator will work to educate, understand desired family planning needs and link the patient to reproductive health services as appropriate.</description>

    <arm_group_type>No Intervention</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants assigned to the standard care group will receive the current standard of care for reproductive health care in the substance treatment setting. Current standard of care is to administer the state-mandated, Infectious Disease Behavioral Screen. If a patient screens at risk for HIV they are referred to the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) or the Denver Public Health (DPH) Clinic for further evaluation and follow-up. At this time, there is no standard work in place to assess pregnancy desire, contraception use and/or to provide information on contraceptive methods or referral to services. All participants will receive a reproductive health informational brochure. Standard care participants will have needed information, but will need to independently initiate and access services.</description>
