    <textblock>
      This study is intended to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Nerivio, an FDA-authorized
      remote electrical neuromodulation (REN) device for the acute treatment of migraine, for the
      acute treatment of migraine in people with chronic migraine. The device delivers
      transcutaneous electrical stimulation to the upper arm to induce conditioned pain modulation
      (CPM) that activates a descending endogenous analgesic mechanism. The study duration consists
      of a 4 weeks of active treatment with the device in about 40 patients.
