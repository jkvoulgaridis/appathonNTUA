      A mutilpe-center, open-label, dose-escalation Phase I clinical trial to evaluate the safety
      and the tolerability of HLX55 in patients with advanced solid tumors

      This study is an open-label and dose escalation study including dose finding stage and
      expansion stage.

      In dosing finding stage, the study will precede in two phases, (i) a modified accelerated
      titration design 2A (ATD 2A) phase and (ii) a traditional 3+3 dose escalation phase aimed at
      exploring the safety and MTD of HLX55. Four dose levels are designed for HLX55 in this stage:
      2.5, 5, 15, and 25 mg/kg/3 weeks. The 5 mg/kg/3 weeks will serve as the starting dose.

      In the dose-expansion stage, three to five cohorts are planned, and different cohorts will
      evaluate the efficacy of HLX55 for potential indications. Maximum 20 patients will be accrued
      in each cohort.
