      A single-arm intervention study assessing the feasibility of a multimodal intervention of
      management of cancer cachexia in patients with non-small cell lung cancer during primary
      anti-neoplastic treatment. The effects of the intervention is compared to a historical
      control group

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a single arm intervention study, we will provide a multimodal intervention consisting of
      dietary counselling, physical exercises plan as well as fish oil.

      The target of the dietary counselling is:

        -  30 kcal/kg/d (in patients with BMI &lt;30) or 25 kcal/kg/d (in patients with BMI =&gt; 30)

        -  at least 1.0 g protein/kg/d

        -  three daily meals of at least 20 g of protein

        -  restrict overnight fasting to a maximum of 11 hours

      The initial dietary counselling is at the first cycle of anti-neoplastic treatment. The
      patient will be provided an individual plan to meet the dietary targets tailored to the
      individual preferences and symptoms. At every cycle of anti-neoplastic treatment, the plan
      will be adjusted if needed. At every week the patients will be prompted by telephone to
      comply with the dietary plan.

      The physical exercise consists of two exercises:

        -  strength training: a progressive sit-to-stand exercise which is a lower extremity
           exercise.

        -  cardio-vascular training: a progressive brisk walking plan. Patients are prompted to
           execute both exercises twice weekly. The individual targets are set at the first cycle
           of anti-neoplastic treatment and adjusted during the trial.

      Fish oil:

      The patients are instructed to ingest 10g of liquid fish oil (consisting of 2 g EPA/DHA) or 8
      capsules of fish oil (consisting of 2 g EPA/DHA)

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Predictive and prognostic factors of change in skeletal muscle</measure>
    <time_frame>9-18 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in skeletal muscle was measured using CT scans, analysed at the 3rd lumbar vertebra, expressed as actual change in square centimeter. Using an ordinal logistic regression model, patients were ordered in three Groups (muscle wasting: loss of at least 6 cm^2 ; muscle maintenance: +/- 5.9 cm^2; muscle gain: gain of at least 6.0 cm^2). The baseline variables included in the model are age, gender, tumor stage, type of treatment, performance status, inflammatory score (mGPS) and cachexia. The possible prognostic factors included in the model is change in body weight, adherence to the anti-neoplastic treatment plan, treatment response, compliance to the multimodal intervention, number of Nutrition impact symptoms, days in between CT scans, energy and protein intake.</description>
