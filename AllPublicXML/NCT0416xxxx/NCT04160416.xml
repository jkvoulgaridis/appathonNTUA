      The objective is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of modified XELOXIRI combined with
      molecular targeted drug as first-line therapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer
      (mCRC)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is an investigator-initiated, single institution, prospective, single-arm clinical study
      to evaluate the efficacy and safety of modified XELOXIRI combined with molecular targeted
      drug as first-line therapy in patients with unresectable mCRC. Eligible patients will receive
      8 cycles of mXELOXIRI with cetuximab or bevacizumab and then the maintenance therapy until
      disease progression (PD) or unacceptable toxicity, whichever occurs first. Study evaluation
      time is defined as up to 16 weeks after the first dosing of the last patient.
