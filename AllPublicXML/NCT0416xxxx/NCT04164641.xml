      Determining whether the utilization of Noraxon myoRESEARCH Software gait analysis Evaluation
      and orthotic gait Correction can reduce diabetic foot ulceration Or subsequent amputation in
      patients with a history of a diabetic foot ulceration.

      The purpose of this study is to identify emerging abnormal structural pathology of the
      vulnerable re-ulcerative diabetic foot incorporating physical therapy evaluation as well as
      the Noraxon gait analysis to generate quantitative and qualitative gait data. Once peak foot
      pressures and gait pathology is identified, gait remedy is fabricated including either a foot
      orthotic and/or an ankle foot prosthesis. Evaluation of constructed remedy will then be
      evaluated focusing on gait analysis data to validate decreased plantar foot peak pressures
      and gait realignment towards the reduction of the diabetic foot re-ulceration and subsequent
      foot or limb loss.

    <description>Physical therapy evaluation (range of motion, strength, mobility, scale). Noraxon based gait assessment on treadmill while barefoot and with instrumented inner soles. Over ground walking assessment (with wireless instrumented inner soles, observational gait analysis while climbing stairs, ramps, curbs). Noraxon gait assessment and walking on treadmill will be video recorded for assessment. Standard measure of functionality and 6 minute walk test will be conducted. Patient will be fitted with corrective orthotics, based on usual care. Physical therapy re-evaluation. Noraxon based gait assessment and foot assessment (any areas of irritation, callus formation, swelling, ulcer formation, and gait mobility irregularities will be monitored and reassessed) throughout the study.</description>
