  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of induction of labor is to achieve vaginal delivery by stimulating uterine
      contractions before the spontaneous onset of labor. Generally, induction of labor has merit
      as a therapeutic option when the benefits of expeditious delivery outweigh the risks of
      continuing the pregnancy.

      The first part of this process is called cervical ripening. The goal is to facilitate the
      process of cervical softening, thinning, and dilating with resultant reduction in the rate of
      failed induction and induction to delivery time. Cervical remodeling is a critical component
      of normal parturition.

      Effective methods for cervical ripening include the use of mechanical and pharmacological
      methods.

      There are many induction methods: pharmacological and mechanical.

      Nowadays, induction of labour is one of the most frequent obstetric interventions, performed
      in 25% of pregnancies. Generally, better maternal and neonatal outcomes are achieved if the
      risks of continuing pregnancy outweigh the benefits.

      Cervical ripening is the first part of the induction process, which consists in relaxing and
      softening the uterine cervix prior to the onset of uterine dynamics.

      For this purpose, there are available pharmacological (mainly prostaglandin) and mechanical
      methods (including the balloon probes: Foley catheter or double cervical balloon). Despite
      being equally effective in vaginal delivery and caesarean section rate, there has been
      registered an increased risk of uterine hyperdynamic with the use of prostaglandin in
      contrast to the use of balloon probes, which may lead to an increased risk of fetal distress.

      Concerning balloon probes, various published studies conclude that it is an effective and
      safe cervical ripening method, without increasing the risk of maternal infection
      (chorioamnionitis / endometritis) or neonatal infection.

      The use of balloon probes could be established as first-choice method of induction of labour,
      reducing the risk of uterine hyperdynamic and the likelihood of intrauterine fetal distress
      derived from the use of prostaglandin.

      The balloon probe safety makes it an ideal method for performing cervical ripening at home
      (out-patient) in low-risk pregnancies, increasing the satisfaction of women who desire it and
      reducing the economic cost for the hospital.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness and safety of double balloon
      catheter (CRB-Cook®) in induction of labour.

      The main objective is to provide evidence that there are no differences in caesarean section
      rate between induction of labour performed with Cook double balloon catheter in out-patient
      and in-patient compared with a cohort of induction of labour with pharmacological methods
      (dinoprostone and misoprostol).

      Two clinical studies will be carried out for this purpose:

        1. Prospective cohort observational study

        2. Historical case-control study
