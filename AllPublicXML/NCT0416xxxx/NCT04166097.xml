      This study aims to show that a 6-week program designed specifically for women can lead to
      sustainable behavior change and improvement in heart disease risk factors over one year among
      a cohort of 46 female employees recruited from within the Heart Hospital at North Shore
      University Hospital (NSUH). The program is adapted from book &quot;Heart Smart for Women: Six S.
      T. E. P. S in Six Weeks to Heart-Healthy Living,&quot; written by Northwell cardiologists Dr.
      Jennifer H. Mieres and Dr. Stacey E. Rosen.

      The 6-week intervention will include a weekly didactic session, with each week devoted to a
      different theme (food, exercise, etc). The intervention will follow the program outlined in
      the book. We will also be using Yammer, an online discussion group part of the Office 365
      suite, to distribute materials and encourage conversations surrounding the theme of the week.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart Disease is the leading cause of death in women in the United State. Nine out of ten
      women have one or more risk factors for heart disease and one in three women will die of
      heart disease. However, most women are unaware of these statistics. As a result, women are
      less likely than men to recognize the symptoms of a heart attack and are more likely than men
      to delay in seeking help. The best ways to educate women about heart disease and change their
      behavior to prevent heart disease are unknown.

      More than 80% of heart disease is preventable but requires both knowledge of risk factors and
      adherence to lifestyle changes. This program is designed to address these challenges in
      women, where this is a particular unmet need.

      Some prior community and workplace-based studies have demonstrated short term improvements in
      modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease. A community based primary prevention
      program among disadvantaged women decreased the rate of metabolic syndrome, anxiety,
      depression and stress.

      The economic burden of heart disease on employers is significant although workplace employee
      wellness programs have not been shown to decrease employer costs. The impact of employee
      wellness programs on clinical outcome measures have been inconsistent.

      This program is designed to educate female employees about their heart disease risk factors
      and provide tactical support to improve their heart health. Once validated, the program can
      be rolled out to other employees and to the community.

Study protocol will be reviewed and record keeping done every 3 months to ensure that all employee/participant information is kept confidential.
Password-protected database will be used to enter all data - it will contain only de-identified information. Moreover, the online discussion group, Yammer, activity will be reviewed to ensure participant confidentiality is maintained and that unauthorized disclosure of information outside the private group is prevented.</ipd_description>
