  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major lung resection is associated with high post-operative morbidity and mortality and
      significant long-term decreased functional capacity, especially due to cardiorespiratory
      complications.

      RV (Right Ventricle) ejection, pulmonary artery pressure and tone are tightly coupled. The RV
      is exquisitely sensitive to changes in afterload. When pulmonary vascular reserve is
      compromised RV ejection may be also compromised, increasing right atrial pressure and
      limiting maximal cardiac output. Acute increase in RV outflow resistance, as may occur with
      acute pulmonary embolism will cause acute RV dilatation and, by ventricular interdependence,
      markedly decreased LV (Left Ventricle) compliance, rapidly spiraling to acute cardiogenic
      shock and death.

      Most of the studies on RV function after lung resection are small and have found different
      results, and sometimes conflicting findings. As far as the investigators know, there are no
      data on the incidence of the RV dysfunction after major lung resection
      (pneumonectomy/bilobectomy) and it's not clear if there is some direct association between
      the RV dysfunction and post-operative complications. If so, early detection of RV dysfunction
      after major lung resection could provide the opportunity for interventional therapy with
      consequent possible improvement of these patients' prognosis.

      The aim of this study is to identify the incidence of early RV systolic dysfunction (defined
      as Tricuspid Annular Plane Systolic Excursion (TAPSE) &lt; 17 cm, S' (TDI) &lt; 10 cm/s) and
      estimate the RV-PA (Right Ventricle-Pulmonary Artery) coupling as indicated by Guazzi et all.
      (TAPSE/PAPs ratio, where PAPs is the Systolic Pulmonary Artery Pressure) after major lung
      resection (bilobectomy and pneumonectomy) using echocardiography, and to assess if these
      modifications (RV dysfunction and RV-PA coupling) may be associated with post-operative
      cardiopulmonary complications occurring during the hospitalization period. Investigators also
      intend to evaluate if these changes are associated with impaired functional capacity at 3
      months after surgery.
