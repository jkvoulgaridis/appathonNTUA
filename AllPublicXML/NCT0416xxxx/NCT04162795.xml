  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, researchers are primarily interested in evaluating the level of agreement of
      cooling sensation provided by this chewable, flavored, allergy medicine. Participants joining
      this study will receive one test drug tablet and be asked to chew completely before
      swallowing the drug. A questionnaire will be used to collect the feedback from participants.
      The study will involve only one (1) visit and participant will stay in this study for about
      60-75 minutes to evaluate the cooling sensation as well as other sensory attributes perceived
      in the mouth, nose and throat.
