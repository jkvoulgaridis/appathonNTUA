        PART I:

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients will only be included in the study if they meet all of the following criteria:

          -  Patients who have given informed consent

          -  Patients at least 18 years old

          -  Patients with local, locally advanced or metastatic disease of a malignant solid
             tumor. In order to minimize partial volume effect the diameter of at least 1 tumor
             lesion should be ≥ 10 mm in short axis for invaded adenopathies and ≥ 10 mm in long
             axis for all other types of lesions.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients will not be included in the study if one of the following criteria applies:

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 3 or higher

          -  Pregnant patients

          -  Breast feeding patients

          -  Patients with abnormal liver (Bilirubin ≥1.5 x ULN, ALT (SGPT) ≥3 x ULN) or kidney
             function (Serum creatinine clearance ≤50 ml/min as calculated with Cockcroft-Gault
             formula)

          -  Patients with recent (&lt; 1 week) gastrointestinal disorders (CTCAE v4.0 grade 3 or 4)

             which in the opinion of the investigator would either compromise patient safety or
             interfere with the evaluation of the safety of the test radiopharmaceutical

          -  Patients who cannot communicate reliably with the investigator

          -  Patients who are unlikely to cooperate with the requirements of the study

          -  Patients who are unwilling and/or unable to give informed consent

             head-and-neck cancer or melanoma, who is planned for resection or surgical biopsy of

             tumor to be resected or biopsied should be ≥ 10 mm in short axis for invaded
             adenopathies and ≥ 10 mm in long axis for all other types of lesions.
