          -  Subjects whose first symptom of ALS occurred within 3 years of the time of providing
             written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who have the presence or history of any clinically significant disease
             (except ALS) that could interfere with the objectives of the study (the assessment of
             safety and efficacy) or the safety of the subject, as judged by the Investigator.

          -  Subjects of childbearing potential unwilling to use acceptable method of contraception
             from the screening visit until 3 months after the last dose of study medication.

             months before the screening visit.

          -  Subjects who have ALT or AST elevations greater than 2 times the ULN at screening.

          -  Subjects with a Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) &lt;30 mL/Min Per 1.73 m2.

          -  Subjects with history of hypersensitivity to edaravone, any of the additives or
             inactive ingredients of edaravone, or sulfites.

          -  Subjects with hereditary fructose intolerance.

          -  Subjects who participated in another study and were administered an investigational
             product within 1 month or 5 half-lives of the investigational agent, whichever is
