  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this explorative study is to evaluate whether EpiCheck can be used as a predictor
      of tumour response to short-term, intensive chemoresection with Mitomycin.

      The study will be conducted as an exploratory, prospective observational study. Participants
      consists of patients referred to short-term, intensive chemoresection due to recurrent NMIBC.
      The treatment adhere to the regimen described in the NICSA trial with the ClinicalTrials.gov
      identifier NCT03348969. Treatment consists of short-term, intensive chemoresection with
      Mitomycin; 40 mg is administered intravesically three times a week for two weeks. To evaluate
      tumour response, an early cystoscopy is performed in the outpatient clinic one to two months
      after treatment completion. No visible tumour and residual tumour with benign histology is
      considered complete response. Residual tumour tissue with neoplastic histology is considered
      incomplete response and will be treated with TURBT or tumour fulguration. Subsequently
      patients continue a standardized follow-up program as Danish guidelines prescribe which is
      initiated after four months.
