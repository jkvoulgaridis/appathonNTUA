  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to show the blood pressure lowering effect of
      aprocitentan, a new drug, when added to the background antihypertensive therapy in patients
      with uncontrolled blood pressure and chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 3 or 4. Participation
      in the research study will last up to 21 weeks (about 5 months).
