    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in developed
      countries. The consequent healthcare costs in Europe alone are estimated at 196,000 million
      euros annually, approximately 54% of the total investment in health, resulting in
      productivity losses of 24% [1-3]. In recent years, the impact of CVD in non-Western countries
      has been growing [4,5]; therefore, prevention is presented as a primordial tool to improve
      quality of life and patient survival [6,7]. Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is defined as a
      multidisciplinary program of clinical application of preventive measures for risk reduction
      and global and long-term care of the cardiac patient. In secondary prevention, it is shown to
      reduce the morbimortality by almost 50% in patients with heart disease. However, the
      participation of patients in cardiac rehabilitation remains low, especially among the
      following groups: the elderly, women and patients with a low socioeconomic profile. According
      to the latest Euroaspire V data, participation in CR programs in Spain is around 50%. The
      Reureca registry reports that only 10% of patients with a CR indication attend the programs.
      Therefore, new technologies within the health field, specifically within cardiac
      rehabilitation programs through the use of virtual reality (VR) and video games, are shown as
      promising aids with the aim of increasing adherence, satisfaction with programs and
      participation rates, offering the ability to perform physical exercise [8-11]. Virtual
      reality is a simulation of a real or imaginary environment created by a computer system,
      which allows the user to feel immersed and to interact with objects in that environment
      [12-14]. Thus, the basic elements that constitute a VR system are simulation, interaction and
      immersion [15]. Moreover, the creation of more adaptable and accessible videogame platforms
      has meant that the phenomenon of technological expansion can be understood not only as a form
      of leisure but also as an important means of learning and skills training, especially in
      people with motor, cognitive and sensory (neurological and non-neurological) deficits [16].
      In contrast to traditional CR procedures, which can be repetitive, causing a loss of interest
      on the part of patients, video games and VR systems offer the opportunity to participate in
      enjoyable tasks with a therapeutic purpose through physical interaction with the game. The
      design of exercise-based videogames (exergames) provides the possibility of practicing
      physical skills in an entertaining way and of adjusting the game according to the abilities
      of the subject and the level of intensity. In addition, it is known that the level of
      enjoyment of an activity has been identified as one of the predictive factors of the
      effectiveness of an exercise program, and for this reason, interactive technology based on
      exercise is becoming the all-time most popular strategy for the implementation of physical
      activity [17-23]. It is important to emphasize that VR allows the creation of environments
      suitable for activities related to CR. The users of these systems can develop simulated tasks
      and activities in a safe way, since the clinicians have the capacity to control the duration
      and intensity of the exercise and, in this way, to control and supervise the delivery of
      stimuli in the virtual environment [24]. Furthermore, knowledge of results regarding the
      performance of the task in real time, gained through extrinsic feedback, as well as the
      playful nature of the activities proposed through VR and videogame devices, generates a
      competitiveness and challenge component that further increases the degree of patient
      motivation. In this regard, Klasen et al. [25] point out that this increase in motivation is
      related to the influence of videogames on activation of the mesolimbic dopaminergic pathways
      and their repercussions on the reward system of the brain. All this promotes active
      participation on the part of the patient and thus increases adherence to the rehabilitation
      treatment. The aim of the present work is to carry out a RCT to provide information on the
      application of VR and videogame systems within CR programs in patients with cardiac diseases.
