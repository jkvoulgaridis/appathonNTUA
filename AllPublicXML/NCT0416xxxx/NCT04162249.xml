    <textblock>
      The POWER FAST I pilot study is a unicentric, observational, non-randomized controlled
      clinical study. In the control group pulmonary veins isolation was performded in consecutive
      patients with irrigated radiofrequency cateters without contact force-sensing capabilities
      and using conventional low-power and long-duration radiofrequency parameters (20-30 W, 30-60
      s) under continuous intracardiac-echo image and esophageal temperature monitoring. The study
      group consist of consecutive patients distributed in three succesive subgroups. In the study
      group radiofrequency ablation was performed using a point-by-point technique with
      contact-force catheters with different high-power and short-duration parameters:

        -  Subgroup 50W: power 50 W, application duration ≤ 30 s, target lesion index: LSI ≥ 5 or
           Ablation Index ≥ 350 (posterior wall) or ≥400 (anterior wall).

        -  Subgroup 60W: power 60 W, application duration 7-10 s, contact force ≥5 g.

        -  Subgroup 70W: power 70 W, application duration 9 s, contact force ≥5 g.

      The safety endpoint was evaluated with systematic esophageal endoscopy performed &lt;72 h after
      the index procedure. The efficacy endpoint was evaluated:

        -  during the ablation procedure: acute procedural efficacy, firts-pass isolation of
           ipsilateral pulmonary veins, total radiofrequency and procedural time, acute
           reconnections and dormant conduction,

        -  during the follow-up: any atrial tachycardias documented and longer than 30 s were
           considered recurrences.

    <description>Pulmonary veins ablation.
Anterior aspect: power 30 W, catheter dragging (30 s per point).
Posterior aspect: point-by-point ablation using 30 W/30 s applications. If esophageal temperature measured with two independent esophageal probes exceeded 49 ºC radiofrequency settings were modified to 20 W/ 60 s and the number of radiofrequency applications minimized in areas with esophageal temperature rise.
Al procedures were performed with continuos intracardiac echo image and esophageal temperature monitoring.</description>
