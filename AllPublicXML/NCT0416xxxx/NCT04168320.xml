  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study uses an unconventional radiotherapy schedule developed at our institute,
      consisting of a short course high-dose partial irradiation targeting exclusively the hypoxic
      segment of a bulky tumors, which in our preliminary study has shown to be capable of inducing
      abscopal and bystander effects. This approach is delivered by using a stereotactic
      radiotherapy technique so as to spare nearby organs at risk including the peritumoral immune
      microenvironment from irradiation as much as possible. Our approach consists of a single or
      up to 3 radiotherapy doses of at least 10 Gy per fraction prescribed to the 70% isodose line
      encompassing the hypoxic target volume. Radiotherapy will be administered at the precise
      timing determined specifically for each patient based on the serially mapped homeostatic
      immune fluctuations by monitoring the blood levels of the cytokines and inflammatory markers
      over the 2 weeks prior to irradiation. This is done in order to synchronize the radiation
      treatment with the favorable, most active anti-tumor immune system phase, so as to stimulate
      and increase anti-tumor immune system activity.

      This is a monocentric, prospective, two-arm, phase I proof of principle study in which the
      investigator will enroll subjects with oligometastatic and/or locally advanced (N+) cancers
      with at least one &quot;bulky&quot; lesion (maximum diameter of at least 6 cm or greater). Patients
      with life expectancy of at least 3 months, who are ineligible for systemic therapy or
      experience disease progression with systemic therapies will be included. Radiotherapy will be
      administered to arm 1 at an estimated &quot;less favorable time-position in immune cycle&quot;, while
      the second arm will have it administered at the estimated &quot;most favorable time-position in
      immune cycle&quot;.

      The primary endpoint will be the response rate of the non-targeted effects both bystander
      (local, at the level of the partially treated bulky tumor) and abscopal (distant, at the
      non-treated metastatic sites), defined as a tumor regression of at least 30%. Secondary
      endpoints will be safety, survival and analysis of the best timing for the administration of
      radiotherapy.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of our new method for high dose
      partial irradiation of the hypoxic tumor segment of bulky masses in terms of the intentional
      induction of the non-targeted effects of radiotherapy in patients with metastatic or locally
      advanced (N+) malignancies who are ineligible for, or currently in progression under systemic
      therapies. By mapping the homeostatic immune fluctuations serially, and by monitoring the
      blood levels of the cytokines and inflammatory markers over the 2 weeks prior to irradiation,
      radiotherapy will be administered at the precise, optimal timing in order to stimulate and to
      increase anti-tumor immune system activity.

      Primary endpoint: bystander (local) and abscopal (distant, metastatic or lymph nodal sites)
      response rates.

      Secondary endpoints: overall safety and tolerability profile of our new radiotherapy method,
      progression-free survival rates at local and distant sites, as well as overall survival
      rates, efficacy of this regimen in palliating symptoms, neoadjuvant potential of this novel
      radiotherapy for unresectable/borderline resectable bulky lesions, optimal timing for
      radiotherapy to be administered based on the fluctuating/oscillating suppressed anti-tumor
      immune response.

      This monocentric, two-arm prospective phase I proof of principle trial will enroll 26
      patients from a single institution: KABEG Klinikum Klagenfurt am Woerthersee, Austria.

      During the visit, and after clinical examination, patients will be eligible if they satisfy
      the inclusion criteria for participation in this pilot study on the use of the novel
      stereotactic radiotherapy technique which will consist of partial irradiation of exclusively
      hypoxic segments of their bulky tumors, with 1-3 high dose fractions of radiotherapy based on
      the tumor's site, volume and its relationship with nearby organs. The irradiation will take
      place within 3 weeks of clinical examination. After the treatment, the patient will be
      regularly followed for the evaluation of all endpoints. If any severe toxicity (grade ≥3 per
      CTCAE v 4.3 criteria) occurs in the first 7 evaluable patients, the trial will stop. Safety
      reviews will continue on an ongoing basis, provided that severe toxicities do not occur in
      more than 15% of patients. In the case of eventual disease progression during the follow-up,
      the patients will be offered additional local (radiotherapy) or systemic (chemotherapy,
      immunotherapy, hormonal therapy) treatment if indicated by current NCCN (National
      Comprehensive Cancer Network) treatment recommendations and guidelines.

      Routine surveillance computerized axial tomography (CT) imaging of the whole body will be
      performed beginning at 1 month (+/- 3 days) after treatment to allow for endpoint assessment
      - or before in any case of clinical suspicion of disease progression. Routine CT imaging
      surveillance will continue per standard of care. Patients will also be followed clinically
      with physical and laboratory examinations as indicated.

      Tumor assessments will be completed on the CRF using RECIST v1.1. criteria. Radiographic and
      clinical evaluations will be conducted with the same schedule. The investigator will assess
      anti-tumor activity based on radiological assessments and clinical evaluations of patients
      using RECIST v1.1 at baseline, 1 and 2 months post-treatment, and every 3 months thereafter
      until confirmed disease progression per RECIST v1.1, regardless of the discontinuation of
      study treatment or the initiation of subsequent anti-cancer therapy. Radiological tumor
      assessments will also be conducted whenever disease progression is suspected (e.g.
      symptomatic deterioration or physical examination findings suggestive of mucosal recurrence).
