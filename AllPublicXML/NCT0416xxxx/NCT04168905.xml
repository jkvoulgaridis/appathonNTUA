      To evaluate the efficacy and clinical satisfaction of topical oxygen therapy (LOT) in chronic
      wounds (including patients and medical staff), and explore its possible mechanism.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A multi-center open randomized controlled study was conducted. A total of 240 subjects were
      expected to be accepted. Patients receiving normative wound treatment received cyclic topical
      oxygen therapy, not excluding the treatment of other diseases.

      After signing the informed consent, the patients were randomly divided into the treatment
      group and the control group. The total treatment time was 12 weeks or the wound healed
      completely. The enrollment examination included lower limb arteriovenous examination
      (including B-mode ultrasound, ankle-brachial index), and other related necessary examinations
      (such as biopsy excluding malignant tumors; blood routine, bacterial culture excluding wound
      infection; vibration area detection excludes peripheral neuropathy). Relevant examinations
      and records were made at each time point, including pre-admission and weekly follow-up days.
      Wound area measurement, image data collection, wound analysis, secretion detection, patient
      pain score and satisfaction survey, medical staff evaluation were required at each time
      point. Every patient in the group and the follow-up day should be treated according to the
      guidance of the doctor according to the type of wound, including wet wound treatment,
      debridement, decompression, stress treatment and so on.
