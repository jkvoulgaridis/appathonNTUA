    <textblock>
      The investigators performed a retrospective review of all patients undergoing appendicectomy
      from March-November 2018 using the online theatre database and discharge letters. CA was
      defined as patients with perforated or gangrenous appendicitis on histology. Patients were
      divided into 2 groups; Group 1 (G1) included patients with CA who had a drain inserted; Group
      2 (G2) included patients with CA and no drain.
