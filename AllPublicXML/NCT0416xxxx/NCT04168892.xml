  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this prospective, observational, multivariate study will be to
      compare the reliability of automated AMH (measured with Access AMH assay, Beckman-Coulter
      Diagnostics, USA) with that of antral follicle count (AFC) evaluated ultrasonographically
      always by the same operator and with the same ultrasound scanner, in terms of the number of
      oocytes recovered from oocyte sampling in couples subjected to in vitro fertilization.

    <textblock>
      Individual variability in ovarian response to a starting dose of gonadotropins is a
      well-known aspect during controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) and many efforts have been made
      for obtaining the personalization of the treatment, identifying different biomarkers that may
      predict the ovarian response such as age, basal Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH), AMH and
      antral follicle count (AFC). The number of oocytes retrieved is the main expression of
      ovarian response and it remains a relevant prognostic marker in women undergoing In Vitro
      Fertilization (IVF)/Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI) cycles. Consistent evidence shows
      that an optimal - rather than a maximal - oocyte yield is the preferred achievement after COS
      when fresh embryo transfer is scheduled. In fact, live birth rates steadily increase when an
      optimal number of oocytes is collected, whereas low response and hyper-response are
      associated with lower implantation rates, increased obstetrical risks and, at least when
      considering hyper response, increased risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) in the
      fresh cycle. Among the different biomarkers, AMH and AFC seem to have the best performance in
      predicting ovarian response to exogenous FSH.

      Nevertheless, until now, there is often discordance between the AMH level and AFC in clinical
      practice. In cases of discordance, which indicator should be chosen to individualize the
      starting dose of gonadotropins? Until now, no direct comparison of the new automated
      immunoassay of AMH with AFC has been carried out considering the number of retrieved oocytes
      as primary endpoint.

    <description>For controlling the effect of the starting dose on the number of retrieved oocytes, the patients will be divided in two groups based on their age. For the patients with an age ≤ 35 years, COS will be carried out by daily injections of 150 IU of Human Menopausal Gonadotropins (HMG) and will be started on the 3rd day of the cycle. The starting dose will be maintained for the first 5 days and followed by individual dose-adjustments according to the patient's follicular response. The pituitary suppression will be obtained by the administration of the Gonadotropin-releasing Hormone (GnRH) antagonist ganirelix (0.25 mg per day), starting from the 6th day of the ovarian stimulation until the day of the induction of the final oocyte maturation. Highly purified urinary human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) 10.000 IU will be used to induce final oocyte maturation. In case of OHSS risk, the final oocyte maturation will be obtained by using a GnRH agonist (buserelin acetate), 0.5 mg subcutaneously.</description>
