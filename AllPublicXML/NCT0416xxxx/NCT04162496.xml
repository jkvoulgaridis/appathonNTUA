  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with grades ranging from 1--‐3 on the Transverse Neck Line Scale, will be randomized
      to receive up to 1cc of Restylane Refyne on one side of their neck utilizing a cannula and up
      to 1cc of Restylane Refyne on the other side utilizing a 30-‐gauge needle. On Day 30, this
      treatment with the same left--‐right assignment can be repeated if optimal correction on
      either side has not been achieved according to the treating investigator. Subjects will
      return 24--48 hours after their first treatment, to fill out questionnaires, take pictures,
      and to be assessed by blinded evaluators regarding adverse events. Subjects will also return
      30 days after their final treatment to fill out final questionnaires, take pictures, and to
      be assessed by blinded evaluators regarding improvement of static rhytides.

  <detailed_description>

      This will be a prospective, evaluator‐blinded, split-‐neck, clinical study in which patients
      will be randomized to 2 groups.

      The first group will receive up to 1cc of Restylane Refyne into the rhytides on the right
      side of the neck utilizing a 27--‐gauge cannula, while the left side will be injected with a
      sharp 30--gauge needle.

      The second group will be reversed with the left side treated with Restylane Refyne utilizing
      a cannula and the right side treated with a sharp needle.

      Both groups will be utilizing the same safety and comfort protocols established by the
      practice which include the use of topical numbing cream (B.L.T.), cleansing with alcohol, and
      a cold ice pack at the site of injection after the procedure.

      Before and after the procedure a set of blinded evaluators will be grading the subjects'
      static horizontal neck lines using a validated 5-‐point grading scale. The blinded evaluators
      will also be grading the subjects side effects such as bruising and swelling 24--‐48 hours
      after the first treatment. A second treatment is allowed on Day 30 for those who have not
      achieved optimal correction. Either on Day 30 or Day 60, a final assessment with digital
      photography using Canfield's Vectra imaging system, along with a patient questionnaire on
      satisfaction, improvement (GAIS), side effects, and pain levels during and after the
      procedure will also be recorded.
