  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to determine if early operative intervention is superior to
      non-operative management for adult patients with computerized tomography (CT)-proven
      complicated appendicitis with phlegmon or abscess.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Complicated appendicitis with abscess or phlegmon represents a challenging problem to
      emergency general surgeons, and the preferred treatment remains controversial. A variety of
      therapies have been recommended including early operative intervention, delayed operative
      intervention, and non-operative management. Recently, a prospective randomized controlled
      trial from a single center was conducted in Finland comparing operative and non-operative
      management of appendiceal abscess. Patients managed in the operative arm were found to have a
      shorter length of stay, fewer re-admissions, and fewer additional interventions than those
      managed in the non-operative group, but there is no high-quality randomized control trial
      conducted in the United States to support this. The investigators, therefore plan to carry
      out a multi-center, prospective, randomized controlled trial comparing operative and
      non-operative management of complicated appendicitis with abscess or phlegmon in the United
      States.

    <description>This outcome will be measured by the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Gastrointestinal Symptoms Scale. This scale includes 8 subscales of which the investigators will use 6 for a maximum of 41 items, though usually less due to skip logic. Each item is measured on a 5-point scale. Items are summed by subscale and converted to a final score by a computer algorithm. A higher score indicates greater symptom severity and lower quality of life.</description>

    <description>Patients in the operative group will have a surgery performed to remove the appendix laparoscopically, through 3 or 4 small incisions. All patients in the operative group will receive standard perioperative antibiotics. They will also have the abscess(es) drained during the same surgery if there is one present. In some cases, the operation may be too difficult to perform laparoscopically, so an open appendectomy will be performed, involving a longer incision to remove the appendix. In some cases, both laparoscopic and open are performed. The surgeon may also choose to remove a section of the intestine with the appendix or perform additional procedures.</description>
