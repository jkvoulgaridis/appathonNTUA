  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) for preoperative management in
      non-cardiac surgery make the estimation of patients' maximum oxygen uptake (VO2peak) one of
      the cornerstones of preoperative evaluation.

      Indeed, below a certain threshold of VO2 peak fixed in the literature at 15
      milliliters/kilogram/minutes (ml/kg/min) (or 4 Metabolic Equivalent of Task - MET), the ESC
      recommends to carry out additional non-invasive examinations to evaluate the coronary risk of
      these patients.

      In current practice, this evaluation is performed in anesthesia consultation by non-standard
      interview. The question &quot;Can you go up a floor or climb a hill?&quot; permits to classify patients
      with more or less VO2 peak than 4 MET.

      However, several studies, including one published in the Lancet in 2018, show that this
      evaluation doesn't assess correctly the VO2peak of the patients nor predict post-operative
      cardiac complications.

      In the same study, the evaluation of a standardized self-questionnaire, the Duke Activity
      Status Index (DASI), found a good correlation between the value of this pre-operative score
      and the 30-day mortality as well as the occurrence of infarction.

      This self-questionnaire contains a dozen questions about the physical activities of daily
      life that patients are able or not to perform (household, various physical activity). It has
      also been validated in medical patients as being well correlated with the value of VO2 peak
      in the case of an answer by a third party (r = 0.81, p &lt;0.001) and satisfactory in the case
      of a self-questionnaire (r = 0.58 , p &lt;0.001).

      This self-questionnaire exists in English but there is no validated translation in French.
      Given the cultural differences, it seems necessary in order to use it in a French-speaking
      context to go through a scientific validation stage. A validation study of DASI in Portuguese
      has already been published recently, serving as a methodological basis for a French
      translation.

      The purpose of this study is to carry out a validation of a standardized self-questionnaire
      in French. It will be distributed to patients referred for a VO2peak test as part of their
      standard management in the Louis Pradel Hospital (Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon). The results
      of VO2peak predicted by the self-questionnaire will be compared to the VO2 peak measured
      during the examination.
