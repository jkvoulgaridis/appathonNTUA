  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tissue acquisition by Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS) has become a modality of diagnosis and
      clinical orientation for several diseases. Although tissue acquisition traditionally involves
      the cytological diagnosis (using fine-needle aspiration/FNA), the importance of obtaining a
      core for histological examination (by fine-needle biopsy/FNB) has recently been recognized.

      Currently, there is no clear establishment of the usefulness of syringe suction for the
      diagnostic accuracy of solid pancreatic lesions when FNB is used.

      Because of that, the investigators aimed to compare sensitivity, sample adequacy, and
      diagnostic yield of solid pancreatic lesions EUS-guided sampling using with and without
      syringe suction.

      The study will be conducted on a consecutive sample of patients proposed to perform EUS for
      solid pancreatic lesions characterization, in which the clinical and imaging findings justify
      the need for an FNB.

      For each case, FNB will be performed using two punctures: one with 20mL syringe suction, and
      another without suction. The order in which they will be performed will be known only by the
      performing physician and the nursing team at the time that FNB is proposed. This information
      will be concealed from the pathologist responsible for sample analysis.

      Clinical care during and after the procedure will follow the existing guidelines.

      Participants will undergo a single clinical evaluation (at the time of endoscopy and
      recovery) without the need for follow-up visits.
