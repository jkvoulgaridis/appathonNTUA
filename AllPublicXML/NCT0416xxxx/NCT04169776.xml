      This study evaluates the impact of transcutaneous auricular Vagus Nerve stimulation (taVNS)
      therapy on the incidence of nephrotic syndrome relapses in children with idiopathic nephrotic
      syndrome. Participants will perform taVNS 5 minutes a day for 6 months total, monitoring for
      signs of nephrotic syndrome relapse with both labwork and clinical symptoms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome is defined as the development of proteinuria, edema,
      hypoalbuminemia, and hyperlipidemia often presenting in the pediatric population. The
      underlying pathogenesis of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome is poorly understood but likely
      involves dysregulation of the immune system, and the majority of patients respond to steroid
      therapy and other immunosuppressive therapy. Unfortunately, relapses are common, with at
      least one relapse occurring in up to 90% of patients. Frequently-relapsing patients may be
      exposed large amounts of steroids and other immunosuppressants with a multitude of adverse
      effects, while others may not even respond to these treatments. Therefore, novel therapies
      are being studied.

      Vagus nerve stimulation is a novel therapy with the potential to treat inflammatory
      conditions via inhibition of cytokine release by the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway.
      The purpose of the proposed study is to investigate the use of vagus nerve stimulation in the
      prevention of nephrotic syndrome relapses and treatment of proteinuria in pediatric patients
      with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome.

      Patients will be enrolled if they have frequently-relapsing idiopathic nephrotic syndrome or
      proteinuria which does not respond to steroid therapy. These patients will perform daily
      transcutaneous auricular Vagus Nerve stimulation (taVNS) therapy 5 minutes a day for a 6
      month period and will be monitored for urine/bloodwork or clinical signs of nephrotic
      syndrome relapse.

    <intervention_model_description>This study is a prospective cohort pilot study not formally classified as a specific trial phase. The study will involve two Arms, with 15 participants in each Arm of the study. Arm 1 will recruit patients with steroid-sensitive frequently-relapsing idiopathic nephrotic syndrome. Arm 2 will recruit patients with steroid-resistant idiopathic nephrotic syndrome. All participants in both Arms of the study will perform daily transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) therapy for 5 minutes each day. The study period will be 6 months. The participants will be monitored for labwork and clinical evidence of nephrotic syndrome relapse, comparing the number of relapses and level or proteinuria in the 6 months before starting taVNS therapy to number of relapses and level of proteinuria in the 6 month study period.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Safety and tolerability of taVNS (Arms 1 and 2)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The endpoint of heart rate monitoring as a measure of safety of taVNS in this population was selected as this is the most concerning adverse effect of taVNS therapy. If there is no heart rate-related events during this study, it would further justify safe use of taVNS in the pediatric population.
Tolerability is an important measure in this study but is mostly a subjective measure. Therefore, patients who withdraw due to intolerability or report side effects which are deemed intolerable will aid in determining the feasibility of taVNS use in this population.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Impact of taVNS on cytokine levels (Arms 1 and 2)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>TaVNS has been shown in literature to have an anti-inflammatory effect when stimulating the vagus nerve. Several studies have found that cytokine levels are increased in nephrotic syndrome relapses as compared to levels when in remission. This endpoint provides a measure of the efficacy and compliance of taVNS use while also providing a marker for the effect of taVNS on the patient. Finally, if taVNS is shown to reduce the number of relapses while also suppressing cytokine levels, it may suggest a cytokine-associated etiology of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome.</description>

    <measure>Impact of taVNS on number of nephrotic syndrome relapses, time to nephrotic syndrome relapses, and time to remission (Arm 1)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome was chosen as an important measure of the efficacy of taVNS on patients with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome. A reduction in the number of relapses suggests that taVNS is a potential therapy for idiopathic nephrotic syndrome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Impact of taVNS on level of proteinuria (Arm 2)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The marker of disease progression and worsening outcomes is the level of proteinuria in patients with steroid-resistant idiopathic nephrotic syndrome. Measurement of the urine protein to creatinine level on a first morning sample is the most feasible and accurate measure of proteinuria in this patient population.</description>

    <description>Individuals in this arm of the study will have to have a diagnosis of steroid sensitive frequently relapsing idiopathic nephrotic syndrome. They will receive transcutaneous auricular VNS (taVNS) performed for 5minutes every day for 6 months. The settings of the taVNS device will be individualized for each patient. Data will be collected on the the number of nephrotic syndrome relapses, the time between relapses, the time to remission once relapsed, and the level of proteinuria before and while using taVNS therapy.</description>
