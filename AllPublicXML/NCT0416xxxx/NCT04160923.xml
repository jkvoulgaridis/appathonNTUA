  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eclampsia is a rare but serious disease that can happen during the pregnancy. Both general
      and regional anesthesia can both be performed in eclamptic patients. Eclamptic patients has
      greater risk if undergo general anesthesia such as risks associated with general anesthesia
      in pregnancy and also cerebral hemorrhage risks from hypertension during laryngoscope
      application and thrombocytopenia that can happen in eclamptic patients. So, most of
      Anesthesiologists tend to avoid performing general anesthesia in these patients. But spinal
      anesthesia also has side effects such as hypotension or epidural hematoma. And nowadays
      there's minimal evidence on suitable anesthesia in eclamptic patients. Our study wants to
      review on how choice of anesthesia affects these patients both mothers and their neonates
