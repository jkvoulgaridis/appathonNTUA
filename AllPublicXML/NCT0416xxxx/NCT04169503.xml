    <textblock>
      Although immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have proved effective in treating many cancers,
      patients receiving ICIs may experience immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Little evidence
      exists on the safety of resuming these treatments after an irAE.

      Our objective was to investigate the safety of ICI rechallenge after an irAE using the WHO
      pharmacovigilance database
