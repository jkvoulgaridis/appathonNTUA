  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      NIRS technology is therefore a technique that exploits the different absorption properties of
      oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin to evaluate the degree of tissue oxygenation. This
      hemodynamic response is measured in a completely non-invasive and silent manner, by the
      simple emission of light passing through different layers of biological tissue.

      In the literature, some studies concerning the use of the NIRS method for the study of
      urodynamics exist. They seem to show a correlation between the data of the urodynamic
      assessment and the data obtained with the NIRS method. Certain trends seem to be repeated
      with, for example, an increase in oxyhemoglobin at the beginning of the filling phase and the
      beginning of the urination phase.

      The aim of the study is to analyze the NIRS signal and find correlation with urodynamic data.
