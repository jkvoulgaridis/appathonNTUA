      The aim of the study was to evaluate sleep quality in patients with spinal cord injury; to
      investigate the relationship between sleep and spinal cord level, ambulation status,
      spasticity, quality of life, daily living activities, depressive status, neuropathic pain

    <textblock>
      Since survival increases in patients with spinal cord injury, sleep disturbances, which are
      more frequently observed than the general population and have significant impacts on
      mortality, impair long-term quality of life.The aim of the study was to evaluate sleep
      quality in patients with spinal cord injury; to investigate the relationship between sleep
      and spinal cord level, ambulation status, spasticity, quality of life, daily living
      activities, depressive status, neuropathic pain Eighty patients with inpatient rehabilitation
      of spinal cord injury were included in the study.

      Demographic characteristics, duration of spinal cord injury, spinal cord injury level,
      etiology, number of intermittent bladder catheterization (IC), number of night time IC, what
      time they slept, whether they woke up at night, classification of spinal cord injury were
      recorded.

      Ambulation level with Functional Ambulation Classification (FAC), spasticity with Modified
      Ashworth Scale (MAS), depressive symptoms with Beck Depression Index (BDI), quality of life
      with short-form health survey (SF-36), sleep quality The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index
      (PSQI), daytime sleepiness Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS), activity of daily living with
      Barthel Index (BI), neuropathic pain were evaluated with the Douleur Neuropathique 4
      questionnaire (DN4) scale.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional Ambulation Classification (FAC)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 month</time_frame>
    <description>FAC is defined in five stages according to the basic motor skills required for functional ambulation. FAC stage 0 is used to indicate non-functional ambulation, and stage 5 is used to indicate independent walking at each speed and on ground</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Beck Depression Index (BI)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 month</time_frame>
    <description>The severity of depressive symptoms was assessed using the BDI. This scale consists of 21 categories that evaluate the physical, emotional, cognitive, and motivational symptoms of depression, such as hopelessness, irritability, guilt, feelings of being punished, fatigue, and weight loss</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 month</time_frame>
    <description>A questionnaire that assesses sleep quality and discomfort over the last 1 month. The total score is between 0-21. A higher total score indicates poor sleep quality. A score of 5 or more indicates poor sleep quality</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 month</time_frame>
    <description>It is a simple questionnaire that measures daytime sleepiness level. Sleepiness is questioned in cases encountered in daily life. The total score is between 0-24. Daytime sleepiness increases as the score increases</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>short-form health survey (SF-36)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 month</time_frame>
    <description>SF-36 is a widely-used and well-documented health-related quality of life index. The SF-36 survey has eight sub-dimensions, including physical functioning, role limitations due to physical problems, pain, general health perception, mental health, role limitations due to emotional problems, vitality, and social functioning, which are evaluated individually</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Douleur Neuropathique 4 questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>3 month</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluate neuropathic pain. It consists of 10 questions. The maximum score is 10. Patients with a score of 4 or more are considered to have neuropathic pain</description>
