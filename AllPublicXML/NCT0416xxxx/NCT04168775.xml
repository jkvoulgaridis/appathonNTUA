  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies have reported that some COPD patients may have a suboptimal ability to
      generate a sufficient inspiratory effort to achieve adequate lung delivery of inhaled
      medications through dry powder inhalers. Sparse data is available about the inspiratory
      capacity of these patients in the home setting, whether clinically stable or when
      experiencing worsened respiratory symptoms outside the acute care setting. This study is
      undertaken to better understand the proportion of patients with suboptimal peak inspiratory
      flow rate (sPIFR) measurements amongst COPD patients receiving dry powder inhaler(s) (DPI) in
      the ambulatory setting. Further, the study will characterize PIFR over time, the variability
      of PIFR measurements, and the associations with potential predictors (demographics, clinical,
      PRO, body position, and device) as well as exacerbations frequency and change in PIFR around
      period of exacerbation.

      questionnaires at home.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &gt; 50 years-old

          -  Spirometry-confirmed diagnosis of COPD (FEV1/FVC &lt;0.70)

          -  GOLD II-IV based on spirometry results

          -  CAT score &gt; 10

          -  For high resistance DPI, baseline PIFR &lt; 90 L/min (InCheck DIAL®) and &gt;=30 L/min; for
             medium resistance DPI, PIFR ≤ 90 L/min (InCheck DIAL®) and &gt;=60 L/min. Handihaler is a
             high resistance DPI. Examples of medium resistance DPI: Anoro, Incruse, Breo Ellipta®,
             Advair® Diskus® DP or Wixela® Inhub®

          -  Prescribed at least one daily maintenance DPI with no change in prescription within
             the four weeks prior to the Enrollment Visit

          -  One or more exacerbations of COPD requiring systemic corticosteroids within last 2
             years

          -  Inability to achieve minimum PIFR for prescribed DPI(s) at screening/enrollment visit
             (&lt; 30 L/min for e.g., Handihaler® (High resistance DPI), &lt; 60 L/min for Ellipta®
             (Medium resistance DPI))

          -  Inability to perform spirometry to meet American Thoracic Society standards

          -  Any condition that, in the opinion of the site investigator, would compromise the
             subject's ability to participate in the study.

          -  Pneumothorax within the past 4 weeks

          -  For those participants who will require spirometry (i.e., if they have not had it
             within the past 3 months): Participants who present with a myocardial infarction or
             eye, chest or abdominal surgery within six weeks of baseline can be rescreened after
