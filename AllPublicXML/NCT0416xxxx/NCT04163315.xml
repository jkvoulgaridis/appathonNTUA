  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this pilot study, the investigators propose a multimodal evaluation of the brain
      connectivity of brain tumor patients, in order to better understand the effects induced by
      focal lesions on brain structure and function, as well as brain plasticity mechanisms that
      may occur in such condition. The investigators aim at drawing a multimodal brain connectivity
      map of focally brain-damaged patients, with a view to improve onco-functional neurosurgical
      practices.

      Patients included in the present study will first perform the pre-operative MRI (dMRI and
      fMRI) with a specific High Resolution Angular Diffusion (HARDI) sequence and a functional
      acquisition at rest. Then, the investigators will record their cortico-cortical evoked
      potentials elicited by direct electrostimulation during the surgery, just before the tumor
      removal, following our usual protocol. Finally, all data (clinical, diffusion, electrical and
      functional connectivity) will be processed and correlated to each other.

    <description>With this exploratory pilot study, the investigator propose a multimodal evaluation of the structural and functional connectivity of patients with brain tumours, in order to better understand the tumor-induced lesion mechanisms on brain connectivity as well as the brain plasticity mechanisms that the brain develops to maintain a level of overall function neurological. The investigator hope to obtain multimodal brain mapping of locally brain-damaged patients, with a view to improving onco-functional neurosurgical practices.</description>

    <description>Patients included in the study will perform the pre-operative MRI (fMRI and fMRI) with a specific High Resolution Angular Diffusion (HARDI) sequence and a functional rest sequence. The additional scan time for this specific sequence is approximately 25 minutes, with no foreseeable negative impact on the patient</description>
