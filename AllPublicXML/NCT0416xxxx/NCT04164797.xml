      a randomized controlled trial of endostar combined with TP regimen(liposomal
      paclitaxel-carboplatin) for chemoradiotherapy in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma(Ⅱ-Ⅲ)

    <textblock>
      This study was a controlled clinical trial.A total of 402 patients with pathologically
      confirmed esophageal squamous cell carcinoma would be enrolled.Patients were randomly divided
      into two group ,with 201 in the treatment group and 201 in the control group.The treatment
      group was treated with endostar,chemotherapy (liposomal paclitaxel-carboplatin)and concurrent
      radiotherapy.The control group was treated with chemotherapy (liposomal
      paclitaxel-carboplatin)and concurrent radiotherapy .The efficiency and safety would be
      evaluated. The objective response rate and progress free survival would be analyzed.This data
      of this study might provide a more effective treatment for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma
