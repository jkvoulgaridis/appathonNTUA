  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the clinical trial the investigators will assess efficacy, safety and tolerability after
      single and multiple doses of 3 millimolar 5 aminolevulinic acid (Gliolan®) in combination
      with blue-light (405 nanometer) photopheresis in patients with active crohns disease. The
      study is a proof-of-concept pilot with 10 included patients where every patient will get
      active treatment. The use of 5-aminolevulinic acid in combination with blue-light
      photopheresis is a first-in-human trial. Primary endpoints include clinical response and
      adverse events (safety). Secondary endpoints include endoscopic improvement, quality of life
      questionnaires, faecal calprotectin, C-reactive protein and mechanisms of action (differences
      in t-cells and other cells before and after treatment). All patients will get treatment every
      2 weeks for 10 weeks (6 treatments-induction) with evaluation at week 13. If any effect on
      week 13 eligible for study extension with treatment every 4 weeks for up to 12 months.
      Through the study the investigators will see if this kind of photopheresis is safe and can be
      an option for a larger randomized-controlled-trial. In addition the investigators will see if
      photopheresis as an option can be further developed for other diseases as well (ie other
      T-cell mediated diseases or patients already receiving photopheresis as a treatment).
