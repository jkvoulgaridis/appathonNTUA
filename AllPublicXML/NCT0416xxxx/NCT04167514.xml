  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent of participants with complete or partial response to acute Graft-versus-Host Disease (GVHD) treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days post-randomization</time_frame>
    <description>Acute GVHD will be graded and assessed for response based on Harris criteria (stage 0, 1, 2, 3, 4) for skin, liver, upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and lower GI tract. Complete response (CR) is defined as a score of 0 for the GVHD staging in all evaluable organs.
Partial response (PR) is defined as improvement in one or more organs involved with GVHD symptoms without progression in others.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of response (DOR)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 months post-randomization</time_frame>
    <description>DOR is defined as time from the Day 28 response (CR or PR) to any of the following events: relapse/progression of acute GVHD, new systemic salvage therapy for acute GVHD, re-escalation of steroids to greater or equal to 2.5 mg/kg prednisone or equivalent, or death from any cause.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent of participants with non-relapse mortality (NRM)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 months post-randomization</time_frame>
    <description>An event of NRM is death without prior evidence of relapse/progression of the primary disease, where relapse/progression is treated as a competing risk.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent of participants with overall survival and progression-free survival</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 months post-randomization</time_frame>
    <description>An event for overall survival is death from any cause, while an event for progression-free survival is death from any cause or relapse/progression of the primary disease.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent of participants with GVHD-free survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 56 post-randomization</time_frame>
    <description>Patients alive, free of active acute or chronic GVHD, and without other systemic agents or escalation of steroids added for treatment of GVHD will be considered successes for this endpoint.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent of participants with response</measure>
    <time_frame>At Day 7, 14, 21, 28, 56, and 86 post-randomization</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of patients with CR, PR (including subset with VGPR), and treatment failure (TF). The designation of TF will consist of patients with no response (NR), mixed response (MR), progression or initiation of additional systemic (second-line) GVHD therapies or escalation of steroids. Death from any cause will also be considered a TF.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent of participants with Grade 2 to 3 systemic infections</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug</time_frame>
    <description>The incidence of Grade 2 to 3 systemic infections. Grade 2 to 3 systemic infections will be defined according to BMT CTN Manual of Procedures.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent of participants with Grade 3 to 5 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug</time_frame>
    <description>The incidence of Grade 3 to 5 TEAEs (per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] Version 5.0)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent of participants with chronic GVHD</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 months post-randomization</time_frame>
    <description>Chronic GVHD is defined per National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus Criteria. Diagnosis of chronic GVHD of any severity (mild, moderate, or severe) is considered an event for this endpoint.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent of participants with disease relapse</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 months post-randomization</time_frame>
    <description>The cumulative incidence of relapse/progression of the primary disease, with death prior to relapse/progression treated as a competing risk.</description>

    <ipd_description>CSL will consider requests to share Individual Patient Data (IPD) from systematic review groups or bona-fide researchers. For information on the process and requirements for submitting a voluntary data sharing request for IPD, please contact CSL at clinicaltrials@cslbehring.com.
Applicable country specific privacy and other laws and regulations will be considered and may prevent sharing of IPD.
If the request is approved and the researcher has executed an appropriate data sharing agreement, IPD that has been appropriately anonymized will be available.</ipd_description>

    <ipd_time_frame>IPD requests may be submitted to CSL no earlier than 12 months after publication of the results of this study via an article made available on a public website.</ipd_time_frame>
    <ipd_access_criteria>Requests may only be made by systematic review groups or bona-fide researchers whose proposed use of the IPD is non-commercial in nature and has been approved by an internal review committee.
An IPD request will not be considered by CSL unless the proposed research question seeks to answer a significant and unknown medical science or patient care question as determined by CSL's internal review committee.
The requesting party must execute an appropriate data sharing agreement before IPD will be made available.</ipd_access_criteria>
