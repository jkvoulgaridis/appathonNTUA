  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study to determine if a
      hydroponically-cultivated red ginseng preparation is superior to conventionally grown ginseng
      and placebo for positively affecting electrical activity of the brain during performance of
      various cognitive tasks.
