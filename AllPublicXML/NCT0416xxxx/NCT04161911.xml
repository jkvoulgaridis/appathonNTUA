      The central aims of this study are descriptive and designed to describe the patient
      demographics, clinical characteristics, treatment patterns, and overall survival in advanced
      liver cancer participants who received second or third line nivolumab therapy in the

    <description>The initial second or third line nivolumab therapy date will be used as the start date for the OS analysis. Occurrence of death will be considered as event and the duration for event will be calculated as time from 2L or 3L nivolumab therapy date to death date. Patients who survived will be censored and their duration period will be the time between the initial 2L or 3L nivolumab therapy date and the last date of their post-period follow up</description>

    <description>aHCC cohort selected from the Flatiron Health Oncology electronic health record (EHR) data from January 2011 to the most recent data available. The index date will be defined as the start of second or third line nivolumab therapy for aHCC between January 1, 2011 and the most recent data available.</description>

        The study cohort will be selected from the Flatiron database according to the inclusion and
        exclusion criteria.

        Participants will be eligible for inclusion in this study if:

          1. Diagnosed with advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma (aHCC) in the Flatiron database;

          2. Aged 18 years or older at index date; and

          3. Received second or third line nivolumab monotherapy or combination therapy for aHCC.

        Participants will be excluded if:

          1. Received clinical study drugs prior to, on, or post the index date;

          2. Have less than 1 month of medical data following and including the index date. Those
             meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be further stratified by lines of
             therapy and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (PS) score.
