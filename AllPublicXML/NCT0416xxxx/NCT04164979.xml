    <description>This is defined as the percentage of subjects who are free of progression 6 months after study treatment start. Progression is defined death, radiographic progression or clinical deterioration attributed disease progression as judged by an investigator. Radiographic progression is defined using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), as a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions and an absolute increase of at least 5 mm and/or appearance of new lesions.</description>

    <description>To evaluate the tolerability of administering cabozantinib in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced gastric and gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma from the start of treatment, duration of treatment and up to 4 weeks after completion of study treatment.

    <description>To assess the overall response rate to the combination of cabozantinib and pembrolizumab. Overall response rate (ORR) is defined as confirmed complete response (CR) and partial response (PR). Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1): Complete Response (CR) is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR) is defined as a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions.

          -  The effects of cabozantinib on the developing human fetus at the recommended
             therapeutic dose are unknown. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential and
             men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth
             control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation,
             and for 4 months following completion of therapy. Should a woman become pregnant or
             suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her
             treating physician immediately.

          -  A female of child-bearing potential is any woman (regardless of sexual orientation,
             having undergone a tubal ligation, or remaining celibate by choice) who meets the
             following criteria:

               1. Has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or

               2. Has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months (i.e.,
                  has had menses at any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months).

          -  Ability to swallow tablets

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy within 2 weeks prior to entering the study

          -  All toxicities attributed to prior anti-cancer therapy other than alopecia must have

          -  Patients with known brain metastases or cranial epidural disease unless accurately
             treated with radiotherapy and/or surgery (including radiosurgery) and stable for at
             least 4 weeks before first dose of study treatment. These individuals should be
             excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they
             often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of
             neurologic and other adverse events. Eligible subjects must be neurologically
             asymptomatic and without corticosteroid treatment at the time of the first dose of
             study treatment.

               1. Low-dose aspirin for cardioprotection (per local applicable guidelines) is
                  permitted.

               2. Low-dose low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) are permitted.

               3. Anticoagulation with therapeutic doses of LMWH is allowed in subjects without
                  known brain metastases who are on a stable dose of LMWH for at least 6 weeks
                  before first dose of study treatment, and who have had no clinically significant
                  hemorrhagic complications from the anticoagulation regimen or the tumor.

          -  The subject has prothrombin time (PT)/INR or partial thromboplastin time (PTT) test ≥
             1.3 x the laboratory ULN within 7 days before the first dose of study treatment.

               5. unstable angina pectoris

               6. cardiac arrhythmia

               7. evidence of tumor invading GI tract, active peptic ulcer disease, inflammatory
                  inflammatory bowel disease (eg, Crohn's disease), diverticulitis, cholecystitis,
                  symptomatic cholangitis or appendicitis, acute pancreatitis, acute obstruction of
                  the pancreatic duct or common bile duct, or gastric outlet obstruction.

              11. Cavitating pulmonary lesion(s) or known endotracheal or endobronchial disease
                  manifestation.

              12. Lesions invading any major blood vessels.

              13. Other clinically significant disorders that would preclude safe study
                  participation:

                    2. Uncompensated/symptomatic hypothyroidism

                    3. Moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B or C)

              14. psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
                  requirements.

          -  Major surgery within 8 weeks before first dose of study treatment. Complete wound
             healing from major surgery must have occurred 1 month before first dose and from minor
             surgery (eg, simple excision, tooth extraction) at least 10 days before first dose.

                    1. QT: duration of QT interval

                    2. RR: duration of RR interval

               2. Note: If a single ECG shows a QTcF with an absolute value &gt; 500 ms, two
                  additional ECGs at intervals of approximately 3 min must be performed within 30
                  min after the initial ECG, and the average of these three consecutive results for
                  QTcF will be used to determine eligibility.

          -  History of another primary cancer within the last 3 years with the exception of
             non-melanoma skin cancer, early-stage prostate cancer, or curatively treated cervical

             clinically relevant ongoing complications from prior radiation therapy are not
             eligible.

          -  Has received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of study
             intervention. Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the
             following: measles, mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster (chicken pox), yellow fever,
             rabies, Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza

             their excipients.

          -  Has an active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in past 2 years
             (i.e., with use of disease‐modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive
             drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency) is not considered a form
             of systemic treatment and is allowed.

          -  Has a history of (non‐infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or has current
             pneumonitis.

          -  Has a history or current evidence of any condition (eg, known deficiency of the enzyme
             dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase), therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might
             confound the results of the study, interfere with the participant's participation for
             the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of the participant to
             participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.
