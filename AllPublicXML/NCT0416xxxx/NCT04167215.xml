      this study aim to evaluate the role of autologous augmentation for buttock contouring and
      analyze different aethetic gluteal deformity

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The last decades showed an increasing demand for bariatric surgery and diet dependent massive
      weight loss , these successful strategies for weight loss result in significant deformities
      in general body contour , buttock normal appearance is very important for posterior trunk
      aesthetic image and its severely affected after massive weight loss .

      Aesthetically attractive buttocks required special features include adequate volume,
      projection, and a defined infragluteal fold.. The gluteal region in patients with massive
      weight loss is characterized by excessive skin and exaggerated fat loss. Lower body lift
      procedures remove excess skin and lift sagging buttock tissue. unsatisfactory buttock shape
      especially V shaped buttock is considered as important indication for gluteal reshaping
      Mendieta and Cuenca-Guerra and Quezada have proposed novel methods of describing and
      analyzing gluteal aesthetics.

      There are a multitude of options that can be used to improve the buttock includ-ing
      non-surgical injections, implants, fat, excisional, liposuction and various energy devices

    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Analysis of gluteal projection will be performed using Gonzalez-ulloa method , four points and two distances , (A) Greater trochanter, (B) Point of maximal projection of the mons , (C) Point of maximal gluteal projection, (D) Anterior superior iliac spine. The CB line points to the maximal ideal projection of the buttocks. The ideal proportion is a 2:1 ratio between AB and AC.</description>

    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Waist hip ratio assessment The ideal female figure has a waist-to-hip ratio of 0.7. The ration is measured in posterior view and in lateral view with the most pleasing ratio 0.65 and 0.7 respectively.
WHO recommendation for WHR measure ; while patient being in the standing position parallel to the floor at the level at which the measurement is made and using a stretch‐resistant tape and placement of the tape The measurement should be taken around the widest portion of the buttocks. at two definite point for the waist and the hip .
For waist circumference:
The measurement is made at the approximate midpoint between the lower margin of the last palpable rib and the top of the iliac crest.
For hip circumference:
The measurement should be taken around the widest portion of the buttocks.</description>

    <description>Doppler probe is used to locate perforating vessels from the superior gluteal artery. . Flaps or lumbar artery flap will be designed to allow deepithelialization and dissection laterally to medially to identify the perforator . then sketolization is performed A gluteal pocket will then create for the augmentation flaps by undermining in a plane just superficial to the gluteal muscle extending to within 5 cm of the inferior gluteal crease. The deepithelialized flaps will then transpose inferomedially , and tacked to the fascia with several sutures.to be used as autologus buttock augmentation flap</description>
