  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HydroEye® is a dietary supplement that contains both EPA and DHA, as well as GLA and ALA in
      the form of black currant seed oil. It also has vitamins A, E, C, B6, and magnesium, many of
      which are involved in fatty acid metabolism. In 2013, Sheppard et al. tested HydroEye® in dry
      eye patients who were not contact lens wearers and found that symptoms and corneal smoothness
      improved in response to HydroEye® supplementation. To date, HydroEye® has not been assessed
      in patients with contact lens discomfort; therefore, the purpose of this clinical trial is to
      determine the efficacy of HydroEye® as a treatment for contact lens discomfort.
