  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Integrated care models aim to promote the coordination and communication between services.
      The present study aim to evaluate the effectiveness of a new integrated care model
      (Salut+Social model) which will promote the coordination and communication between social and
      healthcare services in southern Catalonia (Spain) for the improvement of quality of life of
      chronic patients, adherence to treatment, access to medical services and caregiver overload.
      Also, we will evaluate the experience of health and social professionals with the new model
      implemented.

    <textblock>
      A clinical trial with mixed methodology will be carried out. The intervention consists of the
      promotion and coordination between the social and health sectors, for 6 months, through the
      use of information and communication technology (ICT) tools that operate as an interface for
      the integrated care model. The study subjects are chronic patients with health and social
      conditions that are susceptible to be treated in a collaborative and coordinated way in the
      field of primary health care. A sample size of 141 patients was estimated. Questionnaires
      will be used at baseline and at 6, 9 and 12 months after the beginning of the study for the
      evaluation of quality of life, treatment adherence, medical service and caregiver overload.
      The principal variable is the quality of life. For statistical analysis, comparisons of means
      and proportions at different time points will be performed. One discussion group will be
      performed with the aim of improving the care model according to professionals' opinions. A
      thematic content analysis will be carried out.

    <description>Patients will be called for the ﬁrst interview of the study by the healthcare professional. Their data will be automatically entered in the Salut + Social app, they will be asked to respond to the study questionnaires (ad hoc questionnaire for sociodemographic data, EuroQol-5D, Zarit questionnaire and Morisky-Green test) and will take part in the future actions to be planned for them. Patients will receive an appointment to attend their PCC at 6, 9, and 12 months after their incorporation into the program. In those follow-up, the same questionnaires will be provided together with the IEXPAC questionnaire, which evaluates the experience of the chronic patient with the new care model.</description>
