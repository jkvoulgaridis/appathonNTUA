  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recurrence is a common problem after catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation, affecting at
      least one out of three patients. Inflammation due to the procedure may contribute to
      pulmonary vein reconnection and, thus, failure of catheter ablation.

      This pilot study will assess whether a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial
      investigating a 10-day treatment with colchicine, a potent anti-inflammatory drug, to improve
      patient relevant outcomes after catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation is feasible.
