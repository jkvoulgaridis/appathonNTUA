  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized study evaluating the effect of routinely collecting a standardized
      questionnaire of heart failure health status during heart failure clinic visits. Participants
      will be randomized to early or delayed implementation of a validated health-related quality
      of life survey (the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire). Participants randomized to
      early implementation will be given this 12-question survey at each heart failure clinic visit
      at the beginning of the study; their heart failure clinician will have access to survey
      results but will continue to manage participants based on standard treatment practice.
      Patients randomized to delayed implementation will start receiving the survey at each clinic
      visit one year later. By comparing the health status and treatment rates between early and
      delayed implementation, this study will determine the impact of standardized health status
      assessment on patient outcomes and clinician decision-making.

    <measure>Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire-12 Score</measure>

    <description>The first KCCQ-12 score collected one year after randomization will be compared between the early implementation and delayed implementation arms. KCCQ-12 scores will be collected in the delayed implementation arm starting one year after randomization.This will be the primary effectiveness outcome. KCCQ-12 has 4 domains (Physical Limitation Score, Symptom Frequency Score, Quality of Life Score, Social Limitation Score) and one Summary Score. Scores are scaled 0-100, where 0 denotes the lowest reportable health status and 100 the highest.</description>
