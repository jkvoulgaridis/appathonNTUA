  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to understand how to manipulate the electrical stimulation from the cochlear
      implant to maximize hearing stimulation and minimize facial stimulation. It is know from
      animal data that the hearing and facial nerves have different sensitivities to things like
      electrical pulse shape, its pattern, and its duration. It is very unclear however if this
      applies to human cochlear implant patients, and what the optimal parameters are to
      selectively stimulate the hearing nerve in humans. The outcomes of this study will be used to
      more selectively program some patients with severe facial nerve cross stimulation and to
      inform the development of new types of implant stimulation.

      The patients eligible for the study are deaf, and have consented as part of their standard of
      care to receiving a cochlear implant. There will be no interference with this process in any
      way. Those patients that are unfortunate to be affected by facial nerve stimulation following
      receiving their cochlear implant however will be contacted and with the aim to help improve
      their symptoms as indicated in prior animal studies

    <intervention_model_description>We will have 2 groups of patients. An Intraoperative group (undergoing cochlear implantation) and a post operative group (with pre existing facial nerve stimulation). The study compares the effectiveness of different pulse shapes within each group, rather than performing a between-group comparison</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To identify stimulus parameters for cochlear implant stimulation that achieve sufficient loudness for hearing, while minimizing stimulation of the facial nerve.</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>The loudness level, or auditory nerve response at which facial nerve stimulation occurs for different stimulation pulse shapes will be measured for all 24 patients on both groups and help to identify different optimal stimulus parameters.
By comparing the amount of electrical current required to initiate a facial nerve response for each pulse shape this will determine if there is an optimal type of stimulation to use, to reduce facial nerve stimulation.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To increase scientific understanding of the biology of the auditory and facial nerve's responses to stimulation.</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>This is a hugely under researched field where we are pioneering techniques and so exact outcome measures may be difficult to quantify in this scientific investigation.
We are not able to use questionnaires or scientific tools at this stage, however this can be measured through electrical current measurements on the volta software for the Advanced Bionics cochlear implant company.</description>

    <description>The intra-operative group consists of patients who have met criteria for cochlear implants. We monitor the facial nerve EMG intraoperatively in all patients, and often get some facial nerve activation when we are testing the implant intraoperatively when we are looking to see if we are getting any hearing nerve responses from electrical stimulation of the implant. We will also measure the facial nerve responses for some other charge-balanced pulse shapes, which are asymmetric and in which either the positive or negative charge is expected to stimulate the nerve. We will only measure these for two electrodes, not for all 12-22 electrodes They will be then invited back post operatively for a second testing during a standard of care visit post switch on for other pulse shapes.</description>

    <arm_group_label>PostOperative Group</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The post-operative group, are patients who are actually having facial nerve stimulation on one or more electrodes, and for whom these electrodes are turned down so much they can't hear very well, or are actually turned off because of the facial nerve stimulation. For these patients, we will slowly increase the current levels on the offending electrodes (maximum of two) until they get some facial nerve twitching, and then turn down the current until they do not have stimulation any more. We will do this for all pulse shapes and determine which shape produces the greatest loudness without stimulating the facial nerve. This will be the only testing session for the second group.</description>
