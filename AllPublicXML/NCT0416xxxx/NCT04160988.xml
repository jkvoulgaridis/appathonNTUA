  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the clinical performance of VeriSee DR for DR screening from color
      fundus photography images in patients with diabetes mellitus. The sensitivity and specificity
      of VeriSee DR's automated image analysis for screening the diabetes retinopathy will be
      determined.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects enrolled in this study should meet all the following criteria.

               1. Subject with age ≥ 20 years old

               2. Subject with documented diagnosis of diabetes mellitus

               3. Subject with image taken by color fundus photography that meet the following
                  requirement:

                    -  The resolution of image is 1024×1024 pixels or higher;

                    -  The angle view of image is 45 or 50 degree.

               4. Subject's image includes macula and optic nerve as judged by the ophthalmologist.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects will be excluded if they meet any of the following criteria.

               1. The color fundus photography image previously used by VeriSee DR during the
                  development process and pre-clinical test

               2. The macula, optic nerve, or other part in the image of color fundus photography
                  is unclear to determine the disease condition as judged by the ophthalmologist.
