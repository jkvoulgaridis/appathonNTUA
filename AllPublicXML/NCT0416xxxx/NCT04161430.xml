  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of 100 mg DRBP108 tablets in the treatment
      of type 2 diabetes mellitus. A total of 750 subjects will be randomly allocated to three
      groups: DRBP108, active comparator and placebo comparator, in a 3:1:1 ratio. The purpose of
      this study is to evaluate whether 24 weeks of DRBP108 treatment will adequately reduce
      hemoglobin A1C levels in T2DM subjects.
