  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) impairs oxygen transport to tissue and causes endothelial injury.
      Thus, therapeutic interventions aim to improve both, but there is an unmet need for
      biomarkers to determine when intervention is necessary and evaluate the effectiveness of the
      chosen intervention in individual patients. This study proposes to monitor SCD and its
      treatment through their impact on cerebral hemodynamics, as the brain is one of the most
      vulnerable and consequential targets of the disease. Specifically, this study will optimize
      quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and advanced optical spectroscopy techniques
      such as frequency-domain near-infrared and diffuse correlation spectroscopies (FDNIRS-DCS) to
      monitor 1) cerebral oxygen transport with measures of cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral
      oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption (CMRO2)
      and 2) endothelial function with cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR).

      Additionally, this study aims to monitor baseline cerebral oxygen transport and CVR, as well
      as changes that occur with treatment (transfusion or genetic therapy to induce fetal
      hemoglobin) and assess hemoglobinopathy patients with known genotypes and phenotypes. The
      ultimate goal is to demonstrate the potential of this monitoring approach to select
      individual SCD subjects for interventions and evaluate individual responses to treatment.
      Success will help justify inclusion of these modalities in ongoing and future clinical trials
      of novel SCD therapies.
