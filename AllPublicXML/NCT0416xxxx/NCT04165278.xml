  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The seasonal variation of motor and non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) has been
      receiving attention all the time. Two potential elements (temperature and sunlight) may
      explains how the seasonal variation could affect PD.

      In clinical practice, part of PD patients from Jiangsu province complained that the motor
      symptoms of PD in winter (low temperature, less sunlight) were more severe than in summer.
      Seasonal variation in temperature may affect seasonal changes in the severity of PD. An
      investigation of hallucinations involving 51 PD patients reported no evidence of seasonal
      variations in clinical symptoms. However, the non-motor symptoms (NMS) in PD fluctuated
      throughout the year, with winter months being more severe than summer month s in a recent
      Cross - sectional retrospective study on 372 consecutive PD patients. Moreover, a study of
      546 PD patients indicated no seasonal fluctuation in motor symptom severity, when measured
      with the Unified Parkinson's disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). We considered that seasonal
      fluctuations of motor symptoms of PD may be related to changes in temperature and sunlight,
      but light therapy has made some progress in the treatment of PD. Therefore, we began to ask
      these PD patients who were affected by temperature changes whether their motor symptoms were
      affected by hyperthermic baths.

      In clinical practice, PD patients who complained that motor symptoms were more severe in
      winter felt the improvement of motor symptoms after HTB. Based on the current situation, we
      will conduct HTB study to further evaluate whether temperature is an important factor
      affecting the motor symptoms of PD patients, and the feasibility and effectiveness of simple
      HTB to improve the motor symptoms of PD.
