    <textblock>
      The aim is to develop, test and evaluate an educational intervention with the purpose to
      strengthen Child Health Services (CHS) Nurses clinical competence in detecting signs of
      postpartum depression in non-native-speaking immigrant mothers. The pilot study has a
      pre-post experimental design. Data are collected before and after the intervention. The
      differences in the values of the collected data are used to estimate the effect of the
      intervention.

      To be eligible for the study the CHS nurse must perform screening of immigrant mothers for
      postpartum depression with help of an interpreter according to the Edinburgh Postnatal
      Depression Scale (EPDS) method more than three times a year. The EPDS is a likert form scale
      with ten statements and is used in combination with a Clinical interview.

      Approximately 40-45 CHS nurses will be enrolled in the pilot study. The number of nurses are
      calculated in comparison to two other published studies within the same context. The
      instruments Clinical Cultural Competence Training Questionnaire (CCCTQ) and General
      Self-Efficacy scale (GSE) will be used as primary outcomes measures. Data are collected
      before the first education day and after the second education day. Secondary outcomes are
      also collected in connection to the educational intervention and consists of reported yearly
      statistics; how many mothers were are offered screening, participated in screening, number of
      screenings preformed with help og an interpreter and number of mothers offered follow-up
      after participating in screening.
