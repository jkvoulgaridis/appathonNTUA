      The aim of this study is to test the Korean version of QoR-15 for its validity and clinical
      acceptability and feasibility.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Quality of recovery (QoR) after anesthesia is an important measure of the early postoperative
      health status of patients. The QoR-40 is a widely-used questionnaire for postoperative
      patients and the short-form version of it (QoR-15) was developed in 2013. The validation of
      QoR-15 has been reported in the version of English, Portuguese, Danish, Chinese and Swedish.
      However, the study to validate the Korean version of QoR-15 has not been demonstrated.

      Patients undergoing surgery and general anesthesia are asked by the investigators to complete
      the QoR-15 questionnaire and Korean 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) a day before
      surgery. They are then asked to repeat the QoR-15 questionnaire 24 h postoperatively and also
      rate their overall postoperative pain score using 11-point numeric rating scale (NRS).
