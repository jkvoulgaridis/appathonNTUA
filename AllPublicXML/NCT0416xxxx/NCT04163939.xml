    <measure>Neck Disability Index (NDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire used to measure how neck pain affects activities of daily living. Each of the 10 items are scored from 0-5, the maximum score is 50. Higher scores signify greater disability. A score over 34 signifies complete disability.</description>

    <measure>SF-36 Quality of Life Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire used to measure quality of life. All questions are scored on a scale from 0 to 100, with 100 representing the highest level of functioning possible. The total score is calculated as a percentage of the total points possible. A higher total percent signifies better outcomes.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analog Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>Scale used to measure pain. The subject will mark their pain on a scale with a length of 100mm. The scale is scored by measuring (mm) from the left end of the scale to the subject's marking. The VAS is scored from 0-100, higher scores signify a greater amount of pain.</description>
