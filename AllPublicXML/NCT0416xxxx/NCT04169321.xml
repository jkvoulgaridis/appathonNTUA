  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a first in human research study (Phase I clinical trial) to test the safety and
      effectiveness of a new radioactive PET imaging drug and biomarker [68Ga]-NOTA-hGZP. It is a
      multi-center, open label, non-randomized, single dose drug trial in metastatic melanoma or
      NSCLC participants.

    <intervention_model_description>Multiple center, open label, non-randomized, single dose study, in metastatic melanoma or NSCLC subjects. Eligible subjects will receive an injection of [68Ga]-NOTA-hGZP followed by dynamic PET imaging. The images will be analyzed for the distribution of radioactivity. Subjects will be followed for adverse events for approximately 5-6 hours post injection or until pembrolizumab injection plus a follow up phone call to assess adverse events 1-3 days after injection.</intervention_model_description>
