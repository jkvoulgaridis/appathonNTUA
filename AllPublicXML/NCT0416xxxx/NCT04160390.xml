    <textblock>
      This trial uses blood samples to understand how patients' bodies process and respond to a
      drug called cyclophosphamide given after a donor stem cell transplant. Identifying biomarkers
      (molecules that can indicate normal or abnormal processes) may help researchers develop a
      blood test that can be used to predict how well patients will process and respond to
      cyclophosphamide.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether endogenous metabolomics compounds obtained before cyclophosphamide
      administration can predict the ratio of 4hydroxycyclophosphamide to cyclophosphamide area
      under the curve (4HCY/CY AUC).

      II. To validate mathematic models of CY and mycophenolic acid (MPA) pharmacokinetics and
      develop mathematic models including these pharmacokinetics, -omics data and clinical
      outcomes.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess if recipients' metabolomics and pharmacokinetics (e.g., CY and it's metabolites
      AUCs) are associated with acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) and other clinical outcomes.

      II. To assess the association of the intestinal microbiome with the plasma metabolome, acute
      GVHD and other clinical outcomes.

      III. To obtain donor blood samples at one time pre-transplant and assess if donors'
      metabolomics are associated with acute GVHD and other clinical outcomes.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Donor and recipient germline deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) isolation and genomic analysis.

      OUTLINE: Participants are assigned to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I (PATIENTS RECEIVING A HAPLOIDENTICAL TRANSPLANT): Patients undergo collection of blood
      prior to transplant, on day 0, days 3-7, day 14, and day 21. Patients also undergo collection
      of saliva prior to transplant and collection of stool prior to and post-transplant. Donors
      undergo collection of blood and saliva within 8 weeks prior to donation.

      ARM II (PATIENTS RECEIVING A NON-HAPLOIDENTICAL TRANSPLANT): Patients undergo collection of
      blood prior to transplant and on days 0, 3, and 4. Patients also undergo collection of stool
      prior to and post-transplant. Donors undergo collection of blood and saliva within 8 weeks
      prior to donation.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Ratio of 4hydroxycyclophosphamide to cyclophosphamide area under the curve (4HCY/CY AUC)</measure>
    <time_frame>At days 3 and 4 after post transplant cyclophosphamide infusion</time_frame>
    <description>Will test the associations of this outcome with each of the four pathways represented in the two targeted assays. As several metabolites within a pathway may act in concert with respect to their association with y, will perform the pathway-wise testing using the ROAST (rotation of residuals) method for testing sets of genes (endogenous metabolomics compounds). Further interpretation and evaluation of the strength of pathway metabolites will be supplemented with tools that include kernel association tests and visualization as in MetaboAnalyst. Will perform variable selection using a penalized regression framework among the pathway sets significantly associated with 4HCY/CY and will incorporate biological or empirical correlation structure into the variable selection process. All regression models will be adjusted for relevant covariates. The resulting set of metabolites will be used to construct a multiple regression prediction model for the ratio of 4HCY/CY AUC.</description>

    <description>Will be measured by flow cytometry. Conventional T cell proliferation (Ki-67+ of all viable CD3+CD4+CD25 negative [-]Foxp3-cells) and Tregs percentages at day 3, 5, 7, 14, and 21 also will be assessed for analysis of time-dependent effects.</description>

    <measure>Development of mathematical models of PK, -omics, and clinical outcomes</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to day 21</time_frame>
    <description>Will develop a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model to predict the impact of various covariates on the pharmacokinetics of CY and its metabolites. The modeling and simulation will be performed using Simcyp or other appropriate PBPK modeling software. This model will be considered adequate based on visual predictive plots. After the PBPK model is validated, a hybrid popPK-PBPK model will be created in which the CY concentrations from the central compartment are inputs into the plasma compartment of the PBPK model.</description>
