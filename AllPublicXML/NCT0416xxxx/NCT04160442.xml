  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to test the feasibility of a Patient Preferences in Shared
      Decision-Making encounter tool (PPSDM) in the clinical context of Diffuse Large B-Cell
      Lymphoma (DLBCL) and Follicular Lymphoma (FL). This project will evaluate the feasibility of
      a shared decision-making (SDM) model that employs an &quot;encounter tool&quot;1 to facilitate SDM at
      the point of a treatment decision for patients with DLBCL and FL.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This project is a single-arm pilot project conducted with 90 patients with newly diagnosed or
      recurrent DLBCL or FL and their providers at three medical oncology practices. Utilizing the
      PPSDM tool in the Carevive electronic platform, patients will report their needs,
      preferences, values and goal prior to the treatment decision-making focused clinical
      encounter. The treating provider will receive the patient results prior to the visit and can
      use these to facilitate SDM in treatment selection during the clinical encounter.
      Post-encounter, patients and providers will complete measures designed to assess feasibility
      and utility of SDM intervention. Patients will also complete measures to assess patient
      satisfaction with the treatment decision, patient activation, and patient perceived
      achievement of desired role in shared decision making and satisfaction with care.
