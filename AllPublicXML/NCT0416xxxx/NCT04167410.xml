  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluated to the effects of a glycaemic control protocol directed by nurses during
      the perioperative period on glycaemic outcomes in diabetic patients undergoing major
      abdominal surgery. The study was conducted at the department of general surgery of a research
      and training hospital.The study included 47 patients who underwent elective major abdominal
      surgery between September 2017 and December 2018. The number of patients in the intervention
      and the control groups was 22 and 25, respectively. The glycemia control protocol will be
      used in the glycemia management of intervention group,routine glycemia management will be
      used in the control group.

    <textblock>
      The prevalence of diabetes among the surgical patient population is 10-15%, and surgical
      operations are administered to diabetic patients more frequently compared to non-diabetic
      patients. Diabetes or hyperglycaemia in surgical patients increases mortality and morbidity
      rates during the perioperative period by 50% compared to non-diabetic patients. Maintaining
      patient blood glucose (BG) levels of within the target range during the surgical period is
      crucial to prevent postoperative complications. The target BG level has been modified in line
      with recent scientific findings; institutions (such as the American Diabetes Association),
      have prepared new guidelines for the management of glycaemia in critically ill and surgical
      patients. Insulin infusion is the most effective method to control glycaemia in patients with
      critical disease or in patients about to undergo major surgery. Therefore, current guidelines
      recommend the use of reliable and practical glycaemia control protocols during insulin
      infusion. These protocols should be learnt by all members of the team that provide
      healthcare. Existing studies suggest that glycaemic management protocols are effective
      methods to achieve the target BG range and decrease the prevalence of hyperglycaemia and
      hypoglycaemia in critically ill and major surgery patients in a reliable and effective way.

    <description>We did not perform any intervention on the patients in the control group. These patients received routine glycaemia control and healthcare provided to diabetic patients undergoing surgical intervention in the department of general surgery.After receiving written informed consent, the first part of the data collection form on the socio-demographic and disease characteristics of the patients were completed face-to-face. The BG levels of the patients and the medications and insulin used for glycaemic control were recorded one night before surgery. The anxiety levels of the patients were evaluated on the morning of surgery using State-Trait Anxiety Inventory . The second part of the data collection form , which included information on glycaemic management, glycaemia levels and the medications and insulin used on the morning of surgery and during surgery, intensive care stay and the clinical period, was filled in by the nurse on the monitoring and anaesthesia forms.</description>

    <description>Following the introduction of the glycaemic management protocol to the clinic, data on the patients in the intervention group was collected prospectively between June 2018 and December 2018. Data of the patients in the intervention group was collected after the patient applied to the hospital for surgery or just after the decision on surgery was taken. Patients in the intervention group whose HbA1C values exceeded 7% were referred to endocrinology specialists prior to surgery. Glycaemic management of these patients was evaluated at the department of endocrinology and medications or doses of insulin and oral antidiabetics were changed when necessary. Glycaemic management was conducted by nurses in line with the protocolConsequently, the glycaemic management of patients during the perioperative period was conducted by general surgery nurses according to the protocol.</description>
