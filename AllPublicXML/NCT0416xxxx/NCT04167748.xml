      To compare pregnancy and live birth rates after untested blastocyst transfer compared to
      transfer of a single euploid blastocyst after PGT-A among women over age 36 using an intent
      to treat analysis.

    <textblock>
      Pre-implantation genetic testing for aneuploidy (PGT-A) is routinely performed as part of in
      vitro fertilization (IVF) with the goal of screening for large chromosomal deletions or
      duplications and identifying chromosomally normal, or euploid, embryos for subsequent
      transfer. PGT-A is currently offered to any infertile patient pursuing IVF treatment. By
      screening a cohort of embryos created from IVF using PGT-A and selecting the chromosomally
      normal embryos for transfer, PGT-A has been shown in several studies of infertile patients to
      decrease time to pregnancy and decrease miscarriage rates. The likelihood of chromosomal
      abnormalities in an embryo is strongly correlated with maternal age, with increasing maternal
      age also associated with increased miscarriage rate. The benefit of PGT-A for improving live
      birth rate and decreasing miscarriage rate has been shown among young patients (less than 35
      years of age) who typically have several embryos from a single IVF cycle, thus can utilize
      PGT-A as a selection tool to prioritize chromosomally normal embryos for transfer. Patients
      undergoing PGT-A, regardless of age, are encouraged to obtain standard antenatal screening as
      recommended by their obstetrician and PGT-A does not replace any non-invasive or invasive
      antenatal screening test.

      The benefit of PGT-A for improving clinical outcomes in poor prognosis, older patients,
      however, is not well established. In this patient population the risks, benefits and costs of
      PGT-A may vary. Older patients have a higher risk of having chromosomally abnormal embryos
      from an IVF cycle, which are not recommended for subsequent embryo transfer. Older patients
      also typically have lower ovarian reserve, and therefore a smaller number of embryos from a
      single IVF cycle. Therefore, older patients who elect for PGT-A have a risk of having no
      chromosomally normal embryos for transfer due to a small number of embryos in the cohort and
      a high rate of chromosomal abnormalities (for example, 80% of embryos from a 40 year old
      patient would be expected to be chromosomally abnormal). Risks of PGT-A include damage to the
      embryo as part of the embryo biopsy and freeze/thaw cycle and cost. The risk/benefit ratio of
      PGT-A among older patients has not been rigorously evaluated. As a tangible first step, our
      current objective is to conduct a prospective randomized study evaluating the benefit of
      PGT-A in poor prognosis patients. To achieve this objective, the investigators propose the
      following specific aim: To compare pregnancy and live birth rates after untested blastocyst
      transfer compared to transfer of a single euploid blastocyst after PGT-A among women over age
      36 using an intent to treat analysis.
