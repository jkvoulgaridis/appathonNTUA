    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the safety and efficacy of AL3818 (anlotinib) hydrochloride in
      combination with Opdivo (nivilumab) for the treatment patients with of metastatic, advanced,
      or recurrent solid tumors. All participants will receive open-label AL3818 with nivolumab.
      Part 1 consists of a dose finding phase to determine the recommended phase 2 dosage of AL3818
      with nivolumab. Part 2 consists of a dose expansion phase, evaluating the safety and efficacy
      of the combination in patients cohorts including metastatic, advanced, or recurrent soft
      tissue sarcomas, non-small cell lung cancer, and small cell lung cancer.

      This phase 1b/2 study evaluates the safety and efficacy of AL3818 (anlotinib) hydrochloride
      in combination with Opdivo (nivilumab) for the treatment patients with of metastatic,
      advanced, or recurrent solid tumors including soft tissue sarcomas (STS), non-small cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC), and small cell lung cancer (SCLC). All participants will receive open-label
      AL3818 with nivolumab on a scheduled basis.

      Part 1 (phase 1b) consists of a dose finding phase to determine the safety, tolerability
      (including recommended phase 2 dosage (RP2D), and PK profile of AL3818 given with nivolumab.
      Participants will receive oral AL3818 once daily on Days 1-14 and nivolumab injection on Day
      1 and 15 of one 21-day cycle.

      Part 2 (phase 2a) consists of a dose expansion phase, to evaluate the safety and preliminary
      efficacy of combination treatment using AL3818 at the RP2D determined from Part 1 together
      with nivolumab injection at standard dosing for patients with metastatic, advanced, or
      recurrent STS, NSCLC, or SCLC in 21-day cycles. Oral AL3818 will be given on Days 1-14 days
      and nivolumab will be given every 2 weeks, for up to 24 cycles of total AL3818 therapy.
