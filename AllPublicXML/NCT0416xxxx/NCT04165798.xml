  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is referred to as the &quot;umbrella master protocol&quot; for pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in
      the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This pembrolizumab NSCLC umbrella master
      protocol uses a platform design and consists of this master screening study and three
      substudies. Each substudy will enroll a different population of NSCLC participants.

      The goal of this umbrella master protocol is to screen potential participants with NSCLC for
      enrollment into 1 of 3 substudies. Participants must first enroll in this pembrolizumab
      master protocol study and undergo screening for NSCLC that will be used to assign them to
      participation in 1 of 3 pembrolizumab substudies.

      The following 3 pembrolizumab substudies will evaluate the efficacy of different
      investigational agents in combination with pembrolizumab given in sequence or in combination
      with pembrolizumab PLUS chemotherapy:

        -  Substudy 1: A Phase 2, Umbrella Study with Rolling Arms of Investigational Agents with
           Pembrolizumab in Combination with Chemotherapy in Treatment-Naïve Patients with Advanced
           Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) (MK-3475-01A) - NCT04165070

        -  Substudy 2: A Phase 2, Umbrella Study with Rolling Arms of Investigational Agents in
           Combination with Pembrolizumab in Treatment Naïve Patients with PD-L1 Positive Advanced
           Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) (MK-3475-01B) - NCT04165083

        -  Substudy 3: A Phase 2, Umbrella Study with Rolling Arms of Investigational Agents in
           Combination with Pembrolizumab in Patients with Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
           (NSCLC) Previously Treated with anti-PD-(L)1 Therapy (MK-3475-01C) - NCT04165096
