  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, paired control study to evaluate the safety and clinical
      efficacy of allogeneic NK cells combined with targeted drug in the treatment for advanced
      HCC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) mismatch can inhibit the negative
      regulatory signal of autologous major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules and ensure
      sufficient NK cell activation, allogeneic NK cells therapy, as a potential therapeutic option
      for tumor, has achieved good results in patients with acute myeloid leukemia. In this study,
      investigators evaluate the safety and efficacy of allogeneic NK cells in the treatment of
      advanced HCC. 200 patients from three hospitals will be enrolled in this study and followed
      up for 1 year. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from patient-related
      donor and cultured in vitro for 15 days and infused to the patient in two consecutive days.
      Clinical data and laboratory data were collected and analyzed, including survival, impact
      indicators, hematology, biochemical indicators, and immunological indicators to evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of the treatment.
