  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized control trial comparing the outcome of ORIF (open reduction and internal
      fixation) with EHA (elbow hemiarthroplasty) for distal humeral fractures in patients aged 50
      years or above.

    <textblock>
      Intraarticular distal humeral fractures AO/OTA type C2 and C3 pose a surgical challenge
      despite the evolution of surgical implants and techniques. Open reduction and internal
      fixation (ORIF) is often preferred as the first choice of treatment, but the results are
      varying, and sometimes disappointing. Total elbow arthroplasty (TEA) has been widely used for
      fractures that are not amenable to ORIF in elderly patients, but the mechanical complications
      remain a challenge, especially in active patients. Elbow hemiarthroplasty (EHA) provides a
      modern alternative that might avoid the mechanical complications and weight bearing
      restrictions related to the linked articulation in semiconstrained TEA. There are no studies
      comparing the results of EHA to that of TEA or ORIF, but case series have reported promising
      results.

      In this study, forty-four patients with AO/OTA type C2 or C3 fractures of distal humerus will
      be randomized to either ORIF or EHA. The patients will be examined after the operation and at
      3 months and 1, 2, 5 and 10 years after the surgery. The main objective of this study is to
      investigate the best treatment option for distal humeral fractures in patients aged 50 years
      or above. This can be of value to future patients sustaining these complicated fractures.

    <measure>Oxford Elbow Score (OES)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years after surgery.</time_frame>
    <description>The OES is a 12-item patient-administrated questionnaire that measures the quality of life in patients with elbow disorder. There are three unidimensional domains: Elbow function, pain, and social-psychological status. Each question is answered on a 5-point scale with each question contributing equally to the total score.Thus, the total score ranges from 12-60, with 60 being the worst. For ease of presentation the score is converted to a scale from 0-48 with 48 being the best. The outcome can be interpreted based on a 48-point scale: 0 - 19 - poor; 20-29 - fair; 30-39 - good; and 40-48 - excellent. The Danish version which will be used in this study, has been translated and cultural adapted according to the guidelines by Guillemin, Bombardier and Beaton.</description>

    <measure>Mayo Elbow Performance Score (MEPS)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months after surgery and 1, 2, 5, and 10 years after surgery.</time_frame>
    <description>The MEPS is a surgeon-administrated instrument that evaluates the outcome after elbow surgery. There are four domains including: Pain (0-45 points), range of motion (0-20 points), stability (0-10 points) and difficulties in daily activities (0-25 points).The outcome can be interpreted based on a 100 points scale: 0 - 60 - poor; 60-74 - fair; 75-89 - good; and 90-100 - excellent.</description>

    <description>Pain is answered on a visual analogue scale (VAS) ranging from 0 to 10, with 10 being the worst and 0 represents a pain free elbow.</description>
