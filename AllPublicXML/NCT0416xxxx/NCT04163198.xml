  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with neuromuscular diseases (NMD) can suffer from a range of respiratory problems
      due to respiratory muscle weakness. Cough muscle weakness means secretion clearance from the
      airways can be problematic, a source of infection, and importantly a cause of death, in this
      patient group. Therefore, these patients are often supported with devices to aid clearance,
      such as mechanical insufflation-exsufflation (MIE). Although evidence supports the use of
      these devices, the optimal technique or settings on the device are not clear. Increasingly,
      higher pressures are used during MIE and recent work has demonstrated that there may be a
      physiological benefit to this. However, higher pressures increase the risk of causing lung
      collapse and may cause detriment to blood flow back to the heart, which is important as NMD
      patients frequently have concurrent heart muscle weakness. Further, recent work has
      demonstrated that higher pressures can cause closure of the throat, which is
      counter-productive in secretion clearance.

      The overall aim of this study is to investigate methods to manipulate MIE to improve
      secretion clearance in patients with NMD. The questions it seeks to answer are:

      (i) how can we maximally improve lung recruitment during inspiration, whilst maintaining
      patient comfort and lower pressures (ii) what is the smallest pressure difference required in
      expiration to achieve an improvement in cough (iii) do these proposed changes to MIE also
      cause throat closure (iv) what factors do patients believe contribute to their adherence to
      MIE therapy?

      Patients with slowly progressive or stable neuromuscular diseases will be included in the
      study. Participation will involve two visits to the Lane Fox Respiratory Unit, each lasting
      approximately four hours. Patients will be recruited from specialist neuromuscular
      respiratory clinics by their clinical teams.
