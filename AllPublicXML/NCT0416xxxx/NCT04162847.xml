  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of mental health problems among college populations has risen steadily in
      recent decades, with one third of today's students struggling with anxiety, depression, or an
      eating disorder (ED). Yet, only 20-40% of college students with mental disorders receive
      treatment. Inadequacies in mental health care delivery result in prolonged illness, disease
      progression, poorer prognosis, and greater likelihood of relapse, highlighting the need for a
      new approach for detecting mental health problems and engaging college students in services.
      The investigators have developed a transdiagnostic, low-cost mobile health targeted
      prevention and intervention platform that uses population-level screening for engaging
      college students in tailored services that address common mental health problems. This care
      delivery system represents an ideal model given its use of evidence-based mobile programs, a
      transdiagnostic approach that addresses comorbid mental health issues, and personalized
      screening and intervention to increase service uptake, enhance engagement, and improve
      outcomes. Further, this service delivery model harnesses the expertise of an
      interdisciplinary team of behavioral scientists, college student mental health scholars,
      technology researchers, and health economists. This work bridges the study team's collective
      leadership over the past 25 years in successfully implementing a population-based screening
      program in more than 160 colleges and demonstrating the effectiveness of Internet-based
      programs for targeted prevention and intervention for anxiety, depression, and EDs. Through
      this study, Investigators will test the impact of this mobile mental health platform for
      service delivery in a large-scale trial across a diverse range of U.S. colleges. Students who
      screen positive or at high-risk for clinical anxiety, depression, or EDs (excluding anorexia
      nervosa, for which more intensive medical monitoring is warranted) and who are not currently
      engaged in mental health services will be randomly assigned to: 1) intervention via the
      mobile mental health platform; or 2) referral to usual care (i.e., campus health or
      counseling center).

      Participants in the study will be enrolled for 2 years and asked to complete surveys at
      baseline, 6 weeks, 6 months, and 2 years.

    <description>Effectiveness of the mobile mental health platform, compared to usual care, in reducing or preventing the number of individuals with mental health disorders (i.e., a positive screen for at least one of anxiety, depression, or eating disorder as the outcome reflecting a &quot;clinical case&quot;), assessed at 6 months and 2 years, with a primary endpoint of 2 years. Clinical case status will be determined using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire-IV (GAD-Q-IV) for generalized anxiety disorder, Social Phobia Diagnostic Questionnaire (SPDQ) for social anxiety disorder, the Panic Disorder Self Report (PDSR) for panic disorder, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) for depression, and the Stanford-Washington University Eating Disorders Screen for eating disorders</description>

    <time_frame>6 weeks, 6 months, and 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Uptake will be assessed as engaging in at least one session of mental health service use either online or in-person. This will be assessed based on actual use of the mobile program in the intervention condition and self-report of mental health services utilized in the control condition.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline, 6 weeks, 6 months, and 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Analyses will be conducted within each disorder subgroup separately. We will use the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire-IV (GAD-Q-IV) for generalized anxiety disorder, the Social Phobia Diagnostic Questionnaire (SPDQ) for social anxiety disorder, the Panic Disorder Self Report (PDSR) for panic disorder, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) for depression, and the Eating Disorder Examination-Questionnaire (EDE-Q) for eating disorders.</description>

    <description>This group will receive access to the mobile intervention for 6 months. They will be assigned to the primary program (i.e., anxiety, depression, or eating disorders) they screen positive for. If a person screens positive for more than one disorder, they will be given the choice of which program they want to start with. They will also be provided preventive interventions for anxiety, depressive, or eating of disorders they may not have but be at risk for. After two weeks in the program, the coach will assign the components presumed to be essential to intervention effects for comorbid disorder(s) and risk factors.</description>
