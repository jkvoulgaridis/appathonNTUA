  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is the most common chronic respiratory disease worldwide. Despite advances in asthma
      management, control of the disease is still a challenge especially among children.
      Information and communications technology (ICT) have been recently used in clinical practice
      to increase awareness of diseases, encourage patients to engage in the management of their
      conditions and improve monitoring and surveillance. The investigators of this study will test
      a new digital platform combining online/offline content aimed to improve asthma control and
      reduce exacerbations and unnecessary consultations in children with difficult-to-control
      asthma. A randomised controlled trial enrolling 60 patients allocated in two groups has been
      designed. The intervention group (IG) will be granted free access during 6 months to a
      web-based platform. During this period, patient will have access to online/off line content
      to improve disease awareness, monitor signs and symptoms and will also get the support of a
      respiratory coach. In addition, patients in this group will receive an electronic peak flow
      meter to register daily variations in maximal expiratory flow and an electronic device to
      connect to their inhaler to track adequate intake of inhaled medication. The control group
      (CG) will receive usual care consisted of scheduled visitations to medical doctors every 4 -
      8 weeks. Both groups will be evaluated at baseline, post-intervention (6 months) and at
      follow up (one year) in the following variables: age, gender, asthma severity classification
      according to international guidelines, date of diagnosis, weight, height, Body Mass Index
      (BMI), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), Asthma Control Questionnaire score,
      treatment received for asthma, number of exacerbations in the previous 6 months and
      concomitant diseases. Exacerbations will be defined as any worsening in asthma symptoms that
      requires an increase in the usual therapy, an unscheduled physician visit, treatment in the
      emergency room or hospitalization.

    <description>Participants in the IG will be given free access to the HappyAir platform during a 6-month period. This platform combines online/offline content to help patients with chronic respiratory diseases monitor their symptoms and improve self-management. In addition to tailored information on their condition, participants will be encouraged to fill in daily data on their physical activity levels, symptomatology, use of rescue medication and mood. In children under 12 years, parents or caregivers will fill in this information. Patients will be asked to record their peak expiratory flow using an electronic peak flow meter twice daily and to fulfil the Asthma Control Questionnaire once a week. They will also have a device connected to their inhaler to record adherence to the medical treatment and will get daily reminders in their smartphones. Every patient will be assigned a respiratory coach who will monitor patient during the study and whom the patients can contact at any time.</description>
