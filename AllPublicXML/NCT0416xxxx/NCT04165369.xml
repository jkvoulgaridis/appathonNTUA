  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The evaluation of an accurate occurrence rate for AKI is of great importance for health
      policy, quality initiatives as well as for designing clinical trials.

      The primary objective is to prospectively evaluate the incidence of AKI within 72 h after
      extended surgical procedures that require admission to an observation unit.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a severe clinical complication with increasing incidence and is
      associated with adverse short- and long-term outcomes resulting in a major health care burden
      worldwide. The introduction of consensus classification systems has enhanced the awareness
      for AKI. The evaluation of an accurate occurrence rate for AKI is of great importance for
      health policy, quality initiatives as well as for designing clinical trials. However,
      analyzing AKI from existing databases is often limited by missing data elements, especially
      the inclusion of the urine output criteria. Missing data and the use of different definitions
      before the consensus classification are the reasons for large variations in reported
      occurrences of surgical induced AKI.

      The primary objective is to prospectively evaluate the incidence of AKI within 72 h after
      extended surgical procedures that require admission to an observation unit (e.g., ICU, IMC,
      PACU) using the latest consensus definition for AKI (Kidney Disease: Improving Global
      Outcomes criteria) and a standardized data collection instrument and to assess the dependence
      of AKI on preoperative and intraoperative factors.

      Method: International prospective, observational, multi-center, cross-sectional cohort study

      Eligible patients will be identified during preoperative assessment. All eligible patients
      will be approached to obtain written consent.
