  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lipedema is a chronic, progressive adipose tissue disorder that is mostly seen as a
      symmetrical growth of the hips and legs, affecting women. The aim of this study is to
      investigate the effect of trunk stabilization exercises in addition to active range of motion
      exercises on body composition, pain, edema, trunk endurance, functional capacity and postural
      stability.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thirty female patients with upper and lower leg lipedemia were included in the study.

      Subjects were divided into two groups as experimental (n = 15) and control (n = 15).

      The physiotherapy program of the control group will consist of active range of motion
      exercises and the physiotherapy program in the experimental group will include active range
      of motion exercises as well as trunk stabilization exercises. After recording demographic
      data of all subjects, limb volume (environmental measurement), body composition analysis,
      trunk endurance, pain (Visual Analogue Scale), postural stability (Biodex Balance System®)
      and functional capacities (6-Minute Walk Test) will be taken.

      After the six-week treatment program, all evaluations will be repeated. SPSS (SPSS 21.0)
      program was used for statistical analysis of the data. Significance level in all analyzes
      will be accepted as p &lt;0.05.
