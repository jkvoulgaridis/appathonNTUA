  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see whether using the 64Cu-NOTA-PSMA-PEG-Cy5.5-C' dot tracer
      is a safe way to identify tumor cells before and during surgery for prostate cancer. The
      researchers want to find out whether PET/MRI scans done after the injection of this
      investigational tracer are more accurate than the usual imaging scans used to locate deposits
      of prostate tumor cells. The researchers will study how the tracer travels through your body
      and where it is distributed. This study is the first time that this tracer will be used in
      people who are undergoing surgery for prostate cancer.

    <description>Patients will receive an intravenous (IV) injection of approximately 5 mCi (+/- 10%) of PSMAtargeting C' dot tracer up to 48 hours before surgery. Patients will then undergo serial preoperative PET/MR imaging to help characterize the safety, biodistribution/pharmacokinetics, and dosimetry of this agent. To assess total radioactivity in whole blood/plasma and urine samples, as well as radioactive metabolites, blood and urine samples will be collected at approximately 30 min post-injection as well as before each imaging session</description>

          -  Age ≥18 years

          -  Patients with presence on CT or MRI of a pelvic node &gt; 10mm in short axis or a node
             with abnormal morphology such as roundness irregularity or loss of fatty hilum AND
             meeting one of the following criteria:

               -  Tumor clinical stage T3a or higher
