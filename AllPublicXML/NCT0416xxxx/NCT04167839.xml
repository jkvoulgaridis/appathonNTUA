  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigated the effects of a sensory diet intervention program on five children
      with a sensory processing disorder. The effect was investigated on children's sensory
      processing skills, psychosocial skills, and classroom engagement.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sensory diets are one of the interventions occupational therapists use in school-based
      settings to manage manifestations of sensory processing disorder. However, very few studies
      have investigated the effectiveness of sensory diets, and the results of these studies were
      mixed. Past studies also had methodological limitations. Therefore, this study investigated
      the effect of sensory diets on children's sensory processing skills, psychosocial skills, and
      engagement in classroom activities. This study used a single-subject ABCA design. Five
      children between the ages of five and eleven years participated in the study. The study
      consisted of an initial baseline phase A1, the control intervention phase B, sensory diets
      intervention phase C, and the second baseline phase A2. Each phase lasted for seven days. The
      PI videotaped each participant for fifteen minutes each school day during all phases to
      collect the data. The participants were videotaped during classroom group activities. Visual
      analysis of the data showed that sensory diets had a positive effect on participants' sensory
      processing, psychosocial skills, and classroom engagement.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        - Children between the ages of four and eleven years and attending pre-kindergarten through
        fourth grade

          -  Children eligible for occupational therapy services under the special education
             eligibility criteria or under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973-subpart D.
             This subpart of section 504 ensures children with disabilities who do not meet the
             eligibility criteria for special education services and are placed in general
             education classrooms receive the necessary support and related services (such as
             occupational therapy) to fully participate in general education classrooms.

          -  Children who scored in the Definite Difference range (+ 2 SD) or Probable Difference
             (+ 1 SD) ranges on two or more sections or quadrants on the Sensory Profile-2, Teacher
             Questionnaire (SP-2 Teacher Questionnaire; Dunn, 2015) were included in this study

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Children with medical concerns, such as cardiac conditions, posing risk to participate in
        resistive (strenuous) gross motor activities or children who used mobility devices were
        excluded from the study as these conditions may have hindered their participation in
        sensory diet activities.

          -  Children who were on medications, such as stimulants, anti-anxiety or anti-convulsive
             medications were excluded from the study as these medications may influence the
             clinical representation of SPD and interfere with the study outcomes.

          -  Children who were currently receiving sensory diets or received sensory diets six
             months prior to the beginning of the study were excluded from the study to control for
             confounding.
