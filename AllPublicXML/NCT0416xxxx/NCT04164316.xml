  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy and effectiveness of the application of
      Kinesio Taping in the short-term management of ITBFS in an exploratory randomized control
      study in two patient groups, an experimental group receiving Kinesio Taping with tension, and
      a control group receiving Kinesio Taping with no tension.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To determine the immediate effects of taping on the three-dimensional joint kinematics and
      moments of the lower limb during running in ITBFS patients, and to determine any differences
      between the experimental and control groups.

      To determine the immediate effects of taping on muscle activity of the gluteus maximus,
      gluteus medius, tensor fascia lata, vastus medialis, and vastus lateralis in ITBFS patients,
      and to determine any differences between the experimental and control groups.

      To determine if the short-term perceptions of pain, symptoms, ADL function, sport and
      recreation function, quality of Life, and fear of movement are changed with taping, and to
      determine any differences between the experimental and control groups.

      To determine any perceived changes in the stability of the knee joint, comfort and benefits
      with taping, and to determine any differences between the experimental and control groups.

      To determine if muscle strength, muscle length, and functional movement are changed with
      taping, and to determine any differences between the experimental and control groups.

      To explore the relationship between the clinical and biomechanical outcome measures in ITBFS
      patients.

    <measure>Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score</measure>
    <time_frame>one week</time_frame>
    <description>The Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score's five patient-relevant dimensions are scored separately: Pain (nine items); Symptoms (seven items); ADL Function (17 items); Sport and Recreation Function (five items); Quality of Life (four items). A Likert scale is used and all items have five possible answer options scored from 0 (No problems) to 4 (Extreme problems) and each of the five scores is calculated as the sum of the items included.</description>

    <description>The Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia is a 17 item questionnaire used to assess the subjective rating of kinesiophobia or fear of movement. A Likert scale is used and all items have four possible answer options scored from 1 (strongly disagree ) to 4 (strongly agree ).</description>
