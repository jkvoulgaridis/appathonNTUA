    <textblock>
      Radiological examinations that require the administration of iodinated contrasts (IC) for
      diagnostic and therapeutic purposes are essential in current clinical practice, and their use
      in interventional procedures has been progressively increasing.

      IC can cause kidney damage, so there is caution in their use in at-risk populations. This
      fact may limit its diagnostic use, with data on underutilization of interventional techniques
      in patients with renal insufficiency, which worsen their prognosis.

      In addition, once the use of IC contrasts is decided, preventive measures, such as
      hyperhydration,are used and can have potential side effects, especially in patients at risk
      of heart failure (acute coronary syndrome, low left ventricular ejection fraction).

      New biomarkers of kidney damage have recently been developed, based on the detection of
      molecules expressed by the kidney in situations of early damage. The quantitative
      determination of cell cycle arrest proteins (Tissue Inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2 (TIMP2)
      and Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein -7 (IGFBP7)) can be predictive of the
      development of moderate to severe contrast-associated acute kidney injury.

      Urinary determination of [TIMP-2] x [IGFBP7] in patients with ACS (acute coronary syndromes)
      before cardiac catheterization would allow early identification of those patients vulnerable
      to IC-induced toxicity and adjustment of preventive measures.

      Urinary determination of [TIMP-2] x [IGFBP7] in patients with ACS undergoing cardiac
      catheterization would allow early identification of those patients vulnerable to IC-induced
      toxicity and adjustment of both appropriate preventive measures.

      A prospective, descriptive observational study will be carried out to determine sensitivity
      and specificity of the urinary determination of TIMP2-IGFBP7 and predictive values in the
      early diagnosis of contrast-associated acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients admitted to the
      Coronary Care Unit (CCU) in a spanish hospital.

      OBJECTIVES

        -  PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: To determine the operational characteristics (sensitivity,
           specificity) of the TIMP2-IGFBP7 biomarker in routine clinical practice, in the early
           diagnosis of contrast-induced AKI (acute renal injury) in patients admitted to the CCU,
           exposed to iodinated contrasts. The established renal failure is defined as KDIGO
           (Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes) stage ≥ 2 in the 24 to 72 hours after the
           administration of contrasts.

        -  SECONDARY OBJECTIVES

      Evaluate these parameters according to the patient's initial risk level:

        -  Estimated renal function upon admission

        -  Initial severity estimated by GRACE score

        -  Sex

        -  Age

        -  Contrast media type and volume

        -  Patient weight

        -  Dose of contrast

        -  Diabetes

      A single determination (10 ml of fresh urine) should be collected in a sterile container and
      the laboratory should centrifuge them within the time of collection. Neither the attending
      physicians nor the investigators will know the results, and the treatment will not be
      influenced.

      The result is reported as a single value which is the concentration of TIMP-2 (ng / mL)
      multiplied by the concentration of IGFBP7 (ng / mL) divided by 1000. The result is reported
      without any unit or concentrations of individual biomarkers. As previously reported, a value
      of&gt; 0.3 identifies patients with a high probability of presenting a moderate to severe AKI
      (acute kidney injury) in 12 hours, while a value of ≤ 0.3 identifies patients with a low risk
      of developing a moderate to serious AKI

      An aliquot of urine will be stored at -80 ° C in the Clinical Analysis Department
