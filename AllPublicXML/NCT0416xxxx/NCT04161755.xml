             glomerulonephritis with the following caveats:

               -  Patients with a history of autoimmune hypothyroidism on a stable dose of thyroid
                  replacement hormone may be eligible

               -  Patient with controlled type 1 diabetes mellitus on a stable insulin regimen may
                  be eligible

          -  Patients type 2 diabetes mellitus may be eligible

             ° Patients with eczema, psoriasis, lichen simplex chronicus, or vitiligo with
             dermatologic manifestations only (e.g., no psoriatic arthritis) may be eligible
             provided that they meet the following conditions:

          -  Rash must cover less than 10% of the body surface area (BSA)

          -  Disease is well controlled at baseline and only requires low potency topical steroids

          -  No acute exacerbations of underlying condition within the last 12 months (e.g., not
             requiring psorlen and ultraviolet A (PUVA) radiation, methotrexate retinoids, biologic
             agents, oral calcineurin inhibitors, high potency, or oral steroids)

          -  Treatment with systemic immunosuppressive medication (including but not limited to
             prednisone &gt;10mg/day, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, methotrexate, thalidomide, and

             received acute, low-dose, systemic immunosuppressant medication (e.g., a one-time dose
             of dexamethasone for nausea) may be enrolled in the study after discussion with and
             approval by the PI and Co-PI. The use of inhaled corticosteroids (e.g., fluticasone
             for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) is allowed. The use of oral
             mineralocorticoids (e.g., flurocortisone for patients with orthostatic hypotension) is
             allowed. Physiologic doses of corticosteroids for adrenal insufficiency are allowed.

          -  Subjects with allergies to IV contrast agents requiring pretreatment with
             corticosteroids will be excluded. Corticosteroids are immunosuppressive and may
             interfere with RO7198457 tolerability and efficacy. Given that there are serial
             contrast agent-dependent follow-up imaging studies built into the study which will
             overlap with vaccination, subjects who require pretreatment with corticosteroids prior
             to IV contrast administration will be excluded

          -  History of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, pneumonitis (including drug induced),
             organizing pneumonia (i.e., bronchioloitis obliterans, cryptogenic organizing
             pneumonia, etc.), or evidence of active pneumonitis on screening chest CT scan.
             History of radiation pneumonitis in the radiation field (fibrosis) is permitted

          -  Known primary immunodeficiencies, either cellular (e.g., DiGeorge syndrome, T-negative
             severe combined immunodeficiency [SCID]) or combined T- and B-cell immunodeficiencies
             (e.g., T- and B-negative SCID, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, ataxia telangiectasia, common
             variable immunodeficiency)

          -  Prior allogeneic bone marrow transplantation or prior solid organ transplantation

          -  Any other disease, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical
             laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that would
             contraindicate the use of an investigational drug

          -  Known clinically significant liver disease, including active viral, alcoholic, or
             other hepatitis, cirrhosis, and inherited liver disease or current alcohol abuse

          -  Previous splenectomy

          -  Administration of a live, attenuated vaccine within 4 weeks before RO7198457
             administration or anticipation that such a live attenuated vaccine will be required
             during the study. Influenza vaccination should be given during influenza season only.
             Patients must not receive live, attenuated influenza vaccine (e.g., FluMist) within 4
             weeks prior to RO7198457 administration or at any time during the study, and for 90
             days following the last study treatment
