  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The cornea is the clear layer in front of the iris and pupil. It protects the iris and lens
      and helps focus light on the retina. Corneal diseases are serious conditions that can cause
      clouding, distortion, scarring and eventually blindness. There are several types of corneal
      disease with keratoconus being one of the most prominent.

      Keratoconus is a weakening and thinning of the central cornea. This thinking causes the
      cornea to develop a cone-shaped deformity leading to vison loss. Keratoconus is usually
      bilateral affecting people between 10 and 25.

      This project aims to collect data on patient suffering with corneal diseases and the
      treatments they receive, including corneal transplantation, over a period of time during
      routine clinical practice.

      A clinical registry such as this can be a very useful tool to provide a real-world view of
      clinical practice, patient outcomes, safety, and comparative effectiveness.

      •Methods:

      Data will be collected from the medical records of patients who have suffered from corneal
      disease and have undergone treatment in the Ophthalmology department of the CHU Montpellier.

      A standardized set of data will be collected for all patients. This will include, demographic
      and social date such as lifestyle and occupation, current and past pathologies and treatment
      received. This is data that is already collected as part of routine clinical practice.

      This will be an ongoing registry with the aim of collecting the maximum data possible. The
      more patients that are entered and the longer the follow up for each patient, the more
      valuable the data will become.

      •Discussion:

      The aim of this registry to help create a better understanding of variations in treatment and
      outcomes; to examine factors that influence prognosis; to describe treatment patterns,
      including appropriateness and effectiveness of treatment and disparities in the delivery of
      care; to monitor safety and harm and to measure quality of care.

      In the long term the data collected in the registry may serve as a basis for the development
      of evidence-based clinical management guidelines to help clinicians deliver the most
      appropriate treatment for corneal diseases in the safest and most efficient manner.
