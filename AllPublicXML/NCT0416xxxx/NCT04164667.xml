      The objective of this study is to examine the effectiveness of a telehealth intervention
      intended to augment several factors related to brain health and cognition in Veterans with
      chronic multi-symptom illness. This pilot study innovatively merges with ongoing clinical
      practice at the War Related Illness and Injury Study Center to explore if utilizing new VA
      technologies and distance-bridging approaches can improve executive function by promoting
      health behaviors (e.g. physical activity and mindfulness meditation, called mental and
      physical training or MAP). Not only does this study intend to examine the feasibility of
      using these tools within the home setting and integrating these practices into the weekly
      lives of Veterans, but it also aims to determine the best way to provide this type of
      intervention by comparing a text-message based directed MAP (dMAP) arm to a self-guided MAP
      (sgMAP) arm. Understanding how much guidance to provide Veterans during their path towards
      recovery is important since we hope that this pilot study will offer not only evidence that
      these practices can be administered without supervision but also reveal that giving Veterans
      the right tools (exercise and meditation app on tablet), guidance (directed text message or
      holistic goals), and support (video-chat health coaching) can have measurable benefits on
      symptom severity and function.
