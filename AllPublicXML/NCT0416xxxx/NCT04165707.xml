  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Very low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet may have beneficial metabolic and weight loss effects,
      however, adhering to this diet may be challenging. Keyto is a self-monitoring and
      app-enhanced intervention to help individuals learn about and monitor their breath acetone (a
      measure of ketosis) levels to promote dietary change and weight loss. The purpose of this
      research is to test the Keyto self-monitoring + app intervention against a &quot;standard of care&quot;
      weight loss dietary app (Weight Watchers). 144 participants will be recruited through
      Facebook ads, provide online consent, and will be randomized to one of the two conditions.
      Weight loss after 12 weeks will be assessed as the primary outcome, with weight loss at 24
      and 48 weeks being secondary outcomes. Blood samples will be collected at baseline and 12
      weeks with optional blood samples at 48 weeks follow up.
