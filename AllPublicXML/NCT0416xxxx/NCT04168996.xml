  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with rib fractures may develop pneumonia and even respiratory failure requiring
      critical care, ventilator management, and hospitalization. Discharge planning is a broad
      range of time-limited services designed to ensure healthcare continuity, avoid preventable
      poor outcomes among at-risk populations, and promote the safe and timely transfer of patients
      care.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Lung Injury Score (LIS).</measure>
    <time_frame>Change during the hospitalization, after a week, and after 6 months follow up</time_frame>
    <description>This score was assessed the progression of the lung injury and the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome. The final value was obtained by dividing the sum of the variables used: no injury (LIS=0), mild to moderate (LIS≥0.1), severe (LIS&gt;2.5). We were allocated with a cutoff in the score of LIS.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change during the hospitalization, after a week, and after 6 months follow up</time_frame>
    <description>This measure contains two sections, a descriptive questionnaire about health impairment and a numerical scale about health status perception. The descriptive section includes five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension is categorized into three levels of functioning for each of the five dimensions. The numerical scale ranges from 0 (defined as the worst imaginable health state) to 100 (defined as the best imaginable health state</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Barthel Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Change during the hospitalization, after a week, and after 6 months follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The Barthel Index assesses the level of dependence required by patient to perform the activities. The item scores are totaled which may vary from 0 (total dependence) to 100 (fully independent).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Blaylock Risk Assessment Screening Score (BRASS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change during the hospitalization, after a week, and after 6 months follow up</time_frame>
    <description>It comprises a 10-item scale with a score between 0 and 40, with a higher score correlating with a greater likelihood of discharge complications and length of stay.
A score of 0-10 identifies patients at low risk for complications, 11-20 identifies those requiring discharge planning, and scores above 20 indicate patients who require extensive discharge planning.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Early Screen for Discharge Planning (ESDP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change during the hospitalization, after a week, and after 6 months follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The question screening tool was composed for several items (age, living status, disability, and self-reported walking limitation). The score was between 0 and 23. A positive score (≥ 10) was found to indicate the need for automatic referral for complex discharge planning</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Newcastle Satisfaction with Nursing Scales (NSNS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change during the hospitalization, after a week, and after 6 months follow up</time_frame>
    <description>This measure contains two scales, the experiences of nursing care scale (cognitive evaluation), and the satisfaction with nursing care scale (emotional evaluation). Item scores for each of the scales are summed so that the two scale with scores range from 0 (the best care and full satisfaction) to 100 (the worse care and no satisfaction).</description>
