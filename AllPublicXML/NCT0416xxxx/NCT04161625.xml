  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose is to evaluate reach, effects and costs effectiveness of a mobile, fall
      prevention exercise program for older community-dwelling persons (70+ years) in a pragmatic
      trial.

      Information about the study will be spread to the population by letters sent to all
      households with someone aged 70 years or older, presentations for senior organizations,
      advertisements on busses, health care centers, senior centers and in social media.
      Participants will be recruited in one municipality through the website
      (www.ostersund.se/sakrasteg) including information about the aim and procedures of the study.
      If seniors themselves judge that they are eligible to participate in the study, they can
      register by providing their email address. After baseline assessment, through self-reports in
      a digital survey, participants will get access to the mobile health application. The
      estimated target group is 2600 persons. Recruitment will be ongoing for six months. The
      intervention is delivered through the Safe Step application, developed in co-creation with
      seniors and researchers. Safe Step provides a large repository of evidence-based balance and
      strength exercises in video formats alongside falls preventive information and advice. With
      the Safe Step app the user can compose an individualized exercise program suitable for their
      needs. To help the user adhere to the program a set of behaviour change techniques is
      provided by the program. The user can set their own goals, get reminders and positive
      feedback form a virtual physiotherapist, and follow their own progress. Advice on how to
      integrate the exercises into everyday activities is also offered. The participants will
      exercise on their own with the help of the application for one year, with a recommendation of
      30 minutes at least 3 times/week. In addition, participants will get monthly emails with
      falls preventive information in short videos, they will also be asked to report any falls by
      responding to a survey attached to the message.

      In order to maximize reach and to support participants to get started using the Safe Step
      application, technical support and group-based exercise will be provided.

      The interventions will last for 1 year with follow up assessments at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months
      in addition to the monthly fall reports. Effects and cost effectiveness will be evaluated in
      relation to a previously registered RCT NCT03963570.

    <description>Health related quality of life is assessed by the EuroQol 5 dimension 5 level self-report questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L).
The EQ-5D-5L descriptive system comprises the following 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression, and a Visual Analogue scale (VAS). Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems. A 1-digit number express the level selected for each dimension. The digits for 5 dimensions can be combined in a 5-digit number describing the respondent's health state. It should be noted that the numerals 1-5 have no arithmetic properties. The VAS records the respondent's self-rated health on a vertical, visual analogue scale (ranging from 0-100) with endpoints labelled &quot;the best health you can imagine&quot; and &quot;the worst health you can imagine&quot;.</description>

    <description>All included participants will receive full access to the Safe Step application and create their own individual program of strength and balance exercises. During 1 year the participants are recommended to exercise at least 30 minutes, 3 times a week and continuously progress their program. In addition they will every month receive an email with general falls prevention information in a short video.
Additional support to promote reach and exercise adherence will be provided in the format of technical support and try-out group exercises throughout the recruitment period.</description>

    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Digital exercise program with support</intervention_name>
    <description>The Safe Step application includes an instruction movie on how to create and progress an individual exercise program. The exercises, presented in video format, are organized into 10 groups with a main focus on balance (3 groups), lower-limb strength (4 groups), and gait/step (3 groups). The participants choose an exercise suitable for their needs from each group to compose a program of ten exercises.
Participants use the app to plan their exercises, set reminders, register their exercise, and view statistics. A virtual physiotherapist delivers motivational messages and feed-back. At the end of each month the participants receive an email asking them to report any falls during the past month in a short digital survey. These messages also contains a new video with general falls prevention information.
Technical support will be provided weekly at senior meeting sites. Try-out group exercises (step 1-3) will be provided by a local wellness association (Friskis&amp;Svettis)</description>
