  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gender dysphoria is defined as a persistent incongruence between an experienced gender and
      the assigned sex at birth Transgender and gender nonconforming persons desire to modify their
      appearance to be consistent with their self-identified gender identities. In non-binary
      people, contrary to binary transgender persons, self-identified gender identities do not fit
      the classical pattern male/female.

      During the last decennium, an increase in the number of young subjects, especially children
      and adolescents, referred to gender identity centres has been observed. A new nosological
      entity &quot;rapid-onset gender dysphoria in adolescents and young adults&quot; has recently been
      described in the literature, whose etiology has not been well understood.

      This growing demand of adolescents and young adults observed in the recent years is not well
      understood.
