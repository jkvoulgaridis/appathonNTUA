    <textblock>
      This is a study to characterize the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of KD025 and
      KD025 metabolites in subjects with mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment compared to
      healthy subjects with normal hepatic function.

      The primary objective of the study is:

      • To assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of KD025 following a single oral dose of KD025 in
      subjects with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment compared to healthy subjects with
      normal hepatic function.

      The secondary objectives of the study are:

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single oral dose of KD025 in subjects with
           mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment, and in healthy subjects with normal
           hepatic function.

        -  To assess the PK of the KD025 metabolites following a single oral dose of KD025 in
           subjects with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment compared to healthy subjects
           with normal hepatic function.

             hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy) or postmenopausal
             (defined as females at least 45 years of age with at least 12 months post-cessation of
             menses without an alternative medical cause, even with a follicle-stimulating hormone
             level ≤40 mIU/mL, unless on hormone replacement therapy).

          4. Males will agree to use contraception

          5. Male subjects must not donate sperm from Check-in (Day -1) until 90 days after the
             Follow-up visit.

          6. Able to comprehend and willing to sign an informed consent form and to abide by the
             study restrictions.

          7. In good health, determined by no clinically significant findings from medical history,
             PE, 12-lead ECG, vital sign measurements, and clinical laboratory evaluations at
             Screening and Check-in (Day -1), as assessed by the Investigator (or designee).

          8. Matched to subjects with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment in sex, age (±10
             years), and body mass index (±20%).

             For Subjects with Hepatic Impairment Only:

          9. Documented chronic stable liver disease (Child-Pugh Class A [mild], B [moderate], or C
             [severe] at Screening); diagnosis of hepatic impairment due to parenchymal liver
             disease. If the Child-Pugh Class of a subject differs between Screening and Check-in,
             the Child-Pugh Class documented at Screening will be utilized for enrollment. This
             will exclude biliary liver cirrhosis or other causes of hepatic impairment unrelated
             to parenchymal disorder.:

                  hepatic ultrasound, computed axial tomography scan, magnetic resonance imaging,
                  and/or liver biopsy.

               -  'Chronic' is defined as &gt;6 months.

               -  'Stable' is defined as no clinically significant change in disease status within
                  the last 3 months (90 days), as documented by the subject's recent medical
                  history (eg, no worsening of clinical signs of hepatic impairment, or no
                  worsening of total bilirubin or prothrombin time by more than 50%).

         10. Subjects with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment may have medical findings
             consistent with their hepatic dysfunction as determined by medical history, PE,
             12-lead ECG, vital sign measurements, and clinical laboratory evaluations at Screening

         15. Subjects with diabetes mellitus may be included, provided the subjects have:

               1. Glycosylated hemoglobin A1c values ≤9.5% at Screening. Subjects with values
                  outside this range may be allowed by the Covance Medical Monitor on a
                  case-by-case basis.

               2. Blood glucose values ≤240 mg/dL at Screening and Check-in (Day -1) while on
                  subjects' normal diabetes medication.
