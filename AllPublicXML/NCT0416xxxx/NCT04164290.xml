  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Jiashen Tablets as an oral, compound traditional chinese medicine prepatations, have an
      effect on improvement of the heart failure. This study will assess the safety, tolerability
      and pharmacokinetics (PK) of Jiashen Tablets, following oral administration of single and
      multiple ascending dose of Jiashen Tablets.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will include a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose
      design study (Part A), and an open-label SDAD pre-multiple daily ascending dose (MDAD) study
      (Part B) and an open-label MDAD study (Part C) study.

      The study will be conducted in healthy participants and performed at a single study center.
      70 healthy participants are planned to be included in the study.

      Part A will include six cohorts, 40 participants. Within each cohort, 2 participants will be
      randomized to receive placebo and other participants randomized to receive Jiashen Tablets.
      Each participant will receive Jiashen Tablets at the selected dose level or placebo by oral
      administration in a fasted state once daily.

      Part B will include two cohorts, 12 participants, minimum dose group and maximum dose group
      respectively depending on the findings. Within each cohort, participant will receive Jiashen
      Tablets at the selected dose level by oral administration in a fasted state once daily.

      Part C will include three cohorts, 24 participants. Within each cohort, participant will
      receive Jiashen Tablets at the selected dose level by oral administration in a fasted state
      once daily for 7 days.
