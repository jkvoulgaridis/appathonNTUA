  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The bone marrow aspiration and biopsy (BMAB) is an essential and indispensable examination
      for the diagnosis and the follow-up of the hematological diseases but which remains painful
      and dread by the patients. Until then it was performed manually using a trocar. It is now
      practiced most often using a tool (like a small drill), device that pierces through the
      external iliac bone to extract a bone cylinder that will be analyzed

      If the gesture is faster than with the manual method, it remains overall painful and the
      noise generated by the drill that passes through the periosteum of the iliac bone is
      impressive for the patient.

      Prevention measures to limit pain and anxiety are put in place during the examination: local
      anesthesia, with or without a lidocaine patch, as well as inhalation of a mixture of nitrous
      oxide and oxygen (MEOPA®). These, recommended by the &quot;Standards, Options, Recommendation&quot;
      (SOR) often remain insufficient and are not devoid of undesirable effects.

      Despite these precautions, several studies show that the action remains painful and
      anxiety-provoking.

      An exploratory survey carried out in the hematology department of the François Baclesse
      Center in 2013 confirms these results and specifies that the pain remains present for another
      30 minutes after the examination.

      The investigators believe that associating a psycho-corporeal technique, as is sophrology,
      with the usual care, could contribute to the decrease of the threshold of pain and anxiety
      during the BMAB and avoid the use of a premedication.

      The effectiveness of sophrology as a complementary technique in the field of pain prevention
      in invasive procedures is recognized by observations and clinical results. This complementary
      therapy, among others, has its place in the hospital.

      To date, to investigator's knowledge, there is no published, randomized study evaluating the
      effectiveness of sophrology on pain in invasive procedures.

      The investigators propose a study whose main objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of a
      session of sophrology on the pain felt during the realization of the BMAB, in patients with
      hematological malignancy. This session will be provided by a sophrologist nurse This study
      should include 90 patients undergoing a BMAB over a 24-month period.

On the other hand, the caregiver raises the corresponding score from 0 to 10. Pain will bemeasured a posteriori (not possible to evaluate during the sophrology sesssion)</description>
