      Standard, effective, and scalable training models are needed to help equip community health
      workers in their community-based diabetes prevention awareness efforts. This study will
      tailor/adapt, implement, and evaluate an innovative internet-based virtual world model to
      remotely deliver a diabetes prevention awareness training program to community health
      workers.

      Standard, effective, and scalable training models are needed to help equip community health
      workers in their community-based diabetes prevention awareness efforts. This study will
      tailor/adapt, implement, and evaluate an innovative internet-based virtual world model to
      remotely deliver a diabetes prevention awareness training program to community health
      workers. A sequential mixed-methods design is used to address these specific aims: 1. Use
      community-based participatory research methods to guide the overall study and inform
      tailoring and adaptation of our virtual world model to deliver the CHW training program; 2.
      Conduct a randomized pilot study to compare change in primary outcomes (0, 12 weeks) after
      the in-person versus virtual world delivery of the program; and 3. Conduct summative focus
      groups to gather information to refine the program and study methodology.

    <description>A multi-item index of self-efficacy will be used to examine confidence in making lifestyle changes and in delivering the content. Higher scores represent greater confidence. Stage of change questions will assess CHW motivation (i.e., pre-contemplation, contemplation, preparation) or achievement of eating habit and physical activity behaviors (i.e., action/maintenance stages).</description>
