  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goals of the pilot RCT examining the potential effectiveness of the Safe at Home program
      in DRC are to:

        1. Determine the potential effectiveness of Safe at Home program on improvements of family
           functioning and secondary outcomes of reductions in intimate partner violence and child
           maltreatment

        2. Determine the potential effectiveness of the Safe at Home program on changes in pathway
           outcomes such as attitudes towards harsh discipline, gender attitudes, power-sharing,
           positive parenting practices, etc.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For the pilot RTC, quantitative data will be collected from up to 420 individuals
      participating in the Safe at Home program in the North Kivu, DRC. The 420 individuals
      comprising the study population will be 210 couples, of which both the male and female
      partners will be asked to participate in the study. After baseline data collection is
      completed, within each of the four sites where the program will occur in North Kivu, DRC, two
      groups of couples will be formed (n=8 groups total). Each group will be formed based on
      geographical proximity and will mirror real-life implementation of the program and ensure
      high fidelity to program design and limit contamination or spillover of Safe at Home to the
      control groups. Groups will then be randomized to receive Safe at Home in Cycle 1 or be
      waitlisted to receive Safe at Home in Cycle 2. After randomization is completed the Cycle 1
      programming will commence. Following a waiting period of 3 months after the program ends, the
      endline survey will be administered. Subsequently Cycle 2 cohort will receive programming.

    <description>The experimental arm will receive the Safe at Home program which is a community-based discussion group series aiming to prevent and respond to intimate partner violence and child maltreatment in conflict-affected communities. It includes once weekly, single-sex discussion groups with coupled men and women and once monthly family discussion groups with couples and children. During the weekly sessions men and women reflect critically and engage in dialogue related to gender, power, and privilege, learn about the causes and consequence of violence against women and children and gain skills in stress management, psychosocial support and positive parenting strategies. Family sessions focus on improving relationship quality and shared decision-making among partners and participation of children in family decision-making.</description>
