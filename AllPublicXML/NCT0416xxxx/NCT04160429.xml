  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial collects and analyzes sweat and saliva samples compared to blood in detecting
      chemical concentrations in the body in patients with chronic or infectious diseases receiving
      medications. Wearable sweat sensors are capable of monitoring electrolytes and metabolites
      (sodium, potassium, glucose, lactate, etc.) for health monitoring and disease diagnosis.
      Designing wearable sweat sensors capable of providing information regarding drug
      administration may be challenging due to ultralow concentrations in biofluids. This trial
      seeks to determine if the use of a smart wristband can accurately measure the levels of
      chemicals and substances in sweat.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To compare novel, home-based methods of quantitating medication concentrations in either
      saliva or sweat to the 'gold standard' of liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry of
      plasma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare novel home-based methods of quantitating substances in either saliva or sweat
      to the 'gold standard' in plasma.

      II. Assess the ease of obtaining home-based samples.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo collection of sweat samples via Macroduct Sweat Collection System 3710S and
      saliva and blood samples within 24 hours after medication administrations. Patients also
      complete questionnaires over 5-10 minutes and have medical charts reviewed.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up periodically.
