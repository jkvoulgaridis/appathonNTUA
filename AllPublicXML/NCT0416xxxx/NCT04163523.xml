        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Males and females between 18 to 65 years of age (inclusive)

             IRB-approved Informed Consent Form prior to admission to this study

          3. Male subjects must agree to use a medically acceptable method of contraception from
             Screening until 90 days after administration of the last dose of study drug. Medically
             acceptable methods of contraception include the following: abstinence; a condom in
             addition to having the female partner use another form of contraception such as
             medically approved hormonal methods, diaphragm, intrauterine device or a tubal
             ligation. This requirement may be waived if the Principal Investigator or delegate is
             satisfied that the subject or partner is sterile (i.e., if female has undergone a
             hysterectomy, or has undergone a tubal ligation at least 3 months prior to Screening,
             or is postmenopausal (no menstrual period for at least 12 months prior to Screening);
             if male has undergone vasectomy at least 6 months prior to Screening). Male subjects
             agrees not to donate sperm for at least 90 days after administration of the last dose
             of study drug

          4. Female subjects of non-childbearing potential measures, meeting at least one of the
             following criteria:

               1. amenorrhoeal for 12 months (menopause confirmed by Follicular Stimulating Hormone
                  (FSH) and Luteinising Hormone (LH) levels as defined by the established reference
                  ranges), or

               2. surgically sterile (e.g. hysterectomy, oophorectomy, tubal ligation for at least
                  3 months)

          5. Males and females with a body mass Index (BMI) range 18-35 kg/m2 inclusive.

          6. Subjects who are healthy as determined by pre-study medical history, physical
             examination, and 12-Lead ECG

          7. Subjects who have clinical laboratory test results during the screening period that
             are within the reference ranges or are clinically acceptable to the Investigator

          8. Subjects who test negative for HIV, HBV, and HCV by standard serologic tests must be
             negative at Screening

             herbal supplements (paracetamol &lt;2 grams/day is acceptable) but including mega dose

             study, unless agreed as nonclinically relevant by the Investigator and BeiGene

         11. Subjects who have used any investigational drug and /or participated in any clinical
             trial within 2 months of first dosing

         12. Subjects who have donated and/or received any blood or blood products within the
             previous 3 months prior to first dosing. Subjects should not donate blood while on the
             study and for at least 60 days after last dose of study medication

         13. Subjects who have consumed food or beverage (including caffeine, alcohol, and
