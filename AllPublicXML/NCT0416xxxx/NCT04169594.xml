  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gait analysis is commonly performed in clinical practice. However, it is complex and requires
      an understanding of the activation of muscles in lower limbs, trunk, and upper limbs in a
      specific spatiotemporal pattern and the appropriate joint positions which support and advance
      the body weight in different phases of gait cycles.

      In study, we plan to pilot the application of 3D gait analysis with statistical modelling in
      2 common causes of gait deviation: unilateral hemiplegic stroke and unilateral lower limb
      amputation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study on the use of 3D gait analysis using motion capture in combination with
      Statistical Parametric Mapping in patients with unilateral hemiplegic stroke and unilateral
      lower limb amputation. Data collected will then be compared against a normative dataset.

      The findings from this study will then be used to build a decision support tool in
      combination with clinical analysis which could focus clinical recommendations for gait
      training, physical therapy, exercise and orthotics prescription to reduce unnecessary joint
      forces in affected and unaffected segments.
