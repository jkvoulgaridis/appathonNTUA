  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep and particularly deep sleep are playing an important role for brain and body health.
      Poor sleep has been associated with risk factors for cardiovascular disease and moreover, is
      hypothesized to increased mortality risk of cardiovascular diseases. Yet, the role of
      specific sleep processes for cardiovascular function remains unclear. Particularly deep
      sleep, which is manifested by large amplitude, low frequency oscillations is of importance
      for the restorative functions of sleep. Thus, the modulation of deep sleep by auditory
      stimulation will be of central interests to assess the cause-effect relationship of specific
      processes within sleep for cardiovascular regulation.

      This study will assess the effects of slow wave modulating auditory stimulation on
      cardiovasuclar functions in healthy male participants.
