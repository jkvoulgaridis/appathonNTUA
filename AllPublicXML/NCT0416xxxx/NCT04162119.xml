      This is a single center, non-randomized, open-label, phase 2 study to evaluate the efficacy
      and safety of BCMA-PD1-CART cells therapy for patients with relapsed/refractory Multiple
      Myeloma.

      Previous studies have found that multiple myeloma cells express PD-L1 at a high level.
      Therefore, the combination of anti-PD-1 or PD-L1 antibodies with CART therapy may further
      improve the clinical efficacy of CART cell for multiple myeloma.

      The investigators screened PD-1 mutant that have high affinity bind with the PD-L1 ligand,
      and the affinity of the prepared mutant PD-1 Fc fusion protein to bind to PD-L1 reached
      clinical anti-PD-L1 antibody levels. The investigators prepared BCMA CART cells which
      secretes the mutant PD-1Fc fusion protein, and the prepared CART cell culture supernatant can
      well block the binding of PD-L1 to PD-1. Preclinical studies have shown that BCMA CART cells
      secreting mutant PD-1Fc fusion protein have a superior killing effect on PD-L1 positive
      multiple myeloma tumor cells to BCMA CART cells which does not express PD-1 fusion protein.

      The trial was conducted to explore the safety and efficacy of BCMA-PD1-CART cells in
      Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma.

    <intervention_model_description>This study was a single-center, open-label, single-arm, non-randomized clinical trial, which was divided into 3 groups by infusion dose level. Firstly, each dose group has 3 patients. The pretreatment regimen of cyclophosphamide (25mg/m2 for 3 consecutive days) and fludarabine (10mg/kg for 3 consecutive days) was given before CART cells were reinfused. CART cells were reinfused on the third day after the pretreatment. If no serious side effects emerges in the group, then the next group uses the subsequent higher dose. If serious side effects emerges in a single patient in any dose level, 3 more patients will be enrolled to the same dose level. After 9 or more patients, we select the safest dose and recruit more patients for CART test to explore its effectiveness.</intervention_model_description>
