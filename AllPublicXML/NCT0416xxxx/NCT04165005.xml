    <textblock>
      The present study examined the effect of a short Mindfulness-based intervention emphasizing a
      'decentering' component on elderly seniors. Methods: 30 community seniors (Mage= 74.7)
      performed either 'decentering' intervention, guided imagery intervention, or control care as
      usual. The 8-week interventions included weekly 20-minute sessions and daily 10-minute home
      practice. Participants underwent a cognitive and emotional assessment before and after the
      interventions, which included filling out questionnaires and performing the Simon task. Trial
      registration: The study follows the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, approved by
      the committee in Beer-Yaacov Hospital, Israel (number 579) on 24 Oct. 2017.
