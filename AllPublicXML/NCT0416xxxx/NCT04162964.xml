  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dementia is widely prevalent and results in high direct and indirect health costs. Dementia
      is associated with stress, anxiety, and depression in both patients and caregivers, and
      caregiver burden is extremely common. Treatment protocols for patients and caregivers are
      unclear and insufficient; drug treatments to manage behavioural and psychological symptoms of
      dementia can yield serious negative side effects, and caregivers may not have access to
      one-on-one psychotherapy due to high costs and long wait times. Yoga is an ancient Indian
      mind-body practice that uses physical postures, breathing exercises, and meditation. Yoga may
      be a viable therapeutic modality to address the psychological challenges associated with
      dementia in patients and caregivers, as it has been shown to decrease stress and improve
      anxiety and depressive symptoms in various populations. Recent research has suggested that
      patients with dementia and their caregivers may also experience positive effects on their
      mental health from practicing yoga. Furthermore, when yoga is taught in a gentle and mindful
      manner, it is generally not associated with any negative side effects. While there is
      preliminary data on dyadic exercise interventions for dementia patients and their caregivers,
      to date no research has examined the effectiveness of a dyadic yoga intervention on stress,
      anxiety, and depression.

      The investigators propose an 8-week study of a dyadic chair yoga program for patients with
      mild to moderate dementia and their caregivers (n = 30-40 participants). Our primary outcome
      of interest is changes in perceived stress, while secondary outcomes include changes in
      symptoms of depression and anxiety. The investigators will also look at the effects of the
      chair yoga program on caregiver burden, quality of interactions, well-being, mindfulness, and
      self-compassion. All outcomes will be assessed before the program starts and upon its
      termination. Participants will attend a 1-hour weekly group yoga class (4-10 participants per
      group) with their dyad for 8-weeks, and will also be given a video recording of a yoga class
      to practice together at home as often as possible. The investigators hypothesize that after
      the 8 week yoga program, patients and caregivers will report lower stress, as well as reduced
      symptoms of anxiety and depression. Results will be available mid-2020.

Scores on the PHQ-9 can range from 0-27, with higher scores indicating more severe depression.
Hypothesis: Patients with dementia and their caregivers will report less severe symptoms of depression, as measured by the full version of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), following participation in an 8-week gentle chair yoga program.</description>

    <description>Using an 8-week single arm pilot trial, assess the effects of chair yoga on symptoms of anxiety in patients and caregivers using the GAD-7.
Scores on the GAD-7 range from 0-21, with higher scores indicating more severe anxiety.
Hypothesis: Patients with dementia and/or their caregivers will report fewer symptoms of anxiety, as measured by the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item Scale (GAD-7), following participation in an 8-week gentle chair yoga program.</description>

    <description>Assess the effects of chair yoga on caregiver burden using the ZBI following 8 weeks of chair yoga.
Scores on the ZBI can range from 0-88, with higher scores corresponding to higher levels of burden.
Hypothesis 1: Caregivers of patients with dementia will report lower caregiver burden, as measured by the Zarit Burden Scale (ZBI), following participation in an 8-week gentle chair yoga program.
Hypothesis 2: Lower patient scores on the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 (week 8) will be associated with decreased caregiver burden following participation in an 8-week gentle chair yoga program.</description>
