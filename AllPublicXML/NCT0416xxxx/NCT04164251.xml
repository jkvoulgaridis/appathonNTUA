  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to pilot a program that will evaluate the feasibility of an
      inpatient screening mammography for non-adherent and high risk hospitalized women age 52-74
      admitted to the medicine services at Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center and Howard County
      General Hospital. The two key activities include: inpatient breast care education with
      educational handouts and offering inpatient screening mammography. Inpatient screening
      mammography will be offered to non-adherent (last screening mammogram more than 24 months
      ago) and high risk (Gail 5-year risk of breast cancer 1.6 or greater) women. This pilot
      program will thus evaluate the feasibility of an inpatient screening mammography as an
      innovative approach to increase breast cancer screening among non-adherent and high risk
      women.
