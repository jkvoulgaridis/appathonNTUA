  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will create a comprehensive, multicomponent behavioral intervention package
      (ONBOARD; OvercomiNg Barriers &amp; Obstacles to Adopting Diabetes Devices). ONBOARD will provide
      adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D) the skills to maximize benefit and minimize daily
      interference from barriers associated with continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and increase
      readiness for closed loop.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed research will create and refine the ONBOARD intervention for CGM use.
      Participants will be tracked using metrics of A1c, time in glucose target range, number of
      days using CGM, blood glucose (BG) downloads, diabetes problem solving, diabetes distress,
      and technology attitudes. The investigators will examine whether ONBOARD leads to improved
      diabetes and psychosocial outcomes and sustained CGM use. At the end of this study, the
      investigators will have created and refined a comprehensive, multicomponent intervention
      package to promote increased and sustained uptake of CGM and increase readiness for closed
      loop adoption.

    <description>ONBOARD consists of four 60-minute sessions over 3 months. Each session will target a key barrier to CGM use: physical, data, social, and trust. Sessions will be delivered individually to participants by a doctoral level psychologist with diabetes expertise. Each session will include relevant first-person digital stories told adults to with T1D, recounting how they managed relevant CGM barriers.</description>
