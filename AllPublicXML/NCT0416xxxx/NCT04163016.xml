    <description>This study will include pregnant women who have decided to continue treatment with commercial certolizumab pegol (CZP) in accordance with their treating physician prior to participating in the study. Study participants will be responsible for obtaining and administering commercially available CZP under the care of their physician and according to the locally approved product label.
From all study participants blood samples will be drawn for pharmacokinetics during the study.</description>

    <description>The collection of blood samples for pharmacokinetics (PK) is considered interventional. Blood samples will be drawn at enrollment, predose every 4 weeks (Q4W), postdose every 8 weeks (Q8W) and postpartum predose and postdose.
Study participants will be responsible for obtaining and administering commercially available approved dosing regimens of certolizumab pegol (CZP) as prescribed by each study participant's own physician.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant is pregnant and ≤10 weeks gestation at the time of enrollment

          -  Participant must have been on stable, maintenance dose certolizumab pegol (CZP)
             treatment for at least 12 weeks independent of and prior to being enrolled in this
             study, for an approved indication in accordance with her treating physician

          -  Participant expects to continue CZP therapy throughout pregnancy and for at least 12
             weeks postpartum

          -  Participant has a negative interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) or tuberculin skin
             test (TST) within the prior 6 months, and there has been no change in the study
             participant's clinical status, or social, family, or travel history. Participants with
             documented Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine and at low risk for tuberculosis
             (TB) may enroll without having a TB test performed

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant has any medical or psychiatric condition that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, could jeopardize or would compromise the study participant's ability to
             participate in this study

          -  Participant is not permitted to enroll into the study if she meets any of the
             following TB exclusion criteria:

               1. Known active TB disease

               2. History of active TB involving any organ system

               3. Latent TB infection

               4. High risk of acquiring TB infection

               5. Current nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) infection or history of NTM infection
                  (unless proven to be fully recovered)

          -  Study participant is taking a prohibited medication or has taken a prohibited
             medication

          -  Live vaccine(s) within 1 month prior to Screening, or plans to receive such vaccines
             during the study

          -  Study participant has any clinically significant pregnancy-related clinical or test
             abnormality, as judged by the investigator

          -  Study participant had a positive or indeterminate interferon gamma release assay
             (IGRA) or tuberculin skin test (TST) at Screening. In case of indeterminate result, a
             retest is allowed if time permits; 2 results of indeterminate require exclusion of the
             study participant
