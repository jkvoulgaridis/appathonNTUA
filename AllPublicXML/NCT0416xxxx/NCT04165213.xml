    <textblock>
      The protocol is organized into three Phases - In Phase I an online training program will be
      developed in &quot;Care of Persons with Dementia in their Environments&quot; (COPE) -an evidence-based
      bio-behavioral dementia program -using state-of-the science simulation and best online
      learning practices. In addition an automated approach to fidelity monitoring using
      computational linguistics (automatic classification programs) will be developed. In Phase II,
      ten long term care community-based (PACE) organizations will be randomized into two groups; 5
      PACE organizations will serve as the &quot;control&quot; site in which staff training will be provided
      via the traditional high intensity face-to-face training in the COPE program. 5 PACE
      organizations will serve as the comparison and staff will be trained using the online COPE
      training program. Phase II will evaluate the whether an online training program is the same
      or better in improving PACE staff competency and fidelity to COPE principles and protocols
      compared to a high intensity face-to-face traditional form of training. In Phase III the
      efficacy of the COPE program on PACE participant outcomes by type of COPE training will be
      evaluated. Each of the PACE organizations will enroll 5 persons with dementia and their
      caregivers in the study. This will yield 50 family dyads (25 dyads in traditional training
      sites and 25 dyads in online training sites). Dyads will be followed for 4 months.
      Non-inferiority analysis will be used to assess whether dyads will yield the same or better
      outcomes regardless of how PACE staff were trained.

      PHASE 1a - The Online Training Program - We will develop ten self-paced online learning
      modules. These modules will enable OTs and RNs to participant to have anytime/anywhere access
      to content and activities to aid their learning. The modules will include rich multimedia
      content and interactive assessments to keep the learner engaged. The modules will allow for
      easy packaging of the content into the latest interoperability standards for such content
      including the latest Shareable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) specifications, which
      will allow for repurposing and sharing with other institutions.

      To accommodate diversity of learning needs, the modules will be designed using a
      hyperlearning model with four dimensions. The general principles will begin with the module
      learning objectives and follow with a review of core concepts and required and/or
      self-directed learning activities. The mini-lecture component of the modules will include
      information on the major concepts of the module. Since the modules will be self-paced, the
      learner can take his/her time going through them and perform in the embedded interactive
      learning activities. The clinical reasoning dimension will provide the learner with an
      opportunity for problem-solving and clinical decision-making. This dimension will contain
      vignettes and case studies with questions requiring analysis and synthesis. The final
      dimension will be evaluation/ assessment of learning outcomes. This dimension will use
      teacher-made and standardized pre-and post-tests to assess attainment of specified learning
      outcomes. The self-paced modules will be highly interactive featuring integrated multimedia
      content, assessments, and learner evaluations to allow PACE staff to engage with the content
      at a high level and practice application in simulated scenarios. Each module will require
      approximately 45-60 minutes/module for the learner to complete. Participants can use the
      modules separately at different times throughout a training curriculum or they can be
      assigned at the beginning of a training time by having this information front-loaded.

      To develop the modules, we will work intensely in year 01 with an instructional design team
      at Drexel University with specialists in dementia care, the COPE program and experts in
      simulation, use of standardized patients, and training of nurses and other health
      professionals from Penn, Trinity Health and Jefferson. We anticipate the modules to contain
      the following content: module 1 - introduction to COPE program, research evidence, and core
      principles underlying the program; module 2 - overview of delivery characteristics, role of
      RN and OT, three phases (assessment, implementation, generalizability) of the COPE program,
      permissible adaptations; module 3 and 4- assessment phase, introduction to clinical interview
      and all assessments and forms; module 5 and 6- implementation phase including helping
      caregiver identify 3 problem areas, engaging in problem solving and brainstorming, developing
      and providing an assessment report and offering prescriptions (strategies) for each
      identified problem area; module 7and 8, generalizability phase or helping caregivers use
      strategies for one problem area to address another and planning for the future; module 9-
      developing rapport and working with family caregivers from different backgrounds, cultures,
      living environments and relationships and helping families balance caregiving with other life
      roles, adjusting approach by level of readiness; module 10 - challenging cases, motivational
      interviewing, how to explain the program, how to meet caregivers where they are at and
      provide validation and support. Scripts for each module will be developed and shared with
      OTs/RNs who are not part of the study but work within Trinity PACE programs. This will allow
      for continuous feedback loops to assure that the scenarios meet the needs of PACE staff. We
      will compare the online program to our traditional 3-day face-to-face training currently used
      with COPE.

      The 3-day training program will be conducted by Dr. Piersol using a slide deck and case
      presentations as we have previously done. The comparison of the two training programs is
      described in Phase 2 and 3 below.

      PHASE 1b -The Fidelity Monitoring Program- We seek to develop a scalable approach to assess
      fidelity to the COPE Program when it is implemented in a real-world setting such as PACE
      using computational linguistics techniques (e.g.

      natural language processing). The essence of fidelity to the Core Principles of COPE program
      will be captured by using automatic classification programs that evaluate both the content
      that should be included in COPE sessions, and the style of delivery. While automatic
      classification programs have been applied to measure quality metrics of transcribed
      narratives in the field of psychotherapy (21), it has not been used to measure other aspects
      of quality- namely fidelity to evidence-based practices or dementia care and caregiver
      supportive programs. The development of the automated Fidelity Monitoring Program will occur
      in three steps and will be carried out by a technical team consisting of an expert in content
      analysis, Dr. Ani Nenkova, and a consultant expert in speech recognition and prosody, Dr Mari
      Ostendorf.

      Co- I Nenkova has worked extensively on automatic summarization, evaluation of automatic
      summarization and readability and linguistic style. The ultimate goal of our efforts is to
      develop a system that- given a recording of a COPE delivery session (e.g. in real time
      immediately after interaction between the clinician and the caregiver)- produces a
      three-tiered score, indicating if the fidelity was 'excellent', 'acceptable' or
      'problematic'. Special emphasis will be given to the accuracy of identifying 'problematic'
      COPE fidelity which is not fateful to training and may not produce the same desired outcomes
      as intervention delivered with higher fidelity.

      First, we will obtain n-best list speech recognition of the COPE interaction . This will help
      mitigate recognition errors in the next stage. Until recently, audio recording transcription
      was fraught with challenges particularly in sessions involving two or more speakers. Advances
      in audio signaling and speech recognition have brought technology for automating language
      analysis within reach. Recent research has suggested that text based features may be more
      effective than using audio features alone when classifying fidelity in behavioral research
      (47). Automatic speech recognition software will be used to transcribe sessions and the
      resulting words will be used in a text-based model of fidelity. All COPE training, practice
      and implementation sessions will be audio taped with participant consent. There are several
      of automatic speech recognition tools that we can use. We will pick the one that best
      balances accuracy of recognition in our domain and privacy.Once the transcripts are obtained,
      there are two approaches that we will develop and contrast: (1) comparison with a reference
      delivery and (2) a supervised classification approach. The first has the advantage of needing
      only a small number of excellent deliveries and several acceptable deliveries, for each of
      the seven dimensions, while the other needs a larger set of labeled data but would
      potentially lead to higher accuracy of prediction.

      Comparison or similarity to reference (Steps A and B): Our approach will leverage techniques
      widely used in the evaluation of automatically produced content, such as machine translation
      and automatic text summarization. In these applications it is not feasible to track system
      improvement with human judgments of quality. Instead, most of the progress is measured by
      computing similarity between a set of sample reference text (i.e. what a 'good' translation
      or a 'good' summary would be) and the system output. Such automatic evaluation approaches are
      widely used for machine translation (48) and summarization (49). While there have been some
      concerns that the automatic measures are not fine enough to distinguish between levels of
      very good context, these measures show strong ability to distinguish 'very bad' content
      (50,51), (or poor fidelity) aligns with the needs of our project.

      In Step A we will compile 10 examples of 'excellent' COPE fidelity deliveries, with the
      regions where desired aspects is expressed will be explicitly marked, i.e. marked parts where
      person-environment fit is discussed, or parts of the interaction where the clinician asks
      open ended questions or confirms the caregiver understanding of the content. Next, new
      interactions will be ranked by their similarity with the reference 'excellent' interactions
      (52). In Step 2 we will identify 'problematic' fidelity deliveries. We will make use of 10
      negative examples of 'acceptable' but imperfect deliveries. If the new interaction ranks
      lower than most of these, it will be considered unacceptable or 'problematic'. Parameters and
      decision rules will be developed at this step to determine cut-off levels for declaring an
      interaction problematic.

      Determination of &quot;excellent&quot; versus &quot;problematic&quot; fidelity ratings of the audio recordings
      will be assessed by Drs Hirshman and Renz (who were not the original developers of COPE and
      thus they offer an independent review) using the COPE Adherence Scale developed for the
      original clinical trial in order to evaluate the extent to which core treatment principles
      were implemented effectively. Ratings from the Adherence Scale have been standardized such
      that 1.00 represents perfect fidelity and 0.00 represent complete non-fidelity. The scale was
      previously modeled off of the NIH REACH I and II fidelity approach. Findings from the
      combined fidelity ratings will be used to refine the automated fidelity program into a &quot;best
      model&quot; to be tested in Step C (53).

      Supervised classification (Step C) For this approach, we will need to examine all recorded
      sessions (600+). We will train a supervised classifier or a regression model to predict the
      score (1 to 3, corresponding to excellent, acceptable and problematic) of a given
      interaction. We will experiment with a number of classifiers, including deep learning
      frameworks and more traditional support vector machine and (logistic) regression models.The
      resulting final validation set of 100 labeled interactions will serve to finalize the best
      model for fidelity prediction.

      PHASE 2 - Evaluation of Online Training Program in Interventionist Uptake and Fidelity Phase
      2 of this study involves a series of activities designed to evaluate the whether an online
      training program is the same or better in improving interventionist uptake of- and fidelity
      to- COPE principles and protocols compared to a high intensity face-to-face traditional form
      of training. Eligibility and enrollment: Ten participating Trinity PACE Organizations will
      participate via webinar in a brief orientation/ training to the study and project logistics.
      Next, Trinity Health PACE organizations will be randomized into two groups using the
      re-randomization procedures described in the paragraph below; 5 PACE organizations will serve
      as the &quot;control&quot; site in which training will be provided via the traditional high intensity
      face-to-face.; 5 PACE organizations will serve as the comparison and be trained through the
      online training site. Prior to randomization, we will carefully examine PACE organizations on
      important variables such as size, location (urban; rural) percent of persons with dementia,
      and staff: participant ratio. In each site, one occupational therapist (OT) and one nurse
      (RN) will be trained (e.g., 5 OTs and 5 RNs in traditional sites; 5 OTS and 5 RNS in online
      training sites for a total of 10 OTs and 10 RNs or 20 health providers)

      PHASE 3 (Aim 3) - Efficacy of COPE on PACE participant outcomes by type of COPE training.

      This aim will be accomplished by evaluating dyad outcomes of the COPE program under the two
      different training approaches. Following training, each of the PACE organizations will enroll
      5 persons with dementia and their caregivers in the study. This will yield 50 family dyads
      (25 dyads in traditional training sites and 25 dyads in online training sites).

      At 4 months, study outcomes will be assessed.
