      PURPOSE: To investigate the effect of the disease and HSCT on muscle dysfunction and to
      investigate the prognostic role of muscle dysfunction at critical decision points in patients
      with hematological diseases referred to hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT).

      HSCT: Patients diagnosed with malignant hematological diseases who are referred to
      myeloablative HSCT, to a myeloablative &quot;reduced toxicity conditioning&quot; regime with
      Fludarabine and Treosulfane (FluTreo) or to non-myeloablative HSCT.

      RATIONAL: Patients diagnosed with malignant hematological diseases undergoing HSCT are faced
      with poor prognosis. The treatment is demanding and associated with severe deconditioning
      potentially leading to worse prognostic outcomes. To what extend patients body composition at
      the point of referral to HSCT, as well as changes in body composition throughout the cancer
      continuum is associated with cancer outcomes is currently not well described, specifically if
      this should be part of standard clinical evaluation in order to optimize therapy-efficacy.
      Recent findings suggest that pathophysiological alterations in skeletal muscle mass and
      function can have significant implications for the risk of disease progression and long term
      prognosis.
