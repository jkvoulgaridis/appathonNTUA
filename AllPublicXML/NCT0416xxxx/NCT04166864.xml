      This study will investigate the feasibility, safety, and tolerability of administering
      repetitive Transcranial magnetic stimulation(TMS) at frequencies other than standard 10 Hz.
      This study will enroll 10 subjects who will undergo one quantitative electroencephalograph,
      one TMS procedure to determine the appropriate frequency and intensity for treatment, weekly
      mood/symptom assessments, and up to 30 TMS treatments. Subjects will be asked to participate
      for up to 6 weeks.

      STUDY OBJECTIVE

      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate feasibility of repetitive Transcranial
      Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) treatment for depression at stimulation frequencies other than 10
      Hz. The objectives for this study are:

        1. to determine if each subject's frequency response pattern shows one or more distinct
           frequencies of stimulation that generated increased Spectral Correlation Coefficient;

        2. to determine if these frequency response patterns differ across subjects; and,

        3. To gather pilot data for an extramural funding application to investigate the efficacy
           of rTMS treatment at individualized stimulation frequencies as an alternative to the
           standard 10 Hz protocol.

      INCLUSION/EXCLUSION CRITERIA

      We will enroll 10 subjects into this study. Subjects must meet all the following inclusion

           cardioverter defibrillator, pacemaker, vagus nerve stimulator, or metal aneurysm clips

           magnetic field and are acceptable for use with transcranial magnetic stimulation

      STUDY PROCEDURES

      SUBJECT SCREENING AND ENROLLMENT If a potential TMS patient is evaluated and meets TMS
      treatment criteria, they will be approached by a study staff member who is not involved in
      their clinical TMS evaluation to inquire if they would like to participate in the study. If
      they confirm interest, the study details and their involvement will be discussed with them
      and the consent form will be reviewed and explained to them. They will have an option to
      complete the consent form or take it home and complete it when they decide to participate.

      A copy of the signed consent form will be provided to the study participant and the original
      signed consent form will be maintained.

      Subjects will be asked to participate in the following procedures:

      Qualitative Encephalograph (QEEG) One QEEG will be performed in using ANT Neuro equipment.
      Recordings will be performed while the subjects are resting in the eye-closed, maximally
      alert state. Electrodes will be attached to the subjects' scalp using a 64, Ag-Cl electrode
      nylon electrode cap. These types of electrodes are non-invasive, apply easily and quickly
      with little or no discomfort to the subject, and are easily removed with minimal clean up.
      During the recordings, subjects will sit in a comfortable chair while the electrodes are
      applied. The recording will then be performed and the technicians will alert subjects if any
      signs of drowsiness appear. A CPz-referential montage will be used with electrodes placed
      according to the 10-20 system (Leuchter et al., 1992; Dunkin et al, 1995). Signals will be
      digitally recorded (bandpass 0.3-70 Hz) and analyzed with the Brain Vision Analyzer 2.0
      software and MatLab.

      Symptom Survey/Mood Assessments

      We will administer the following assessments weekly:

        -  Inventory of Depressive Symptomology (Self-report) (IDS-SR)

        -  Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD)

        -  Profile of Moods (POMS)

      The Subjects will be asked about their feelings, thoughts, activities, or emotional
      well-being. Assessments will be done with study staff and completely individually through
      self-assessment.

      Motor Threshold Determination Before the Spectral Correlation Coefficient is determined, the
      appropriate intensity will be assigned and used for the Spectral Correlation Coefficient
      determination and subsequent treatments. The TMS physician(co-investigator/PI) measures the
      subject's motor threshold by administering several brief pulses. The motor threshold is the
      minimum amount of power necessary to make the patient's thumb twitch, and varies from
      individual to individual.

      Spectral Correlation Coefficient Determination Prior to the first treatment and following
      motor threshold determination, subjects will receive stimulation with 68 different
      stimulation pulse trains of 40 pulses each at frequencies ranging between 3 and 20 Hz in
      steps of 0.25 Hz, plus intermittent theta burst (iTBS) stimulation, in randomized order. In
      between pulse trains, 26 s resting period will be recorded. This entire procedure is called
      &quot;frequency interrogation&quot; and will take forty (40) minutes.

      To estimate the optimal individual stimulation frequency, we will compute the spectral
      correlation coefficient (SCC), which is the the similarity of spectra at two different
      electrode locations at sliding center frequencies from 3 to 20 Hz in steps of 0.5 Hz and with
      a 4 Hz band width (+/- 2 Hz). This is computed as a Pearson bivariate correlation coefficient
      (R) between the seed (F3, stimulation site) and target (posterior locations of the
      fronto-parietal control network) for each electrode pairing for pre- and post- interrogation
      resting state. The change in Spectral Correlation Coefficient will be determined by
      subtracting the post-rTMS from the pre-rTMS SSC, separately for each electrode pair. Only
      electrodes with an increased SCC will be considered for further analysis.

      We next calculate the Spectral Correlation Coefficient density, which is an indicator of a
      focal increase (clustering) of high Spectral Correlation Coefficient connections to a small
      topographic area. To calculate density, the Euclidian distance between the remaining target
      electrodes will be computed and summed. A large cumulative distance indicates that increased
      targets are widely spread, while a small distance indicates a more focal activation. The SCC
      and the inversed cumulative target distance then will be z-transformed and combined, such
      that a large value would indicate a strong increase in connectivity along with a dense
      distribution of the respective target electrodes, while a small value would indicate a
      moderate connectivity increase and more dispersed target locations.

      In previous work, we have shown that Spectral Correlation Coefficient is a reliable biomarker
      for 10-Hz rTMS treatment outcome in depression (Corlier et al. 2019) and our preliminary data
      also indicate that connectivity density post interrogation at 10 Hz is higher for subjects
      who responded to full rTMS treatment course at 10 Hz.

      For the current study, we propose to select the frequency with the largest connectivity
      density (strong and focal connectivity increase within the fronto-parietal control network)
      in the range of 3 and 20 Hz as the optimal individual stimulation density.

      TMS TREATMENT

      Ten patients will be administered 10 and up to 30 acute rTMS treatments at their individual
      stimulation frequency and up to 6 taper rTMS treatments administered over 2-3 weeks. Weekly
      evaluations of clinical symptoms (IDS-SR) will be the primary outcome measure, in addition to
      the assessment of general tolerability and safety issues.

      During the treatment, the stimulation coil is placed on the head so that it rests above the
      front region of the subject's brain. Treatment is then commenced according to the assigned
      settings. During the treatment, subjects will hear a series of clicking sounds and will feel
      a tapping sensation under the treatment coil. Per treatment, a total of 3000 pulses will be
      administered over 75 bursts with 40 pulses delivered per burst. Each treatment will last
      between 35-50 minutes depending on the treatment parameters.

      Treatment will be administered using the Magstim Super Rapid2 Plus1 system, a research device
      or FDA-approved MagVenture Clinical TMS system.

      ANALYSIS

      Weekly evaluations of clinical symptoms (IDS-SR) will be the primary outcome measure, in
      addition to the assessment of general tolerability and safety issues. The assessments will be
      used to determine feasibility, tolerability, and safety of this treatment assignment method.
