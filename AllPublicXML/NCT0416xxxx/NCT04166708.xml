    <textblock>
      A professional flamenco dancer will perform a ZAP 3 test, a sequence of single strikes of the
      feet performed continuously for 15 sec. Kinetic and kinematic studies will be recorded during
      the performance.

      Flamenco is a highly emotional and sensitive dance, which is one of the most characteristic
      elements of Spanish culture. It is both physically and mentally demanding, with the emphasis
      on footwork technical execution and the aesthetic of arms and trunk movements. Years of
      training are necessary to achieve any level of proficiency as professional flamenco dancer.

      Therefore proper execution of the movements minimize the risk of injury accompanying foot -
      ground contact which was reported by several studies. The most suffering parts of the
      dancer's body are the cervical and lumbar spine, knee and foot.

      Despite the growing number of studies on flamenco dancing, there is a lack of investigations
      focused on understanding how does the flamenco dancer's body work to mitigate an injury risk.
      Therefore, the purpose of this study is to examine the parameters related to this issue:
      vertical Ground Reaction Force, Centre of Mass displacements and knee joint kinematics of the
      supporting leg They will be registered and analyzed during footwork performance.

      A female professional flamenco dancer will perform a footork test called ZAP-3. It is a
      sequence of single strikes of the feet performed continuously for 15 seconds as fast as
      possible. 3D lower extremity kinematic data is used to collected using a five-camera motion
      analysis system (Vicon; Oxford Metrics Ltd., Oxford, UK). Kistler force platform will use to
      record the Ground reaction forces .

    <description>The participant has to perform ZAP 3 test, a sequence of single strikes of the feet performed continuously for 15 sec.
The first footwork step is made with the ball of the Foot with the non supporting leg. The second footwork step that will be produced by dropping the heel on the floor and making an audible sound. It is called Heel Drop (HD). The other leg will perform the third footwork step striking only the heel on the floor. The fourth one is made with the other leg, the supporting leg, when the ball of the foot is planted, repeating a HD step footwork. The fifth one is made by the non supporting leg, tapping the tip of the toe on the floor behind the base of support. The last one step is also made with the other leg, the supporting leg, meantime the ball of the foot is planted the heel is dropped on the floor repeating a HD step footwork. Numbers of footwork steps performed will be recorded. A greater number of strokes are associated with a better result.</description>

    <measure>Centre of mass oscillations</measure>
    <time_frame>15 seconds</time_frame>
    <description>During ZAP-3 test, Centre of mass oscillations will be registered. Three-dimensional lower extremity kinematic data are collected using a five-camera motion analysis system at a sampling rate of 120 Hz (Vicon; Oxford Metrics Ltd., Oxford, UK). Body segments were defined according to the Golem model by means of 35 reflective markers attached to the head (4), trunk (4), pelvis (3), arms (7) and legs (5). Centre of mass oscillations will be measured in metres.</description>

    <description>The vertical component of Ground Reaction Forces will be measured using Kistler force platform. The subject was asked to perform twice, in order to place both right and left foot on the force platform while performing footwork steps test ZAP-3. Ground Reaction Forces will be registered in degrees in newtons unit.</description>
