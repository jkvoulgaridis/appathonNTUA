  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study will evaluate a new in-the-ear (ITE) hearing aid hardware. The goal is to
      evaluate the audiological performance, usability, feature function, and to identify
      unexpected or unwanted behaviour from the devices. The study plans to compare the
      behind-the-ear (BTE) hardware style with the ITE devices regarding the benefit received from
      different microphone locations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hearing aids constantly undergo incremental improvements from already marketed devices. The
      new devices are expected to perform as well or better than the previous ITE devices.

      The aim of the testing is to grant quality control prior to product launch according to
      Bernafon development requirements.

      The current study will evaluate a new ITE hearing aid hardware. The firmware driving the
      hearing aid has already been sold on the market using the BTE hardware for almost one year
      and will now be launched using the ITE custom hardware. The goal is to evaluate the
      audiological performance, usability, feature function, and to identify unexpected or unwanted
      behaviour from the devices. The study plans to compare the two hardware styles regarding the
      benefit received from different microphone locations.

      As human subjects are involved the validation falls under the definition of a clinical
      investigation. The validation will address the performance of the new chip using the ITE
      hardware, and ensure that there is no reduction in speech understanding between using the BTE
      and ITE hardware styles. Evaluating the overall performance of the Mermaid 9 ITE devices is
      important to validate that the end user is satisfied with the devices and that all user
      requirements are fulfilled. All features available in Mermaid 9 have been validated and are
      currently used on the market in Mermaid 9 BTE devices.

    <measure>Speech Intelligibility Performance</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of one month.</time_frame>
    <description>Speech test scores will be measured with speech reception thresholds (SRTs) of speech in noise in three conditions: unaided, aided with the BTE device, and aided with the new ITE device. The test is the Oldenburg Sentence test (OLSA) and uses nonsense sentences. The score is measured by the the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at which 50% of words in a sentence list are correctly repeated. The speech is always presented at 65 decibels (dB) and the background noise varies to maintain the 50% correct. A lower SNR score indicates a better score. The maximum score will be 15 dB and the minimum will be -5 dB.</description>

    <description>Word recognition test scores will be measured with speech reception thresholds (SRTs) of speech in noise in three conditions: unaided, aided with the BTE device, and aided with the new ITE device. The test is called the Göttinger sentence test (GÖSA) and uses content relevant sentences that subjects repeat . The score is measured by the the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at which 50% of words in a sentence list are correctly repeated. The speech is always presented at 65 decibels (dB) and the background noise varies to maintain the 50% correct. A lower SNR score indicates a better score. The maximum score will be 15 dB and the minimum will be -5 dB.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective Performance of Aided Benefit</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of one month.</time_frame>
    <description>The subjective performance for the new device will be measured with the APHAB questionnaire (Abbreviated Hearing Aid Benefit Profile). The questionnaire is a list of 24 statement that the subjects must agree or disagree with using a scale of units from A to G (A being Always and G being Never). Each letter has a corresponding score used for the calculation: A receives 99, B receives 87, C receives 75, D receives 50, E receives 25, F receives 12, and G receives 1.
An average for each subscale is calculated, and a global or overall score can be calculated by taking the mean of the three positive subscales (Ease of communication, Background noise, and Reverberation). For these three subscales a higher score indicates a better performance. The highest possible score is 99 and the lowest is 1. The fourth scale (Aversiveness) is a negative scale meaning that a higher score means a worse performance. The highest possible score is 99 and the lowest is 1.</description>

    <measure>Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of one month.</time_frame>
    <description>The number of adverse events reported including adverse events (AEs) related to the device will be used to measure the outcome. Adverse Events will be collected in an interview with the subjects during the Appointment. The minimum number of adverse Events possible is 0 and the maximum is infinite. A lower number means a better Outcome.</description>

    <measure>Unexpected device behavior</measure>

    <description>Subjects will a questionnaire to report unexpected behavior. A 5-point scale is used with 0 being the lowest answer possible (never occuring) and 5 being the highest answer possible (occuring often). A lower scale is a better score.</description>
