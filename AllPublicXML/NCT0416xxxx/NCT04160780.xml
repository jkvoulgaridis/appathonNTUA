  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe maxillary atrophy occurs after extraction of teeth in poster maxilla due to
      dimensional changes occur after removal; besides, sinus membrane pneumatization causes
      alveolar bone resorption, different classification for remaining alveolar bone in the
      posterior maxilla were done. In this study, the ABC sinus classification was followed in case
      selection. A sinus augmentation is done with several techniques. Sinus membrane elevation is
      done with two different approaches, either the crestal approach or lateral window approach.

      Using biofiller material for sinus membrane elevation has been tried by many researchers,
      using a bone graft, platelet concentrates preparation, collagen membranes, tenting screws, or
      with implant tenting.

      In this study, sinus augmentation was performed using a lateral window approach using L-PRF
      as sole biofiller material in one group, xenograft as only biofiller material in the second
      group and mixed xenograft with L-PRF in the third group. Histomorphometric analysis was done
      from the core biopsy after three months of augmentation, and implant placement was done.

      After three months, prosthetic parts were placed. The results of this study show that the
      augmentation of the sinus using L-PRF mixed with bone graft is showing the best results
      followed by L-PRF only, and the least was xenograft.

      From this point of discussion, it can be considered that using L-PRF as sole biofiller
      material in sinus augmentation.

    <description>After three months from sinus augmentation, a second surgery will be done for implant placement; during this procedure, a bone core biopsy will be harvested. The biopsy will be stained with mason stain for histomorphometric analysis. The aim is to measure the newly formed bone for three months.</description>
