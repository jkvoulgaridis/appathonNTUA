  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multi-centre study will compare the acceptability and feasibility of intermittent
      preventive treatment (IPTp) with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) alone, or combined with
      azithromycin, to the current strategy of IPTp with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) to prevent
      malaria, sexually transmitted and reproductive tract infections in HIV-uninfected pregnant
      women (IMPROVE) .
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Overall aim: To determine whether IPTp with DP, alone or combined with AZ, is a feasible and
      acceptable alternative to current policies.

      Primary objectives:

      To assess the acceptability and feasibility of monthly IPTp-DP, with or without AZ, compared
      to current policy of IPTp-SP in HIV-uninfected pregnant women.

      We will also conduct an 'implementation feasibility' study in the routine setting in adjacent
      sites to the IMPROVE trial site in Kenya (only), using a 3-arm cluster randomized design to
      assess systems effectiveness, implementation strength, scalability, and identify potential
      operational hurdles for scale up. The feasibility study will be done in HIV-uninfected women
      only. Ministry of health nurses providing routine ANC services will be trained to provide
      IPTp-DP or IPTp-DP+AZ, or refresher training for current policy (IPTp-SP). The interventions
      will be implemented for a period of 10 months. Approximately 5-6 months after the start of
      implementation, delivery effectiveness will be assessed through exit interviews with pregnant
      women leaving ANC clinics. Women who receive the correct doses of the interventions will be
      followed up at home 4-5 days after their clinic visit (i.e. no more than 2 days after their
      3-day regimen finished) and interviewed about adherence, including pill counts. The
      quantitative study will be supplemented by a qualitative study to explain the quantitative
      outcomes and to assess perceptions of scalability of the interventions tested.

      Feasibility study Interventions:

      Monthly IPTp regimens: Arm 1. Standard single-day stat course of quality-assured SP; Arm 2.
      Standard 3-day course of 3 to 5 tablets (40/320mg) of DP per day based on bodyweight
      (Eurartesim®, AlfaSigma, Italy); Arm 3. Same as 2, plus AZ (Throza®, Universal Cooperation
      Ltd), 2 tablets (500mg) daily for 2 days, given at first ANC visit in second and third
      trimester only.

      Outcome Measures

      Feasibility study:

      Primary Outcome - Adherence assessed through home visits: Proportion of pregnant women
      attending ANC who receive the first dose of IPTp by DOT and the correct number of tablets for
      subsequent doses (IPTp-DP +/- AZ) visited at home and who have verified they completed the
      treatment. Where IPTp-SP is given by DOT this is assumed as 100% adherence and that the
      correct dosage is given.

      Secondary outcome - Delivery effectiveness assessed by exit interviews with pregnant women
      leaving ANC: Proportion of pregnant women attending ANC for their first and second visit in
      their second or third trimester who receive an appropriate dose with each drug/drug
      combination. For both IPTp-DP and IPTp-DP+AZ arms, women will be asked whether the first dose
      was given by DOT and the correct number of tablets for subsequent doses available on exit.
      For IPTp-SP the full dose should be given by DOT.

      Sample sizes:

      Feasibility exit interviews (delivery rate): 1,485 pregnant women Feasibility home visits
      (adherence rate): 744 pregnant women Acceptability among pregnant women: approx. 90
      Acceptability among health providers: approx.90
