      The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of an app-based mindfulness
      meditation intervention for PA students.

      The investigators will measure feasibility of using the Calm app for 10-minutes a day for
      four weeks in PA students. Feasibility will be measured with acceptability (i.e. satisfaction
      survey), demand (participation in the app as prescribed), and practicality (i.e., survey).
      Secondly, the investigators will determine the preliminary effects of a 4-week meditation
      intervention on burnout levels in PA students when compared to a wait list control group.
      Burnout symptoms (primary outcome), mindfulness, stress levels, and depressive symptoms
      (secondary outcomes) will be measured at baseline and post-intervention (4-weeks). Data
      gathered from this study will inform a future randomized controlled trial to determine the
      effects of a mindfulness meditation app on burnout in PA students. The information could also
      be used to design other studies assessing burnout in the workplace.

      Aim 1: Determine the feasibility (acceptability, demand, practicality) of using the Calm app
      10-minutes per day for four weeks in PA students. For the intervention group, our benchmarks
      will be as follows: 1) Acceptability (i.e., satisfaction) ≥70%, 2) Demand (i.e.,
      participation in the app as prescribed, intention to use) ≥70%, 3) Practicality (i.e.,
      survey) ≥70%.

      Aim 2: Determine the preliminary effects of using the Calm app 10-minutes per day for four
      weeks on burnout (primary outcome) mindfulness, stress levels, and depressive symptoms
      (secondary outcomes) in PA students as compared to a wait-list control group.

    <description>The Maslach Burnout Inventory is a 22-item inventory used to measure aspects of the burnout syndrome within three subscales: emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and personal accomplishment. Using a seven-point scale (0, never; 1, a few times per year; 2, once a month; 3, a few times a month; 4, once a week; 5, a few times a week; 6, every day), participants rate their experience of burnout. Possible scores on the emotional exhaustion subscale range from 0 to 54. Possible scores on the depersonalization subscale range from 0 to 30. For both the emotional exhaustion and depersonalization subscales, higher mean scores correspond to higher degrees of burnout. Possible scores on the personal accomplishment subscale range from 0 to 48. Lower mean scores on the personal accomplishment subscale correspond to higher degrees of burnout. Scores are computes via sum.</description>

    <measure>Mindfulness</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to post-intervention (week 4).</time_frame>
    <description>The Freidburg Mindfulness Inventory is used to measure mindfulness using a 14-item questionnaire covering all aspects of mindfulness. Using a four-point scale, (1, rarely; 2, occasionally; 3, fairly often; 4, almost always), participants are asked to characterize their experience of mindfulness. Higher scores indicate higher levels of mindfulness. Scores are computed via sum.</description>

    <measure>Stress</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to post-intervention (week 4).</time_frame>
    <description>The Perceived Stress Scale is a 10-item inventory used for the assessment of perceived stress. The scale measures the degree to which situations are appraised as stressful. The items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (never) to 4 (very often). Higher scores indicate higher levels of stress. Scores are computed via sum.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to post-intervention (week 4).</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 is used to measure and diagnose depression using a 9-item self-report measure. Items are rated 4-item scale ranging from 0 (Not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). Higher scores correspond with more severe depressive symptoms. Scores are computed via sum.</description>

    <description>Participants will be asked to download the Calm app on their smartphone. Participants will then receive an email containing login credentials to access the Calm app. Once they receive this email and they receive their study start date, they will be asked to meditate for at least 10 minutes a day for 8 weeks. This prescription mimics how a new, paying member would use the app. Participants in the intervention group will be emailed weekly reminders.</description>
