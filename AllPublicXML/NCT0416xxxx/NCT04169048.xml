  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The first disorder-specific parenting training program for mothers with Borderline
      Personality Disorder (M-BPD) is evaluated in a randomized controlled trial.

      The training program is expected to have positive effects on parenting behavior, decrease the
      risk of maltreatment of the child, and improve emotion regulation in mothers at post
      treatment and at 6-month follow-up compared to a control group (treatment as usual; TAU).

      Additionally, disorder-specific aspects of dysfunctional parenting behavior as well as
      BPD-specific aspects of child maltreatment are compared to a clinical control group (mothers
      with anxiety and/or depression, M-AD/D) and a healthy control group (M-CON).

      To assess the differential development of parenting, the risk of maltreatment and emotion
      dysregulation in untreated M-BPD are compared to M-CON. The investigators expect the
      difference to increase over time, indicating a worsening in BPD parenting.
