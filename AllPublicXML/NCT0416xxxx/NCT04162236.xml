  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preeclampsia (PE) is a pregnancy-related hypertensive disorder drive by an anti-angiogenic
      environment. Women with PE have 2-4 time higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease
      (CVD), although the specific mechanism relating these two conditions remains elusive. In
      non-pregnant patients with coronary disease, angiogenic profile proved to be an independent
      predictor of poor prognosis and is associated with a higher mortality rate. The investigators
      hypothesized that in PE, the antiangiogenic environment determines the degree of cardiac
      dysfunction and remodeling and the posterior cardiovascular risk.

      Main objective: To determinie the relationship between antiangiogenic environment and cardioc
      dysfuntion and remodelin in women at risk and in established PE. M&amp;M: placental dysfunction
      markers (angiogenic factors (PlGF) and anti-angiogenic factor (sFlt1) and cardiovascular risk
      variables (BMI, BP, arterial stiffness, copectin, proBNP, high-sensitivity troponin, carotid
      intima thickness and echocardiography parameters) would be evaluated in 280 patients at risk
      of PE according to first trimester screening and 100 controls. Additionally, cardiac
      dysfunction parameters would be evaluated in women with established PE (n=60) and common
      transcriptomic signatures between cardiovascular disease and preeclampsia would be
      investigated in placental samples from 10 PE and 10 controls. It will provide evidences to
      evaluate and characterize the association between angiogenic factors and cardiac dysfunction
      and remodeling in PE.

    <description>Women with a singleton pregnancies attending for prenatal care in the maternal and fetal Medicine Unit will be asked to participate if they meet the following criteria:
1)High risk for preeclampsia according to first trimester screening (maternal risk factors, blood preassure, PPAP-A, mean pulsatility index (PIm) of the uterine arteries (UtA) at 11.0 to 13.6 weeks of gestation (n=280).
Women in this group will be subdivided in cases and controls according to the later development of preeclampsia:
cases: women developing PE (estimated n=40)
controls: women not developing PE (estimated n=240)</description>

    <description>Epidemiological data: Maternal history risk factors. First trimester scan is performed on all patients.
Antropomethric measures
Systemic arterial stiffness: using applanation tonometry with pulse wave analysis and pulse wave velocity.
Carotid Intima Thickness
Echocardiography assessment: It will be performed by a cardiologist specialized in cardiac imaging according to the usual standard protocol. High resolution images will be acquired and post-processed with dedicated software for the speckle tracking analysis. 2D echocardiography parameters to be acquired, tissue Doppler and speckle tracking software
Markers in maternal blood: Angiogenic factor and cardiac function biomarkers: Blood samples will be collected without anticoagulant to obtain serum. sFLT-1, PlGF, High-sensitivity Troponin and NT-proBNP will be measured using automated electrochemiluminescence immunoassays.</description>
