  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAC) incidence increases regularly in Western countries and it is
      expected to become the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality in 2020. The
      prognosis of this disease remains very poor with an overall 5-year survival rate less than
      5%.

      The FOLFIRINOX regimen (5-fluorouracil [5-FU], folinic acid, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin) and
      the combination of nab-paclitaxel with gemcitabine demonstrated to be more effective than
      gemcitabine alone, and are both validated as standard first-line treatment options for
      metastatic PAC. However, the use of FOLFIRINOX is limited to patients with ECOG performance
      status (PS) 0-1 and aged less than 75 years. Nab-paclitaxel is currently not reimbursed in
      France.

      This trial is an open label, multicenter, randomized phase III trial comparing gemcitabine vs
      FOLFOX in patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma and non-fit for FOLFIRINOX.
      Adults fulfilling inclusion criteria and non-inclusion criteria will be randomized between a
      FOLFOX arm and a gemcitabine arm. The primary endpoint is the overall survival (OS) at 24
      months. The secondary objectives are : objective response rate and disease control rate
      (RECIST v1.1, in case of evaluable lesion), duration of response, duration of disease
      control, progression free survival (PFS), the evolution of biomarkers Ca 19-9 and CEA under
      treatment, the toxicities according to International Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
      Events (CTCAE) version 4.0, the safety of both arms, the quality of life, the dose intensity
      (DI) of each protocol, the Quality-Adjusted Survival, and the rate and type of second-line /
      third-line regimens chemotherapy. With an expected median survival time in the control group
      of 5 months, an accrual period of 3 years and a minimum follow-up period of 2 years, a total
      of 199 patients per group are required to detect a hazard ratio of 0.75 based on a 5%
      two-sided type I error rate and a power of 80%, leading to a total number of 400 patients to
      include.

The primary Q-TWiST analysis will be performed using the Intention-to-treat analysis(ITT) population, and will be supplemented with analyses in the per-protocol population (i.e., patients who received ≥80% of the protocol-defined treatment during the first 6 weeks of treatment) and analysed in pre-specified subgroups: age (&lt;75 years, ≥75 years), baseline PS (0-1, 2), liver metastases (Yes, No), and tumour location (head, other).</description>
