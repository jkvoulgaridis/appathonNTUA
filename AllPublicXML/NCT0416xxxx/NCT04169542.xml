    <textblock>
      This trial studies the impact of out-of-pocket costs, lost wages, and unemployment in
      patients with breast cancer undergoing breast surgery. Post-mastectomy reconstructive
      patients are at high risk for financial toxicity (adverse effects of escalating health care
      cost on well-being). This study is being done to collect information about financial costs
      patients may have as a result of breast reconstruction. This may help researchers demonstrate
      the financial consequences of undergoing breast surgery.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Obtain Comprehensive Score for financial Toxicity (COST) questionnaire data from the
      patients who are undergoing any form of breast reconstruction.

      II. To determine which patients are at higher risk of financial toxicity while pursuing
      breast reconstruction.

      III. Assess if financial toxicity or distress is associated with worse BREAST-questionnaire
      (Q) performance as well as quality of life.

      IV. To estimate total out of pocket expenses and lost production due to treatment.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients complete up to 4 electronic questionnaires over 15 minutes before surgery and at 6,
      12, and 24 months after surgery . Patients also complete a web-based cost diary to capture
      out-of-pocket expenses monthly for 12 months.

      After completion of study, patients will be followed up for 1 year.

    <description>Will be measured by the Comprehensive Score for financial Toxicity questionnaire and cost diary. Summary statistics including mean, standard deviation, median, and range for continuous variables, and frequency count and percentage for categorical variables will be provided. Various subgroup analyses may occur. In these cases, continuous variables will be compared using the two-sample t-test and categorical variables will be compared using chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test. Multivariate regression analysis will be performed to account for confounding and to increase the robustness of any causal inference.</description>
