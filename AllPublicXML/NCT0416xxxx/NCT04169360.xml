  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double blind, placebo controlled, randomized trial to evaluate the safety and
      preliminary efficacy of ANS-6637 in adults with opioid use disorder with and without opioid
      agonist therapy. Patients will be randomized to two arms: (1) ANS-6637 for three months vs
      (2) Placebo for three months. Subjects will subsequently be followed for an additional one
      month post treatment.

    <measure>Opioid Craving</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Opioid craving will be assessed using the Opioid Craving scale questionnaire. The questionnaire consists of three questions and each of these questions has a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value 10. A score of 0 on each question is the best outcome; a score of 10 on each question is the worst outcome.</description>

    <measure>Self reported description of drug use (Self-reported frequency/quantity/mode of opioid use, self-reported use of other drugs, overdose and overdose death)</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported frequency/quantity/mode of opioid use as well as self-reported use of other drugs will be gathered using the Drug Use Survey. Subjects will indicate frequency of opioid use by documenting the number of times they used an opioid during a given day. The quantity of opioids used will be determined by the dollar amount of opioids the subject reports they have consumed during that day. Subjects will also report mode of opioid use by indicating whether they are using opioids via injection, skin popping, snorting or oral. The Drug Use Survey will also ask subjects to report incidence of use of non-opioid substances. Incidence of overdose will be captured with the Naloxone questionnaire which asks, &quot;since you last visit, have you experienced an overdose?&quot;. Incidence of overdose death will measured by the number of medical examiner confirmed deaths of study participants with cause of death listed as &quot;overdose related to an opioid&quot;.</description>
