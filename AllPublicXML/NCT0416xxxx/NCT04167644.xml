    <textblock>
      The ideal management of blood pressure in BP after acute intracerebral haemorrhage is still
      debated and whether a higher intensive reduction of blood pressure after acute intracerebral
      haemorrhage may be better or not is still controversial. Conflicting results from different
      randomized trials in regards to the clinical guidelines for management of hypertension in
      people with acute intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). These results indicate that the management
      of BP and the prognosis after acute spontaneous ICH are very complicated.

      Therefore, analysis based on actual blood pressure (BP) accomplished may be a more efficient
      method to assess the impact of BP management on outcome of ICH.

      In our research, blood pressure (BP) management and prognosis were studied in patients with
      acute intracerebral hemorrhage to decide the perfect time control BP to improve outcome.

      Methods:

      Patients were diagnosed by clinical examination and according to the initial CT brain after
      the onset of ICH.

      Intensive management of blood pressure (BP) started once the diagnosis of intracerebral
      hemorrhage was established. Systolic blood pressure targeted 140 mm Hg by IV drug that lower
      BP like nicardipine or diltiazem. Oral antihypertensive medications like (Angiotensin II
      Receptor Blockers (ARBs) or Ca-blocker), after 24 h of hospitalization, was utilized in
      combination and step by step changed from intravenous administration.

      Patients were exposed to:

      A) Complete history taking and complete clinical assessment including neurological and
      general examinations.

      B) Initial Glasgow Coma Scale score at admission to hospital and patients according to GCS
      score were classified to 3 groups I (13-15), II (5-12), and III (3-4 ) according to Hemphill
      et al 2001.

      C-Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) is a profoundly valid and reliable measure of disability and is
      broadly utilized for assessing stroke outcomes and degree of disability. We characterized a
      favorable outcome as mRS ranging from zero up to two, while unfavorable outcome ranging for 3
      up to six].

      D- Routine laboratory examinations including CBC, blood sugar, coagulation tests, renal and
      hepatic functions.

      E- CT brain was accomplished for all patients at onset of admission to hospital to decide the
      characters of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). The volume of the intracerebral
      hemorrhage was determined utilizing the ABC/2 method (A is the most great diameter on the
      most large ICH cut, B is the diameter perpendicular to A, while, C is the number of axial
      cuts of ICH multiplied by the thickness of cuts. Additionally, the location ICH (regardless
      of whether infra or supatrentorial), and if there is IVH or not, also, if there is shift of
      midline structure or hydrocephalic changes were determined. Regarding ICH volume, patients
      were partitioned into two groups (&lt; 30 cm3 and ≥30 cm3).

      Statistical analysis

      SPSS version 19.0 was utilized for statistical analysis. Data were collected and displayed as
      numbers proportions, mean ± standard deviation, and range. Favorable and unfavorable groups
      were compared by chi-square measurement. For variable with ordinary distributions and
      homogeneous variances, Student's t-test was utilized to check the significant difference
      between the mean ± standard deviation values in the two groups. P value &lt;0.05 were considered
      of statistical significant results.

      Multivariate logistic regression analysis was accomplished for the independent variables or
      factors that were accompanied by better outcomes: like younger ages, GCS at admission,
      diastolic blood pressure one hour after admission, systolic BP 6 h after admission, and
      systolic blood pressure 24 h after admission.

        The present study was conducted during the period from May 2018 to the end of April 2019.
        This study was conducted on150 patients presented by acute spontaneous intracerebral
        hemorrhage (ICH) were admitted to the Department of Neurology of Mansoura University
        Hospital. Modified Rankin Scale score (mRS) after discharge was calculated and accordingly,
        patients were partitioned into two main groups: The first group was favorable outcome
        patients (mRS queal 0-2) and the second group was unfavorable outcome patients (mRS queal
        3-6). Independent factors that were significantly related to prognosis were assessed by
        multivariate logistic regression.
