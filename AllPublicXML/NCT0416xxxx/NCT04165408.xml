      This trial is to assess the safety and clinical performance of Contino device is preventing
      Urinary Incontinence in male subjects with Sphincteric Incompetence
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sphincteric incompetence is most commonly found in men who have had radical prostatectomy
      (RP). RP is the most common treatment for localized high-risk Prostate Cancer in North
      America.

      The Contino®, a urethral insert, was conceived by a prostate cancer survivor and worn for 10+
      years without incident, and a First in Human clinical trial was completed without serious
      adverse event. The basis for this clinical trial is a post market clinical follow-up study.
      No drug treatment will be administered.

    <description>The Contino® urethral insert is a self-administered licensed medical device, is inserted into the distal portion of the male urethra inhibiting the flow of urine. The Contino is self-inserted into the adult male urethra and is removed prior to urination. Much more than just a device, Contino® is an integrated solution that includes personalised fitting and support from incontinence specialists. It is made from highly specialised medical grade polymer, which has been extensively tested for biocompatibility.</description>
