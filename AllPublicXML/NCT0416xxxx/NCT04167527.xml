      This study will test the hypothesis that patients presenting within 8 hours of onset with
      cerebral ischemia in the setting of proximal large vessel occlusions (LVO) and low baseline
      NIHSS scores (0-5) will have better 90-day clinical outcomes (mRS distribution) with
      immediate mechanical thrombectomy (iMT) compared to initial medical management (iMM).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, the vast majority of these patients do not receive immediate vessel imaging with
      either CT- or MR-angiography. However, acute ischemic stroke patients with low NIHSS who
      harbor a large vessel occlusion (LVO) later decline in 20-40% of cases, and/or have
      underappreciated impairments related to their relatively mild strokes. Similarly, LVO
      patients presenting with a transient ischemic attack (TIA) are under increased risk of
      clinical deterioration. Such patients with apparent good collateral circulation, and hence a
      substantial perfusion of the vascular territory of the occluded large artery, likely have the
      most to gain from endovascular revascularization. At the same time, this collateral perfusion
      may allow for more frequent recanalization, either spontaneously or by intravenous (IV) rtPA.
      Experience with immediate mechanical thrombectomy (iMT) in the LVO mild stroke target
      population is limited.

      This study will test the hypothesis that patients presenting within 8 hours of onset with
      cerebral ischemia in the setting of proximal large vessel occlusions (LVO) and low baseline
      NIHSS scores (0-5) will have better 90-day clinical outcomes (mRS distribution) with
      immediate mechanical thrombectomy (iMT) compared to initial medical management (iMM).

    <time_frame>24 hours post randomization</time_frame>
    <description>Early Neurologic Deterioration (END) is defined as an increase in NIHSS of â‰¥4 points. NIH Stroke Scale/Score (NIHSS) is a 15-item neurologic examination stroke scale used to evaluate the effect of acute cerebral infarction on the levels of consciousness, language, neglect, visual-field loss, extraocular movement, motor strength, ataxia, dysarthria, and sensory loss. A trained observer rates the patent's ability to answer questions and perform activities. Ratings for each item are scored with 3 to 5 grades with 0 as normal, and there is an allowance for untestable items.</description>

    <measure>Health-related quality of life EQ-5D score comparing the two treatment arms</measure>
    <time_frame>90-day</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-5D is a standardized instrument measuring health-related quality of life. The EQ-5D consists of a descriptive system and the EQ VAS.
The descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. The EQ VAS records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale. The scores on these five dimensions can be presented as a health profile or can be converted to a single summary index number.</description>

    <measure>Self-reported mental and physical health PROMIS Global-10 score</measure>
    <time_frame>90-day</time_frame>
    <description>Mental and physical health will be assessed using PROMIS Global-10. The PROMIS Global-10 short form consists of 10 items that assess general domains of health and functioning including overall physical health, mental health, social health, pain, fatigue, and overall perceived quality of life.Scores are converted to a T-Score metric.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-reported PROMIS Fatigue score</measure>
    <time_frame>90-day</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS Fatigue assesses a range of self-reported symptoms, from mild subjective feelings of tiredness to an overwhelming, debilitating, and sustained sense of exhaustion that likely decreases one's ability to execute daily activities and function normally in family or social roles. Fatigue is divided into the experience of fatigue (frequency, duration, and intensity) and the impact of fatigue on physical, mental, and social activities.
Each question has five response options ranging in value from one to five.To find the total raw score, values of the response to each question will be summed up. Total raw score will be transformed into a T-score for each participant. The T-score rescales the raw score into a standardized score with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation (SD) of 10. Therefore, a person with a T-score of 40 is one SD below the mean.</description>

The IADL scale covers eight functional domains: using the telephone, shopping, food preparation, housekeeping, laundry, transport, medication, and finances. Participants are scored according to their highest level of functioning in categories, and summary score ranges from 0 (low function, dependent) to 8 (high function, independent).</description>
