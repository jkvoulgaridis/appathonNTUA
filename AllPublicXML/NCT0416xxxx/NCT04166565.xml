    <textblock>
      This trial will try to establish the feasibility and efficacy of the combination of DaraVCD
      in Multiple Myeloma (MM) patients presenting with extramedullary disease (EMD). The study
      will be conducted as a Phase II trial.

      Forty patients will be included in the study cohort. All patients will be followed closely
      for toxicities and response assessment. After completion of treatment, patients will be
      followed every 6 months for survival until 5 years after enrolment

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Confirmed diagnosis of Multiple Myeloma(MM) (IMWG consensus guidelines)

          2. Newly diagnosed or relapsed (patients should have received a maximum of one line of
             prior therapy) patients presenting with extramedullary disease (EMD) of the skin,
             liver, lungs, central nervous system, lymph nodes or other tissues, but not solely
             paraskeletal plasmacytoma (expanding soft tissue masses)* detected by physical exam
             and confirmed (when required) by Weight Bearing CT/MRI/PET-CT and/or biopsy**.
             Documentation of plasma cell infiltration is highly recommended unless it requires
             invasive surgical intervention such as intracerebral infiltration of plasmacytomas.

             *Note: patients with only paraosseous extension of MM forming soft tissue
             plasmacytomas are not eligible

             **Note: An additional radiologic assessment at screening is not required to confirm
             EMD. Documentation in terms of physician's/pathologist's report and/or radiologic
             assessments performed within 42 days of C1D1 will suffice for the purposes of
             eligibility. All patients however will undergo a baseline radiologic assessment at
             C1D1 for response purposes.

          3. Patients with one prior line of therapy must have:

               -  achieved a response (PR or better based on investigator's determination of
                  response by the IMWG criteria) to at least one prior regimen.

               -  documented evidence of PD based on Investigator's determination of response as
                  defined by the IMWG criteria on or after the last line of treatment.

          4. Age ≥ 18 years

          5. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 2. Note: for patients
             with central nervous system (CNS) involvement, an ECOG performance status &gt;2 is also
             acceptable

          6. Each patient must sign an informed consent form (ICF) indicating that he or she
             understands the purpose of and procedures required for the study and are willing to
             participate in the study. Patients must be willing and able to adhere to the
             prohibitions and restrictions specified in this protocol, as referenced in the ICF.

          7. Patient must have measurable disease of MM as defined by the below criteria:

               -  IgG MM: Serum M protein level ≥1.0 g/dL or urine M protein level ≥200 mg/24
                  hours, or

               -  IgA, IgD, IgE, IgM MM: Serum M-protein level ≥0.5 g/dL or urine M-protein level
                  ≥200 mg/24 hours; or

               -  Light chain MM, for patients without measurable disease in the serum or urine:
                  Serum immunoglobulin free light chain (FLC) ≥10 mg/dL and abnormal serum
                  immunoglobulin kappa lambda FLC ratio.

          8. Reproductive Status

               -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum or urine
                  pregnancy test at screening. Females are not of childbearing potential if they
                  have been in natural menopause for at least 24 consecutive months, or have had a
                  hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy

               -  Women must not be breastfeeding

               -  WOCBP must agree to follow instructions for reliable methods of birth control.
                  This includes one highly effective (&lt; 1% failure rate per year) form of
                  contraception (tubal ligation, intrauterine device (IUD), combined or progestogen
                  only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation [birth
                  control pills, injections, hormonal patches, vaginal rings or implants] or
                  partner's vasectomy) and one additional effective contraceptive method (male
                  latex or synthetic condom, diaphragm, or cervical cap). Contraception must begin
                  4 weeks before the start of treatment and continue for the duration of study
                  treatment and for 3 months after cessation of daratumumab or 12 months after
                  cessation of cyclophosphamide, whichever is longer.

               -  Males who are sexually active must always use a latex or synthetic condom during
                  any sexual contact with females of reproductive potential, even if they have
                  undergone a successful vasectomy. They must also agree to follow instructions for
                  methods of contraception for 4 weeks before the start of study treatment, for the
                  duration of study treatment, and for 3 months after cessation of daratumumab or 6
                  months after cessation of cyclophosphamide, whichever is longer.

               -  Female patients must not donate eggs for up to 3 months after cessation of
                  daratumumab or 12 months after cessation of cyclophosphamide, whichever is
                  longer.

               -  Male patients must not donate sperm for up to 3 months after cessation of
                  daratumumab or 6 months after cessation of cyclophosphamide, whichever is longer.

               -  Azoospermic males and WOCBP who are not heterosexually active are exempt from
                  contraceptive requirements. However, WOCBP will still undergo pregnancy testing
                  as described above.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Solitary plasmacytoma

          2. Paraosseous extension of MM forming soft tissue plasmacytomas only (without EMD).

          3. Previous therapy with any anti-CD38 or anti-CS1 monoclonal antibody

          4. Patients refractory to bortezomib based regimens (PD on or within 60 days of

             half-lives of the treatment, whichever is longer, before Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1). The
             only exception is emergency use of a short course of corticosteroids (equivalent of
             dexamethasone 40 mg/day for a maximum of 4 days) for palliative treatment before C1D1.

          8. Previous autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) within 12 weeks before C1D1.

               -  Hemoglobin level ≤7.5 g/dL (≤4.65 mmol/L); transfusions are not allowed to reach
                  this level

               -  Platelet count ≤75 × 109/L in patients in whom &lt;50% of bone marrow nucleated

                  reach this level

         19. Concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical condition (e.g. uncontrolled diabetes,
             active systemic infection, uncontrolled hypertension, cancer, etc.) that is likely to
             interfere with the study procedures/results or which, in the opinion of the
             investigator, would constitute a hazard for participating in this study.

         20. History of active malignancy during the past 5 years with the exception of basal
             carcinoma of the skin or stage 0 cervical carcinoma;

               -  Patient is seropositive for hepatitis B (defined by a positive test for hepatitis
                  B surface antigen [HBsAg]). Patients with resolved infection (ie, patients who
                  are positive for antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen [antiHBc] and/or
                  antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen [antiHBs]) must be screened using
                  real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) measurement of hepatitis B virus (HBV)
                  DNA levels. Those who are PCR positive will be excluded.

             EXCEPTION: Patients with serologic findings suggestive of HBV vaccination (antiHBs
             positivity as the only serologic marker) AND a known history of prior HBV vaccination,
             do not need to be tested for HBV DNA by PCR.

             o Known to be seropositive for hepatitis C (except in the setting of a sustained
             virologic response, defined as aviremia at least 12 weeks after completion of
             antiviral therapy).
