  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Worldwide, osteoporosis causes more than 8.9 million fractures per annum. Osteoporosis used
      to be a significant public health concern that most commonly affected Caucasian women in
      Northern Europe and the United States. Recently, it has become a major public health problem
      in Asia, most notably among Chinese women.

      We intend to conduct a cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) to examine if a physical
      activity and education intervention, compared with an education-only intervention (waiting
      list for physical activity), can result in improved physical activity, reduced falls, and
      maintaining bone mass, among female nursing home residents in China. The aim of the current
      pilot and feasibility trial is to test the feasibility and acceptability of conducting these
      interventions.

      A pilot and feasibility cluster RCT will be conducted for females aged 60 to 75 years living
      in nursing homes in Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan Province, Western China. The unit of
      cluster randomization is the nursing home. A total of four nursing homes (two state-owned and
      two private-owned) will be involved in the pilot and feasibility trial. They will be randomly
      selected and afterwards randomly assigned to either the intervention group (2 nursing homes)
      or control group (2 nursing homes). We seek to recruit 20 women from each nursing home.

      The intervention group participants will exercise with the research staff or under
      supervision of the trained nursing home staff, and will receive face-to-face workshops,
      booklet, newsletters, phone calls, and short message service (SMS) reminders. Participants in
      the control group will only receive educational materials (i.e. face-to-face workshops and
      booklet) and will be wait listed to receive no other interventions of this study until after
      the post-intervention. All participants will be referred to doctors for advice and standard
      care as usual.

      The primary outcome is the change of habitual physical activity from baseline to 12 months,
      which will be measured using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire - Short Form
      (IPAQ-SF). Secondary outcomes include incidental falls and change in bone mineral density
      (BMD) from baseline to 12 months. The study results will serve to provide an estimate of the
      effect size, intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and rates of eligibility, recruitment
      and attrition, which may enable a more accurate sample size calculation for a definitive RCT.

    <description>At least six staff from each nursing home that assigned to the intervention group will be invited to attend two educational workshops. Participants in the intervention group will receive the following interventions.
Face-to-face workshops: Five 1-hour educational workshops on physical activity will be delivered in months 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 of the program held at each nursing home.
Booklet: At the first educational workshop, each participant will be provided with a pictorial booklet.
Exercise: The physical activity training consists of 50-60 min exercise sessions three times a week on non-consecutive days for 12 months.
Others (newsletters, phone calls, and reminders): The intervention group will also receive newsletters containing myth dispelling information on osteoporosis and physical activity, motivational phone calls and a total of 52 SMS via mobile phones (reminders to attend workshop sessions and physical activity motivating messages) over 12 months.</description>
