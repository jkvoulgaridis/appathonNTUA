  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Apremilast mediates its clinical effect through the cAMP‐PKA‐NFkappaB pathway which results
      in a clinical picture changes to a decrease of all signs of inflammation.

      Due to the NFkappaB mediated chronical inflammation in the pathogenesis of acne conglobata, a
      treatment with Apremilast seems to be an effective option.

      In this study, treatment with Apremilast (Otezla®) will be performed in patients with acne
      conglobata to observe its preliminary efficacy and safety in an open label, single‐centre
      proof of concept study design.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment options for acne conglobata are limited and those which are effective can only be
      used in short term such as systemic steroids, antibiotics or retinoids due to their
      association to side effects or potentially teratogenetic effects.

      Apremilast, a specific inhibitor for PDE‐4, mediates its clinical effect through the
      cAMP‐PKA‐NFkappaB pathway which results in a decrease of pro‐inflammatory and increase of
      anti‐inflammatory cytokines in several types of leukocytes. The clinical picture changes to a
      decrease of all signs of inflammation.

      Due to the NFkappaB mediated chronical inflammation in the pathogenesis of acne conglobata, a
      treatment with Apremilast seems to be an effective option.

      In this study, treatment with Apremilast (Otezla®) will be performed in patients with acne
      conglobata to observe its preliminary efficacy and safety in an open label, single‐centre
      proof of concept study design.
