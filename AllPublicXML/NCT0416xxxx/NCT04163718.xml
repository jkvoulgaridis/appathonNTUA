        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A diagnosis of B-cell CLL that has not been previously treated and now warrants
             treatment consistent with accepted iwCLL criteria (Hallek 2018) for initiation of
             therapy. Any one of the following conditions constitute CLL that warrants treatment:
             (a) Evidence of progressive marrow failure as manifested by the onset or worsening of
             anemia and/or thrombocytopenia, or (b) Massive (i.e., lower edge of spleen ≥ 6 cm
             below the left costal margin), progressive, or symptomatic splenomegaly, or (c)
             Massive (i.e., ≥ 10 cm in the longest diameter), progressive, or symptomatic
             lymphadenopathy, or (d) Progressive lymphocytosis in the absence of infection, with an
             increase in blood absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) &gt;50% over a 2-month period or
             lymphocyte doubling time of &lt;6 months (as long as initial ALC was ≥30,000/µL), or e)
             Autoimmune anemia and/or thrombocytopenia that is poorly responsive to corticosteroids
             or other standard therapy, or (f) Symptomatic or functional extranodal involvement
             (e.g. skin, kidney, lung, or spine), or (g) Constitutional symptoms, defined as any
             one or more of the following disease-related symptoms or signs occurring in the
             absence of evidence of infection: (i) Unintentional weight loss of ≥10% within the
             previous 6 months, or (ii) Significant fatigue (≥ Grade 2), or (iii) Fevers &gt;100.5°F
             or 38.0°C for ≥2 weeks, or (iv) Night sweats for &gt;1 month.

             partners, and male participants must consent to use a medically acceptable method of
