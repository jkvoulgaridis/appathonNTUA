      This randomized study evaluates the usefulness of the I31 probiotic formula, against placebo,
      in the treatment of symptoms of lactose intolerance.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People with lactose intolerance are unable to fully digest the sugar (lactose) in milk. As a
      result, they may have diarrhea, abdominal pain, gas and bloating after eating or drinking
      dairy products. A deficiency of lactase — an enzyme produced in your small intestine — is
      usually responsible for lactose intolerance. Many people have low levels of lactase but are
      able to digest milk products without problems. In lactose intolerance, though, lactase
      deficiency leads to symptoms after eating dairy foods.

      I31 is a probiotic formula composed of Pediococcus acidilactici strain CECT7483 and
      Lactobacillus plantarum strains CECT7484 and CECT7485, previously shown to improve intestinal
      sensitivity in patients with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). IBS is a functional intestinal
      disease in which recurrent abdominal pain is associated with defecation or a change in bowel
      habits, often accompanied by bloating. Given the overlap in symptoms between IBS and lactose
      intolerance, it is hypothesized that I31 formula could be beneficial for individuals with
      lactose intolerance.

If more than 10ppm in the measurement before ingestion of lactose, and LHBT test was rescheduled and recommendations to avoid complex carbohydrates 24h before the test were repeated. Carbon dioxide (CO2) was measured and used to adjust breath sample for non-alveolar dilution of exhaled air.</description>
