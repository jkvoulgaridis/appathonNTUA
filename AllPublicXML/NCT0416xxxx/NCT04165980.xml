  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Corticomotor excitability, pain sensitivity, descending pain control and somatosensory evoked
      potentials (SEPs) is often altered in acute and chronic pain.

      Topical capsaicin generates stable, long-lasting hyperalgesia and ongoing tonic pain in
      healthy participants, which significantly inhibits corticomotor excitability in the primary
      motor cortex (M1).

      Recent studies (by Fischer et al 2017) indicated that multifocal Transcranial Direct Current
      Stimulation (tDCS) administered to brain regions linked to the resting state motor network
      (network-tDCS) could enhance corticomotor excitability in healthy participants compared to
      single site M1-tDCS.

      It remains unknown whether network-tDCS has also the potential to modulate the inhibitory
      effects on motor cortex excitability, pain sensitivity, descending pain control and SEPs
      associated with prolonged pain

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To date, pain modulation to M1 rs-network tDCS during 8% capsaicin induced pain has not been
      assessed (Mylius, Borckardt and Lefaucheur, 2012). Further, it is unknown how multichannel
      tDCS acts on tonic cutaneous pain for approximately 24 hours.

      The main objective of these projects are to study and characterize quantitatively the effects
      of multichannel tDCS in the development of prolonged pain.

      It is hypothesized that multichannel tDCS of left M1 resting-state network will reduce the
      severity of experimentally prolonged pain over the m. first dorsal interosseous (FDI), will
      increase descending pain control, might possibly increase pain thresholds and simultaneously
      will modulate the peak-to-peak amplitude of SEPs to electrical painful stimulation. Further,
      it is hypothesized that descending pain modulation of M1 tDCS will be related to interference
      with the suppression of cortical excitability

    <measure>Corticomotor excitability</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Corticomotor excitability is expressed as the peak-to-peak amplitude of motor evoked potentials to single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation. It is expected that network-tDCS will reduce corticomotor inhibition induced by tonic pain during 24 hours.</description>

    <measure>Conditioned pain modulation effect</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Conditioned pain modulation effect is an indicator of descending inhibitory control in humans. In this study, it is performed using pressure cuff algometry. The CPM protocol consisted of a constant cuff pressure stimulation (conditioning stimulus) at 70% of the PTT (recorded for pain sensitivity assessment on that day) applied to the left leg and simultaneously one ramped cuff stimulation (test stimulus) at 1 kPa/s applied to the right leg. It is hypothesized that network-tDCS might normalize the CPM effect reduced by tonic pain during 24 hours.</description>

    <measure>Warm detection thresholds (sensitivity measure)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Warm detection thresholds will be assessed using a thermode applied on the volar forearm. The thermode will start increasing the temperature from 32 C (Celsius degrees) until the participant can detect a warm sensation and will immediately press a stop button. This task will be repeted a total of 4 times.
It is hypothesized that 2 daily treatments of active network-tDCS will not modulate this sensitivity measure during prolonged pain due to a small effect size.</description>

    <measure>Heat pain thresholds (pain sensitivity measure)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Heat pain thresholds will be assessed using a thermode applied on the volar forearm. The thermode will start increasing the temperature from 32 C (Celsius degrees) until the participant can detect a temperature increment from just &quot;a warm sensation&quot; to an additional of either &quot;burning&quot; or &quot;painful&quot; and will immediately press a stop button. This task will be repeted a total of 3 times.
It is hypothesized that 2 daily treatments of active network-tDCS will not modulate this pain sensitivity measure during prolonged pain due to a small effect size.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mechanical pain thresholds (pain sensitivity measure)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Mechanical pain thresholds (MPT) were assessed using seven pinprick stimulators (MRC Systems GmbH, Germany) exerting forces ranging from 8 mN to 512 mN over the distal part of the volar forearm. Starting with the lightest, each stimulator is applied in an ascending order until the participant reported a perception of sharpness or pain. If the pain threshold is not reached, the value of 1024 mN was registered. The MPT will be expressed as the geometric mean of five series of ascending/descending series of stimuli.
It is hypothesized that 2 daily treatments of active network-tDCS will not modulate this pain sensitivity measure during prolonged pain due to a small effect size.</description>

    <measure>Cuff pressure pain sensitivity</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>A computer-controlled cuff algometer combined with two 10-cm wide air-pressured cuffs and an electronic visual analogue scale (eVAS; anchored at 0 cm [no pain] and 10 cm [worst pain imaginable]) are used to assess cuff pressure pain detection thresholds (PDT) and pain tolerance thresholds (PTT).
It is hypothesized that 2 daily treatments of active network-tDCS will not modulate these pain sensitivity measures during prolonged pain due to a small effect size.</description>

    <measure>Amplitude of SEPs to electrical painful stimulation</measure>

    <measure>Latency of SEPs to electrical painful stimulation</measure>

    <description>This study has a parallel design and 2 groups: Active tDCS and Sham tDCS. Sham tDCS applies a standard sham protocol consisting of ramping up and down during 30 seconds at the beginning and at the end of each tDCS session. Each tDCS session lasts 20 minutes and applies a total current of 4mA.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>The active comparator is the Active tDCS group. The active tDCS will target the resting-state motor network and will apply a distributed direct current during the whole session. (The TIME during the direct current is applied is the only difference with Sham tDCS) Each tDCS session lasts 20 minutes and applies a total current of 4mA.</description>

    <intervention_name>transcranial direct current stimulation</intervention_name>
    <description>Transcranial direct current stimulation delivers a low intensity current of up to 4 mA per session through small and circular shaped electrodes applied over the scalp. This induces a weak but focal electrical field that may modify the excitability of the underlying cortical target in a polarity and activity dependent fashion.</description>
