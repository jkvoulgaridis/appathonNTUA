    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to estimate the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder
      (PTSD) at one month in women who have given birth at the University Hospital of Angers over a
      period of 1 year.

    <textblock>
      Childbirth is a natural process expected, prepared and imagined by all future parents.

      A traumatic experience of childbirth and its consequences is a major problem that is often
      underestimated for women's health. Some women may develop Post Traumatic Stress Disorder
      (PTSD) after delivery. The literature reports a prevalence of PTSD in relation to childbirth
      of 1.3 to 6%.

      Symptoms of post-traumatic stress can be triggered by any event, perceived as threatening to
      the life or physical integrity of the person or a third party and causing intense fear,
      helplessness and horror.

      It may be thought that childbirth, by its psychological and physiological characteristics,
      can be described as an extreme experience and its experience depends on multiple factors.
      Thus, an innocent childbirth for caregivers can be traumatically experienced by the woman.

      The symptoms described are symptoms of avoidance (inability to return to the scene of trauma,
      denial of trauma), symptoms of intrusion (nightmares, reviviscences) and symptoms of
      neuro-vegetative hyper activation (sleep disorders, anger, emotional indifference ).

      The development of PTSD following childbirth is a known phenomenon, but minimized and very
      little diagnosed by obstetric teams.

      Therefore, it seems interesting to assess the prevalence of PTSD during childbirth in order
      to optimize our management, that is to identify patients at risk of PTSD and offer them
      adapted psychological follow-up.

      This study also aims to describe the kinetics of the development of post-traumatic postpartum
      symptoms and to study the risk factors for the development of PTSD.

    <description>Patients are informed during the 9th month pregnancy consultation consultation at Angers University Hospital by the midwife or obstetrician in charge of the consultation. They are included in the 48 hours following the delivery after their hospitalization in the maternity ward.
During hospitalization, socio-demographic and medical data are collected and the IDP scale is completed before returning home.
Follow-up at one month and one year is carried out by the investigators by means of a telephone call during which the patient answers the PCL-S questionnaire. Also collected during this call are information on the physical and mental state of the patient, the state of health of her newborn and the progress of the return home.
Patients are considered at high risk of PTSD if they have a PCL-S score ≥ 44 at 1 month. A consultation with a psychiatrist is offered to these patients at risk of PTSD in order to make the diagnosis and offer them appropriate care if necessary.</description>
