  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human, open-label, dose escalation, phase I clinical trial to assess the
      safety and immunogenicity of the candidate ChAdOx2 RabG vaccine in healthy UK volunteers aged
      18-65. The vaccine will be administered intramuscularly (IM).

      Volunteers will be recruited and vaccinated at the Centre for Clinical Vaccinology and
      Tropical Medicine (CCVTM), Oxford. There will be 3 study groups and it is anticipated that a
      total of 12 volunteers will be enrolled. Staggered enrolment will apply between study groups
      and for the first three volunteers within each group.

      The study includes an optional extended follow-up period, lasting one month and starting one
      year after vaccination. Volunteers will receive a complete pre-exposure prophylactic course
      of an existing rabies vaccine, allowing study of the immunological memory (recall response)
      induced by ChAdOx2 RabG. A second optional element of the study is the collection of saliva
      samples at each visit for the study of shedding of EBV and CMV.

          -  Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months
             preceding the planned administration of the vaccine candidate.

             the risk to the volunteer because of participation in the study, affect the ability of
             the volunteer to participate in the study or impair interpretation of the study data.

             period (e.g. through planned travel to high risk enzootic areas of through work which
             may lead to exposure and for which rabies vaccination is usually
             required/recommended).

          -  Receiving rabies vaccination following the completion of the first 8 weeks of followup
             but before the optional extended follow-up period will exclude participants from

             participants from receiving certain IRVs (as per the relevant SmPC) during the
             optional extended follow-up period, but will not exclude participants from receiving
             ChAdOx2 RabG.
