      Primary Aim: In participants with OUD in early or sustained full recovery on
      buprenorphine/naloxone therapy, to characterize adverse events associated with adding two
      psilocybin doses to a stable buprenorphine/naloxone regimen.

      Secondary Aim: To evaluate the effect of psilocybin treatment on the effectiveness of
      buprenorphine/naloxone maintenance therapy.

      Secondary Aim: To evaluate the effect of concurrent buprenorphine/naloxone use on the effects
      of psilocybin therapy.

      Descriptive Aim: To describe any changes in self-efficacy, quality of life, pain.

      The primary objective of this clinical trial is to determine the safety of psilocybin in
      adult patients with opioid use disorder concurrently taking buprenorphine/naloxone
      (Suboxone®).

      Eligible participants will be adults with opioid use disorder (OUD) who have been
      demonstrated to be stable on a daily buprenorphine/naloxone dose. Recovery status will be
      verified by the participant's community-based prescriber. After psychological screening and
      at least 6 hours of preparatory counseling and preparation for the psilocybin dosing, set,
      and setting, each participant will ingest 1 oral dose of psilocybin. All dosing sessions will
      be attended by 2 specially trained guides, in a dedicated Clinical Research Facility. After
      eight hours of observation in the dosing room, the participant will be kept overnight in the
      hospital Clinical Research Unit, and complete an integration session with a psychologist
      before discharge to home. Approximately 4 weeks after the first dose, the participant will
      receive a second oral dose of psilocybin, with the same length of observation.

      Participants who have been administered the first dose but decline to receive the second dose
      will remain evaluable. At study termination, their active study participation will end, but
      completion of the 28 day post-dose follow up will be requested.

      The primary endpoint is the assessment of the safety of concurrent administration of
      buprenorphine and naloxone (eg., Suboxone®) and psilocybin as determined by physiological
      measures (ECG, respiratory rate, blood pressure, body temperature, and blood oxygen
      saturation) and validated clinical and self-report measures (Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale
      (COWS), Opioid Craving Scale (OCS), Timeline Follow-Back (TLFB)).

    <measure>Mean Change in Symptoms of Opioid Withdrawal Measured by COWS Instrument</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It is hypothesized that co-administration of oral psilocybin with buprenorphine/naloxone will not cause signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal. This will be measured by the Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS) instrument, an 11-item scale administered by the clinician where total score of: 5- 12 = mild withdrawal; 13-24 = moderate withdrawal; 25-36 = moderately severe withdrawal; and more than 36 = severe withdrawal. Administered before the dose and again 8 hours after the dose.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change in Peripheral Capillary Oxygen</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It is hypothesized that co-administration of oral psilocybin with buprenorphine/naloxone will not cause opioid intoxication. Opioid intoxication will be determined by drops peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2) before and after dosing.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change in ECG</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It is hypothesized that co-administration of oral psilocybin with buprenorphine/naloxone will not cause a clinically significant increase in the QTc interval. The QTc interval will be measured by electrocardiogram (ECG) before and after dosing. ECGs will be collected using the CardioCard PC computer-based system, once before the dose, and again at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 hours after the dose. If a QTc(F), calculated by the CardioCard system exceeds 470msec, a study physician will be contacted immediately for further monitoring and treatment recommendations.</description>

    <measure>Change in Opioid Craving Scale (OCS) from baseline through end of study</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 1, Week 5, and Week 9</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the effect of psilocybin treatment on the effectiveness of buprenorphine/naloxone maintenance therapy. The hypothesis is that co-administration of oral psilocybin with buprenorphine/naloxone will not cause an increase in opioid craving, as measured by the OCS at baseline, week 1, week 5, and week 9. The OCS is a 3-item visual analog scale to measure the frequency and intensity of opioid craving. Total score ranges from 0-30 where the higher the number, the higher the craving.</description>

    <measure>Mystical Effects Questionnaire (MEQ) after each dose</measure>
    <time_frame>approximately Week 1 and Week 5</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the effect of concurrent buprenorphine/naloxone use on the effects of psilocybin with guided counseling. The hypothesis is that co-administration of buprenorphine/naloxone with oral psilocybin will not be associated with a change in the effects of psilocybin, as measured by adverse events (Primary Outcome Measure), and the MEQ. The MEQ is a 30-item assessment used to characterize the consciousness-altering effects of psilocybin. Total possible range of scores is 0-150 where the higher the number the higher the consciousness-altering effects.</description>

    <measure>Mean Number of Days of Participant Opioid Use via Time Line Follow Back (TLFB)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 9 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It is hypothesized that co-administration of oral psilocybin with buprenorphine/naloxone will not be associated with an increase in self-reported illicit opioid use. This will be measured by Time Line Follow-Back calendar method for up to the 28 days following the last dosing session. Participants will be asked to recall the previous 28 days of substance use at the first in-person visit.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and End of Study, Up to 9 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Descriptive changes in participant self-efficacy, quality of life, and pain will be explored through a number of participant surveys.
The GSES is a 10-item scale to assess a participants self-beliefs to cope with difficult situations. The total range of possible scores is 10-40, higher scores indicate more self-efficacy.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and End of Study, Up to 9 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Descriptive changes in participant self-efficacy, quality of life, and pain will be explored through a number of participant surveys.
TMQ is a 10-item questionnaire designed to measure how much participants feel their lives have meaning and how much they strive to find meaning and understanding in their lives. Items are scored on a 7-point Likert Scale from 1 (absolutely true) to 7 (absolutely untrue). Item 9 is reverse scored. The total range of possible scores is 10-70, higher scores indicate more perceived meaning in life.</description>
