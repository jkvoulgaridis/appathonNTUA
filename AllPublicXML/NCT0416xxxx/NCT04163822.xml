  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common respiratory disease in premature infants, the
      incidence of which is increasing in recent years. It seriously affects the survival rate and
      quality of life of premature infants.

      At present, the diagnosis of BPD mainly adopts the 2001 NICHD standard, which does not
      account for the radiographic information. However, some recent studies revealed that the BPD
      infants with fibrotic and cystic radiographic changes required longer-term invasive
      ventilation, longer-term parenteral nutrition, more frequent red blood transfusion and a
      higher risk of home oxygen therapy. The infants with moderate or several BPD were also
      reported to be more likely to have a radiographic appearance with fibrosis or cysts than
      those with mild BPD.

      The radiographic patterns of BPD were stratified into four stages according to the lung
      pathology. The fibrotic and cystic patterns were defined as the typical changes of BPD, which
      is commonly present at 10 days or later after birth. However, it is not uncommon to occur
      earlier. One study reported that 23%～27% of infants with moderate or severe BPD had typical
      radiograph changes on the first day of life.

      The exact etiology of early fibrotic and cystic changes is little known, which is likely to
      be associated with intrauterine inflammation. Chorioamnionitis and intrauterine infection was
      believed to induce fetal lung inflammation, which could interfere with lung development,
      resulting in BPD. Therefore, early radiographic fibrotic and cystic appearance may indicate a
      specific stage of lung inflammation, which originates in the intrauterine infection and
      subsequently develop BPD.

      Currently, BPD is diagnosed solely based on oxygen dependence, which does not reflect the
      etiology and pathogenesis. It can be speculated that BPD may have different subgroups; each
      subgroup could have unique etiology, clinical and radiographic patterns, and prognosis. The
      BPD with early fibrotic and cystic radiographic changes is likely to be a particular
      subgroup, which is likely to be attributable to intrauterine infection. Therefore, this
      retrospective study aims to depict the clinical profiles and prognosis of BPD infants with
      early typical radiographic changes, which will be of great potential for early-adopting
      tailored management and improving the long-term outcome of this group of infants.
