  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if LCZ696 is safe, tolerable and can improve
      exercise capacity (via improved peak VO2) in non-obstructive HCM patient population over the
      course of 50 weeks of treatment.

    <description>The primary analysis will assess the effect of LCZ696 on the change from baseline in peak VO2 (ml/kg/min) at week 50 compared to placebo, where baseline peak VO2 will come from the screening/baseline CPET.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosed with Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy with a left ventricular wall thickness
