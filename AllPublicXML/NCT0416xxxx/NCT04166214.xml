    <textblock>
      The purpose of the proposed research project is to evaluate and enhance the feasibility and
      acceptability of integrating a tele-mentoring component into the identification of oral
      lesions at the 6 dental clinics of Family Health Centers at NYU Langone (FHC), a Federally
      Qualified Health Center (FQHC) in Brooklyn, NY.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The tele-mentoring intervention involves training dental faculty members and residents to use
      intraoral cameras to take photographs of oral lesions and place them in the Dentrix
      electronic health record (EHR), along with descriptions of the lesions. Using a mixed-methods
      approach, the study will evaluate and enhance the feasibility and acceptability of
      integrating a tele-mentoring component into the identification of oral lesions at the 6 FHC
      dental clinics.

    <description>Feasibility of the integrated intervention will be assessed through dental provider surveys and semi-structured interviews. The dental provider survey, which consists of a checklist of 10 key components of the tele-mentoring intervention to be implemented, will be completed by 2 dentists at each of the 6 FHC dental clinics (n=12) after screening at least 1 patient subject for oral cancer using an intraoral camera, as per the tele-mentoring protocol.</description>

    <description>engage 6 dental residents (1 at each of the 6 FHC dental clinics) in a semi-structured interview to assess specific barriers they have encountered to sustaining the intervention and strategies for addressing those barriers to facilitate integration of the tele-mentoring intervention into the routine workflow of the dental clinics.The semi-structures interviews with dental resident subjects will take 30-45 minutes to complete, and will be digitally recorded and transcribed. The transcriptions will be stored in a secure REDCap database. The digital files will be deleted once they are transcribed. No identifying information will be recorded.</description>

    <description>The SOPROCARE is intended for clinical practice of general dentistry, as an aid in the diagnosis of pit and fissure caries, as an aid to highlight dental plaque and gingival inflammations and as intra-oral camera to visualize anatomical details that are invisible to the naked eye or with a mirror. In CARIO mode, the camera helps the dental practitioner to highlight carious warning on pits and fissures of the occlusal side of the teeth. In DAYLIGHT mode, the camera enables you to visualize anatomical details invisible to the naked eye or with a mirror. In PERIO mode, the camera helps the dental practitioner to see the presence of dental plaque but also to highlight gingival inflammations . This mode offers to the dentist and/or hygienist a tool for an improved communication, motivation and education of his/her patients, who will then become aware of their oral health condition.</description>
