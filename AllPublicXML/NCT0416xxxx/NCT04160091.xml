  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of FX006 in patients with
      glenohumeral osteoarthritis (OA) or shoulder adhesive capsulitis (AC).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group
      study in separate cohorts of patients with a documented history of either glenohumeral OA or
      shoulder AC. Glenohumeral OA and shoulder AC patients will be randomized to receive a single
      intra-articular injection of either FX006 or placebo (saline) in a 1:1 ratio to the index
      shoulder with a 24-week Treatment Evaluation Period. Glenohumeral OA patients will be
      stratified by Baseline average daily shoulder pain with movement score according to the
      following classifications: 5.0 to &lt;7.0 or ≥7.0 to 9.0 (0 to 10 numeric rating scale [NRS]).
      Shoulder AC patients will be stratified by Baseline average daily shoulder pain with movement
      score according to the following classifications: 5.0 to &lt;7.0 or ≥7.0 to 9.0 (0 to 10 NRS),
      and by pain duration since onset (1 to 3 months, inclusive, or &gt;3 to ≤6 months). A Home
      Exercise Program will be implemented 3 days following injection for shoulder AC patients.
