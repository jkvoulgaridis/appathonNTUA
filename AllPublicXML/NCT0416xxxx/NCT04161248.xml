      The purpose of this study is to find the highest dose of a new drug, in combination with
      standard drugs, which can be tolerated without causing very severe side effects. The study
      treatment is new agents in combination with R-GDP or an equivalent regimen.

    <textblock>
      To find the highest dose of a new drug that can be tolerated without causing severe side
      effects when receiving R-GDP or an equivalent regimen. This is done by starting at a dose
      lower than the one that is tolerated in patients when given on its own. Participants are
      given the new drug together with R-GDP and are watched very closely to see what side effects
      they have and to make sure the side effects are not severe. If the side effects are not
      severe, then new participants will be given a higher dose of the new drug. Participants
      joining the study later on will get higher doses of the new drug than participants who join
      earlier. This will continue until a dose is found that causes severe but temporary side
      effects. Doses higher than that will not be given.

          -  Patients must be accessible for treatment and follow up. Patients enrolled on this
             trial must be treated and followed at the participating centre. This implies there
             must be reasonable geographical limits (for example: 1 ½ hours driving distance)

             of relapse, are eligible. MRI scanning and / or lumbar puncture should be performed if
             there is clinical suspicion of active CNS disease.

          -  Known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), active Hepatitis C virus
             infection, active Hepatitis B virus infection or any uncontrolled active systemic
             infection. Patients with Hepatitis B serology suggestive of infection are eligible if
             they are HBV DNA negative and concurrently treated with anti-viral therapy. Patients
             with a history of hepatitis C who have eradicated the virus are eligible.

             not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the
             investigational regimen are eligible for this trial. However, patients on active
             anticancer therapy for other advanced or metastatic malignancies are not eligible, as
             this is a phase I study identifying a RP2D of a single agent and there is the
             potential for drug-drug interactions. Consult CCTG for patients who are on adjuvant
             therapies after curative surgery or in instances where it is felt the patient may be
             eligible (for example, TCC bladder receiving local therapies or CLL not requiring
             active therapy).

          -  Pregnant or lactating females, or women of childbearing potential not willing to use
             an adequate method of birth control for the duration of the study.

             their components.

          -  Patients with any other clinically significant medical condition which, in the opinion
             of the treating physician, makes it undesirable for the patient to participate in the
             study or which could jeopardize compliance with study requirements including, but not
             limited to: ongoing or active infection, significant uncontrolled hypertension, or
             severe psychiatric illness/social situations.
