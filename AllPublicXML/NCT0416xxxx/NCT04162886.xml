      Aim: The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of thrower's ten exercises on the
      upper extremity performance in healthy sedentary individuals.

      Method: 36 healthy sedentary men and women aged 18-35 years will be included in the study.
      Subjects will be divided into two groups: exercise and control. The exercise group will be
      given Thrower's Ten training sessions 3 times a week over an 8-week period. Before and after
      the study, the subjects were tested for dynamic balance on the upper extremity with the Upper
      Limp Y balance test and for explosive power with the medicine ball throw test. Moreover, the
      strength of the shoulder rotator muscles was measured with an isokinetic dynamometer at a
      speed of 60º/sec.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the level of upper extremity strength assessed by an isokinetic dynamometer (Cybex Norm).</measure>
    <time_frame>At the beginning and at the end of 8 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>During all tests, participants will be encouraged verbally and visually. The forces of the upper extremity will be measured with an isokinetic dynamometer and an angular velocity of 5 repetitions at 60 ° / sec. Before the actual exam, subjects will allowed to make 3 trials. The test results will be recorded for the dominant side.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the level of upper extremity explosive strength assessed by a seated medicine ball throw (SMBT) test.</measure>
    <time_frame>At the beginning and at the end of 8 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>A line will be drawn on a flat surface before testing. In the beginning, the subject will sits on this line with the head, back, and butt leaning against the wall and legs extending straight following the line. Hands were placed on the two sides of the wall without fingers touching. Upon the start command, the subject will lifted the ball to the chest and threw forwards as in a basketball shot. A 2 kg medicine ball will used in the test.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the level of upper extremity balance assessed using Upper Quarter Y Balance Test (UQYBT)</measure>
    <time_frame>At the beginning and at the end of 8 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will put the dominant or non-dominant hand to be tested on the starting line and extended the arm in medial, inferior lateral, and superior lateral directions and the length will measured in all 3 directions in cm.</description>
