  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare 2 types of Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) to
      treat chronic neuropathic pain. TENS involves the application of electrical stimulation to
      the skin via surface electrodes to stimulate nerve fibres for pain relief.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TENS is already recommended in clinical practice to treat chronic neuropathic pain. The
      objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of 2 different modes of TENS: conventional
      TENS (c-TENS) and mixed-frequency TENS (m-TENS). Randomization will determine the mode that
      the patient has to test during the first month.

      Each patient will test successively each mode during 1 month at home (3 sessions 1 hour/day).
      Then, the patient will test the other mode during the second month. Up to 6 months, the
      patient will be free to use the mode of TENS he wants.

    <description>Visual analogue scales are 10-cm lines anchored at the ends by words that define the bounds of various pain dimensions. The patient is asked to place a vertical mark on the scale to indicate the level of intensity of his or her pain being 0 equivalent to no pain and 100 to the worst possible pain</description>

    <measure>Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC)</measure>
    <time_frame>day 30, day 60</time_frame>
    <description>Patient Global Impression of Change is a 7-point scale used by the patient to rate the severity of the patient's illness at the time of assessment being 1 equivalent to no change or worsening and 7 to very much improved, making a difference</description>

    <measure>Brief pain inventory (impact on daily life) (BPI)</measure>
    <time_frame>day 30, day 60</time_frame>
    <description>The BPI allows patients to rate the severity of their pain and the degree to which their pain interferes with common dimensions of feeling and function. There are line drawings of the front and back of a human body on which patients mark the location of their pain. In addition, patients fill out 11 different questions about pain intensity (present as well as least, most, and average for the past 24 hours) and the effect of the pain on their ability to function during various activities of daily living (pain interference items) rated on 0-10 scales being equivalent to no interference and 10 to complete interference.</description>

    <description>During the first month: Patients will have to test 3 sessions of TENS 1 hour/day. Depending on their arm assigned by randomization, patients will begin with c-TENS or m-TENS.
[Cross-over] During the second month: Patients will test the other type they do not have used yet according to the following scheme: 3 sessions of 1 hour, each day.
In this way, all patients will test successively the 2 different modes. After the end of the second month and up to the end of their participation (6 months after randomization) patients will be free to use the mode of TENS they prefer.</description>
