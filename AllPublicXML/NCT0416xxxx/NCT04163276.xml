  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluate the interest to create a new database of PET digital brain exams in
      population of 50 years and over of patients. Half of patients with no abnormal brain
      metabolism while the other half patients with Alzheimer's disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The 18F-FDG cerebral PET can be performed for the detection of neurodegenerative diseases
      found hypometabolism in the areas concerned (Alzheimer's disease, fronto-temporal dementia,
      dementia Lewy body etc). The diagnosis is given by the clinician with a visual analysis of
      the data. Technical aids are now recommended (European recommendations) to complete the
      diagnosis with a quantitative analysis of different brain regions to a healthy brain base, to
      guide the diagnosis, in addition to visual analysis.

      The emergence of a new technology has allowed the transition from analog PET / CT to digital
      PET / CT improving spatial resolution and image contrast. Unlike analog PET / CT that uses
      photomultipliers to detect light, digital PET / CT uses the digital photon counting technique
      to directly convert light into a digital signal and each crystal is connected to a single
      detector.

      Different software, used in clinical routine, gives access to a quantified analysis of
      different areas of the brain. However, these programs have been made with healthy subjects of
      reduced strength (for example, the Neuro Q ® software database is based on 29 healthy
      patients), with no specific age and thanks to analog PET / CT ( old generation). There is
      therefore a low specificity in terms of detection of degenerative pathologies, this being
      explained by a decrease in cerebral metabolism with age 9, mainly at the level of the
      anterior areas 10 (frontal lobe, temporopolar areas, insular areas, cortex anterior
      cingulate).
