      Purpose: The aim of the study was to compare the analgetic effect of two solutions of
      intracameral anesthesia in patients undergoing cataract surgery and assess the factors
      influencing the patients' postoperative activities.

      Methods: In this prospective, single-blind, randomized study, a group of 62 patients
      undergoing cataract surgery received Mydrane (Mydrane group) or a combination of 1% solution
      of lignocaine and 0.025% solution of adrenalin (reference group) as an intraocular
      anesthetic. The analgetic effect of these two anesthetic methods was evaluated using
      psychological tools - Visual Analog Scale for Pain (VAS Pain) and Brief Pain Inventory-short
      form (BPI) on the next day after the surgery.

    <description>The the mean severity score, the pain interference mean score was measured with Brief Pain Inventory-short form (BPI-short form). BPI is one of the most widely used measurement tools for assessing clinical pain. It contains two domains that measure pain intensity (severity) and the impact of pain on functioning (interference). In the current study, BPI was used to evaluate the severity of pain and the impact of pain on daily function in the previous 24 h. The responses were given using an eleven-point numeric rating scale (NRS) scored 0-10, where 0 = best outcome/does not interfere/no pain/complete pain relief and 10 = worst outcome/completely interferes/most pain/no pain relief.</description>

        A total of 70 patients was initially scheduled to participate in this study. However, 8
        patients did not attend the postoperative visits and were excluded. As a result, only 62
        patients were included in the analysis. The mean age (±SD) of patients was 73.95 (±7.82)
        years. Female to male ratio was 55/45 in Mydrane group and 53/47 in the control group.
