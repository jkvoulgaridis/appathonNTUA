  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Microvascular dysfunction is an independent predictor of poor prognosis. Such response in the
      culprit vessel is common even after successful revascularization. This study investigated
      whether the microvascular dysfunction differed between culprit and non-culprit vessels in
      patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention
      (PCI).

      The prospective study included 115 patients with ACS. In this study, after successful PCI,
      culprit and non-culprit intracoronary hemodynamic measurements were performed and repeated at
      6-month follow-up. 13N-ammonia positron emission tomography (PET) was performed at 6-month
      follow-up visit to determine absolute myocardial blood flow (MBF). The resistance values of
      each vessel were calculated using the coronary pressure data and the MBF values obtained from
      13N-ammonia PET data. Such physiological measures were compared between culprit and
      non-culprit vessels in baseline and 6-month follow-up.

    <description>Physiological parameters of the culprit artery after PCI were determined with the restoration of Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) 3 flow. Index of microcirculatory resistance (IMR) were measured using a 0.014 coronary temperature and pressure-sensing guidewire (PressureWireCertus, ST. Jude Medical, MN, USA). These parameters were then determined for non-culprit vessels.</description>

    <description>Physiological parameters of the culprit artery after PCI were determined with the restoration of Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) 3 flow. Aortic pressure (Pa), distal intracoronary pressure (Pd), fractional flow reserve (FFR), coronary flow reserve (CFR) and index of microcirculatory resistance (IMR) were measured using a 0.014 coronary temperature and pressure-sensing guidewire (PressureWireCertus, ST.
