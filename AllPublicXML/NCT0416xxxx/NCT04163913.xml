  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will prospectively compare compliance rates between a novel FDA cleared wearable
      compression therapy with and without digital engagement for DVT prophylaxis in both hospital
      and home environments after total knee or hip arthroplasty.

    <textblock>
      This study is a single-arm, open-label, prospective, single-center study designed to evaluate
      compliance to CirvoTM therapy use with and without digital engagement. Historical
      questionnaire data with a different compression device will be compared to the same
      questionnaire used for the prospective cohort of up to 200 subjects. All patients prescribed
      compression therapy following total joint arthroscopy will be offered participation.

      Subjects will receive CirvoTM compression therapy according to the standard of care protocol
      at NYU during or after surgery and 18 hours per day for 14 days.

        1. Baseline: Following consent, participants will provide demographic, medical history and
           information with respect to their elective orthopedic procedure and receive training on
           the CirvoTM device. Participants will be randomized to either digital engagement or no
           digital engagement groups.

        2. Post procedure: After the procedure, CirvoTM device operation will be reviewed with the
           participant.

        3. Discharge: Any adverse events occurring during hospitalization will be reviewed, data
           capture on the CirvoTM app will be confirmed.

        4. 14- day visit: Participants will complete a patient satisfaction questionnaire, provide
           information with respect to any adverse events including specific details about DVT and
           readmission and return the devices.

        5. 30-day phone call/visit: Participants will be contacted at 30 days to answer questions
           about DVT's and readmissions.

    <description>A sample size of 100 subjects is powered at 90% to show a difference of 10% in compliance between the 2 digital engagement cohorts. For each subject, Compliance will be calculated for each participant during the course of therapy in terms of the number of hours of actual use/number of hours of prescribed use. The number of hours will be summarized as days of use for each group.
The means of each group will be presented. The primary endpoint is the difference in compliance between the group assigned to digital engagement versus no digital engagement with the Cirvo app. The mean difference will be compared to zero using the paired t-test</description>

    <description>The CirvoTM device (Figure 1) is a lightweight, mobile, active, intermittent leg compression device placed on the calf of the leg, using hook and loop (e.g. Velcro) straps in the similar manner as commercially available intermittent leg compression devices The system utilizes an electro-mechanical drive system to intermittently compress the calf from the ankle toward the knee for a duration and compression level prescribed by the physician. The level of compression delivered by the CirvoTM therapy will be in the same range as existing devices which corresponds to the type of pressure applied by a blood pressure cuff.</description>
