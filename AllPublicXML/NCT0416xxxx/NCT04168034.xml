  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The iParent2Parent program matches parents of children living with arthritis with a trained
      parent mentor who will provide parents of children newly diagnosed with arthritis: practical
      coping advice and social support through shared lived experiences. This study will compare
      two groups of parents: those who are in the iParent2Parent program and those in the control
      group (no mentor).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parents/primary caregiver of children with JIA are an often overlooked but essential member
      of their child's health care team. They are responsible for managing their child's treatment
      program, and act as advocates for their child to support positive adaptation to JIA and to
      learn self-management skills for the disease. This is in the context of managing the
      financial, logistical, emotional, and social demands of parenting in general. Within
      pediatric tertiary care centres, peer-support programs for parents of children with JIA are
      often limited or difficult to access. The iParent2Parent Program aims to fill this gap in
      services by offering a program of trained parent peer mentors who can provide practical
      coping advice, foster adaptive problem solving, and provide social support via shared lived
      experience.

    <description>Criteria for feasibility are based on studies previously conducted by our group and will be: accrual rate of &gt;70%, attrition rate of &lt;15%, technical difficulties reported by &lt;10% of parents and mentors, adherence rate of &gt;80%, &lt;5% missed responses on outcome measures and high acceptability (based on qualitative analyses). Data related to the primary outcome will be recorded on investigator-developed forms.</description>
