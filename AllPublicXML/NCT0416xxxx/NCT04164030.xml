    <textblock>
      The purpose of this two phase study is to: 1) develop and 2) assess a program titled: Merging
      Yoga, Occupational Therapy and Nutrition Education (MY-OT-Ed) designed for low income adults
      with Type 2 Diabetes. Half of the participants will participate in the Nutrition Education,
      and the other half of the participants will participate in Nutrition Education plus
      Occupational Therapy group and group yoga.

    <textblock>
      Merging Yoga, Occupational Therapy and Nutrition Education (MY-OT-Ed) is an interdisciplinary
      program designed to help low income adults with Type 2 Diabetes engage fully in life while
      learning to manage their diabetes. The aim is to empower individuals to embed diabetes
      self-management into everyday activities and routines while upholding quality of life.
      Currently Extension Services bring nutrition education to the under-served population in the
      local communities through the Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program (EFNEP). Colorado
      EFNEP uses the evidence-based, healthy eating and active living curriculum, Eating Smart â€¢
      Being Active (ESBA), with adult participants. While EFNEP may be helpful in the management of
      some aspects of diabetes care, it is not designed to address the established self-care
      behaviors and routines essential for effective diabetes self management. Therefore, it is
      critical to merge nutrition education programs such as EFNEP with other established
      interventions to best meet the needs of the individual with diabetes. Likewise, yoga is an
      effective form of physical activity to manage some aspects of diabetes care and outcomes.
      However, yoga is also not enough to address all of the needs of the individual. Furthermore,
      evidence for the success of occupational therapy's role in diabetes self-management is
      growing as a way to manage some aspects of the complexity of diabetes care or routines in
      everyday life. Our aim in this study is to follow best practice and create and evaluate an
      interdisciplinary approach to type 2 diabetes self-management by merging together yoga,
      occupational therapy and nutritional education to improve diabetes related outcomes in our
      population.

    <time_frame>Pre assessment, post assessment following 9 week session and 6-8 weeks follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Self-Report Habit Index contains 12 items that measures habit strength, including automaticity, repeated character of the behavior and the sense of identity the behavior reflects. A 5 point likert scale (ranging from strongly agree (4), to strongly disagree (0) ) is used to score each item. The Self-Report Habit Index yields a total score by summing all of the items together. The total score ranges from 0 - 48, with a higher score representing a stronger habit.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in diabetes distress measured using the Diabetes Distress Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre assessment, post assessment following 9 week session and 6-8 weeks follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Diabetes Distress Scale contains 17 items, which assess causes of burden and worries related to managing a chronic disease as diabetes. A 6 point likert scale (1 = no problem; 6 = severe problem) is used to score each item. The Diabetes Distress Scale yields a total score and 4 sub scale scores, including emotional burden, physician-related distress, regimen-related distress, and interpersonal distress. The total score and sub scale scores are calculated by summing the responses of the number of items and dividing by the number of items. There are five items for emotional burden, 4 items for physician-related distress, 5 items for regimen-related distress, and 3 items for interpersonal distress. Therefore, the total and sub-scores are each reported as a mean item score, ranging from 1-6, with a higher score representing greater distress reported.</description>
