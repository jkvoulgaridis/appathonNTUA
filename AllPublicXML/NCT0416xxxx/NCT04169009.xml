  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study plans to learn more about how the shingles vaccine, Shingrix (SRX), successfully
      prevents shingles in older people. Two vaccines are currently approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) to prevent shingles. Zostavax is a live virus vaccine which has been
      available since 2006 and prevents shingles about 50% of the time, though it is less effective
      the older a person is when they receive it. Shingrix, which was approved by the FDA in 2017,
      is not a live virus, but has an additive in the vaccine to boost immune response. It is about
      97% effective at preventing shingles regardless of a person's age and so far has been
      effective for at least 4 years after vaccination. Because Zostavax has live virus in it,
      giving a &quot;challenge&quot; dose of Zostavax - vOka varicella zoster virus - to people who have
      received both vaccines (Zostavax or Shingrix) in the past, will allow researchers to learn
      more about how the body works to prevent shingles and how any shingles vaccination helps
      protect against shingles.

    <description>Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV) DNAemia will be measured by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as a surrogate for viremia over the first 7 days after vOka intradermal (ID) challenge. The outcome measure will be the area under the concentration time curve of the VZV DNAemia expressed in DNA copies/ml of blood.</description>
