  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      University of California, Los Angeles researchers will recruit healthy participants (age
      18-35) to participate in a study examining whether the administration of naltrexone, an
      opioid antagonist, eliminates the ability of social support figure reminders to enhance fear
      extinction--a process during which a threatening cue is learned to not predict a negative or
      threatening outcome (i.e., electric shock) by being repeatedly presented in the absence of
      that outcome.

      After undergoing an email screening, a telephone screening, an in lab screening, and a health
      screening, 60 participants will be enrolled in the study. During the experiment, 30
      participants will be administered naltrexone and 30 participants will be administered placebo
      (both participants and experimenters will be blind to condition) before undergoing a fear
      extinction procedure in which threatening cues--cues that predict electric shock--will be
      paired with either an image of a social support figure (provided by participants) or a second
      threatening cue. These pairings will be presented repeatedly in the absence of shock in order
      for fear extinction to occur. Participants will return for a follow-up test to determine if
      fear extinction was successful.
