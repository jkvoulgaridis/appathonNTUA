      This study follows children into adolescence who were first randomized to intervention
      condition in infancy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parents serve as co-regulators for their young children, helping them regulate behaviors,
      emotions, and physiology and supporting the development of healthy brain circuitry.
      Neglecting parents often fail to serve as co-regulators, which has implications for young
      children's self-regulatory capabilities and brain development. As children become older,
      these difficulties with self-regulation may become more pronounced. Adolescence represents a
      period of particular vulnerability for the emergence of mental health problems because of
      increasing demands for regulation of emotions and behaviors, coupled with on-going
      development of neural circuits that support emotional and behavioral regulation. The
      Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-up (ABC) intervention was designed to help parents learn
      to interact in responsive and sensitive ways, with the expectation that children would show
      enhanced ability to regulate behavior, emotions, and physiology. The efficacy of the ABC
      intervention among parents involved with Child Protective Services (CPS) was assessed.
      Parents were randomized to ABC or to a control intervention. Children were followed at T1
      (ages 1-4) and T2 (ages 8-10). At T1, more of the children in the ABC group developed secure
      and organized attachments than children in the DEF group, and children in ABC showed more
      normative production of cortisol, less expression of negative emotions, and poorer inhibitory
      control than children in DEF. ABC parents were more sensitive and showed more optimal neural
      activity than DEF parents. At T2, ABC children showed greater prefrontal cortex activation in
      response to threat than DEF children, suggesting better regulation to threat at the level of
      brain activation. Also at T2, children in the ABC group reported more secure relationships
      with parents, and showed more normative cortisol production and more optimal autonomic
      nervous system functioning than DEF children. In adolescence, the ABC intervention is
      expected to result in enhanced brain circuitry and more optimal functioning across domains as
      assessed at multiple levels of analysis relative to the control intervention. In the proposed
      study, behavioral and neurobiological development among 13-, 14- and 15-year-old adolescents
      whose parents were referred by CPS to a randomized controlled trial in infancy (n=120), and
      among low-risk adolescents followed since middle childhood (n=80) will be assessed.

    <time_frame>Age 13 years</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be met by two research assistants (one male, one female), whom they have not met previously. The research assistants will tell the participants that they will have 5 minutes to prepare a speech which they will give to the researchers who will rate the speech. Participants will then give their speeches for 5 minutes; the research assistants will maintain neutral expressions and provide no feedback. Afterwards, participants will be asked to do (age-adjusted) mental arithmetic aloud (Buske-Kirschbaum et al.,1997). For the purpose of assessing cortisol, investigators will collect saliva samples before and after the speech/math.</description>

    <measure>Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART)</measure>
    <time_frame>13 years of age</time_frame>
    <description>This task assesses risk-taking through a computer game in which participants see a balloon on the computer screen and have the option of pumping up the balloon more, and therefore increasing its monetary value, or stopping and collecting the value of the balloon. If the balloon pops on a pump, then all of the value of the balloon is lost and the next trial begins. There is a randomly, pre-determined probability of the balloon popping on any given pump of each trial. A brief version of the task with 15 balloons will be used. A running tally of participants' total monetary gain is kept (and can range from $0 up to a cap of $5). The amount of money earned is the score, with more money reflecting higher risk taking.</description>
