  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims at investigating the special effectiveness of antidepressant effect of
      Fluvoxamine for endogenous depression. The investigators also aim to assess the effect of
      Fluvoxamine on the multimodal magnetic resonance imaging(MRI), blood cytokines, feces
      bacteria flora and neuropsychological performance in depression patients with melancholic
      features. The investigators further aim to identify the predictors of Fluvoxamine's
      antidepressant effeect using the above techniques.

    <measure>Change in Congruent STROOP Time to Complete (Executive Function)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 months, 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Stroop Colour Naming Test (STROOP) is a cognitive test designed to assess the ability to inhibit a prepotent response to reading words while performing a task that requires attention control. It comprises two sheets with 50 words on each, and each word is the name of a colour. On the first sheet, the Congruent STROOP Sheet, the word and ink colour match; on the Incongruent STROOP Sheet, the word and ink colour do not match. For each sheet, the patient has 4 minutes to name the ink colour of each word. When the patient finishes the sheet, or once 4 minutes is up, the clinician notes the time taken and counts the number of correct and incorrect responses. The scale ranges from 0-100, the higher score the greater the cognitive flexibility.</description>

Each correct symbol is counted, and the total score ranges from 0 (less than normal functioning) to 133 (greater than normal functioning).&quot; as a description of DSST.</description>
