  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 1 and Phase 2 study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of
      polyvalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (pPCV) when administered to adults. Phase 1 has no
      formal hypothesis. The primary hypotheses for Phase 2 are: pPCV is noninferior to
      Pneumovax™23 as measured by the serotype-specific opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) geometric
      mean titers (GMTs) for the common serotypes at 30 days postvaccination and that the
      serotype-specific OPA GMTs for the unique serotypes in pPCV at 30 days postvaccination are
      statistically significantly greater following vaccination with pPCV than those following
      vaccination with Pneumovax™23.
