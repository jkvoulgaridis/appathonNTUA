      Background - Volume overload is an important clinical target in acute heart failure
      management (AHF), typically addressed using loop diuretics. An important and challenging
      subset of heart failure patients exhibit fluid overload despite significant doses of loop
      diuretics. One approach to overcome loop diuretic resistance is the addition of a
      thiazide-type diuretic to produce diuretic synergy via &quot;sequential nephron blockade&quot;.
      Although potentially able to induce diuresis in patients otherwise resistant to high doses of
      loop diuretics, this strategy has not been subjected to large-scale clinical trials to
      establish safety and clinical efficacy.

      Methods - Our trial is a multicentric, double blind, randomized clinical study, aiming to
      recruit 310 patients with AHF and clinically evident volume overload. Study participants are
      randomized to receive a standard diuretic therapy (intravenous loop diuretics as recommended
      by current guidelines plus placebo) or SNB therapy (loop diuretics plus oral metolazone at
      the dose of 5/10 mg once daily) on top of standard medical therapy. Mineralocorticoid
      antagonists will be used in association with the two regimens according to blood potassium
      level and kidney function at the discretion of the treating physician. The primary endpoint
      is defined as the change in the serum creatinine level and the change in weight, considered
      both as a bivariate response and with their single components, between the time of
      randomization and 72 hours after randomization. Secondary endpoints include global well-being
      and dyspnoea assessed by a visual-analogue scale, changes in body weight and net fluid loss,
      proportion of patients free from congestion, treatment failure, changes in biomarker levels
      and the composite of death, rehospitalization, or an emergency room visit within 60 days, as
      well as the composite of total number of days hospitalized or death during the 60 days after
      randomization.

    <description>The bivariate response will be displayed on a two-dimensional grid with individual data points for each patient representing paired changes in both creatinine (inmg/dL) and weight (in kilograms) 76 hours after randomization. A confidence region for the average difference between treatment arms in this bivariate response can be described as an ellipse, and the 2 treatment arms will be compared statistically with the use of the Hotelling T- square, which is a multivariate analog of the 2-sample t test used with a single continuous variable (Ann Math Stat. 1931; 2:360-78). Evaluating these 2 important responses to treatment as a bivariate end point reflects clinically important responses to therapy and avoids the requirement of making adjustments in sample size to prevent a type 1 error that would be necessary if the end points were considered separately (Eur J Heart Fail. 2003; 5:717-23).</description>
