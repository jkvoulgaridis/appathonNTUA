  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, extension study to evaluate the long-term safety of
      tislelizumab or pamiparib given either as monotherapy or in combination with each other or
      with other agents in participants with advanced malignancies who participated in a prior
      BeiGene sponsored clinical study (parent study).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For the purposes of this study, &quot;study treatment&quot; will refer to the investigational agents,
      tislelizumab and/or pamiparib. A parent study is defined as the original BeiGene sponsored
      clinical trial in which the participant was initially enrolled and received tislelizumab or
      pamiparib treatment or both (with or without other treatments).

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Currently participating in a BeiGene-sponsored eligible parent study

          2. Fulfills treatment criteria specified in the parent study protocol

          3. In the opinion of the investigator, the participant will continue to benefit from
             tislelizumab and/or pamiparib treatment

          4. The first dose of study treatment in the extension study will be received within the
             treatment interruption period allowed by the parent study:

               1. For tislelizumab monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapies, interruption
                  period is no more than 12 weeks

               2. For pamiparib monotherapy, interruption period is no more than 21 consecutive
                  days due to toxicities other than anemia and no more than 56 consecutive days for
                  investigational drug-related anemia

               3. For pamiparib in combination with tislelizumab, interruption period is no more
                  than 21 consecutive days for pamiparib and no more than 42 consecutive days for
                  tislelizumab

               4. If the interruption period is beyond the period allowed by the parent study, the
                  acceptable length of interruption will depend on an agreement between the
                  investigator and the medical monitor of the extension study

        Specific Inclusion Criteria for Participants Who Continue Survival Follow-up Only in the
        Extension Study:

          1. Signed informed consent obtained prior to enrolling in this long-term extension study

          2. Currently participating in a BeiGene-sponsored eligible parent study in the survival
             follow-up portion following tislelizumab-containing therapy

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Permanently discontinued from either tislelizumab and/or pamiparib treatment in the
             parent study due to unacceptable toxicity, noncompliance with study procedures, or
             withdrawal of consent. Participants who were treated with pamiparib or tislelizumab in
             combination with other agents and are still receiving pamiparib or tislelizumab but
             have discontinued the other agent(s) are eligible

          2. Have uncontrolled active systemic infection or recent infection requiring parenteral
             antimicrobial therapy prior to the start of the extension study

          3. Have a life-threatening illness, medical condition, or organ system dysfunction that
             in the investigator's opinion, could compromise the participant's safety, interfere
             with the absorption or metabolism of tislelizumab or pamiparib, or put the study
             outcomes at undue risk

          4. Underwent treatment with any systemic anticancer treatment (other than treatment
             permitted in the parent study) during the time between the last treatment in the
             parent study and the first dose of study treatment in the extension study

          5. Pregnant or lactating women

        NOTE: Other protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply.
