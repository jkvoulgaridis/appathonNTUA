  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this phase I study is to evaluate the safety and potential efficacy
      and to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of IBI315, a HER2/PD-1 bi-specific
      antibody in patients with advanced solid tumors
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This phase Ia/Ib, open-label, multicenter study has two stages. The Ia stage is a
      dose-escalation study that will focus on safety, tolerability, efficacy and RP2D . Patients
      with HER2-expressing advanced solid tumor who failed from previous standard of care will be
      enrolled in the phase Ia study. DLT observation period is 28 days.
