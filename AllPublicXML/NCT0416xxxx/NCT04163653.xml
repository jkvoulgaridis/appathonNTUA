  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Fontan procedure has revolutionized the treatment of patients born with a congenital
      univentricular heart defect. However, over time, it is associated with severe lymphatic
      complications such as plastic bronchitis, protein-losing enteropathy (PLE) and peripheral
      edema.

      The hypothesis is that patients with a univentricular circulation have a changed morphology
      which may be associated with both the degree of lymphatic complications and their physical
      capacity.

      The morphology will be described using T2-weighted non-contrast MRI.

      The Fontan procedure has revolutionized the treatment of patients born with a congenital
      univentricular heart defect. However, over time, it is associated with severe lymphatic
      complications such as plastic bronchitis, protein-losing enteropathy (PLE) and peripheral
      edema. It has been proposed that these complications arise due to a elevated central venous
      pressure of the changed circulation.

      The hypothesis of the study is that patients with a univentricular circulation have a changed
      morphology which may be associated with both the degree of lymphatic complications and their
      physical capacity.

      The morphology will be described using T2-weighted non-contrast MRI. The main lymphatic
      vessel, the thoracic duct, will be rendered and measured using 3D software, and the lymphatic
      changes characterized by Dr. Yoav Dori (CHOP, Pennsylvania, USA), using a newly published
      grading system. The above will be correlated with the amount of complications experienced by
      the patients, and their physical capacity measured by both IPAQ questionaire and CPX test.

      The study population consists of patients with a Fontan circulation operated at InCor Heart
      Institute, São Paulo, Brasil and Hospital das Clínicas, Ribeirão Preto, Brasil. Exclusion
      criteria were mental illness, genetic syndromes and age &lt;18 years. The patient group will be
      compared with age, gender and weight matched healthy controls.
