    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn if Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i)
      medications enhance beneficial properties of epicardial adipose tissue including metabolic
      flexibility, insulin sensitivity, decreased cell size and reduced inflammation.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis to measure metabolic flexibility in epicardial adipose tissue samples.</measure>
    <time_frame>Time to collect tissue collected during surgery (up to 15 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>Analysis will be performed using Lipolysis Colorimetric Assay and measured by glycerol content on standard curve. Indirect effects of SGLT2i in vivo in epicardial adipose tissue will be compared to Glipizide by measuring rate of lipolysis, or breakdown of adipose in to free fatty acids.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Average insulin mediated glucose uptake (IMGU) to measure insulin sensitivity in epicardial adipose tissue samples.</measure>
    <time_frame>Time to collect tissue collected during surgery (up to 15 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>Mature adipocytes will be isolated, cultured, and treated with 2-NBDG, a fluorescently-labeled deoxyglucose analog, as a probe for the detection of glucose uptake measured by excitation/emission of florescence in the mature cells.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Characterization of the inflammatory cytokine expression profile in epicardial adipose tissue samples.</measure>
    <time_frame>Time to collect tissue collected during surgery (up to 15 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>Analysis will be performed using Luminex to measure levels of inflammatory cytokines on the human adipocyte panel.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Distribution of adipose cell size in epicardial tissue.</measure>
    <time_frame>Time to collect tissue collected during surgery (up to 15 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>After tissue collection and osmium fixation, adipose cell size will be determined by Beckman Coulter Multisizer III, and described via a mathematical model to estimate peak diameter, fat storage capacity, size variability, and % small cells.</description>

    <description>Consenting participants in the Ertugliflozen group will be supplied with 2-week course of medication prior to cardiac surgery. Participants will be educated on use and have blood glucose monitored during the medication course. The surgeon will then collect a small amount of fat near the heart during surgery.</description>
