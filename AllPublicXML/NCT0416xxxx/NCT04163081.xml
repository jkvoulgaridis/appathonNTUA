  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The INITIATE Study is a randomized controlled trial that is testing an intervention designed
      to increase long-term abstinence among tobacco smokers seen in emergency departments (ED).
      The intervention includes a behavioural incentive and tailored follow-up support on long-term
      smoking abstinence, health, healthcare utilization, and cost. Tobacco-related illnesses cost
      the healthcare system millions each year. Quitting smoking improves smoking-related outcomes,
      like the onset or management of heart disease, stroke, lung diseases, and several cancers.
      There are approximately 16 million visits to Canadian EDs each year; an estimated 3-4 million
      of these involve smokers. Effective quit smoking interventions exist, but are underutilized.
      Few hospital EDs in Canada offer tobacco-use interventions. In order for ED staff to offer
      quit smoking support, interventions need to be simple given the realities of the ED
      environment. Considering that stopping smoking improves health outcomes, that tobacco-use is
      an important cause of preventable ED use, and the volume of smokers, Canadian EDs are a
      missed opportunity in the initiation of quit smoking support. Our intervention has been
      designed to optimize uptake and smoking abstinence by including the most effective
      evidence-based behavioural and drug-related approaches, removing specific barriers and
      challenges that smokers face when trying to quit (e.g., affordability, low confidence and
      motivation), while packaging the intervention in a quick-to-initiate manner, making it ideal
      for fast-paced, complex ED environments.
