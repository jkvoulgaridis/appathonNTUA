  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the impact of treating myofascial trigger points with a single session
      of dry needling on maximal isometric strength in the short term. Two groups will receive dry
      needling in separate muscle groups and a third group will receive no dry needling.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dry needling is a effective treatment for myofascial trigger points. It is very common in a
      sporting environment. Strength is a key aspect of athletic performance. Despite the
      prevalence of dry needling within a sporting environment, the effects of dry needling on
      strength remains unknown.

      This study will investigate the effects of dry needling on maximal isometric strength with a
      view to informing clinical practice amongst clinicians working in the elite sport setting.

    <intervention_model_description>Participants with latent trigger points in rectus femoris (RF) and gluteus maximus (GM) muscles will be stratified evenly into 3 groups (RF dry needling, GM dry needling or control) based on baseline strength. Treatment, data collection and data analysis of all participants will be conducted concurrently.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>The principal investigator will gather data using a force platform and computer software. It will be anonymised and group allocation will be concealed by a second investigator before being individually analysed by the principal investigator. The second investigator will be given the individually analysed data and he/she will sort the individual data into relevant groups for group analysis.</masking_description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 24 hours post intervention, 48 hours post intervention, 72 hours post intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Measured in newtons. It is the amount of force exerted by pulling against an immovable bar. Peak force is measured as vertical ground reaction by force platforms beneath the participants feet.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 24 hours post intervention, 48 hours post intervention, 72 hours post intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Measured in newtons per second squared. It is the amount of force exerted by pulling against an immovable bar divided by the amount of time it takes to generate the force. It is measured as vertical ground reaction by force platforms beneath the participants feet.</description>

    <measure>Normalised isometric peak rate of force development during the isometric mid-thigh pull</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 24 hours post intervention, 48 hours post intervention, 72 hours post intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Measured in newtons per second squared and expressed relative to each participant peak force. It is the amount of force exerted by pulling against an immovable bar divided by the amount of time it takes to generate the force divided by the peak vertical ground reaction force produced during the trial. It is measured as vertical ground reaction by force platforms beneath the participants feet.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 24 hours post intervention, 48 hours post intervention, 72 hours post intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Measured in newtons per second squared. It is the amount of force exerted by pulling against an immovable bar divided by the amount of time it takes to generate the force. With values expressed in specific time interval windows (0ms to 50ms, 0-100ms, 0-150ms, 0-200ms, 0-250ms) It is measured as vertical ground reaction by force platforms beneath the participants feet.</description>
