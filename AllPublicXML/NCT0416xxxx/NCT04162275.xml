      Design：Randomization, double-blind, single-center, single-dose, dose-escalation , placebo and
      parallel control Objectives：

        1. To investigate the tolerability and safety of Chinese healthy adult subjects after a
           single oral administration of Finamine tablets;

        2. To investigate the pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics of Finamine tablets;

        3. To provide dose setting basis for follow-up clinical studies. Investigational
           subject:Healthy-adult subjects in China

      34 cases (including 4 cases of the pre- trial), of which the 150mg dose group is in the 4
      cases of pre- trial (open, all accepted Finamine tablets orally, among whom, two receive it
      under fasting condition , and the other two receive it half an hour post a high-fat meal
      started). There are 6 cases in the formal trial (the subjects' ratio of investigational drug
      to placebo is 2:1). In all other dose groups, the subjects' ratio of investigational drug to
      placebo is 3:1.
