      PrepTAB aims to determine whether elderly patients are able to complete 4 preoperative risk
      assessment questionnaires within a web-based survey.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Elderly patients are the most rapidly increasing group among surgical admissions. They are
      prone to a higher risk, because of predisposing risk factors. A comprehensive preoperative
      risk assessment is recommended by the European Society of Anaesthesiologists guideline, but
      time-consuming and usually not performed at present. A telemedical approach would enable an
      out-of hospital risk assessment before hospital admission and provide important information
      without the need for additional in-hospital resources. The feasibility of the completion of a
      web-based questionnaire by elderly patients, within a controlled in-hospital setting is
      required, as a base for a telemedical approach.

        A convenient sample of patients, meeting all inclusion and none exclusion criteria, will be
        enrolled in the study. The patients will be recruited from the anaesthesia ambulance in the
        University hospital RWTH Aachen, where they have an appointment with the anaesthetist
        before their planned surgery.
