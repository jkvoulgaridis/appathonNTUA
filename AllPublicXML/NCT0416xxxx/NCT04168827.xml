  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research aims to study the occurrence of post-traumatic stress, anxiety or depression in
      the parents of a child who has been hospitalized in intensive care unit following a severe
      trauma.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With nearly 25% of trauma deaths, trauma is one of the leading causes of death in the world
      for children aged 5 to 14 years. In children under 4, it is responsible for 6% of deaths.

      Severe trauma is defined by an Abbreviated Injury Scale &gt; 3 score in at least one anatomical
      region.

      In case of multiple traumas, the Injury Severity Score is used to define severe polytrauma if
      it is &gt; 15.

      Cranial trauma is the most common lesion found in polytraumatized children and is present in
      80% of cases.

      Serious head trauma is defined as the existence of a cranial trauma in a patient whose
      Glasgow score is less than or equal to 8.

      Severe trauma is a source of high mortality and severe disability in surviving children. Due
      to the context of sudden onset, a prolonged length of hospitalization in intensive care, as
      well as the occurrence of often severe sequelae, the severe trauma causes a real upheaval for
      the child's relatives.

      In adults, the occurrence of post-traumatic stress, anxiety and depression is relatively well
      described in patients and relatives of patients who have been hospitalized in intensive care
      unit. However, there is currently no pediatric study focusing on this subject, apart from
      neonatology where the traumatological context remains exceptional.

      This research aims to study the occurrence of post-traumatic stress, anxiety or depression in
      the parents of a child who has been hospitalized in intensive care unit following a severe
      trauma.
