  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to provide detailed information on state of mind, psychological
      wellbeing and stress for lay responders dispatched to suspected OHCA via a mobile phone
      application.

      The Heartunner system is a mobile phone positioning system for dispatch of CPR-trained lay
      volunteers to nearby suspected out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCAs). After downloading of
      a mobile phone application (The Heartrunner application), and given consent of participation,
      the lay responders are dispatched to nearby suspected OHCA. The lay responders are either
      dispatched directly to the scene of the suspected OHCA to perform CPR, or to fetch the
      nearest AED. The location of the OHCA and available AEDs are displayed on a map, facilitated
      by the Heartrunner application. The Heartrunner system is studied through &quot;The SAMBA-trial&quot;
      on clinical outcomes for OHCA patients (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02992873).

      The psychological effects among the lay responders will be evaluated with an online survey
      adjacent to dispatch and after 4-6 weeks. The results of the survey will be compared both
      intra-individual, and to a control group of not dispatched lay responders within the
      Heartrunner system. Descriptive statistics regarding interventions, age, gender and former
      experience will also be presented.

    <description>Swedish Core Affect Scale (SCAS);The measure of state of mind will be done on 12 affective scales of adjective pairs that range from 1-9. For example: anxious (1) to calm (9), pessimistic (1) to optimistic (9) etc. High numbers on adjectives indicating activation, as well as measures on &quot;Anxious&quot;, &quot;tense&quot; and &quot;nervous&quot; will be regarded as (negative) stress whereas &quot;Interested&quot; &quot;engaged&quot; and &quot;optimistic&quot; will be regarded as (positive) stress.</description>
