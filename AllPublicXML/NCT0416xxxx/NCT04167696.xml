      An open-label, phase I, multi-center study to determine in relapsed/refractory (r/r) acute
      myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients the recommended dose of
      CYAD‑02 after a non-myeloablative preconditioning chemotherapy followed by a potential
      CYAD‑02 consolidation cycle for non-progressive patient. A maximum of 27 r/r AML/MDS patients
      will be evaluated in this study in case of no dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and no replacement
      of patients.

    <textblock>
      This open-label phase I, multi-center study aims to determine in relapsed/refractory acute
      myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome patients the recommended dose of CYAD-02 after a
      non-myeloablative preconditioning chemotherapy followed by a potential CYAD-02 consolidation
      cycle for non-progressive patients.

      During dose escalation, three prespecified dose-levels of CYAD-02 will be evaluated in three
      cohorts. Patient enrollment during dose-escalation will be staggered according to the
      Fibonacci 3+3 design and extension of cohorts II and III will be done in parallel. The first
      CYAD-02 infusion will be administered after prior non-myeloablative preconditioning
      chemotherapy (CYFLU) administered on three consecutive days.

      Non-progressive patients meeting the criteria specified below may receive a consolidation
      cycle with three additional CYAD-02 infusions at a 2-week interval without prior
      preconditioning.

      For all patients who received at least one CYAD-02 infusion, the overall study duration will
      be approximately 15 years.
