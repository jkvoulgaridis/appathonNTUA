      Purpose of this prospective, randomized, controlled, multi-center study is to evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) as compared to surgical
      aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in female patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis.
      Patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive either TAVI or SAVR aortic valve replacement. For
      TAVI procedure, Edwards SAPIEN 3 THV system Model 9600 TFX (20, 23, 26 and 29 mm) or SAPIEN 3
      Ultra THV system Model 9750 TFX (20, 23, 26) with the associated transfemoral delivery
      systems will be sued, for SAVR any commercially available surgical bioprosthetic valve.
      Patients will undergo the following visits: Screening, Procedure, Post Procedure, Discharge,
      30 day, 6 months (telephone contact) and 1 year.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent large meta-analyses and a large retrospective study from the STS/ACC TVT Registry
      demonstrated improved survival in female versus male aortic sclerosis patients undergoing
      TAVI despite their advanced age and increased rates of major peri-procedural vascular
      complications, bleeding events and strokes. These gender-related patient profile differences
      have also been present in multicentre cohorts across the world. A recent meta-analysis by
      Siontis et al. showed that TAVI, when compared with SAVR, was associated with a significant
      13% relative risk reduction in 2-year mortality, a benefit more pronounced amongst females
      and patients undergoing transfemoral TAVI.

      In a recent meta-analysis, the female-specific survival advantage from TAVI over SAVR was
      explored. Amongst females, TAVI recipients had a significantly lower mortality than SAVR
      recipients, at 1 year (OR 0.68; 95%CI 0.50 to 0.94). Amongst males there was no difference in
      mortality between TAVI and SAVR at 1 year (OR 1.09; 95%CI 0.86 to 1.39). There was
      statistically significant evidence of a difference in treatment effect between genders at 1
      year (p interaction = 0.02). In an attempt to explore the mechanisms for an increased
      mortality rate in women undergoing SAVR, different endpoints were explored in female patients
      exclusively. It was shown that women, undergoing SAVR, having both a higher periprocedural
      mortality, higher rates of bleeding and acute kidney injury, worse patient prosthesis match
      and worse long term recovery of left ventricular function.In the recent PARTNER 3 the
      composite of death from any cause, stroke, or rehospitalization had occurred in 42 patients
      (8.5%) in the TAVI group as compared with 68 patients (15.1%) in the surgery group at 1 year.
      The difference was 6.6% (95%CI -10.8% to -2.3%) and thus exceeded the pre-defined
      non-inferiority margin of 6%.

      Subgroup analyses of the primary end point at 1 year showed no heterogeneity of treatment
      effect in any of the subgroups that were examined including gender (p=0.27). There were 292
      women included with an endpoint rate of 18.5% for SAVR (men 13.8%) and 8.1% for TAVI (men
      8.7%), showing a clear trend for an increased benefit of women undergoing TAVI instead of
      SAVR (rate difference -10.4%; 95%CI -18.3% to -2.5%). Nonetheless, the benefits of TAVI were
      preserved in both men and women.Earlier observational and clinical studies indicated an
      increased risk for women undergoing SAVR compared to men while being at a comparable risk for
      TAVI. In a recent meta-analysis of TAVI vs. SAVR in men and women the risk of dying from the
      intervention was reduced by a relative 32% in women (OR 0.38; 95%CI 0.50-0.94) while there
      was no such difference in men (OR 1.09; 95%CI 0.86-1.39). This was mostly documented as being
      the effect of a reduced periprocedural mortality with TAVI (-54%; OR 0.46; 95%CI 0.22-0.96)
      and major bleeding (-57%; OR 0.43; 95%CI 0.25-0.73) while the difference in strokes and acute
      kidney injury did not reach statistical significance. Taken all available scientific data on
      the comparison of TAVI versus open surgery in patients with indication for AVR together it
      remains probable, that independently of the individual surgical risk female patients in
      particular seem to benefit from a non-surgical aortic valve replacement strategy.

      As the indirect comparisons of the intermediate to low risk outcomes in PARTNER 2/3 suggest a
      favorable risk reduction in women compared to men as described, the investigators believe it
      is timely for a dedicated trial to demonstrate the non-inferiority of TAVI in women compared
      to SAVR and, in case of this being true, whether TAVI is actually superior to performing
      SAVR.
