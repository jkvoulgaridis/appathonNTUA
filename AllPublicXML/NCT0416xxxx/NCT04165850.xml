  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, off label study, to provide interested ALS patients with
      Ciprofloxacin/Celecoxib fixed dose combination, while assessing safety and tolerability and
      routine disease progression measures (ALSFRS-R and Vital Capacity).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be prescribed a fixed dose combination of Ciprofloxacin and Celecoxib to be
      taken thrice daily, and will be monitored for safety and tolerability. Additionally, routine
      disease progression measures will be assessed.

          4. Disease duration after first symptom less than 3 years prior to baseline

          5. Patients may be treated in parallel with Riluzole and/or Edaravone; 30 days of stable
             use prior to enrollment is required

          6. Upright forced vital capacity (FVC) ≥ 50% of predicted for age, height, weight and sex
             at screening

          7. Patient is able to swallow tablets/ capsules

          8. A caregiver (if one is needed)

             childbearing potential (i.e., females who have had their first period unless they are
             anatomically or physiologically incapable to become pregnant), must have a negative
             pregnancy test, and agree to use contraceptive drugs or devices (e.g., diaphragm plus
             spermicide, or oral contraceptives) for the duration of the study and 10 weeks after
             the last treatment dose AND require male partners to use a condom during sexual
             intercourse

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. A past history of adverse reaction/hypersensitivity to either NSAIDs, celecoxib or
             fluoroquinolones, ciprofloxacin

               5. Cognitive impairment, related to ALS or otherwise, sufficient to impair patient's
                  ability to understand and/or comply with study procedures and provide informed
                  consent

          8. Patient who is treated with chronic aspirin or NSAIDs, and is at risk if stopped.
