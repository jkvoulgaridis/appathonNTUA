  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Little is known about autophagy during HIV infection. Recently, two different teams reported
      important dysfunctions of autophagy in HIV-infected patients despite sustained suppressive
      antiretroviral therapy. As altered autophagy is strongly linked to cellular senescence and
      chronic inflammation, two hallmarks of HIV-infected patients despite long-term suppressive
      antiretroviral therapy, it is important to improve our knowledge in the area.

      Our main objective is to determine whether all or part of mononuclear cell subpopulations
      (CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, and monocytes) exhibit a defect in autophagy function in a
      cohort of HIV-infected patients who are virologically-controlled (plasma HIV RNA &lt;50 copies /
      ml) either spontaneously (i.e. HIV controllers or post-treatment controllers) or after they
      started antiretroviral therapy at different time points (i.e. at the acute or chronic
      phases), as compared with a control group (i.e. uninfected healthy blood donors).
