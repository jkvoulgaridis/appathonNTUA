  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are studies that suggest that oral and intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis combined with
      mechanical preparation is superior to unprepared antibiotic prophylaxis.

      Although there is not enough level of scientific evidence to state it with certainty, in
      addition to the fact that there is a great variability of these, so the investigators believe
      it is necessary to conduct a prospective and randomized study to know their degree of
      efficacy in a wide range of patients.

      Routine antibiotics for the intravenous and oral prophylaxis of colorectal surgery will be
      used.

      Experimental group: Patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery that involves, colonic
      resection.

      The antibiotic prophylaxis in this group will be composed of:

      An oral antibiotic pattern of ciprofloxacin (750mg / 12h, 2 doses) and metronidazole (250mg /
      8h, 3 doses) the day before surgery, plus mechanical bowel preparation with Sodium
      picosulfate, light magnesium oxide, citric acid anhydrous (15.08 g/ 2 doses) + + An
      intravenous antibiotic pattern of cefuroxime 1g and metronidazole 1,5gr during anesthetic
      induction.

      Control group: Patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery that involves, colonic
      resection.

      The antibiotic prophylaxis in this group will be composed of:

      An oral antibiotic pattern of ciprofloxacin (750mg / 12h, 2 doses) and metronidazole (250mg /
      8h, 3 doses) + An intravenous antibiotic pattern of cefuroxime 1g and metronidazole 1,5gr
      during anesthetic induction.

      In both groups a second intravenous dose of cefuroxime (750mg) will be administered if the
      intraoperative time elongates more than three hours or there is an intraoperative bleeding
      over 1000cc.

      There won´t be a placebo treatment. Subject compliance will be evaluated according to the
      usual practice in surgical care field
