  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to evaluate an online training program on shared decision making within
      the prenatal context. The main outcome is intention on using a decision aid in prenatal
      screening consultation and study population is nurses. Secondary outcomes are; knowledge
      acquisition, acceptability of the formation and perceived usefulness. The investigators
      hypothesise that this web-based SDM training program developed for the prenatal screening of
      Down Syndrome will significantly increase nurses' intentions to use the decision aid in their
      clinical practice with pregnant women and their partner.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pregnant women have difficulty choosing among the wide variety of prenatal screening options
      available. To help pregnant women and their partners make informed decisions based on their
      values, needs and preferences, a decision aid (DA) has been developped and online shared
      decision-making (SDM) training program for health professionals has been created to support
      the use of this DA and give health care professionals key elements on SDM. The decision aid
      was found relevant and acceptable to pregnant women and their partners; the relevance and
      acceptability of the online SDM training program aren't evaluated yet. This study aim to
      assess the intention on using a DA after taking the online training program, to evaluate
      knowledge acquisition and to assess the program's acceptability and perceived usefulness.
      This is a multi-center, two-arm, controlled trial (RCT). Thirty-six participants will be
      randomly allocated to either 1) an experimental group that is exposed to the investigator's
      complete 3 hours online training program intervention (n = 18) or 2) a control group that is
      exposed to an intervention which will be a 3 hours online training program focused on
      prenatal screening alone.

    <masking_description>When a participant is randomised to the trial, the private firm will assign a trial group following a pre-selected list of randomisation (given by the private firm). The employee of the private firm will be the one non-blinded in our study, by giving participant access to one of the formation. The ''Care Provider'' is not present in this study; in fact, all interactions are via the private firm and is directed towards an online-intervention. A randomisation list will be kept by the private firm and send to the research team after the data analysis. The Investigator are blinded also by the randomisation process. There is no officially Outcomes Assessor, because the outcomes of interest are self-reported (intention of using a DA) or pre-measured (for example; with the knowledge test, rightful answer are already known).</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of intention to use a decision aid after completing the online training program on SDM in prenatal screening</measure>
    <time_frame>The intention will be measured initially before accessing the formation. After the formation completed (duration is variable), the participant will have access to the questionnaire once again in a delay of 24-72 hours.</time_frame>
    <description>Nurses intention of using a decision aid for prenatal screening in clinical practice is the primary outcome. To be measured, the CPD (Continuing professional development) reaction questionnaire will be used. This questionaire scores on 5 constructs; intention, social influence, beliefs about capabilities, moral norm and beliefs about consequences and has 12 questions. The constructs intention will be targeted, however the others constructs will be also evaluated for their potential on predicting behavior of health professionals. It is a self-reported questionnaire. The use of decision aid has been chosen as an outcome become it is a main component of SDM itself and of the training. The score is on a scale from 1 to 7 (Likert type), which 1 is the minimum and 7 the maximum value (except one question that has a 5 intervals of pourcentage, that will be adjusted on 7 items scale in the analysis). The higher score means better outcome.</description>

    <description>A newly designed and self-reported questionnaire consisting of 20 questions, reviewed by an SDM expert and a pedagogical advisor, explore knowledge on; Down Syndrome (2 questions), prenatal screening (7 questions), SDM (7 questions) and ethic (4 questions). There is 2 true-false questions and the other ones are multiple choices questions. Each question has the same ponderation, which is 5% on a total score of 100%. There is only one right answer to each question. There is no negative correction. The higher score means better outcome (acquisition of knowledge). The title of this questionnaire is: &quot;Knowledge&quot;.</description>

    <measure>Satisfaction with training: self-reported questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>After the formation completed (duration is variable), the participant will have access to the questionnaire in a delay of 24-72 hours.</time_frame>
    <description>Satisfaction will be addressed on the content, trainers and overall satisfaction. For evaluating these kinds of satisfaction, a pre-existing self-reported questionnaire created by Schmidt (2007) will be used. The score is on a scale from 1 to 5 (Likert type), which 1 is the minimum and 5 the maximum value. The higher score means better outcome. The title of this section is :&quot;Satisfaction&quot; and it has two sections; &quot;Satisfaction within the training content&quot; and &quot;Satisfaction with the training contributors&quot;.</description>

    <time_frame>After the formation completed (duration is variable), the participant will have access to the questionnaire in a delay of 24-72 hours.</time_frame>
    <description>Acceptability is evaluated by looking at the comprehensibility, the amount of information , the quality of information, the format chosen of the training and it is based on a pre-existing self-reported questionnaire done by Kasper and al. (2017). The score is on a scale from 1 to 5 (Likert type), which 1 is the minimum and 5 the maximum value. The higher score means better outcome. The title of this questionnaire is &quot;Training acceptability&quot;.</description>

    <description>Usefulness is declined in terms of work responsibilities, relevance of topics to career development, relevance of topics in relation to individual learning needs, consistency with declared objectives, balance between theory and practice and it is based on a self-reported questionnaire by Giangreco, Sebastiano and Peccei (2009). The score is on a scale from 1 to 5 (Likert type), which 1 is the minimum and 5 the maximum value. The higher score means better outcome. The title of this questionnaire is &quot;Perceived usefulness of the formation&quot;.</description>

    <description>TThe intervention consisted of an online self-study training program lasting 3 hours which aims to engage SDM in a prenatal screening context. The training was divided into four main modules: 1)SDM, 2)DS prenatal screening, 3)Decision aid and 4)Communication between healthcare professionals and patients. In each module, the targeted learning objectives and the work to be carried out (e.g. readings to be made, video to be viewed, evaluation to be carried out, etc.) are presented. Various teaching methods and medias are used during this training: videos, interviews, narrated capsule, readings, links to scientific articles and complementary websites. Videos are done with experts on SDM, ethics of prenatal testing. A simulation in the end is done to put participants in context of an actual consultation with a pregnant woman and her partner. This training was designed to adapt to the learning pace of the user, is hosted on University Laval platform and needs an identification code to enter.</description>

    <description>The control intervention consisted of an online self-study training program lasting 3 hours which aims to provides knowledge for prenatal screening. The training has four main modules: 1)Context and history of prenatal screening(new), 2)DS prenatal screening(existing), 3)Consent in prenatal screening(new) and 4)Communication between healthcare professionals and patients(existing). In each module, the targeted learning objectives and the work to be carried out are presented. Various teaching methods and medias are used during this training: videos, interviews, narrated capsule, readings, links to scientific articles and complementary websites. Videos are done with experts on SDM, ethics of prenatal testing. For the 2 new modules, narrated capsules and reports have replaced videos of experts. There is no simulation at the end.
