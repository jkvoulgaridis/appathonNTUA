    <textblock>
      IMP4297 is a PARP inhibitor. This is a 2:1 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study

      A Phase III Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Multicenter Study to Evaluate the
      Efficacy and Safety of IMP4297 Following First-Line Platinum-based Chemotherapy in the
      Monotherapy Maintenance Treatment of Subjects with International Federation of Gynecology and
      Obstetrics (FIGO) Stage III-IV Ovarian Cancer. Subjects with newly diagnosed III/IV
      high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) or other histological types of ovarian cancer,
      fallopian tube cancer or primary peritoneal cancer carrying breast cancer susceptibility gene
      (BRCA) mutation who have had a complete/partial response (CR/PR) after first-line
      platinum-based therapy will be randomly assigned to IMP4297 or placebo at a 2:1 ratio.
