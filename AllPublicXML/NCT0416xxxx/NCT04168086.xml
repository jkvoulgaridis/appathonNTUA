    <textblock>
      Transcranial focused ultrasound stimulation (tFUS) will be used in this study to functions of
      the cerebellum in human motor learning. Participants will complete a visuomotor task while
      receiving stimulation pulses from tFUS. How tFUS stimulation influencing the acquisition and
      retention of motor memory will be assessed based on group comparison of behavioral measures
      such as reaching accuracy.

      The purpose of this study is to test functions of the cerebellum in human motor learning. The
      cerebellum has been thought to play critical roles in human motor control and motor learning.
      Non-invasive brain stimulation studies with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)
      and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) provided evidence for the involvement of the
      cerebellum in human motor learning. However, due to limitations in spatial resolution of tDCS
      and TMS stimulation, it is still unclear what specific functions the cerebellum may have in
      motor learning, considering the behavioral and anatomical evidence that the cerebellum also
      has connections with prefrontal cortex and is associated with cognitive functions. By
      applying transcranial focused ultrasound stimulation (tFUS), which is a non-invasive brain
      stimulation technology with great spatial precision, the investigators aim to dissect
      functions of motor area and non-motor area of the cerebellum in motor learning. Young healthy
      adults will be recruited and randomly assigned to one of three experimental groups. During
      learning to adapt to a visual rotation (45 degrees) when reaching for a virtual target,
      subjects will receive tFUS stimulation over motor area of the cerebellum or non-motor area of
      the cerebellum depending on the study group. How tFUS stimulation influencing the acquisition
      and retention of motor memory will be assessed based on group comparison of behavioral
      measures such as reaching accuracy.
