      This is a randomized, parallel, open label Phase II window trial to assess the clinical and
      biological effects of neoadjuvant abemaciclib (Arm 1) or neoadjuvant abemaciclib plus
      nivolumab (Arm 2) in patients with HPV-negative head and neck squamous cell carcinoma

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, parallel, open label Phase II window trial to assess the clinical and
      biological effects of 15-21 days of neoadjuvant abemaciclib (Arm 1) or neoadjuvant
      abemaciclib plus nivolumab (Arm 2) in patients with HPV-negative HNSCC who are planned for
      oncologic surgery, with pre-clinically informed genetic and immune biomarker correlatives.

      In the window-of-opportunity clinical trial, patients planned for oncologic surgery are
      briefly exposed to a novel cancer agent(s) in the window between diagnostic biopsy and
      definitive surgery. Paired, pre- and post-surgical tumor specimens permit ex vivo analysis of
      target modulation in both tumor and the tumor microenvironment - providing insight into
      mechanism of action and paving the way for rigorous companion biomarker development. Clinical
      activity is assessed by quantitative change in tumor size (∆T), which is correlated to
      hypothesis-driven genomic and immune biomarkers of interest.

      Investigators hypothesize that abemaciclib, with or without nivolumab, will significantly
      reduce tumor burden as measured by ∆T. Further, investigators will test the primary biomarker
      hypothesis that the clinical activity of abemaciclib, with or without nivolumab, is
      associated with an increased proportion of tumors that are T-cell inflamed. Investigators
      will evaluate tumor-intrinsic, tumor microenvironment (TME), and microbiome biomarker
      hypotheses in specific genetic contexts, including tumors with specific classes of tumor
      protein 53 (TP53) mutations, p16 loss, and/or CCND1 amplification.

             time of initiating study treatment), fungal infection, or detectable viral infection
             (such as known human immunodeficiency virus positivity or known active hepatitis B or
             C [e.g. hepatitis B surface antigen positive or hepatitis C antibody positive with
             detectable viral load]). Screening for HIV or hepatitis is not required for
             enrollment.

          8. Patient with any other condition that would, in the Investigator's judgment, preclude
             patient's participation in the clinical study due to safety concerns or compliance

               1. Sexually active males should use a condom during intercourse while taking
                  abemaciclib and for 4 weeks after the final dose of abemaciclib.

               2. Males who are sexually active with a woman of child-bearing potential should
                  apply highly effective contraception during the study as defined below, in order
                  not to father a child in this period.

               3. Women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP), defined as all women physiologically
                  capable of becoming pregnant, must use highly effective contraception during the
                  study and through at least 3 weeks after the final dose of abemaciclib (Arm 1),
                  and 20 weeks after the final dose of nivolumab (Arm 2). Highly effective
                  contraception is defined as:

             i. Total abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of
             the subject. [Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
             postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception].

        ii. Female sterilization: have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without
        hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment.

        iii. Male partner sterilization (with the appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of the
        absence of sperm in the ejaculate). [For female study subjects, the vasectomized male
        partner should be the sole partner for that patient.] iv. Use a combination of the
        following (both 1+2):

        1. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS) 2. Barrier
        methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with
        spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository.

        v. Note: Hormonal contraception methods (e.g. oral, injected, and implanted) are not
        allowed as abemaciclib may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives.

        vi. Note: Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child-bearing potential if they
        have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile
        (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral
        oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) at least six weeks ago.

        11. Prisoners or subjects who are compulsorily detained (involuntarily incarcerated) for
        treatment of either a psychiatric or physical (e.g., infectious) illness.
