  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Intrauterine adhesions are a difficult clinical problem for reproductive
      infertility. The most common cause is uterine cavity surgery and post-abortion (including
      abortion and spontaneous abortion). After the abortion, the uterine cavity adhesion, when is
      the key point, the literature is not much ink, early literature has mentioned that after the
      abortion, the uterus scraping action is scraped in four days and the uterine adhesion will be
      smaller than one to four weeks. Much more, it seems that the sooner the uterine adhesion
      factor is excluded, the more it can reduce uterine adhesion, but the uterine curettage itself
      is a risk factor for uterine adhesion. This early practice, the current clinical application,
      is not used, Instead, it is a hysteroscopy. Our past clinical observations, as soon as
      possible after the abortion, outpatient hysteroscopy, can find the tissue factors that may
      cause adhesion in the uterine cavity as soon as possible, and immediately remove it with an
      outpatient hysteroscope.

      Objective: To verify the early outpatient hysteroscopy and reduce the occurrence of
      intrauterine adhesion after abortion.

      Expected benefits to patients: Abortion is likely to cause intrauterine adhesions, which may
      further cause the incidence of reproductive infertility, should be involved before the
      formation of permanent injury, reduce the adhesion of the uterine cavity. Outpatient
      hysteroscopy is a simple and easy-to-use examination procedure that is painless and does not
      require anesthesia. Although it is invasive but has few complications, it is expected to
      reduce the occurrence of intrauterine adhesion after abortion.
