  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective clinical pilot study for subjects diagnosed with Occupational Progressive
      Pneumoconiosis.

      Subjects will be treated with Nintedanib 150mg twice daily for 3 years.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      100 Patients with asbestosis, silicosis, coal workers pneumoconiosis and diffuse dust
      fibrosis will be included. Patients will have an FVC ≥45% predicted (no upper threshold), and
      a diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (TLCO) above 30% predicted. Patients
      will be randomised to receive Nintedanib 150 mg twice daily, with the dose of the study drug
      reduced to 100 mg twice daily or interrupted temporarily in the case of adverse events
      (AEs).The primary end point will be the annual decline in FVC, measured in millilitres per
      year, calculated from serial measurements over 36 months.

      Lung function testing will be performed at baseline; 2, 4, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 44 and 52
      weeks, and every 4 months thereafter until study cessation or withdrawal at a maximum of 36
      months.

      In patients who show clinical benefit as per the end points specified access to Nintedanib
      treatment will be continued.
