  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children and adolescents diagnosed with medullablastoma and with recurrent or refractory to
      frontline therapy will be treated with 177Lu-DTPA-omburtamab, which is a radioactive
      labelling of a murine monoclonal antibody targeting B7-H3.

    <textblock>
      Part 1 is a dose-escalation phase with a 3+3 sequential-group design in which patients will
      receive a dosimetry dose followed by maximum of two 5-week cycles of treatment doses of
      intracerebroventricular 177Lu-DTPA-omburtamab.

      Part 2 is a cohort-expansion phase in which patients will receive a maximum of five 5-week
      cycles of intracerebroventricular 177Lu-DTPA-omburtamab at the recommended dose determined in
      Part 1.

      End of treatment will take place within 5 weeks after the last cycle and thereafter the
      patients will be enter the follow-up period. The patients will be followed for up to 2 years
      after last dose.

          -  Ventriculoperitoneal shunts without programmable valves. Ventriculo-atrial or
             ventriculo-pleural shunts.

          -  Grade 4 neurotoxicity. Grade 3 or lower stable neurological deficits (due to brain
             tumor) or hearing loss are allowed.

          -  Uncontrolled life-threatening infection.

          -  Received radiation therapy less than 3 weeks prior to the screening visit.

          -  Received systemic or intrathecal cytotoxic chemotherapy or intrathecal immunotherapy
             (corticosteroids not included) less than 3 weeks prior to the screening visit.

          -  Received any prior anti-B7-H3 treatment.

          -  Non-hematologic organ toxicity Grade 3 or above; specifically, any renal, cardiac,
