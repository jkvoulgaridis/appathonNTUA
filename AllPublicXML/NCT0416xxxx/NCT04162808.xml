  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antithrombotic therapy is the cornerstone of the management of patients with acute coronary
      syndrome (ACS), which result in lower risk of mortality and ischemic events. But, accompanied
      side effect of bleeding always causing worsens outcomes. Tools to evaluate risk/benefit ratio
      is useful in daily practice. The in-used scores, such as CRUSADE, are derived from
      retrospective studies, without all types of ACS and without long-term prediction. This
      project aims to establish a database of anti-thrombosis treatment and bleeding in five large
      centers in Beijing through the observational registry of ACS. With the database, establish a
      bleeding risk assessment system that can be used for all ACS patients and can predict the
      full course of antithrombotic treatment.
