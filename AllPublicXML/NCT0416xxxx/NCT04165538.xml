  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the elderly patients with hip fracture, some often take antiplatelet drugs such as
      clopidogrel due to the ischemic cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases. In traditional
      practice, these patients often need to stop medication for 5-7 days before surgery. But on
      the other hand, delayed surgery will lead to a significant increase in fracture related
      complications. Therefore, the appropriate time for drug withdrawal is particularly important
      in this population.

      Thromboelastography is a monitoring method that can accurately judge the anticoagulation
      status of patients. We hope to use thromboelastography to guide the time of drug withdrawal,
      shorten the time of drug withdrawal as much as possible, and reduce the incidence of fracture
      related complications without increasing the risk of massive hemorrhage.

    <description>Patients in the TEG group will undergo a Thrombelastograph test after admission, and the timing of operation will be determined according to the results of the test, that is, 1 day, 3 days and 5 days later respectively for patients with ADP-induced platelet-fibrin clot strength (MAADP) of &gt; 50 mm, 30-50 mm and &lt; 30 mm. For Non-TEG patients, the drug withdrawal time is determined by the doctor in charge according to the clinical routine, generally about one week.</description>
