             who has had menses at any time in the preceding 24 months). WOCBP must agree to remain
             abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use an acceptable contraceptive
             method (refer to Appendix 6) from the day of signing informed consent, during the

         10. Men must agree to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use an
             acceptable contraceptive method (refer to Appendix 6) from the day of signing informed

          1. Prior treatment with any CDK4/6 inhibitor.

          2. Participation in other studies involving investigational drug(s) within 28 days prior
             to the first dose of CS3002 and/or during study participation.

          3. Acceptance of major surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, target therapy, immunotherapy
             or other anti-cancer therapy within 21 days prior to the first dose of CS3002.

          4. Prior treatment with drugs that are known to prolong the QT interval within 7 days
             before the first dose of CS3002.

          5. Concomitant use of products known to prolong the QT interval or to be moderate to
             strong inhibitors/inducers of CYP3A4 which cannot be discontinued ≥ 5 half-lives prior
             to first dose of CS3002 and withheld throughout the trial until 2 weeks after the last
             dose of CS3002.

          6. Any toxic effects of prior anti-cancer therapy or surgical procedures unresolved to
             baseline severity or NCI-CTCAE Version 5.0 Grade ≤ 1 (except alopecia or other
             toxicities not considered a safety risk for the patient at investigator's discretion)

          7. Diagnosis of any other malignancy within 3 years prior to the first dose of CS3002,
             except for adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, or carcinoma in
             situ of the cervix.

          8. Diagnosis of small cell lung cancer and HPV positive tumors.

          9. Known brain metastasis or other central nervous system (CNS) metastasis that is either
             symptomatic or untreated. CNS metastases that have been treated by complete resection
             and/or radiotherapy demonstrating stability or improvement are not an exclusion
             criterion provided they are stable as shown by imaging for at least 4 weeks before
             screening without evidence of cerebral edema and no requirements for corticosteroids
             or anticonvulsants.

         10. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to CS3002, or any of its excipients (refer to Section 6.2.1).

             life-threatening complications in the short term (including patients with massive
             uncontrolled effusions [pleural, pericardial, peritoneal], and pulmonary
             lymphangitis).

         12. Any of the following within 6 months prior to the first dose of CS3002: myocardial
             infarction, severe/unstable angina, ongoing cardiac dysrhythmias of NCI-CTCAE Version
             5.0 Grade ≥ 2, atrial fibrillation of any grade, coronary/peripheral artery bypass
             graft, symptomatic congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular accident including
             transient ischemic attack, or symptomatic pulmonary embolism.

         13. Presence of active gastrointestinal disease or other condition that will impair
             significantly with the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of CS3002.

         14. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, known ongoing or
             active infection, including HIV, active hepatitis B or C.

         15. Subjects who are Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or Hepatitis B core antibody
             (HBcAb) positive, or Hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody positive at screening, must not
             be enrolled until further definite testing with Hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA titres and
             HCV RNA tests can conclusively rule out presence of active infection (HBV DNA ≥1000
             cps/mL or 200 IU/mL; HCV RNA exceeding the lower detection limit) requiring antiviral
             therapy with Hepatitis B and C, respectively.

         16. QTc interval &gt; 480 msec (based on the mean value of the triplicate screening ECG);
             family or personal history of long or short QT syndrome; history of ventricular
             dysrhythmias or risk factors for ventricular dysrhythmias such as structural heart
             disease (e.g., severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction, left ventricular
             hypertrophy), coronary heart disease (symptomatic or with ischemia demonstrated by
             diagnostic testing), clinically significant electrolyte abnormalities (e.g.,
             hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia).

         17. Known or suspected active alcohol or drug abuse.

         18. Other acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition including recent (within the
             past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior or laboratory abnormality that may
             increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product
             administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the
             judgment of the investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for entry into this
             study.

         19. Females who are pregnant or lactating.
