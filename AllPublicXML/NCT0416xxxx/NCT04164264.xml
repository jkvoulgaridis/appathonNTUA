  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Propofol is an extensively utilized intravenous sedative and general anesthetic. However,
      propofol has a narrow therapeutic index, and this means that there is only a small difference
      in the dose required to produce loss of consciousness and the dose required to produce
      potentially life-threatening effects such as loss of protective airway reflexes and cessation
      of spontaneous breathing. Moreover, there is substantial variation between individuals in the
      doses required to achieve these pharmacodynamic endpoints.

      Given the inexorable rise in demand for pediatric sedation and the increasing use of propofol
      in sedation protocols by non-anaesthesiologists, the purpose of this study is to refine the
      propofol dosing recommendations to account for pharmacogenomic variability to make procedural
      sedation safer for children. Experienced users already adjust for age and body weight. This
      study may enable further refinements according to sex and - novelly - ancestry.

      Hypothesis:

      The investigators hypothesize that examination of genome-wide association study (GWAS)
      findings will enable the investigators to provide pharmacogenomic insights into clinically
      observed - and, with this study, quantified - differences in propofol requirements for loss
      of consciousness (LOC) and apnea in children. It is further hypothesized that the
      distribution of allelic variants in these pharmacogenes may differ between children of
      different genomic ancestry.

      Objectives:

      Primary: (i) To describe and quantify doses of propofol required to produce loss of
      consciousness and apnea in children of differing ages, sex and self-identified countries of
      origin. (ii) To identify genomic associations that may explain variability, and generate
      hypotheses for further study. (iii) To identify genomic ancestry and examine how pharmacogene
      allele variants that may explain the findings of (i) above are distributed across genomic
      ancestries.

      Secondary: To examine the correlation between self-identified countries of family origin and
      genomic ancestry.

      Methods:

      Prospective, non-randomized, single cohort study of two pharmacodynamic endpoints (loss of
      consciousness and apnea), in children requiring propofol anesthesia, with subsequent
      genome-wide association study (GWAS) and principal component analysis (PCA) to examine,
      respectively, pharmacogenomic explanations for pharmacodynamic variability and genomic
      ancestry.

    <description>At T0, a propofol infusion at a rate of 1.5 mg/kg/min will be started until apnea is achieved. Loss of consciousness will be defined clinically using loss of eyelash reflex (TLOER) and tolerance of nasal cannulae (TNC), tested every 10 sec., and by a BIS &lt;60 for 30 sec. (TBIS). Apnea will be defined as absence of end-tidal CO2 for at least 20 seconds (TAPNEA). A saliva sample with be taken under anesthesia for genome-wide association study and principal component analysis.</description>
