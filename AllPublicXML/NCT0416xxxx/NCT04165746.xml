  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of early intervention (placement into
      foster care, and a caregiving training) on physical, cognitive, social and brain development
      and psychiatric symptomatology in children place in out-of-home care.

      The Early Institutionalization Intervention Impact (EI-3) Project will document and compare
      the impact of enhanced institutional care on early childhood development to that of
      high-quality foster care. We will recruit a large (n= 220) samples of young children who have
      been identified as having to be removed from their families and we will randomize these
      children to two groups: enhanced institutional care (Group 1) or to enhanced foster care
      (Group 2). Institutional caregivers and Foster Parents will participate in a caregiving
      training, along with the child, that includes 5-1.5 hour sessions over 6-8 weeks.

      In this Randomized Control Trial (RCT), we will assess the children in Groups 1 and 2 at the
      time they come into care and then at several follow-up time points (12 months, 24 months, 36
      months of age). We hypothesize that children placed into foster/family care (FCG) will
      display enhanced socioemotional development, and enhanced behavioral and neural patterns of
      attention, cognition and social cognition, compared to children placed in enhanced
      institutional care.

    <description>Caregivers at institutions will participate in a caregiving training, called Video Feedback Intervention to Promote Positive Parenting (VIPP). During VIPP a trained interventionist meets with a caregiver and child in the home environment.
The VIPP Interventionist will meet with caregivers and children for 5, 2-hours sessions over 6-8 weeks to discuss recordings of children and their caregivers. As described above, the sessions will focus on creating a positive atmosphere by reinforcing positive interactions.</description>

    <description>Foster parents will be recruited, consented to background checks, and trained in Portuguese. Hired foster parents will supported and monitored by project social workers and psychologists from local Foster Care programs. Foster parents will received frequent visits from the social workers, with visits occurring weekly for several months after placement of the child, then biweekly and later monthly. Project social workers will consult weekly with US staff experienced in dealing with young children in foster care.
Additionally, foster parents will participate in the VIPP caregiving training, in the same format as that described in the Enhanced Institutional Care Arm: the VIPP Interventionist will meet with caregivers and children for 5, 2-hours sessions over 6-8 weeks to discuss recordings of children and their caregivers. As described above, the sessions will focus on creating a positive atmosphere by reinforcing positive interactions.</description>

    <description>Upon entry into the Child Protection System, if the child is assigned to one of the districts participating in the RCT, the court will notify the study team. Children that have been randomly assigned to Foster Care will be placed in a foster home within 48 hours of referral to the Family Court/Child Protection System.
Children and Foster Parents will receive biweekly visits from Social Workers. Children and Foster parents will also participate in the caregiving intervention described below. Children will remain in the placement until such time as the social workers, psychologists and Family Court Judge determine that one of the following outcomes is appropriate: reunification with biological family or adoption.</description>

    <description>During VIPP an intervenor meets with a caregiver (foster parent or caregiver at the institution) and child in the home environment. During each session, the intervenor videotapes the caregiver and child doing play-based activities. After the meeting, the intervenor reviews the videos. At the next meeting, the intervenor reviews the videos with the caregiver and provides positive, constructive feedback to the caregiver. VIPP is aimed at increasing sensitivity in parents/caregivers in order to encourage positive interactions. The guiding principles are to create a positive environment and to convey that the caregiver is the expert on their own child. VIPP has been used as an intervention in traditional families, childcare settings, foster care, and for families with children with autism. VIPP has demonstrated its effectiveness through 12 RCTs in several different countries. This will be the first time that VIPP is being used in foster and institutional care in Brazil.</description>
