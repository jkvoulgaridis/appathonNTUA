  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastric cancer is a global health issue as the world's fifth most common malignancy and third
      leading cause of cancer mortality, respectively. Preoperative radiation therapy may improve
      overall survival (OS) but is seldom used. There is precedent for preoperative chemoradiation,
      as it is the standard of care for esophageal and gastroesophageal junction tumors. However,
      reluctance of physicians to prescribe preoperative radiation therapy in gastric cancer may be
      due to the large treatment fields necessary to account for stomach motion. MR guided
      radiation therapy (MRgRT) may permit decreased field sizes and more accurate dose delivery.
      In traditional CT based radiation delivery the same radiation plan is delivered each day
      without assessment of inter-fraction or intra-fraction motion. MRgRT permits the physician to
      contour the unique anatomy daily to generate a new plan to account for day to day organ
      motion. Real-time MR imaging is also used during the treatment so that radiation is only
      delivered when the tumor is within the pre-specified target area. Thus, MRgRT may overcome
      traditional barriers of radiation delivery in gastric cancer and improve oncologic outcomes.

    <description>Radiotherapy will consist of five fractions, delivered once daily, to a total dose of 25 Gy at 5 Gy per fraction. The clinical target volume will include the entire stomach and locoregional lymph nodes. Radiation must be delivered with MR guided radiation therapy (MRgRT) and daily adaptive planning. The stomach and OARs must be redrawn each day for the adaptive plan. Plans should be adapted to meet OAR constraints or improve coverage as needed for each day's unique anatomy
