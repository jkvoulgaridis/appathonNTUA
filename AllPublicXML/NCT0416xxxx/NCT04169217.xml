      elective aortic aneurysm Repair

      Population:

      Patients scheduled for elective repair of aortic aneurysm at St. Thomas' Hospital

      Screening and recruitment:

      Eligible participants will be identified by the vascular team; during the weekly
      multi-disciplinary team meeting, or via the clinical nurse specialist from tertiary
      referrals.

      Participant information leaflets will then be sent out to eligible patients 2 weeks before
      the outpatient appointment.

      Recruitment will be carried out during surgical outpatient appointments. Written informed
      consent will be obtained and participants will be randomised into three groups.

      This pilot study will help us to:

      Introduction

      Optimising fitness prior to surgery, known as prehabilitation, has the potential to reduce
      risk and improve post-operative outcomes by increasing functional capacity and physiological
      reserve. Prehabilitation strategies include educating patients with lifestyle modifications
      such as smoking cessation, nutrition, exercise and anxiety reduction. Deconditioning and
      sarcopenia has been shown to predict a higher cost amongst patients undergoing major
      abdominal surgery [1] and has been recently identified as an independent predictor of
      hospital length of stay [2], hence optimising functionality may prevent morbidity.

      There is a growing need to improve outcomes in vascular surgery, yet few examples of vascular
      prehabilitation exist. The 2018 Get It Right First Time (GIRFT) report [3] states one of the
      key recommendations is to improve the use of prehabilitation and to make it more consistent
      via NHS England commissioning.

      Multiple studies with varying prehabilitation strategies have been published in the last
      decade [4]. Prehabilitation has been associated with encouraging results in major colorectal
      and upper gastrointestinal cancer surgery [5],[6]. Data such as these have also led to the
      development of prehabilitation services within NHS Trusts [7].

      Supervised training programmes have shown to improve patient's anaerobic threshold and
      fitness in patients having aortic aneurysm repairs [8],[9],[10]. A recent randomised
      controlled trial has provided evidence to support supervised exercise training, by suggesting
      improvements in postoperative outcome, length of stay, postoperative pain and
      complications[11]. Historically there were concerns about exercising in this cohort of
      patients, however recent studies has shown that aneurysm expansion does not occur with
      exercise and exercise is safe [11],[12].

      St. Thomas' Hospital is a tertiary referral centre performing between 200-250 aortic aneurysm
      repair operations annually. We serve a large demographic from South East England and receive
      referrals from across the whole of the UK, making the provision and appeal of a supervised
      prehabilitation exercise programme difficult.

      Prehabilitation education provided is especially effective if delivered at the right time,
      for example, the need for high risk surgery; the so called 'teachable moment' [13]. Despite
      the recent surge in evidence surrounding the benefits of prehabilitation, it is not yet part
      of established pathways. There has been some guidance as to how to practically achieve
      prehabilitation into our clinical practice but there is still work to be done in terms of
      integrating it into perioperative pathways [14].

      A mentored prehabilitation programme that does not require supervised exercise is
      generalisable and feasible, but yet to show improvements in patient outcomes.

      Over the last 12 months we have been delivering a group based prehabilitation and exercise
      workshop named 'Road to Recovery'. This is a physiotherapist and anaesthetist led
      prehabilitation workshop, targeted to provide valuable education and advice to patients and
      their families about their surgery, hospital stay and expectations for discharge, diet,
      lifestyle and exercise before their aneurysm surgery. The advice emphasises the importance of
      empowering patients to take control of their own health. The workshop is designed to educate
      patients and allay their fears and anxieties around hospital admission and surgery.

      The physiotherapist then provides a detailed lecture on exercise and the relevance of
      strength in the recovery period. An interactive, group-based demonstration of various safe
      and approved practical exercises is then undertaken. Feedback from the patients has been
      positive.

      As part of the study, in addition to the prehabilitation workshop, we also aim to examine the
      potential benefits of a mentored approach, by use of technology and communication.

      Our patients often live long distances from the hospital, so frequent hospital visits and
      supervised exercise sessions are not plausible. Therefore, a mentored prehabilitation
      programme could be considered more practical and generalisable.

      We hypothesize that a prehabilitation workshop, and continued patient engagement, has the
      potential benefit to improve both the physical and psychological wellbeing of patients
      awaiting aortic aneurysm repair.

      An initial pilot study examining the study design and deliverability of a mentored approach
      prehabilitation programme, is warranted.

      Our hypothesis is that a mentored prehabilitation programme will benefit patients having
      elective aortic aneurysm surgery. This approach should be tested in a pilot study to ensure
      appropriate study design, processes and uptake of the programme by patients.

           Exclusion criteria

             -  Urgent or emergency aneurysm repair

             -  Patients who undergo emergency admission during the 8-week time frame, will be
                removed from the ongoing trial, but their data will be used up to that point.

             -  Contraindications to exercise

             -  Severe musculoskeletal disorders preventing exercise

           Recruitment

           Eligible patients will be identified either from tertiary referrals, or during the
           weekly aneurysm multidisciplinary meeting by the aortic clinical nurse specialist (CNS).

           The CNS will post the participant information leaflets to eligible participants 2-3
           weeks before their first surgical consultation.

           The research team will then recruit and consent the participants on the day of their
           attendance to the surgical clinic.

           The workshop will run on two Fridays a month. The participants will then be randomised
           to one of three groups on this date. All recruited participants will be given the
           activity monitor and instructed on its use for the study.

           The participants recruited into the non-mentored (Arm 2) and mentored (Arm 3)
           interventions will then attend the workshop on the next available day. Participants in
           arm 3 will be given training on the use of the app.

           Participants will be reimbursed for all study-related travel costs.

           Randomisation

           Recruited participants will be randomised into one of three intervention groups in a
           1:1:1 allocation ratio. A block randomisation technique with computer-generated sequence
           of random numbers will be produced using Sealed Envelope software
           (www.sealedenvelope.com).

           Study Arm 1 (Control):

           - Current usual practice, no prehabilitation workshop.

           Study Arm 2 (non-mentored prehabilitation):

           - Prehabilitation workshop with no further patient contact.

           - Participants to be given a prehab 'pack' which includes lifestyle advice.

           Study Arm 3 (mentored prehabilitation):

           - Prehabilitation workshop with regular 'mentoring' up to 8 weeks after the workshop,
           prior to their surgery.

           - Participants to be given a prehab 'pack' which includes lifestyle advice.

           - Weekly phone call by a member of the research team to remind and encourage the
           participant to increase activity.

           - Participants will be given a smartphone with a 'Prehab Activity' app. This app is
           designed and delivered by Medopad (London, UK). The app will include motivational push
           notifications, embedded documents and video clips summarising the importance of
           prehabilitation and demonstration of exercises.

           - The participants in this group will receive training in how to use the app by the
           research team.

             -  Participants will have the opportunity to access expert advice from a designated
                physiotherapist in normal working hours.

           Medopad is a software company which provides health information and a learning platform
           for patients. All data is anonymised and the clinicians will be able to view any
           comments made by the participants (using their ID only) - this will be cleared once the
           participant finishes the trial.

           Medopad will receive anonymised feedback from participants via the research team.

           Activity Trackers All patients are to have their activity levels tracked by an Actiwatch
           Spectrum (PHILIPS Healthcare, Eindhoven, Netherlands) activity tracker. This is a
           lightweight, waterproof, wrist-worn device. All data will be stored on the trackers and
           downloaded anonymously onto secure research computers for analysis.

           Outcome assessors will be blinded to the intervention.

           Follow up

           Patients will be followed at two time points in the trial, prior to surgery after the
           eight-week intervention period (Follow up 1) and six weeks post-operatively (Follow up
           2).

           Follow up 1: Eight weeks after recruitment, prior to surgery

             -  The participant will be requested to attend St Thomas' Hospital to complete a QoL
                questionnaire and functional assessments.

             -  The outcome assessor will remain blinded to the group allocation of the
                participant.

           Follow up 2: Six weeks postoperative Subjects will be contacted to complete a QoL
           questionnaire. Electronic patient records and discharge letters will be used to collect
           data on post-operative complications, 30-day mortality and length of hospital stay.

           Data Recording All data will be recorded onto paper CRFs which will then be transferred
           onto CASTOR database.
