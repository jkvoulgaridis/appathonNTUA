    <textblock>
      -  Background In emotional regulation, the patient remembers an emotional situation,
           focuses his attention on his physical sensations when he relives a recent emotion, and
           let evolve his sensations.

        -  Method Evaluate the relevance of this method by an interventional study, in a pre-post
           mono group, on patients suffering from phobia.

        -  Objective The investigators aim to validate the effectiveness of this emotional
           regulation method and compare its results with that of conventional methods. Sessions
           are individual and repeated until the disappearance of phobic fear.

      The present study may contribute to propose a new possibility to treat phobias in a simple
      and fast way.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Between 2003 and 2006, the investigators conducted an exploratory, prospective and
      comparative research study, taking each person as their own control, to evaluate the benefits
      of the type of emotional regulation developed by the Tipi association on a population
      suffering from phobias.

      - Participants Phobias can be categorized by type, as defined in the DSM IV, the standard
      reference during the study period (American Psychiatriy Association, 2000) : agoraphobias,
      social phobias, specific situational phobias (claustrophobia, transport phobia), phobias
      linked to the natural environment (heights, water, fire), to animals (spiders, snakes,
      amphibians, tentacled shellfish) and other types of specific phobias (fear of physical
      contact, being dirtied, contaminated, vomiting), phobia of blood - injections - medical
      techniques - accidents.

      The investigators aim to conduct a prior and systematic verification with each person to
      confirm that their fears were phobias as defined in the DSM IV (American Psychiatriy
      Association, 2000). The phobia must be diagnosed by a doctor or psychiatrist. Each people
      must provide a medical certificate that evidenced the diagnosis in writing.

      All people must read an information form on &quot;Understanding your emotions&quot; All participants
      must have suffered from their phobias for a long time. They have to describe their treatment.

      Everybody in the study population have to provide a short-written report on the effects of
      the session(s) 1 week, 1 month, 3 months and 12 months after the session.

        -  Intervention (see below)

        -  Follow-up During the one-year follow-up period, the patient was requested to send a
           written self-assessment of his situation and the change and/or disappearance of his
           phobia. If the investigators didn't receive the person's assessment, the investigators
           followed-up with a mail and a phone call.

        Inclusion criteria :

          -  Adult: 18-90 years old

          -  Phobic people: agoraphobia, with or without panic associated, social phobias and
             specific phobias. Diagnosis of phobias must be established by the medical world during
             consultations and explorations. This is systematically checked with the patient to see
             if the fears come under a phobia as defined in the DSM IV, reference at the time in
             2006 (ref DSM IV). The list of phobias classified by type is as follows: animal type
             or insects; natural environment type (phobias storms, height, water ...); blood type -
             injection - accident (phobia of seeing blood or an accident or having an injection or
             any other invasive medical procedure); situational type (fear of specific situations
             such as public transport, tunnels, bridges, elevators, air travel, driving a car or
             enclosed areas); another type: afraid to choke, to vomit or contract an illness, fear
             of falling, and fears about loud noises or disguised characters.

          -  People accepting regular follow-up until one year after the first session.
