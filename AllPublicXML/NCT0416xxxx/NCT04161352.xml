  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) is still a standard treatment for the unresectabl stage III
      NSCLC.However, prognosis following this treatment is generally poor, with 5-year survival of
      15-20%. The result of published HELPER study had showed that Endostar, a kind of angiogenesis
      agent, in combination with CCRT could improve the efficacy and safety. In order to verify the
      rusults, the investigators design the current study.

      The current study is a observation study in the real world setting. The 500 patients in
      compliance with Enrollment Criteria will be as the objects of observation. The procedure of
      study include the period of screening, treating and follow-up. The duration of study is about
      two and half year. The data entrying will be done by CRC, using the EDC system. CRA will
      audit the quality of data regularly.
