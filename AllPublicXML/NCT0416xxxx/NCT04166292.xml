  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stylage® XL Lidocaïne is a CE-marketed hyaluronic acid gel indicated for the restoration or
      augmentation of facial volume by injection into the deep dermis or subcutaneously. Lidocaine
      hydrochloride is intended to reduce the pain associated with the injection.

      In this study 40 healthy subjects between the age of 30 and 65 years, presenting a volume
      deficit on the face as evaluated by the investigator at inclusion in the study, who have
      given his/her informed consent and met all the eligibility criteria, will be enrolled.

      Subjects will come to a total of 6 visits over a period of 18 months and a screening visit
      prior to baseline injection. The facial volume variation after baseline injection will be
      assessed. Treatment responders rate, Global Aesthetic Improvement, volume on the cheekbones,
      volume on the chin and chin angle (for applicable subjects), subject's satisfaction and
      safety will be also assessed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, uncontrolled, single site study with a blinded evaluator assessing the
      efficacy of Stylage® XL Lidocaïne on FVLS and GAIS clinical scoring.

      The study duration by subject is 18 months with a screening visit (V0) before injection, the
      baseline visit (injection of Stylage® XL Lidocaïne, V1) and 5 follow-up visits after 1, 3, 6,
      12 and 18 months (V2 to V6). At 1 month (V2) an optional touch-up may be done (if needed).

      The primary endpoint is the facial volume variation from baseline (D0) to 6 months after
      treatment initiation measured by an independent evaluator on photographs using FVLS (Facial
      Volume Loss Scale).

      Facial volume variation (evaluated by an independent evaluator) &amp; treatment responder rate,
      Global Aesthetic Improvement (evaluated by the patient and the doctor), volume on the
      cheekbones and chin &amp; chin angle (for applicable subjects), subject's satisfaction will be
      measured at all time-point with a FVLS, GAIS,3D QuantifiCare system, FACE-Q questionnaire
      (cheekbones and chin) respectively. Safety will be also assessed.

    <masking_description>The facial volume loss will be retrospectively assessed by a blinded independent evaluator using the Facial Volume Loss Scale (FLVS) on 3D photographs from V1 (D0 before) and at the following visits: V2 (D30 before), V3 (D90), V4 (D180), V5 (D360) and V6 (D540). The evaluator is blinded to treatment and visit number.
The overall improvement level will be retrospectively assessed by a blinded independent evaluator using the GAIS on 3D photographs at the following visits (in comparison with 3D photographs before injection): V2 (D30 before), V3 (D90), V4 (D180), V5 (D360) and V6 (D540).
