  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposed study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 3-arm parallel,
      multicenter phase II study, designed to explore the efficacy and safety of SHR0302 treatment
      for patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis.

      The study will be conducted over a 12-week treatment period. Two active doses of SHR0302 will
      be compared to placebo and improvement in atopic dermatitis will be assessed using the
      Investigator's Global Score (IGA)

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects between 18-75 years of age (inclusive), male or female, at the time of
             informed consent

          -  Moderate to severe atopic dermatitis

          -  Capable of providing a signed and dated informed consent form indicating the subject
             has been informed of all pertinent aspect of the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with historical or current evidence of clinically significant cardiovascular,
             neurological, psychiatric, renal, hepatic, immunological, gastrointestinal,
             urogenital, nervous system, musculoskeletal, skin, sensory, endocrine (including
             uncontrolled diabetes or thyroid disease) or hematological abnormalities that are
             uncontrolled. Significant is defined as any disease that, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, would put the safety of the subject at risk through participation, or
             which would affect the efficacy or safety analysis if the disease/condition
             exacerbated during the study

          -  Subject has a current diagnosis of other active skin disease (e.g., psoriasis or lupus
             erythematosus) or skin infection (bacterial, fungal, or viral) that may affect the
             evaluation of atopic dermatitis

          -  Subject has a severe comorbidity that may require systemic steroids therapy or other
             interventions or requires active frequent monitoring (e.g., unstable chronic asthma)
