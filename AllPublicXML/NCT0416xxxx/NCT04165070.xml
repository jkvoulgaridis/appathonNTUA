  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in
      combination with MK-7684 in treatment-naïve participants with advanced squamous or
      non-squamous NSCLC.

      This study is one of three pembrolizumab substudies being conducted under one pembrolizumab
      umbrella master protocol (MK-3475-U01).

    <description>ORR was defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population who had a Complete Response (CR: Disappearance of all target lesions) or a Partial Response (PR: ≥30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per RECIST 1.1.</description>

    <description>PFS is defined as the time from first dose of study treatment to the first documented progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Per RECIST 1.1, PD is defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered PD.</description>
