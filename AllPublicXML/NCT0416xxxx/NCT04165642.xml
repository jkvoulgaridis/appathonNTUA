  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the efficacy of laser balloon ablation of atrial fibrillation (AF) without
      verification of electrical isolation of pulmonary veins using implantable loop recorder.

      This is a prospective and single-center study. A targeted number of 82 patients suffering
      from paroxysmal or persistent AF, indicated to undergo catheter ablation will be included.
      The study will consist of: i) patient enrolment, ii) treatment phase, and iii) 1-year
      follow-up phase. The duration of the study is expected to be 24 months, from first patient
      enrolment to last patient follow up.

      This is a prospective and single-center study. A targeted number of 82 patients suffering
      from paroxysmal or persistent AF, indicated to undergo catheter ablation will be included.
      The study will consist of: i) patient enrolment, ii) treatment phase, and iii) 1-year
      follow-up phase. The duration of the study is expected to be 24 months, from first patient
      enrolment to last patient follow up.

      In a recent meta-analysis including 1188 patients, free from arrhythmic recurrences at 12
      months after a single ablative procedure with a laser balloon and without continuous
      monitoring with ILR was 74%1.

      Assuming that the approach without post-ablative verification of pulmonary vein isolation and
      continuous monitoring with ILR can lead to a 60% success rate at 12 months, 80 patients are
      required to have an 80% probability to observe a level of 2-code significance of 0.05 in an
      exponential model with the log rank test. With an estimated loss of data (patients lost to
      follow-up, protocol deviations and incomplete data) of 5%, the total number of patients to be
      enrolled is 82.

      Subject screening and enrolment will be carried out for approximately 12 months. The study
      will continue up to 12 months after last patient enrolment, dependent on the rate of
      enrolment and the regulatory timeline (as applicable).

      <textblock>
        All patients referred to the Department of Arrhythmology for the management of parosysmal
        or persistent AF will be considered for eligibility. A subject, who meets all of the
        inclusion criteria, and none of the exclusion criteria, is eligible to participate in this
        study.

        All subjects enrolled in the clinical study (including those withdrawn from the clinical
        study or lost to follow-up) will be accounted for and documented, assigning an
        identification code linked to their names, alternative identification or contact
        information.

        This log will be kept up to date throughout the clinical study by the principal
        investigator (PI) or his/her authorized designee. To ensure subject privacy and
        confidentiality of data this log must be maintained throughout the clinical study at the
        clinical site.
