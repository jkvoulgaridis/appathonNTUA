  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lymphoma diagnosis often involves removal and biopsy of one or more lymph nodes. Many (around
      half) of these diagnostic procedures show that no cancer is present, hence unnecessary
      removal results in numerous side effects and complications. The procedure is also highly
      invasive.

      The investigators have already shown that it is possible to tell the difference between
      healthy and diseased tissue in the laboratory by looking at the light emitted by tissue when
      a low power laser is shone on to it. The investigators intend to use this technique, known as
      &quot;Raman Spectroscopy&quot; (RS) to tell if tissue in the node is cancerous or healthy. By combining
      RS with a fine needle, the technique can target tissues below the skin with minimal invasion.
      Our needle will provide the clinician with instant diagnosis without the delay and cost of a
      laboratory analysis by pathologists.

      The investigators have designed a probe that slides through a fine needle, guided by
      ultrasound, to the lymph node. The space between the two needles provides space for cell
      aspirate.

      The investigators propose to measure spectra from excess lymph node biopsy samples taken
      during standard routine diagnostic biopsy.

      The investigators are also interested to see if they can successfully extract a fine needle
      aspiration (FNA) biopsy sample using the device, as well as record a RS measurement. If
      successful this would ease clinical adoption as the study could run in parallel with existing
      standard routine clinical practice, using just one device.

      This study will evaluate the new device on half a lymph node that will be excised and
      snap-frozen during a routine surgical biopsy, to gather data for submission of approvals for
      an in-vivo study to follow.

      Surplus lymph node tissue collected from patients undergoing routine surgical treatment for
      head &amp; neck disease will be investigated using vibrational spectroscopy.

      The project will develop a combined FNA/Raman spectroscopy needle probe. This study will
      evaluate this device on excised lymph node tissue to gather data for submission of approvals
      for an in-vivo study to follow. Raman &amp; FTIR (fourier transform infrared) spectra will be
      correlated with routine histopathology results using multivariate analysis methods. Cytology
      samples taken using the device will be compared with histopathology results.

      Aims

      To demonstrate that the FNA/Raman spectroscopy probe device, developed as part of this
      project, can:

      Safely perform measurement of Raman spectra on excised lymph node tissue Safely perform FNA
      (fine needle aspiration) biopsies on excised lymph node tissue To evaluate the performance of
      a Raman needle probe to detect lymphoma &amp; malignancy in excised head &amp; neck lymph nodes and
      differentiate from benign nodes.

      To develop the investigators understanding of vibrational spectroscopy signal characteristics
      in head &amp; neck lymph nodes (through Raman &amp; FTIR mapping measurements of tissue sections).

      Objectives To test a new combined FNA and spectroscopic device on ex vivo tissue in
      preparation for an in vivo study.

      Outcome

      Primary Outcome Measures The FNA/Raman spectroscopy probe device can be used safely on
      excised lymph nodes to measure tissue spectra and collect FNA biopsies.

      Diagnostic performance of vibrational spectroscopy for differentiation of lymphoma &amp;
      malignant nodes from benign nodes.

      Secondary Outcome Measures Evaluation of the performance of a Raman needle probe to detect
      lymphoma &amp; malignancy in excised head &amp; neck lymph nodes and differentiate from benign nodes.
      To develop the investigators understanding of vibrational spectroscopy signal characteristics

        Patients undergoing surgical head &amp; neck lymph node biopsy within Gloucestershire Hospitals
        NHS Foundation Trust Patients with a lump in their head or neck are sometimes referred by
        their GP for a biopsy. This often first involves taking a small sample of cells with a fine
        needle, guided by ultrasound, called a Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) biopsy. If the result
        from this FNA biopsy is inconclusive, then they are often further referred for a surgical
        biopsy. Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust is a tertiary referral centre for
        surgical head and neck biopsies.
