      TOPHAT is a double blind, individually randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group,
      flexible dose trial of ondansetron (8-24mg/day) as a treatment for Parkinson's
      hallucinations, with a 12-week primary outcome and follow-up to 24 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates whether ondansetron, a drug used to treat post-operative sickness,
      has a meaningful treatment effect on Parkinson's hallucinations, and whether the drug is safe
      and cost effective for use in the NHS. We will compare ondansetron to placebo (a tablet that
      looks identical but contains no drug) over 12 weeks treatment, with follow up (once treatment
      ends) for a further 12 weeks. We will also investigate whether treatment effects against
      hallucinations are related to improved processing of visual information. Assessments of
      symptoms will be carried out during treatment (after 6 and 12 weeks), and once treatment ends
      (18, 24 weeks), to measure hallucinations, delusions (false beliefs), Parkinson's symptoms
      (tremor, anxiety, sleep disturbance), memory, quality of life, possible side-effects such as
      constipation and headache, and the proportion of people who drop out due to side effects, or
      require additional treatment for their hallucinations. Blood drug concentration (measured
      after 6 and 12 weeks) will provide information on how quickly the drug is cleared from the
      body, and how this relates to treatment effects and side-effects, to guide future prescribing
      in people with Parkinson's. Based on knowledge of the average hallucinations scores in
      previous Parkinson's treatment studies, 216 people will be needed for the study to detect a
      meaningful treatment effect. The study will run for 4 years and involves a series of linked
      stages: (1) Trial set up across 15-20 UK centres; (2) Recruitment over 2 years; (3)
      Completion of follow up; and analysis, publication and dissemination of results.

The dose will increase from a single daily 8mg tablet (AM) (weeks 1 and 2), to 16mg/day (8mg twice daily) (weeks 3 and 4), with a further increase to 24mg/day (8mg AM, 16mg PM) (weeks 5 and 6). Dose escalation will be guided by telephone safety monitoring prior to each dose increase, and a face to face assessment at the end of week 6.</description>
