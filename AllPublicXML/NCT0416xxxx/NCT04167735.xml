  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants will complete a listening task in a simulated reverberant environment.
      Participants are seated and instructed to look at a fixation cross while a sentence is
      played. Sentences are varied with respect to their speech rate. While listening to the
      sentences participant's pupil dilation is measured by means of pupillometry which is a
      non-invasive physiological measurement. Participants are asked to repeat back the sentences
      loud. At fixed intervals, subjective ratings are collected by asking participants to move an
      on-screen slider using a game controller. Two hearing aid programs will be compared, one
      intended for speech perception in quiet and the other to reduce reverberation in reverberant
      environments. The study is designed as factorial, with 2 speech rates, 2 room simulations and
      2 hearing aid programs. The same conditions will be re-tested once after a minimum of one
      day. A pilot study will determine appropriate speech rates by applying a different factorial,
      with 4 speech rates, 2 room simulations and 1 hearing aid program. Participants complete all
      conditions (within-subjects) in one experimental sessions that lasts around 1 hour.

    <measure>Changes in Event-related-pupil-dilations (ERPDs)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Pupil dilations will be recorded from the participant during the performance of the auditory tasks. Analyses will be carried out relative to the pre-trial baseline (measured one second prior to the onset of the stimulus), in order to account for differences in baseline physiological activity. It is planned to analyze event-related-pupil-dilations.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Oldenburg sentence test</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>1. Words recalled correctly: words repeated back by participants are logged and the percentage of words recalled correctly calculated.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>subjective rating</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective ratings: using a game controller, participants rate the difficulty of the sentences and listening effort on a visual analog scale. The scale is continuous and ranges from minimal to maximal difficulty/effort. The position of the cursor on the scale is then used to calculate a percentage from 0-100% difficulty/effort.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Non-verbal Trail Making Test A &amp; B</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>The Trail Making Test is a neuropsychological test of visual attention and task switching. It consists of two parts in which the subject is instructed to connect a set of 25 dots as quickly as possible while still maintaining accuracy. The data, serving as an outcome measure, are time-to-complete the set in seconds</description>

    <description>Each participant will be fitted with the 2 different Sound Changing principles on the same hearing aid, saved to 2 manual programs (ensures exact same hearing loss compensation for each intervention). Reverberation Canceller principle is a sound processing algorithm to remove reverberation from a speech signal to improve the speech intelligibility and comfort. The active comparator condition is without Reverberation Canceller principle enabled.</description>

Reverberation Canceller principle is a sound processing algorithm to remove reverberation from a speech signal to improve the speech intelligibility and comfort. The experimental condition applies the Reverberation Canceller and is predicted to provide a benefit in reverberant room simulations.</description>
