  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to identify what sender/signal combinations are most persuasive in
      encouraging low socioeconomic males living in the U.S. to take-up seasonal flu vaccination.
      The investigators plan to recruit male subjects and randomly assign them to three persuasion
      treatments: two of which vary dimensions of the sender of medical recommendation (concordance
      and authority treatments) and one which varies the signal (validation). Specifically, the
      investigators will show subjects videos of either black or white male &quot;actors&quot; providing
      scripted information on the flu vaccination. The investigators cross-randomize race with
      authority as the actor will portray either a actor or a layperson. In addition, the
      investigators will vary the script used in the experiment between one that acknowledges past
      injustices (indicated as a validation script hereafter) and one that does not (indicated as a
      baseline script hereafter). Lastly, the investigators will randomize offer prices for a free
      flu shot coupon. The design requires collection of baseline and endline surveys combined with
      administrative data from pharmacies about coupon redemption. The outcomes of interest are
      posterior beliefs about seasonal flu vaccination, demand and willingness-to-pay (WTP) for a
      free flu shot coupon and redemption of the coupon.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will recruit approximately 1,000 African American or Caucasian adult males
      with a high-school diploma or less. The investigators will oversample African American
      individuals, emphasizing low-income and minority men because these characteristics are
      correlated with lower relative take-up of flu vaccination. After informed consent is
      obtained, subjects will be asked about sociodemographic information (age, education, income
      and marital status), healthcare experience and past medical history, knowledge and beliefs
      about flu vaccination, and location of the nearest pharmacy. The investigators will then
      randomly assign the adult male subjects to videos which contain one of black or white actors
      playing the role of either a doctor or a layperson as well as different scripts. The content
      of the infomercial will be the safety and effectiveness of adult seasonal flu vaccination.
      After the video, the investigators will obtain information on beliefs regarding flu
      vaccination, feedback on the video, attention to the video and willingness-to-pay for a flu
      shot coupon. The investigators will track coupon redemption, which is redeemable at most
      pharmacies nationwide.
