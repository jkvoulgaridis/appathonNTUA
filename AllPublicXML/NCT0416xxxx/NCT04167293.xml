  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although sorafenib is the standard treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma with portal vein
      invasion, the outcome of these patients remains very poor, with a median survival time of 5.5
      to 7.2 months. It has been demonstrated that first-line treatment with transarterial
      chemoembolization plus radiotherapy could provide more favorable survival than sorafenib
      alone. However, intrahepatic dissemination and distant metastasis remains the major
      recurrence pattern after treatment in these patients; therefore, searching for new strategies
      to improve efficacy is necessary. Immunotherapy targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoints has
      demonstrated promising activity in advanced HCC. Combining radiotherapy with immune
      checkpoints showed promising response rates and improved survival in several solid tumor
      types. The aim of this randomized study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of
      stereotactic body radiotherapy followed by sintilimab (an anti-PD-1 antibody) compared with
      stereotactic body radiotherapy alone for hepatocellular carcinoma with portal vein invasion
      after arterially directed therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 116 HCC patients with portal vein invasion after arterially directed therapy
      (transarterial chemoembolization or hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy) will be
      randomized to two treatment arms using a 1:1 ratio: SBRT + PD-1 arm or SBRT alone arm.
      Patients in both arms will receive stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) using volumetric arc
      therapy. The prescribed dose is 30-54 Gy in 3-6 fractions over 1-2 weeks. In the SBRT + PD-1
      arm, sintilimab is administered intravenously at 200 mg every 3 weeks for up to 1 year. The
      first course of sintilimab will be given within 4-6 weeks after completion of SBRT.
