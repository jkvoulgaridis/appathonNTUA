  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Natural thyroid function changes during pregnancy. In up to tens of percent of pregnant
      women, these changes can lead to pathological fluctuations in hormone and antibody
      production. Although the effects on pregnancy and child development are well described, none
      has determined their influence on mother's emotional well-being and the quality of life.

      At present, universal thyroid screening in pregnancy in the Czech Republic is not covered by
      health insurance. The aim of the project is to change this situation by providing quality of
      life estimate for the cost-effectiveness model.

      This is a project of three specialized institutions aimed at mapping various aspects of the
      quality of life of pregnant women and describing the impact of thyroid disease on their
      lives. The project is a parallel study to a larger project Early screening for thyreopathy in
      pregnancy (CZ.03.2.63/0.0/0.0/15_039/0009643) supported by the European Fund Operational
      Programme Employment through the National screening centre. The data will be collected
      through online questionnaire from women enrolled in the Early screening for thyreopathy in
      pregnancy (CZ.03.2.63/0.0/0.0/15_039/0009643) who were screened for TSH, TPOAb and FT4.
