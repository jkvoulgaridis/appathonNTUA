    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to test 18F-BMS-986229 positron emission tomography (PET) imaging
      a practical and safe way to check the status of esophageal, stomach, and gastroesophageal
      junction cancer.

    <description>10 participants will receive one injection of 18F-BMS-986229 (370 MBq) and will then undergo whole-body PET/CT (80 mA) encompassing the vertex of the skull to the proximal thigh performed at 60 minutes (within the range of 55-70 minutes) postinjection. The scan itself is expected to last about 30 minutes and participants will be asked to remain in the waiting area or dedicated room for an additional 30 minutes post scan. The total time from injection will be 120 minutes. In both cohorts, participants whose treatment includes nivolumab and who have positive tumor localization observed at baseline will be asked to undergo an additional round of imaging.</description>

    <description>25 participants may receive 370 MBq of 18F-BMS-986229 given intravenously and will undergo a single PET/CT scan 60 minutes (within the range of 55-70 minutes) postinjection. The scan itself is expected to last about 30 minutes and participants will be asked to remain in the waiting area or dedicated room for an additional 30 minutes post scan. The total time from injection will be 120 minutes. In both cohorts, participants whose treatment includes nivolumab and who have positive tumor localization observed at baseline will be asked to undergo an additional round of imaging. If the participant agrees, they will receive a second injection while undergoing nivolumab treatment (after at least 2 cycles or 6 weeksof therapy).</description>

        Potential research subjects will be identified by members of the patient's treatment team,
        the protocol investigator or research team. If the investigator is a member of the
        treatment team, s/he will screen their patient's medical records for suitable research
        study participants. The investigator will use information provided by the patient and/or
        medical record to confirm that the patient is eligible and contact the patient regarding
        study enrollment. All eligible patients, regardless of sex and race will be approached for
        participation. No additional measures, e.g. advertisement, payment to patients, will be
        employed to recruit patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant must have pathologically or cytolofically confirmed (at MSK) esophageal,
             gastric, or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma

          -  PD-L1-positive expression in &gt;/=1% of the tumor or stromal cells. PD-L1 expression
             will be reviewed by MSK pathologist, scored and recorded using the combined positive
             score (CPS) formula (number of PD-L1 positive tumor cells, lymphocytes, and
             macrophages divided by the number of tumor cells x 100).

          -  Participants must have disease that can be evaluated radiographically. This may be
             measurable disease or nonmeasurable disease according to RECIST 1.1.

          -  Concurrent therapy is allowed.

          -  Age 18 years or older.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-2.

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum
             pregnancy test within 24 hours before receiving the first dose of the study
             medication. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum
             pregnancy test will be required.

             within 14 days of initiation of treatment.

        with Gilbert's disease [&lt;/=3 x ULN]) AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT): &lt;/=2.5 x ULN OR &lt;/=5 x ULN
        for subjects with liver metastases

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known diagnosis of immunodeficiency or receipt of systemic steroid therapy or any
             other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days before the first dose of trial

             polyangitis], myasthenia gravis, Graves' disease, rheumatoid arthritis, hypophysitis,
             uveitis) within the 3 years before the start of treatment. The following are
             exceptions to this criterion:

               -  Subjects with vitiligo or alopecia

               -  Subjects with hypothyroidism (e.g., following Hashimoto syndrome) who are stable
                  with hormone replacement therapy or with psoriasis not requiring systemic
