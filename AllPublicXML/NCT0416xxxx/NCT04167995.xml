    <textblock>
      ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by persistent symptoms of inattention
      and/or hyperactivity and impulsivity that are present before age 18. These symptoms must be
      evident across ADHD treatment is currently based on a multimodal approach with the
      combination of psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy, but no reliable markers of treatment
      response have been identified yet and 20-35% of subjects in clinical trials may have an
      inadequate response to the treatment The gut microbiome refers to the microbial ecosystem
      found in the gastrointestinal system of the human species Probiotics are a type of beneficial
      bacteria that improve health and facilitate intestinal microbial balance Increasing evidence
      suggests that the gut microbiota plays a key role in the gut-brain communication axis by
      influencing metabolism, inflammation, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and
      neurotransmission multiple domains and cause Impairment in functioning in order to meet the
      diagnostic criteria for ADHD

    <description>This tool is used in order to assess the profile and severity of symptoms, response to treatment and follow up studies. Items are scored on 14 subscales of symptoms including opposition, cognitive problems, inattention, and hyperactivity.It is usually considered normal when T-scores are less than 60, while scores above 60 are signs of academic, behavioral, or social issues. There are several different classes as well</description>
