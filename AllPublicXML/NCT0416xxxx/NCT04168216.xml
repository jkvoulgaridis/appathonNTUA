  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The intention with the study is to have a better understanding of what happens to COPD
      patients' symptoms, lung function and markers of inflammation over 12 weeks. This information
      will increase the understanding of COPD and how to design new treatments for COPD in the
      future.

      This is a Phase IV, open-label, single-arm, single-site study. The purpose of this
      exploratory study is to gain longitudinal insights into the relationships between the
      inflammatory profile, symptoms, lung function, and reliever use in subjects with chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

      The study will include a minimum of 8 clinic visits and consist of a Screening Visit (Visit
      1), a 4-week run-in period, a Baseline Visit (Visit 2) and a 12-week observational period,
      including 6 visits scheduled every 2 weeks. To standardise the use of COPD medications all
      subjects will receive maintenance Duaklir and reliever Ventolin for the duration of the
      study. During the observational period, additional visits may occur if subjects experience a
      worsening of their COPD symptoms. For each individual subject, the duration of participation
      in the study will be 16 weeks.

      Estimated study duration is approximately 20 months including approximately 50 patients.

        The study will include patients diagnosed with symptomatic COPD and blood eosinophil count
        &gt;0.1×109 cells/L, who are receiving maintenance treatment with a long-acting β2 agonist
        (LABA) in combination with ICS and/or a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) and
        require use of an inhaled short-acting bronchodilator (β2 agonists or anticholinergics) as
        rescue medication. The study will include both current and former smokers (with at least 10
        pack-year history) and intends to recruit a maximum of 30% current smokers.

             significant endocrine, autoimmune, metabolic, neurological, renal, gastrointestinal,

             standard treatment.

          7. Subjects currently treated with eosinophil-depleting medications (ie, mepolizumab,
             benralizumab), or who have been treated within 5.5 half-lives of eosinophil-depleting

             drug within 4 months or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to Visit 1.

         10. Participation in another clinical study with a non-biologic investigational product or
             new formulation of a marketed non-biologic drug during the last 30 days prior to Visit
             1 that, in the opinion of the Investigator, could impact the results of the current
             study.

         11. Subjects with a known hypersensitivity to the treatment or any of the excipients of
             Duaklir and Ventolin.

         12. Involvement in the planning and/or conduct of the study (applies to both AstraZeneca
             staff and/or staff at the study site).

         13. Judgment by the Investigator that the subject should not participate in the study if
             the subject is unlikely to complete the observational period (eg, literacy, substance
             abuse, life-threatening comorbidity).

         14. Previous entry into the observation period in the present study.

         15. For women only - currently pregnant (confirmed with positive pregnancy test),
             breast-feeding or planned pregnancy during the study. Women of childbearing potential
             not using acceptable contraceptive measures, as judged by the Investigator.

         16. As judged by the Investigator, planned hospitalisation/vacation during the study that
             interferes with study assessments.
