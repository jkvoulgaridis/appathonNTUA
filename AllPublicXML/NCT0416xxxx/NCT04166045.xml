    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>We will also assess the change in migraine pain before versus after treatment with the 100-mm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), which is a continuum scale that patients can quantify their pain from none (0 mm) to extreme (100 mm) for both treatment sites. The mean score for each patient cohort will be calculated. We will also perform a sub analysis on women versus men.</description>

    <measure>Percent of subjects who are responders</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>For each subject treatment effectiveness will be assessed by both achieving pain relief (if the pain decreases from a 4-point visual rating scale (VRS) of 'severe' or 'moderate' at pre-treatment to 'mild' or 'none' at 120-min post-treatment) or pain-free ('none') status. The percent of subjects that experience a significant reduction in pain relief score (VRS) will be calculated for the verum and sham treatment sites.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  18-100 years, inclusive

          -  Diagnosis of episodic migraine with and without aura per International Headache
             Society diagnostic criteria

          -  4-14 migraine days per month

          -  Ability to provide informed consent

          -  Demonstrates no contraindication to the use of electrical nerve stimulation

          -  Capable and willing to follow all study-related procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Currently pregnant or breastfeeding, pregnant within the past 6 months or intends to
             become pregnant during the enrollment period

          -  Diagnosis of chronic migraine or other forms of primary or secondary headache
             disorders, including medication overuse headache per International Headache Society
             diagnostic criteria

          -  Any medical condition that would, in the opinion of the investigator, make the subject
             ineligible

          -  Has received botulinum toxin injections within the past 3 months

          -  Is currently implanted with an electrical and/or neurostimulator devic, including but
             not limited to cardiac pacemaker or defibrillator, vagal neurostimulator, sacral
             stimulator, bone growth stimulator, or cochlear implant

          -  Use of investigational drug/device therapy within the past 4 weeks

          -  Deemed unsuitable for enrollment in study by the investigator based on subjects'
             history or physical examination (including bleeding disorders, anticoagulant
             medications and peripheral neuropathy)

          -  No changes in preventive medications (or other medications determined to potentially
             interfere with the study) in the previous 30 days and no intent to change it during
             the study
