  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of malnutrition is common among patients with colorectal cancer. Chemotherapy
      induced side effects may impact negatively on nutrition intake thus increase the risk of
      malnutrition and serious complications for patients. Nurse-led empowering education may have
      positive effect on self-care activity of this patient group. Therefore, purpose is to test
      the effect of educational nursing intervention on self-care activity and knowledge level
      among patients with colorectal cancer during the chemotherapy. Secondary outcomes are quality
      of life and malnutrition.

      A two-arm, single center, patient blinded superiority trial with stratified randomization
      (1:1) and with repeated measures is used to measure the effectiveness of face-to-face
      education on nutrition intake related chemotherapy induced side-effects' self-care compared
      to standard care. Eligibility criteria are adult patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer
      and receiving intra venous chemotherapy treatment. Patients are recruited in one university
      hospital outpatient clinic in Finland. Experienced oncology nurse delivers the intervention
      two weeks after the first chemotherapy. Primary outcomes are activation in self-care and
      knowledge level. Secondary outcomes are quality of life and malnutrition risk measured at
      baseline (M0) and after eight (M1) and 16 weeks (M2) after the intervention.

      The study will provide knowledge of nurse-led educational intervention on self-care
      activation related to chemotherapy-induced side effects that may deteriorate nutrition intake
      among patients with colorectal cancer. The findings will contribute to patient education and
      better self-care of nutrition related side effects, thus better quality of life.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The rate of knowledge level (Knowledge test of malnutrition, nutrition impact side effects and their self-care, RasOma, Tuominen et al. 2019)</measure>
    <time_frame>From the baseline to 8 and 16 weeks after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Knowledge is seen as essential for empowerment (Rankinen et al. 2014; Castro et al. 2016). It is assumed that knowledge level is better in the intervention group compared to control group. Knowledge test was developed in the research group, which included an oncologist, a dietitian, oncology nurses and a researcher. The instrument includes 15 items (yes/no, right answer=1 point, wrong answer=0 points).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The rate of self care activation (Patient Activation Measure PAM, Insignia Health; Hibbard et al. 2004)</measure>
    <time_frame>From the baseline to 8 and 16 weeks after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Activated individuals have the knowledge, skills and confidence to self-manage their health. PAM shows how ready, willing and able an individual is to manage his or her health and healthcare.It is assumed that patients in the intervention group are more activated to self-care their side effects. The activation score is based on a 0-100 point scale. A change of 3-4 points is associated with the difference between engaging and not engaging in particular behaviors. Activation self care is rated from 1 to 4 (1= low activation level; believing the patient role is important, 2=low activation level; having the confidence and knowledge necessary to take action, 3=moderate activation level; actually taking action to maintain and improve one's health, and 4=high activation level; staying the course even in stressful situations)(InsigniaHealth 2017).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The incidence of malnutrition risk (Nutritional Risk Screening NRS2002, Kondrup et al. 2003)</measure>
    <time_frame>From the baseline to 8 and 16 weeks after hte intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Nutrition consultations have affected positively on patients' food intake and nutritional status (Kiss &amp; Krishnasamy 2014; Tu et al. 2013; Ravasco 2011, 2012). Patients with a total score of ≥3 are classified as nutritionally at risk. It is assumed that malnutrition risk is lesser in the intervention group compared to control group.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The rate of quality of life (The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Scale - Colorectal, FACT-C, Cella et al. 1993)</measure>
    <time_frame>From the baseline to 8 and 16 weeks after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The risk of malnutrition is strongly associated with QoL in cancer patients initiating chemotherapy (Calderon et al. 2018).The FACT-C questionnaire consists of 36 items on a 5-point Likert scale in four areas of well-being: physical (0-28 points), social (0-28 points), emotional (0-24 points), functional (0-28 points) and CRC subscale (0-28 points). Higher score means better QoL (34 points=low level, 34-68 points= satisfactory, 68-102 points=average and 102-136 points=high)(Ganesh et al. 2016; Goździewicz et al. 2017).</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of interruption, transfer and cancellation of the treatments</measure>
    <time_frame>From the baseline to 8 and 16 weeks after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Better nutritional status is related to better treatment effect and better well-being, which may lead to better adherence to treatment schedule (Ravasco et al. 2012). Data is collected from patients' records.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of morbidity</measure>
    <time_frame>From the baseline to 16 weeks after hte intervention</time_frame>

malnutrition, its prevalence and consequences for patients with CRC undergoing CT
side effects impairing nutrition intake during CT treatment.
prevention and self-care methods of the side effects Teach-back is used to verify participants' understanding. Empowering effect is confirmed by using active listening and asking patients' individual side effects, self-care strategies and need of additional knowledge in the beginning of the session and supporting patients' self-care methods when they have been applicable and effective. Additional knowledge of each theme is offered. To reinforce the intervention effect patients receive after the first CT a self-monitoring diary including assessment of side effects prevalence and intensity (NRS 0-10) before and after the self-care strategies. They return diaries by the 5th cycle of CT.</description>
