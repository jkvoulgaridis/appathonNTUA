    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of venetoclax when given
      together with azacitidine in treating patients with high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome that
      has come back (recurrent) or does not respond to treatment (refractory). Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as venetoclax and azacitidine, work in different ways to stop the growth
      of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping
      them from spreading.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the safety and tolerability (phase 1) and overall response rate (ORR) (phase
      2) of venetoclax in combination with azacitidine in patients with treatment-naive high-risk
      myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) with bone marrow
      excess blasts &gt; 5% and patients that are relapsed/refractory to prior hypomethylating agent
      (HMA) therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Rate of complete remission (CR). II. Rate of marrow/morphologic complete remission (mCR).
      III. Rate of hematologic improvement (HI; erythroid/platelet/neutrophil responses).

      IV. Rate of red blood cell (RBC) transfusion independence. V. Rate of platelet (PLT)
      transfusion independence. VI. Rate of cytogenetic response. VII. Rate of bone marrow blast
      response. VIII. Time to transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). IX. Duration of
      response (DOR). X. Overall survival (OS). XI. Progression-free survival (PFS). XII. Time to
      next MDS treatment (TTNT). XIII. Event-free survival (EFS).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate the effects of therapy on MDS and to identify biological markers of
      response to venetoclax and/or its combination with azacitidine.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of venetoclax followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive venetoclax orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-7 or 1-14 and azacitidine
      subcutaneously (SC) or intravenously (IV) over 15 minutes on days 1-5. Cycles repeat every
      4-8 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3-6
      months for up to 5 years.

             urine pregnancy test within 72 hours before the start of the treatment. Women of
             childbearing potential must agree to use an adequate method of contraception during
             the study and until 3 months after the last treatment

          -  Males must be surgically or biologically sterile or agree to use an adequate method of
             contraception during the study until 3 months after the last treatment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients having received any prior BCL2 inhibitor therapy

          -  Patients with MDS with IPSS risk categories low or Int-1 (overall IPSS score &lt; 1.5)
