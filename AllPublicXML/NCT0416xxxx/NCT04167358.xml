  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-comparator, global, multi-center, long-term safety study for
      evaluating safety and tolerability of linerixibat in participants with cholestatic pruritus
      in primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) who participated in a prior eligible clinical trial with
      linerixibat. Participants will be administered with 90 milligrams (mg) linerixibat orally
      twice daily. The total daily dose will not exceed 180 mg total daily dose. The effect of
      linerixibat on measures of quality of life and health-related quality of life in the study
      population will also be assessed. The duration of the study will be approximately four years
      until study end and the total duration of study participation will vary by participant
      depending upon time of entry relative to study end in their respective country. Approximately
      75 participants will be enrolled in this study.

    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of a study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/ birth defect and other situations which involve medical or any other situation according to medical or scientific judgment.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and up to 48 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PBC-40 is a participant-derived, disease specific health-related quality of life measure with data to support its validity in PBC. The PBC-40 measure is comprised of 40 questions, each scored on a scale of 1 to 5 (where 1 = least impact, 5 = greatest impact) grouped into six domains (symptoms, itch, fatigue, cognition, social, and emotional). The PBC-40 scale will be administered by appropriate site personnel, with a 7-day recall period, at the Baseline visit and at each study visit thereafter and at study end or study withdrawal.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and up to 48 months</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-3L is a standardized instrument developed by the EuroQol Group as a measure of health-related quality of life that can be used in a wide range of health conditions and treatments. The EQ-5D consists of a descriptive system and the EQ Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). The descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 3 levels: 1=no problems, 2=some problems, and 3=extreme problems. The EQ-5D-3L will be administered by site personnel at the Baseline visit and at each study visit thereafter and at study end or study withdrawal.</description>
