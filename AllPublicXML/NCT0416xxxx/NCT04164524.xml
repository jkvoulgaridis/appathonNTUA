      Patient diagnosed with Para umbilical hernia, umbilical hernia, epigastric will be selected
      for the study. Sampling technique will be systematic with every 2nd patient being exposed to
      Gentamycin spray during mesh repair. . Each procedure took 90 to 120 minutes approximately.
      All patients underwent open abdominal hernioplasty operated on elective list. After placing
      onlay polypropylene mesh fixed with 2-0 prolene and gentamicin 160 mg injection will be
      sprayed over the secured mesh. Close active suction drain will be placed in subcutaneous
      space. Finally we will close the skin with Prolene 2-0 with vertical mattress suture or
      stapler.

      Patients and methods:

      The study will be conducted at Dow University Hospital Karachi, Ojha Campusa. The subjects
      included were elective patients operated for abdominal hernias. Sample size calculated for a
      larger study with 50% frequency, and 99% confidence levels, using Openepi was found to be
      664. According to Connelly*, the sample size of pilot study should be 10% of the sample size
      of a larger pilot study. As it is a pilot study, the sample size for this study was found to
      be 66.

      We will take the informed consent before including the patient in the study. Inclusion
      criteria Following hernia operated on elective list

        -  Para umbilical hernia

        -  Umbilical hernia

        -  Epigastric hernia

      Exclusion criteria

        -  All above hernia operated in emergency

        -  Inguinal hernia

      Sampling technique will be systematic with every 2nd patient being exposed to Gentamycin
      spray during mesh repair. . Each procedure took 90 to 120 minutes approximately. All patients
      underwent open abdominal hernioplasty operated on elective list. After placing onlay
      polypropylene mesh, fixed with 2-0 prolene and gentamicin 160 mg injection will be sprayed
      over the secured mesh. Close active suction drain will be placed in subcutaneous space.
      Finally skin will be close with Prolene 2-0 with vertical mattress suture or stapler. All
      patients discharge on a day care basis with follow-ups in the OPD Out patient Department for
      any post-operative SSI Surgical site infection for a period of two weeks. Drains will be
      remove once no or less than 20 ml serosanguinous/ serous discharge in 24 hours.
