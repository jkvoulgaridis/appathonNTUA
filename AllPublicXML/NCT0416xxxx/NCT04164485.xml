  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Unilateral vocal cord paralysis (UVCP) is a clinical condition and often leads to glottic
      insufficiency. The presence of glottic insufficiency can result in poor pronunciation
      quality, vocal fatigue, shortness of breath with speaking, and in some cases, it could lead
      to unable to pronounce, dysphagia and aspiration, severely decreasing quality of life for its
      victims. This study is carried out to explore the short-term and long-term efficacy of the
      functional collagen scaffold in guiding laryngeal soft tissue regeneration.
