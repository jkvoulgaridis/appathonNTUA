  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out whether the study drug, TSR-042, followed by
      standard chemoradiotherapy (the chemotherapy drug capecitabine + radiation therapy) and
      standard surgery is an effective treatment for advanced dMMR rectal cancer. The study will
      also look at the safety of the study drug.
