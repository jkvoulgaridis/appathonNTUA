  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to determine whether workplace delivery of HIV self-testing will lead to an
      increase in uptake of HIV testing and subsequent linkage to care or prevention services among
      men in Uganda.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current coverage of HIV testing and counseling in Uganda is 60% with only 34% of these
      being men and only about 55% of males living with HIV know their status (MoH, 2016). The
      challenges with HIV testing require a new focus and new approaches to reach people with
      undiagnosed HIV infection.

      HIV self-testing (HIVST) is one such innovative approach to making testing more accessible to
      several under-served populations such as men and key populations (WHO, 2013).

      In this regard, this study seeks to determine whether providing HIVST in workplace settings
      will increase the uptake of HIV testing services among men employed in private security
      services in Uganda and improve linkage to treatment and prevention services.

      Design: Cluster randomized trial in two Ugandan districts

      Participants: Male employees of private security companies
