  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-arm, single use, single-center, randomized, 10-sequence per arm, open-label,
      crossover pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) study, designed to evaluate elements of
      abuse liability (AL) including subjective effects, plasma nicotine uptake, and physiological
      measures during and following ad libitum use of the study investigational products (IPs) by
      generally healthy subjects.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cigarette smokers and smokers who also use smokeless tobacco (SST) [e.g., snus, moist snuff]
      will be recruited into the study.

      Starting on Day -1, eligible subjects will be confined at the clinical site for 6 days.
      Subjects will be randomized to evaluate one IP in each of five separate Test Sessions, such
      that each subject will evaluate five IPs: one of two forms of the nicotine lozenge in three
      different regimens, a commercially-available nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) nicotine
      lozenge, and the subjects' usual brand (UB) cigarettes.

      Each Test Session will last for approximately 6 hours during and following IP use and will
      include collection of subjective measures, PK assessments and physiological measures.

      On Day -1, subjects will be instructed on how to use both the specific lozenge IP in their
      assigned study arm and the NRT lozenge and will have one trial use of both IP.
