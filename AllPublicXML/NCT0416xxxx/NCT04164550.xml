  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to address the limited knowledge regarding patient well-
      being and nasal function after interpolated flap repair of post-Mohs surgical defects on the
      nose. Improved understanding of the patient experience will allow providers to better counsel
      their patients pre-operatively and potentially identify patients who may benefit from
      additional interventions.

      This project is a multi-center prospective cohort study evaluating postoperative complication
      rates, quality of life outcomes, and nasal function after interpolated flap repair of
      post-Mohs surgical defects of the nose. Our primary outcome is the incidence of short-term
      complications(within 4 weeks of surgery) defined by the American College of Mohs Surgery as:
      death, bleeding requiring additional intervention, functional loss attributable to surgery,
      hospitalization for an operative complication, and surgical site infection. Secondary
      outcomes will include incidence of flap necrosis and evaluation of quality of life at 1, 4
      and 16 weeks after repair. Quality of life will be investigated using the Skin Cancer Index
      (SCI)- a skin cancer specific quality of life instrument and the Nasal Appearance and
      Functional Evaluation Questionnaire (NAFEQ). Previous literature has demonstrated that Mohs
      surgery in the outpatient setting has a very low complication rate but this literature is
      generally limited to single-institution studies or studies examining smaller repairs.
      Furthermore, it has been proven that receiving a skin cancer diagnosis is stressful and
      patient satisfaction with skin cancer surgery is related to their appearance and scarring or
      changes in appearance can decrease quality of life. Our study serves to fill the current
      literature knowledge gaps by examining repair of large defects and looking at both
      complications and quality of life outcomes. Data collection will begin pre-operatively on
      patients 18 and older who require an interpolated flap repair of a post-Mohs surgical defect.
      These patients will then be followed and asked to complete SCI and NAFEQ surveys as well as
      complication questionnaires at prescribed intervals. All data will be stored via a secure
      RedCap database.

    <description>Skin Cancer Index is 15-item, disease specific, validated, quality of life instrument with three sub-scales, Emotion, Social, Appearance. A 5-point response format is used for each question where 1 equals &quot;very much&quot; and 5 equals &quot;not at all&quot;. Standardized Scores Range from 0-100 with higher scores indicating higher quality of life. Standardized scores are obtained by summing the individual scores and dividing them by the number of items in each sub-scale.</description>

    <description>The NAFEQ is a 14-item, validated quality of life instrument with two sections. The first seven items regard nasal function and airway passage, while the following seven questions assess satisfaction with nasal appearance. Responses are rated on a 5-point Likert scale where 1 equals &quot;always&quot; or &quot;very dissatisfied&quot;, depending on the question, and 5 equals &quot;never&quot; or &quot;very satisfied&quot;. Potential scores range from 7-35 with higher scores indicating greater satisfaction with overall nasal functioning and appearance.</description>

        Patients age 18 years or greater who are capable of providing informed consent and who may
        require an interpolated flap repair of their post-Mohs surgical defect will be recruited.
        If they consent to the study, they will be asked to complete the SCI and NAFEQ
        preoperatively. Patients who subsequently undergo interpolated flap repair will be followed
        and will complete subsequent SCI and NAFEQ surveys at one week from the date of the
        interpolated flap inset, 4 weeks after flap takedown, and 16 weeks after flap takedown. The
        target enrollment is 180 patients undergoing interpolated flap repair.
