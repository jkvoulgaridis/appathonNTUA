      The purpose of this clinical study is to evaluate the clinical utility of the Nevisense in
      normal clinical practice, i.e. the potential effect of implementing Nevisense in clinical
      decision making (Human vs Human &amp; Machine) based on Nevisense measurement at time of biopsy
      decision.

      This is a multi-center, prospective, blinded clinical study designed to evaluate clinical
      utility of Nevisense in normal clinical practice, i.e. the potential effect of implementing
      Nevisense in clinical decision making (Human vs Human &amp; Machine) based on Nevisense
      measurement after biopsy decision. The study enrollment will continue until minimum of 180
      subjects are enrolled in the study. Up to 3 US university/hospital investigational sites will
      participate in this study. Biopsying clinician or the investigators from the clinical
      practices of physicians participating in the study will perform the patient and lesion
      assessment for biopsy as standard of care at the clinic.

      Study subjects will be recruited from the clinical practices of physicians participating as
      investigators in this study. Biopsying clinicians provide their assessment to whether s/he
      would have sent the lesion(s) for biopsy had s/he known the EIS information beforehand .
      Thereafter an evaluation of the suspicious lesion with the Nevisense will be performed
      followed by a biopsy of the lesion. The biopsied lesion will be subjected to histological
      analysis.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The lesion(s) meet criteria for Nevisense evaluation.

          -  Lesions that present with unclear clinical presentation to allow for clinical
             diagnosis of benign or minimally dysplastic nevus (nevi) -Thus, necessitating a
             biopsy.

          -  Lesions within Nevisense indication for use: Nevisense is indicated for use on
             cutaneous lesions with one or more clinical or historical characteristics of melanoma,
             when a dermatologist chooses to obtain additional information when considering biopsy.
             Nevisense should not be used on clinically obvious melanoma. The Nevisense result is
             one element of the overall clinical assessment. The output of Nevisense should be used
             in combination with clinical and historical signs of melanoma to obtain additional
             information prior to a decision to biopsy. Nevisense is indicated only for use on:

               -  primary skin lesions with a diameter between 2 mm and 20 mm;

               -  lesions that are accessible by the Nevisense probe;

               -  lesions where the skin is intact (i.e. non-ulcerated or non-bleeding lesions);

               -  lesions that do not contain a scar or fibrosis consistent with previous trauma;

               -  lesions not located in areas of psoriasis, eczema, acute sunburn or similar skin
                  conditions;

               -  lesions not in hair-covered areas;

               -  lesions which do not contain foreign matter;

               -  lesions not on special anatomic sites (i.e. not for use on acral skin, genitalia,
                  eyes, mucosal areas).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who fail to provide informed consent

          -  Study subjects with underlying medical disease which may alter ability to diagnose
             clinically or inhibit Nevisense from collecting data
