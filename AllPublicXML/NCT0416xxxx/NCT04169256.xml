    <textblock>
      This study is the first time into human study (FTIH) for HYR-PB21 for injection. The study
      will evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of single ascending
      and single subcutaneous dose of HYR-PB21 for injection in healthy adult volunteers.The
      results of this study are intended to be used to identify appropriate and well tolerated
      doses of HYR-PB21 for injection to be used in further studies. A comparison of PK/PD
      characteristics between HYR-PB21 for injection and EXPAREL will also be included in this
      study.
