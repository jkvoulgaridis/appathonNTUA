  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, a number of modalities have become available for the noninvasive reduction
      of adipose tissue. One of those is high intensity focused ultra sound (HIFU). The study aimed
      to discover the effect of Focused Ultrasound on localized abdominal fat size in fatty liver
      patients.

      Methods: In total, 40 participants with a body mass index (BMI) 30-40 kg/m2, whose age ranged
      between 30 and 45 years, mild to moderate fatty liver (Liver to Spleen ratio &lt; 1), and with
      waist-hip ratio (WHR) greater than 0.8 for females and greater than 0.95 for males were
      included. The participants were randomly assigned to two groups, one group received focused
      ultrasound, diet, and exercises (the study group) and the other group received exercises, and
      diet only (the control group), respectively. Measures were abdominal subcutaneous fat volume,
      abdominal visceral fat volume, and liver to spleen ratio (L/S ratio) were measured at the
      beginning of the study and 3 months later.

All subjects in both groups (A &amp; B) followed an aerobic exercise 3 to5 times/week for 12 weeks in the form of walking on treadmill for 30 minutes with moderate intensity (moderate intensity = 12-14 according to Borg Scale). The beginning period will be 15 mints and increased gradually until reaching 30 mints per time.</description>
