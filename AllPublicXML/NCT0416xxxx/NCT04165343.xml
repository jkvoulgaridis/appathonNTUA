      Evaluation of Multi-Organ Metabolism and Perfusion in Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease
      (NAFLD) by Total Body Dynamic PET Scan on EXPLORER
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      You are invited to participate in a research study that seeks to understand the effect of
      non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) on organs other than the liver. One of the most
      common organs affected in patients with NAFLD is the heart. We expect to have about 60 people
      participate in this study at UC Davis. About three-fourths (45) of the participants will be
      patients who have been diagnosed with NAFLD. The other one-fourth (15) will be healthy
      individuals with no known liver disease. These healthy subjects will allow researchers to
      compare healthy organs or body functions with those of persons with NAFLD. The healthy
      participants are called the &quot;Healthy Control&quot; group. All participants will undergo the same
      testing.

      If you agree to participate in this study, researchers will first interview you and review
      your medical records in order to document your medical (clinical) history. You will also have
      a physical examination by a doctor and a blood test. You will then undergo a series of
      imaging tests to determine the status of your liver, heart and other internal organs.

      All participants will have a PET/CT Scan (Positron Emission Tomography), and an MRI (Magnetic
      Resonance Imaging). All participants will also have an Electrocardiogram and an
      Echocardiogram. All Electrocardiogram tests are the same, but there are two types of
      Echocardiogram tests. One is like a standard ultra-sound imaging of your heart. The other is
      a &quot;Stress Cardio&quot; that will require you to increase your heart rate on a treadmill before the
      ultra-sound test. Your study doctor will determine which test you have.

    <time_frame>3 years total study period. FDG PET scan study is for 60 minutes.</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome is to determine heart (myocardial) glucose uptake rate (K1) determined by dynamic FDG PET scan. This will be compared between those with liver fibrosis stage 3-4 with those with lower stage of fibrosis stage 0-2 as determined by magnetic resonance elastography.</description>

    <description>Positron Emission Tomography (PET): Your blood sugar level will be checked by a finger stick before the PET scan. A small amount of radioactive &quot;tracer&quot; (approximately 0.5 teaspoons) will be injected into a vein in your arm before the imaging test. You will be asked to lay on your back on the EXPLORER scanner platform with both of your arms over the head during the duration of the test. A small amount of blood (1 tablespoon) will be collected after the test. This test will last for up to one (1) hour. This is a research test. Although the results may be available it cannot be used for clinical care. If any incidental findings are noted, it will be reported to you.</description>

    <description>MRI will be performed that can measure both the liver stiffness or fibrosis by a method called MR elastography (MRE) and the amount of fat deposited in the liver by MR proton density fat fraction (MR-PDFF). You will be asked to lay on your back on the scanner platform with both of your arms over the head during the duration of the test. MRE and MRI-PDFF are Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) approved tests and the results will be available to you. This test will last up to one (1) hour.</description>

    <description>You will have baseline echocardiogram images and electrocardiogram (ECG) taken and will be asked to walk on a treadmill, which will increase in elevation and speed every 3 minutes until you can go no longer. This usually takes 9 to 12 minutes. Immediately after exercise, echocardiogram images and ECG will be taken again. The total time you will be in the stress lab including prep time and recovery is about 60 minutes. Wear comfortable or exercise clothing and walking/running shoes. You will be asked to not eat or drink (except for water) for 4 hours prior to the time of your test. Please drink water the day of the test so you are not dehydrated. This is an FDA approved test and the results will be available to you.</description>
