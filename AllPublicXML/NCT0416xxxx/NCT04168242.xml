  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In gynecologic cancers, many common chemotherapy agents can lead to chemotherapy-induced
      alopecia. Currently scalp cooling is the most well studied preventive measure. However, its
      acceptability and its impact on patients' QOL in Asian population is unclear.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dynamic scalp cooling system prevents alopecia by inducing vasoconstriction leading to a
      reduction of scalp blood flow, thus reducing the delivery of cytotoxic drugs to the hair
      follicles and reducing follicular metabolic activities. One recent meta-analysis included 10
      studies showed that the efficacy was 43% in general.
