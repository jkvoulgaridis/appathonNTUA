  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study design: Phase II, multicenter, randomized, sham-controlled, single-blind, parallel arm,
      multicenter study to test the hypothesis that home-based exergames is not inferior to
      home-based cognitive rehabilitation delivered by a software application (app) for mobile
      devices and both interventions are superior to a placebo-analogue cognitive intervention in
      improving cognitive function and reducing cognitive-motor interference in people with
      multiple sclerosis (MS).

      Procedures: Participants will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive an 8-week home-based
      training with exergames (intervention of interest) or adaptive COGNI-TRAcK (comparator
      intervention) or sham COGNI-TRAcK (placebo-analogue intervention). Study assessment will be
      done at study enrolment (baseline), at the end of the 8-week intervention period (immediate
      post-training, Week 8) and after 16 weeks from randomization (post-training follow-up, Week
      16).

      Investigational interventions:

        1. Exergames: home-based repetition of several games delivered by the Nintendo © Wii
           Balance Board, a commercial off-the-shelf video game console for re-training of balance
           and postural strategies

        2. Adaptive COGNI-TRAcK: adaptive (i.e. automatic adjustment of tasks difficulty) working
           memory training delivered by a customized application software for mobile devices to
           self-administer at-home

        3. Sham COGNI-TRAcK: non-adaptive (i.e. constant difficulty level) working memory training
           delivered by the same app as afore described

      Primary endpoint: changes at the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), a measure of sustained
      attention and information processing speed.

      Secondary endpoint: changes at the BICAMS (z-scores), a brief, practical and universal
      assessment tool for cognitive impairment in MS.

      Additional endpoints: magnitude of cognitive-motor interference estimated as dual-task cost
      of balance and walking.

      Sample size estimation: The investigators estimated a pre-defined 8-point non-inferiority
      margin, based on a significant effect of the COGNI-TRAcK in inducing an about 8-point mean
      increase at SDMT score (with respect to a sham intervention). Accordingly, 35 participants
      per arm are required to ensure, with an approximately 85%-power level, that the lower limit
      of a one-side 95% confidence interval will be above the pre-defined non-inferiority margin.
      Therefore, considering also a drop-out rate of 25%, a total of 132 subjects should be
      enrolled.

    <description>The training protocol will be delivered by the Nintendo ® Wii balance board and consists of repetitions of several games selected from the &quot;Wii Fit Plus&quot; package (http:// www.wiifit.com/training/balance-games.html). Each game starts at basic level, and when a certain score is reached, patients is automatically transferred to a more advanced level. Patients will be encouraged to play the next game if they have a level progress; otherwise, 10 minutes will be allocated for each game. During the first 4 weeks of training, patients will be allowed to play only &quot;Zazen&quot; (sitting position), &quot;Table Tilt&quot; and &quot;Ski Slalom&quot;; thereafter they will add the remaining games &quot;Penguin Slide&quot;, &quot;Tightrope Walk&quot;, &quot;Balance Bubble&quot; and &quot;Soccer Heading&quot;.</description>

    <description>The training protocol will be delivered by a dedicated app for mobile devices (mobile phone or tablet). The app implements three different types of exercises (each one executed for about 10 min a session), consisting in a visuo-spatial working memory task, an &quot;operation&quot; N-back task and a &quot;dual&quot; N-back task.
The adaptive training is structured so that the exercises difficulty level will increase by one step every time the user will perform a correct exercise. On the other hand, the difficulty level will decrease by one step if the exercise is incorrect for three times in a row.</description>

    <description>The training protocol will be delivered by a dedicated app for mobile devices (mobile phone or tablet) as previously described for adaptive COGNI-TRAcK. However, the non-adaptive training (placebo-analogue intervention) consists in an algorithm implementing two low difficulty levels alternating every day regardless of the user's performance.</description>
