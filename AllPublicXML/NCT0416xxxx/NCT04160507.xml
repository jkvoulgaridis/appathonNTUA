  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Duke ApoL1 Nephropathy Biorepository aims to address needs within non-diabetic kidney
      failure research by utilizing existing and, when necessary, developing new infrastructure to
      support the consent of patients and the collection of dedicated samples for ApoL1 Nephropathy
      biorepository.

      The mutations in ApoL1 gene that are strongly associated with kidney disease are only present
      in individuals of recent African ancestry (i.e., black people). Caucasians do not have these
      ApoL1 mutations nor the associated kidney disease. Therefore, majority of subjects recruited
      for this study will be self-identified African Americans, Afro-Caribbean and other black
      individual. Study subjects will include individuals with end stage kidney disease and those
      without any clinical evidence of kidney disease.

      Additionally, healthy black adults with no known history of kidney disease will be recruited
      as controls in this study because they are the only group that can fill this role.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The risk of end stage kidney failure among African Americans is 4 times that of Caucasian
      Americans. This excess risk of kidney failure is largely attributable to mutations in
      apolipoprotein L1 gene. While 10-15% of African Americans in the United States possess kidney
      disease-associated ApoL1 mutations, nearly 40% of African Americans on dialysis have these
      mutations. There are significant gaps in the understanding of the pathophysiology of
      ApoL1-nephropathy. Only some of the people with ApoL1 mutations develop kidney failure. The
      pathways that link ApoL1 mutations with end stage kidney failure are not understood. Because
      kidney biopsy is generally obtained from patients with evidence of kidney disease—whose
      kidneys have experienced significant damage and sclerosis—access to the relevant kidney cells
      is very limited. However, recent advancements in biomedical research have made it possible to
      develop kidney-like cells from inducible pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) which were derived
      from blood cells of individuals. This innovative technique will allow us to generate
      iPSC-derived cells from the blood of individuals who have developed ApoL1-nephropathy for the
      purpose studying them in research lab so as to decipher the cellular mechanism of their
      kidney failure.

      Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) will be isolated from the blood using standard
      Ficoll-Paque technique. A fraction of the PBMCs will be cryopreserved and stored at for
      future analysis. We will submit a separate IRB protocol for use of future unspecified
      research with these samples. The remaining fraction of PBMCs will be used to generate
      inducible pluripotentent stem cells (iPSCs). These iPSC would be differentiated into kidney
      cells which could then be further studied. While no plans exist to immortalize any of these
      cell lines, the consent form does allow for creating immortalized cell lines in the future.
      Residual plasma will also be stored separately for additional analysis. Kidney cells shed
      into urine would also be a potential source of iPSCs.

        Mutation in ApoL1 gene is associated with increased risk of non-diabetic kidney disease in
        individuals of recent African descent—i.e., only black people are affected. Therefore,
        black adult cases with non-diabetic nephropathy or healthy controls aged 18 years or older
        will be recruited for consent into the DANB.

        Caucasians do not have these ApoL1 mutations nor the associated kidney disease. Therefore,
        majority of subjects recruited for this study will be self-identified African Americans,
        Afro-Caribbean and other black individual. Study subjects will include individuals at
        various stages of kidney disease and those without any clinical evidence of kidney disease.
