  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this proposed study is to test the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of
      worksite wellness program designed to reduce worker stress (job and personal) and improve
      cardiovascular disease among long-term care workers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a cluster randomized control trial (n=164) delivered in four long-term care
      worksites. Aim 1 is to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of the Worksite Heart Health
      Improvement Project-PLUS (WHHIP-PLUS) on workers' composite Life's Simple 7 scores.
      Hypothesis: workers exposed to the WHHIP-PLUS will report improved adherence to heart healthy
      behaviors and a reduction in cardiovascular disease risk factors measured by a composite
      Life's Simple 7 score at 6 months and 12 months compared to those exposed to education-only
      control. Aim 2 is to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of the WHHIP-PLUS on workers' stress
      levels. Hypothesis: workers exposed to the WHHIP-PLUS will report decreased stress as
      measured by stress scales at the same 2 time-points compared to those exposed to
      education-only control. Aim 3 is to evaluate the feasibility of integrating the WHHIP-PLUS
      with long-term care workers over time. Feasibility will be based on evidence of delivery,
      receipt, and enactment of the intervention.
