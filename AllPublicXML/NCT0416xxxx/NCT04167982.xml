  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to compare a new, continuous illumination and short Incubation time
      regimen of 5-aminolevulinic acid photodynamic therapy (painless ALA- PDT) to low-dose and
      conventional dose of oral isotretinoin for treatment of moderate or severe acne vulgaris. The
      hypothesis is that the painless ALA- PDT will be equally or more efficacious as oral
      isotretinoin, and taking effect more quickly with less adverse effect.

    <description>The pain will be assessed using Visual Analogue Scale (NRS) with a score range of 0-10. The higher the score, the greater the pain, with 0 being no pain and 10 being the most unbearable pain. Pain will be measured at different time points during and after every treatment (including immediately, 1st minute, 3rd minute, 5th minute, 7th minute, 10th minute and 2nd hour, 12th hour, 24th hour and 48th hour after treatment.</description>

    <description>The painless photodynamic therapy group underwent narrow-band light-emitting diode (LED) irradiation (630 nm; 150 J/cm2) after applying 5% 5-aminolevulinic acid(ALA) cream for 30min. A repeat treatment was administered once weekly for a maximum of 5 times. Blood samples, urine routine, blood biochemistry and electrocardiogram were performed before treatment and after treatment.</description>

    <description>Patients in the conventional-dose isotretinoin group were given oral isotretinoin 0.5 mg/kg daily for 6 months, and the cumulative dose was 90 mg/kg. Time for subsequent visit: once every two weeks during the 1st and 2nd months, monthly during 3rd to 6th months. Blood samples, urine routine, blood biochemistry and electrocardiogram were performed before treatment and 2nd , 6th months after treatment.</description>
