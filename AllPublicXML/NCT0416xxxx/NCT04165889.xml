  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Drug Related Problem (DRP) is defined as an event that may potentially affect the health
      outcomes in the patients. DRPs can occur at all stages of the medication usage process
      starting from prescribing (included medication error and inappropriate prescription) to
      dispensing stage. Lack of follow-ups and reassessment of therapeutic outcomes may also
      contribute to DRPs. Pharmaceutical care is a co-operative activity in concert with other
      health care professionals and offered directly to the patient for improved quality use of
      medicines. Pharmaceutical care identifies and resolves actual or potential DRPs.

      In our clinical practice, during the patient admission in internal medicine unit, a
      medication reconciliation process was conducted according to a validated protocol. The first
      step consists of getting the Best Possible Medication History (BPMH), defined as the most
      comprehensive list of all medications taken by the patient. The second step consists of
      comparing the BPMH with admission prescription made by the physician in charge. During
      pharmacist interview, pharmacist discussed about medication adherence and knowledge. The
      third step consists of characterizing, solving and documenting DRPs.

      During the patient's hospitalization, the pharmacist participates at the medication
      prescription revision. At the discharge of hospitalization, a pharmaceutical standardised
      interview is carried out during which the pharmacist explains the modifications of treatments
      to the patient. During this interview, the hospital pharmacist updates the latest treatment
      changes. For patient with more than 65 years old and long-term affection (or patient with
      more than 75 years old with or without long-term affection) and 5 medications, the hospital
      pharmacist write a medication discharge report (MDR) to patient, community pharmacist and
      general practitioner.

      For each medication, the investigators collected its name, dosage, dosage forms and frequency
      of administration. For each DRP, the investigators collected the type of DRP and the drug
      classes (according to anatomical therapeutic chemical classification system).

      For each MDR, the investigators collected number of medication, number and type of DRP
      including inappropriate prescription.
