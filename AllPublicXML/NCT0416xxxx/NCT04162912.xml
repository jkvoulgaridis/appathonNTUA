  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposed study is designed to test the effects of motivational interviewing (MI) in
      increasing the uptake of ACP behaviours among patients with palliative care needs. A
      randomised controlled trial with repeated blinded outcome assessment will be conducted to
      assess the effects of a MI-tailored ACP (MI-ACP) programme on palliative care patients
      recruited from the outpatient palliative care clinics and home palliative care services of
      two hospitals. A total of 204 patients will be recruited and randomly assigned to
      experimental and control groups. The patients in the experimental group will receive a MI-ACP
      programme facilitated by a trained nurse, whereas the patients in the control group will
      receive usual care. Primary outcome is the behavioural changes in ACP. Secondary outcomes are
      perceived stress, decisional conflict and quality of life. Study outcomes will be measured at
      baseline, 1 month and 3 months after enrolment.

    <measure>Advance Care Planning Behaviour</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 month and 3 months follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Behaviour changes in ACP behaviours measured using a questionnaire. It included 4 items about different ACP behavior on a 5-point Likert scale. The higher score means the higher level of readiness for the behaviours.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Decisional conflict</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 month and 3 months follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Decisional conflict regarding end-of-life care is measured by the SURE test, a questionnaire with 4-item on knowledge and support for medical decision making. The higher score means the less decisional conflict.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived stress</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 month and 3 months follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Perceived stress is measured by a 10-item Perceived Stress Scale, a questionnaire, using a 5-point Likert scale. The higher score means the higher level of stress.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 month and 3 months follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life is measured by using a 23-item modified Quality of Life Concerns in the End of Life Questionnaire. The 23 items are rated on a 4-point Likert scale. The higher score means the better quality of life.</description>
