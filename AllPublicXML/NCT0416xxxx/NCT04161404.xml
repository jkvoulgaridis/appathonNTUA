      This study is a phase 1, open label, randomized, three-way crossover, single dose, oral-
      administration of Andrographis paniculata and Metformin in healthy volunteers under fasting
      condition. The study will demonstrate the pharmacokinetics profile and pharmacodynamic
      through metabolic pathway analysis for Andrographis paniculata and Metformin.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, open label, randomized, three period, crossover, single dose oral
      administration of Andrographis Paniculata 1000mg, 2000mg and Metformin 1000mg clinical trial
      in healthy volunteers under fasting condition. Approximately 18 healthy volunteers will be
      enrolled into this study.

      The healthy volunteers will be screened for inclusion and exclusion criteria. Eligible
      subjects will be enrolled into either Metformin 1000mg tablet, Andrographis Paniculata 1000mg
      or 2000mg capsule in a ratio of 1:1:1 in period 1 for single dose oral administration.
      Subjects will then undergo a washout period of at least 7 days. After the washout period,
      subjects will crossover over to another investigational product according to the
      randomization sequence.

      Subjects will fast overnight prior to dosing. The volunteers will be admitted to Clinical
      Investigation Center ward at 7 am in the morning and will confine in air-conditioning
      environment with beds and chairs. The means during the stay at CIC ward will be provided to
      the subjects. The dosing will be performed at 8am. A series of plasma will be collected at 0,
      0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 24 hours post-dose. Urine samples will be
      collected at 0, 0-4 hours, 4-8 hours and 8-12 hours.

      A safety follow-up call will be made to subjects to record any adverse events that occurred
      post-dosing within 1 week.

    <description>Pre-dose and post-dose samples will be analysed using LCMSMS. Normalization, log-transformation and center scaling will then apply to batches of chromatograms. Global metabolomics analyses will be performed to identify significant endogenous metabolites between post-dose and pre-dose samples using T-Test, Principal Component Analysis, Partial Least Square Discriminant Analysis. Annotations of significant compounds will be perform using METLIN database. The significant compounds will lead to prediction of relevant metabolomic pathway from Human Metabolome Database/ Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genome pathway for Andrographis paniculata.</description>
