  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Survival rates for cancer are increasing, resulting in more young adult cancer survivors
      living with lingering side effects. Physical activity has been shown to improve the quality
      and length of life in young adult cancer survivors; yet, few are active enough, and little is
      currently being done to promote physical activity in this population. Therefore, the purpose
      of this 3-arm pilot randomized controlled trial is to explore the feasibility and
      acceptability of a behavioural support intervention aimed at promoting physical activity
      among young adult cancer survivors, which will be delivered either in-person or via
      videoconferencing.

    <measure>Health-related quality of life: RAND 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36; Ware &amp; Sherbourne, 1992)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (week 0), post-intervention (week 12), post-intervention follow-up (week 24)</time_frame>
    <description>Change in participants' self-reported health-related quality of life across baseline (week 0), post-intervention (week 12) and post-intervention follow-up (week 24). The SF-36 measures eight dimensions: physical functioning, bodily pain, role limitations due to physical health problems, role limitations due to personal or emotional problems, emotional well-being, social functioning, energy/fatigue, and general health perceptions. It also includes a single item that provides an indication of perceived change in health. Each item is scored on a 0 to 100 scale, with higher scores representing a more favourable health state.</description>

    <measure>Positive and negative affect: Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS-SF; Watson, Clark &amp; Tellegen, 1998)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (week 0), post-intervention (week 12), post-intervention follow-up (week 24)</time_frame>
    <description>Change in participants' self-reported positive and negative affect across baseline (week 0), post-intervention (week 12) and post-intervention follow-up (week 24). Each item is scored on a scale from 1 ('Very slightly or not at all') to 5 ('Extremely'). Items in the positive scale are averaged together to create a Positive Affect Score, and items in the negative scale are averaged together to create a Negative Affect Score. Higher positive and negative scores represent higher positive and negative affect, respectively.</description>

    <description>Change in participants self-reported depressive symptoms across baseline (week 0), post-intervention (week 12) and post-intervention follow-up (week 24). Each item is scored on a 0 ('Not at all') to 3 ('Nearly every day') scale with higher scores representing greater severity of depressive symptoms.</description>

    <description>Change in participants self-reported anxiety symptoms across baseline (week 0), post-intervention (week 12) and post-intervention follow-up (week 24). Each item is scored on a 0 ('Not at all') to 3 ('Nearly every day') scale, with higher scores representing greater severity of anxiety symptoms.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (week 0), post-intervention (week 12), post-intervention follow-up (week 24)</time_frame>
    <description>Change in participants' self-reported perceptions of cancer impact from baseline (week 0), post-intervention (week 12) and post-intervention follow-up (week 24). Each item is scored on a scale from 0 ('Strongly disagree') to 4 ('Strongly agree'), with higher scores representing greater impact of cancer.</description>

    <measure>Motivation for physical activity: Behavioural Regulation in Exercise Questionnaire-3 (BREQ-3; Markland &amp; Tobin, 2004)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (week 0), post-intervention (week 12), post-intervention follow-up (week 24)</time_frame>
    <description>Change in participants' self-reported motivation for physical activity across baseline (week 0), post-intervention (week 12) and post-intervention follow-up (week 24). This measure taps six behavioural regulations in the physical activity context: amotivation, external, introjected, identified, integrated, and intrinsic motivation. Each item is scored on a scale from 0 ('Not true for me') to 4 ('Very true for me'), with higher scores reflecting greater amotivation, external, introjected, identified, integrated, and intrinsic motivation for physical activity.</description>

    <description>Change in participants self-reported psychological need satisfaction in relation to physical activity across baseline (week 0), post-intervention (week 12) and post-intervention follow-up (week 24). The PNSE measures perceptions of competence, autonomy and relatedness in relation to physical activity. Each item is scored on a scale from 1 ('False') to 6 ('True'), with higher scores representing greater perceived competence, autonomy and relatedness.</description>
