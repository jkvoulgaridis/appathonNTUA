  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Even in patients with successful return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), outcome after
      cardiac arrest remains poor. The overall in-hospital survival rate widely varies both
      worldwide and across communities, from 1 to 4 folds according to circumstances of arrest and
      post-resuscitation interventions. Several studies have already shown that early interventions
      performed after ROSC, such as treatment of the cause, targeted temperature management,
      optimal hemodynamic management and extra-corporeal life support in selected patients, could
      improve the outcome in post-cardiac arrest patients. However, the decision process regarding
      the allocation of these resources, in parallel with the management of patients' proxies,
      remains a complex challenge for physicians facing these situations. Consequently, several
      prediction models and scores have been developed in order to stratify the risk of unfavorable
      outcome and to discriminate the best candidates for post-resuscitation interventions.
      Overall, several scores exist, but external validation are lacking and direct comparisons are
      needed to assess relative interest of scoring systems. Indeed, establishing the optimal
      scoring system is crucial, for optimal treatment allocation and appropriate information to
      relatives.

        This is an observational, prospective, multicentric prognostic study. The study period is 1
        year, and we plan to include 597 patients in 21 ICUs in France.

        For all patients included, medical history, clinical data, paraclinical results and outcome
        (at hospital discharge and at 3 months, including modified Rankin score) will be
        prospectively collected by local investigator, according to an electronical CRF.
