  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) has high prevalence and mortality in China,
      which become a severe challenge for public health. The molecular imaging technology has been
      developed for intra-operative visualization and precise resection of the tumors. The imaging
      probe possess high affinity to the tumor specific targets. Among the tumor related proteins,
      EGFR is located on the cell membrane and over expresses in more than 50% ESCC which has been
      used as an ideal target for molecular imaging.

      Cetuximab is an EGFR targeting antibody for anti cancer therapy. When labeled with an
      commercial available fluorescence dye IRDye800, cetuximab has been used as molecular imaging
      probe in clinical trials for surgical navigation of cancers including head and neck squamous
      cell cancers and gliomas. Previous studies shown high safety when using this probe and
      excellence sensitivity for cancer detection, which bring great promise in translational
      medicine.

      This is a single-center prospective sequential trial. It is the first attempt to apply
      cetuximab-IRDye800 probe in ESCC surgery. This probe will be produced under clinical Good
      Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) conditions. The ESCC patients will be recruited with strict
      criteria.Patients population is planned to be 40 cases between18 and 65 years old, without
      gender limit. The patients will be divided into four groups : control group without probe
      administration, 1% dose group (1% of therapeutic cetuximab dose; 2.5 Mg/m2) and 10% dose
      groups (10%of therapeutic cetuximab dose ;25mg/m2) and 25% dose group (25%of therapeutic
      cetuximab dose; 62.5mg/m2), 10 cases are sequential assigned to each group. After informed
      consent, patients will receive a systemic infusion of the study drug 2 days before surgery.

      Primary (safety and efficiency) and secondary endpoints (tissue EGFR expression) will be
      recorded. Preoperative management and surgical procedures will been performed according to
      conventional protocols. Intra-operative imaging of the surgical field will be performed in
      real time at 2 time points: before and post tumor resection. The postoperative specimens will
      be subjected to pathological analysis including correlation study of fluorescence signal and
      tumor tissue in pathology slice.

      A protocol for managing any allergic reaction related to systemic infusion of cetuximab has
      been established. The patient's vital signs and ECG will be closely monitored post probe
      administration. The blood, liver and kidney, coagulation function and cardiotoxicity will be
      evaluated before and post surgery.

      This clinical trial is anticipated to validate the concept that intra-operative fluorescent
      imaging of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma with cetuximab-IRDye800 can facilitate the
      demarcation of tumor boundary and identification of metastatic lymph nodes and testify its
      safety.
