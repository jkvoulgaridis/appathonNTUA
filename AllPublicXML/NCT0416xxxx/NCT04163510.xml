  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Reading is a fundamental skill that is required for children's successful participation in
      school. Later in life, individuals who were unable to attain adequate reading levels during
      childhood face a cascade of deficits and social marginalization. By the end of third grade,
      predictions are already made about the probability of high school graduation, employability,
      dependence on welfare, incarceration, and decreased health outcomes. With 64% of fourth
      graders and 66% of eighth graders nationwide reading below grade level, illiteracy and low
      literacy constitute a silent epidemic that poses incredibly deleterious financial and human
      costs to individuals and to society. With low readers existing disproportionately in
      low-income communities, the children of low-income parents constitute a vulnerable sector of
      our society, at risk of poor literacy development and ultimately facing the above-mentioned
      disadvantages later in life. The purpose of this study is to empower low-income parents of
      elementary school children who are reading below grade level with strategies and tools to
      incorporate reading into their home routines; to inspire parents to approach reading with
      their children with an attitude of fun, positivity, and enthusiasm; to inculcate positive
      feelings towards reading among parents and children; and ultimately to increase the frequency
      of participants' home reading participation. The study will consist of a nine-week program
      including game playing, recipe following, neighborhood walks, trips to the library, and
      coaching on establishing reading resources and routines at home. Ten sets of parents will be
      recruited to participate in this study. Qualitative data will be extracted from field notes
      taken during intervention sessions and from parent interviews. It is anticipated that study
      results will provide information to occupational therapists to help parents better support
      their children's literacy development.

    <textblock>
      Reading is fundamental to children's successful participation in school and a prerequisite to
      success in a myriad of adult occupations later in life. A student who is reading below grade
      level at the end of third grade is four times more likely to drop out of high school, which
      frequently leads to a cascade of deficits including unemployment, reduced wages, poverty,
      incarceration, and poor health outcomes. 64% of fourth graders and 66% of eighth graders
      nationwide are currently reading below grade level, with low readers existing
      disproportionately in low-income communities. Parental engagement in literacy activities at
      home with their children has decreased in recent years, thus rendering children less prepared
      to succeed at school. The purpose of this study is to assess a nine-week literacy support
      program in a low-income community, targeting the parents of elementary school children who
      are reading below grade level. The program intends to equip parents with strategies to
      incorporate literacy participation with their children into their home routines, thus
      increasing their children's exposure to print, reinforcing academic skills at home, and
      providing opportunities for positive associations with literacy. Participants will establish
      times in their daily schedules for reading, identify locations in their homes to organize and
      store reading materials, and experience a variety of pleasurable ways to engage in reading,
      including game playing, recipe following, neighborhood walks, and trips to the library. Ten
      sets of parents will be recruited to participate in this study. Qualitative data will be
      extracted from field notes taken during intervention sessions and from parent interviews. It
      is anticipated that study results will provide information to occupational therapists to help
      parents better support their children's literacy development.

    <description>The Family Reading Occupations Questionnaire is a 14-item, 5 minute questionnaire with 4 open-ended questions and 10 Likert scale questions. The scale ranges from scores of 10 to 50 with lower scores indicating better outcomes. The questionnaire allows parents to identify the type of reading activities they engage their children with and how frequently.</description>

    <description>A group of parents and their children will participate in this single arm, pre-/post-intervention study. This 10-week study will include 10 sets of parents of low-reading elementary school children, recruited from Harlem Grown Community Center. Intervention will be implemented in a 9-week period, with data collection during the first intervention week and one week post-intervention. Three large-group sessions will be held in a central location (at Harlem Grown Community Center), to build community and rapport among researchers and participants. Six individual sessions will take place in the participants' homes, to customize reading strategies and routines to each family's home setting and personal interests. The reading program will help parents identify strategies to establish literacy routines with their children, and to engage with them in enjoyable literacy activities that promote skill building while reducing negative feelings associated with reading.</description>
