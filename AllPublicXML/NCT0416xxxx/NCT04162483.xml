    <textblock>
      The objective of this retrospective study is to describe in real-life settings the clinical
      practice, utilization and the treated population outcomes at 1-year (12-16 months) follow-up
      at selected, representative centers in France.

      This proposed ATLAS FR study will be a retrospective review conducted to expand our knowledge
      of the clinical outcomes in subjects treated in France between 01 February 2017 and 01 March
      2018.

      This will provide a comprehensive data set that is specifically representative of the Atlas
      stent use in France.
