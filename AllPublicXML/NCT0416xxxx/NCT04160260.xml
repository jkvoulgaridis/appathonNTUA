    <description>Clinical success is defined as sufficient resolution of CABP signs and symptoms such that no additional antibacterial therapy is required for the current infection. Clinical response will be determined by the judgement of the investigator at the subject's End of Treatment evaluation and will be based on the resolution of the following signs and symptoms:
