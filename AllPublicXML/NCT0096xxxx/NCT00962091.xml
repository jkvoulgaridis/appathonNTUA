    <textblock>
      The purposes of this study were to estimate the relative (Rel) bioavailability (BA) of an
      oral solution (OS) formulation of alisertib in reference to a powder-in-capsule (PIC)
      formulation, to characterize the effect of food on the single-dose pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      alisertib OS and enteric-coated tablets (ECT), to characterize the multiple-dose safety,
      tolerability, and steady-state PK of alisertib administered as an OS, and to characterize the
      multiple-dose safety and tolerability of alisertib administered as an ECT.

      The drug being tested in this study is called alisertib (MLN8237). Alisertib is being tested
      to treat people who have advanced solid tumors. This study will look at the relative
      bioavailability (BA) (Part A), food effect and multiple-dose PK and safety of the oral
      solution (OS) (Part B) and food effect and safety of the enteric-coated tablet (ECT)
      formulation (Part C).

      The study enrolled 53 patients (pts). Prior to initiation of Part A, 4 participants were
      enrolled in a dose escalation cohort. Participants in the study received:

      • Alisertib 15 mg to 50 mg orally In the first 2 cycles of all 3 parts of the study, a single
      dose of alisertib was administered on Day 1 (PIC or OS in Part A [n=19 pts]; OS, in the fed
      or fasted state, in Part B [n=6 pts]; ECT, in the fed or fasted state, in Part C [n=24 pts]),
      In Part A, participants then continued on the PIC formulation at 40 mg BID for 7 days (Days 3
      - 9). In Part B, participants continued on the OS formulation at a calculated dose
      administered BID for 7 days (Days 3 - 9). In Part C, the ECT formulation was continued at 40
      mg BID for 7 days (Days 3 - 9); however, dose escalation to 50 mg BID was permitted after
      Cycle 1 based on tolerability and safety findings in the prior cycles. All participants took
      doses at a gap of 12 hours each day for 7 days followed by a 14-day rest period in a 21-days
      cycle for the remaining cycles.

      This multi-center trial was conducted in the United States. The overall time to participate
      in this study was 30 months. Participants made multiple visits to the clinic, and final
      assessments were performed approximately 30 days after last dose of study drug.

    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) A serious is any experience that suggests a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect or precaution that: results in death, is life-threatening, required in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is medically significant.</description>

    <description>Laboratory AEs reported at an incidence of at least 5% overall in the following system organ classes (SOCs) are reported: blood and lymphatic system disorders, metabolism and nutrition disorders, investigations, and hepatobiliary disorders. Abnormal laboratory value were assessed as an AE if the value leads to discontinuation or delay in treatment, dose modification, therapeutic intervention, or is considered by the investigator to be a clinically significant change from baseline. A treatment--emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug.</description>

    <description>Best overall response is defined as the number of participants with Complete Response (CR) + Partial Response (PR) as assessed by the investigator according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria 1.1 for target lesions and assessed by CT or MRI. CR is defined as disappearance of all target lesions and PR is defined as 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions. Stable Disease (SD) is defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for Progressive Disease, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started.</description>

        <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) A serious is any experience that suggests a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect or precaution that: results in death, is life-threatening, required in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is medically significant.</description>

        <title>Best Overall Response (CR+PR) Based on Investigator's Assessment According to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1</title>
        <description>Best overall response is defined as the number of participants with Complete Response (CR) + Partial Response (PR) as assessed by the investigator according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria 1.1 for target lesions and assessed by CT or MRI. CR is defined as disappearance of all target lesions and PR is defined as 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions. Stable Disease (SD) is defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for Progressive Disease, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started.</description>
        <time_frame>At the completion of Cycle 2 and every 2 cycles (every 6 weeks) until Cycle 6 (18 weeks). After Cycle 6 (18 weeks), CT/MRI scans (with contrast) were to be performed every 3 cycles (9 weeks) until PD was documented.</time_frame>
