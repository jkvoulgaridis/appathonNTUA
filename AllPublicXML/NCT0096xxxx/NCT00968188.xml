  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop an empirically validated, scientifically-based HIV
      and STI prevention program that can be delivered online to young men who have sex with men
      (YMSM) who were recently tested for HIV.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Presently, there are a limited number of proven HIV interventions culturally tailored to
      young men who have sex with men (YMSM). This is alarming because Men who have sex with men
      comprise 68% of HIV/AIDS diagnoses in men, despite representing a much smaller proportion of
      the population. In addition, MSM are reporting more sexual risk behavior than in previous
      years and there is significant concern that HIV infection rates may once again be on the rise
      after more than a decade of remaining relatively stable.

      The Internet is a viable intervention avenue because of it's high percentage of accessibility
      and usage, especially among young adults. Moreover, it might hold a strong appeal for YMSM,
      since its anonymity confers a sense of perceived safety against stigma surrounding HIV
      prevention information.

      The purpose of this study is to compare two different versions of an online HIV/STI
      intervention for YMSM. This study is part of an overall program of research designed to
      understand and prevent HIV infection among high-risk youth. Participation in this study will
      help us to determine the usefulness of an tailored and interactive HIV Internet-assisted
      intervention.
