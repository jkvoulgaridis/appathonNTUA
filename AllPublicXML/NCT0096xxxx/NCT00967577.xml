  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate changes in tumor blood flow and disease response to
      the investigation agent, 177Lu-J591.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      177Lu-J591 is made up of two compounds called J591 and 177Lutetium (177Lu) that are joined
      together by a connecting molecule called &quot;DOTA&quot;. J591 is a monoclonal antibody, or a type of
      protein. 177Lu is a radioactive molecule that is being tested for the possible treatment of
      cancer when joined to monoclonal antibodies. J591 attaches to a protein called prostate
      specific membrane antigen (PSMA) found in the body. PSMA is mostly found in normal and
      cancerous prostate cells. In addition, however, PSMA has also been found on the vasculature
      (blood vessels) that supply multiple types of cancer including colorectal, kidney, bladder,
      head and neck, breast, non-small cell lung, pancreas, ovary, esophagus and gliomas.

      We hope that 177Lu-J591 will seek out blood vessels that supply these tumors and deliver a
      dose of radiation (from the 177Lu molecule) to the areas of cancer, without affecting target
      blood vessel that are not associated with the cancer.

      Zirconium-89 (89Zr) is a radioactive tracer that allows special scans to be performed prior
      to administration of the study drug to determine where the antibody goes in the body and to
      screen the tumor's blood vessels to see if they attract J591. Again, DOTA is used to join the
      radioactive material to J591. 89Zr-J591 is not being given to treat cancer.

    <measure>Change in tumor perfusion based on changes in cellularity as assessed using Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI)</measure>

  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in response rate using Response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) Criteria</measure>
    <time_frame>Objective response will be evaluated from changes in baseline to Day 99 and repeated every 3 months until radiographic progression of disease.</time_frame>
    <description>Through RECIST criteria, objective response will be evaluated by taking into account the measurement of the longest diameter only for all target lesions on CT scans as well as normalization of serum tumor markers (if applicable).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the number of subjects who achieve Progression Free Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 58 after administration with 177Lu-J591 and repeated every 3 months until radiographic progression of disease</time_frame>
    <description>Progression free survival is the length of time during and after the treatment of a disease, such as cancer, that a patient lives with the disease but it does not get worse. This will be calculated from the time of treatment (day of 177Lu-J591 infusion) until radiographic progression or death.</description>
