  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of BI
      6727 in Asian cancer patients, and to provide safety data in terms of drug-related adverse
      events.

    <description>Primary objective for this trial was to identify the MTD of volasertib for 2 dosing schedules. The MTD was defined as the highest volasertib dose studied for which the incidence of DLT was less than 2/6 patients. The MTD was defined on the basis of DLTs observed during the first treatment course only. In this outcome measure the percentage of participants with DLTs in cycle 1 is presented.</description>
