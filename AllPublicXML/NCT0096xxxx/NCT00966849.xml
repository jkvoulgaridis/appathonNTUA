      The purpose of this study is to determine whether cash transfers (conditional and
      unconditional) can improve health and social outcomes amongst children living in vulnerable
      households in Manicaland, eastern Zimbabwe. The study hypotheses are:

        1. Cash transfers will increase the percentage of vulnerable children aged 0-4 years with a
           birth certificate.

        2. Cash transfers will increase the percentage of vulnerable children aged 0-4 years with
           up-to-date vaccinations.

        3. Cash transfers will increase the percentage of vulnerable children aged 6-12 years
           attending primary school at least 80% of days per month.

      Cash transfer programmes provide cash to families caring for orphans and vulnerable children
      (OVC). Conditional cash transfer programmes require families to comply with conditions
      relating to child health, education and general social welfare in order to receive the cash.

      We plan to evaluate conditional and unconditional cash transfer programmes in Manicaland,
      eastern Zimbabwe - a predominantly rural area with high HIV prevalence. We will employ a
      cluster randomised controlled trial design. Ten existing study sites that represent four
      socio-economic strata - subsistence farming areas, roadside trading settlements, large-scale
      agricultural estates (tea estates and forestry estates) and small towns - have been
      identified as part of a separate, ongoing cohort study. Each site has been divided into 3
      smaller, socio-economically homogenous clusters providing a total of 30 clusters that will
      form ten matched triplets. One site from each matched triplet will then be randomly assigned
      to one of three study arms - conditional cash transfer arm, unconditional cash transfer arm,
      and standard social services arm.

      Data on the primary endpoints will be collected using a rapid, baseline census of all
      households in the study clusters. This will take approximately 3 months to complete. The cash
      transfer programmes will commence, in the appropriate intervention arms, shortly after
      completion of baseline data collection. A similar follow-up census will take place two years
      after initiation of the intervention.

      The cash transfer interventions will be delivered by a local NGO called Diocese of Mutare
      Community Care Programme (DOMCCP), who work in partnership with Catholic Relief Services
      Zimbabwe. The baseline and follow-up censuses will be managed and conducted by the Biomedical
      Research and Training Institute Zimbabwe (BRTI) and Imperial College London. Data will also
      be collected from children in a sample of households from each of the study clusters as part
      of the ongoing Manicaland Cohort Study, which is a parallel study conducted by BRTI and
      Imperial College London. This data will also be used to evaluate the cash transfer
      programmes.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        A household will be defined as vulnerable and thereby eligible for inclusion in the
        programme if there are children &lt;18 years resident in the household at baseline AND

          -  household is in the poorest quintile of households (20%) at baseline OR

          -  household contains one or more orphans at baseline OR

          -  the household head is under 18 years of age at baseline OR

          -  household contains a chronically ill member OR

          -  household contains a disabled member

        A household will be defined as individuals that live within the same homestead and eat from
        the same pot.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Households already receiving cash transfers for orphans or vulnerable children (OVC) will
        not be eligible to enroll in the pilot programme.

        During the trial, households that do not qualify at baseline but whose conditions later
        change such that they become eligible to participate in the pilot will not be able to
        enroll.
