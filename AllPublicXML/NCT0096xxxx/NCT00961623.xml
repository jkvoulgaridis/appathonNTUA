      The diagnosis and monitoring of clinically-significant pathologies of the knee remains
      challenging, and it is unknown why only some injuries become painful or respond to surgical
      intervention. The limitations of diagnostic magnetic resonance imaging result in arthroscopy
      that is not always beneficial. Elucidation of biochemical pathways underlying pain in this
      condition may aid patient selection for surgery and provide pharmacotherapeutic targets.
      Cytokines or a novel yet uncharacterized protein may be involved in pain following meniscus
      injury and diagnostic cytokine assay may help physicians differentiate patients that may
      benefit from arthroscopy from those that may not. Additionally, evaluating post-operative
      biochemical profiles may provide a method of monitoring surgical outcome and understanding
      post-operative continuation or remission of pain.

      Lavage of the operative and contralateral knee for comparison are performed under anesthesia
      prior to arthroscopy by the infusion of 10cc sterile saline into the knee joint followed by
      the immediate withdrawal into the syringe, and storage at -80°C in a tube containing a
      protease inhibitor. At 12wk post-operative a 10cc lavage is performed on the knee that
      underwent surgery. Clinical findings for each sample are quantified using gold-standard
      symptom severity questionnaires.

      The specimens will be analyzed for 31 potential biomarkers using a multiplexed immunoassay
      panel, the results of which will be compared with pre- and post-operative clinical findings
      and radiographic imaging. Plans do not currently include microarray analysis, but this may be
      later included.

        Our study population includes adult males and females presenting to a single orthopaedic
        surgeon for arthroscopic management of acute or chronic knee pain due to a mechanical
        derangement discernable by MRI.

        Subjects are selected using a probability sampling scheme, such that every knee arthroscopy
        patient that presents, without exclusionary criteria described above, is offered enrollment
        in the study. To date, approximately 85% of patients consent to enrollment, with no
        apparent sampling bias. Additionally, we are using repeated measures (matched random
        sampling) to evaluate the role of mediators of knee pain, and to assess the potential of
        utilizing expression profiles to monitor surgical outcome. For example, clinical indicators
        and biomarker expression profiles taken peri-operatively are compared to those obtained 12
        weeks post-operatively in the same subject.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        •Adult patients with knee pain (acute or chronic) who had failed conservative treatment and
        elected for arthroscopic management. Indications for surgery included the presence of
        mechanical symptoms on history, a physical examination positive for McMurray's maneuver or
        joint line tenderness or both, absence of severe joint space narrowing on plain
        radiography, and the presence of grade III signal changes on MRI in an anatomic location
        consistent with the history and physical examination.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Less than 18 years old.

          -  Recent (within three months) intra-articular corticosteroid injection and past or
             current medical history of autoimmune disease (i.e. rheumatoid arthritis).

          -  In addition, no patients involved in a worker's compensation claim or personal injury
             litigation were enrolled in the study.
