  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine whether citalopram is a useful, well-tolerated, and safe
      treatment for children and adolescents ages 7 to 18 years with functional abdominal pain. The
      study hypothesis is that citalopram will be better than placebo in producing clinical
      improvement and reductions in abdominal pain. It is also hypothesized that citalopram and
      placebo will not differ in terms of safety and tolerability.

    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine the relative efficacy, tolerability, and safety of the
      citalopram in the treatment of pediatric functional recurrent abdominal pain (FAP) in
      children and adolescents ages 7 to 18 years, inclusive. The goal is to recruit and randomize
      100 subjects to citalopram or placebo. Secondary aims include to determine if citalopram is
      superior to placebo in reducing comorbid anxiety and depressive symptoms in children and
      adolescents with FAP, to explore potential mediators (i.e., anxiety, depression) and
      moderators (e.g., age, gender, referral from primary or specialty care) of treatment
      response, and to explore the durability and tolerability of citalopram treatment 18 weeks
      following completion of the double-blind treatment phase with the goal of generating data
      useful to the development of future studies. The study is novel in conducting recruitment,
      assessment, and treatment in traditional medical settings. Limited exclusion criteria and the
      delivery of study assessments and interventions within routine practice settings provide for
      considerably greater external validity than the typical efficacy study.

      Study hypotheses:

        1. Citalopram will be superior to placebo in producing clinical improvement and reductions
           in abdominal pain.

        2. Citalopram and placebo will not differ in tolerability or safety.

    <measure>Clinical Global Impression Scale - Improvement (CGI-I) Will be Used to Assess Overall Global Illness Improvement. CGI-I Scores of 1 (Very Much Improved) or 2 (Much Improved) Indicate an Acceptable Treatment Response.</measure>
    <time_frame>The CGI will be completed at weeks 2, 4, and 8</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical Global Impression Scale - Improvement (CGI-I) is a 7-point scale, with lower values being more favorable, used to assess overall global illness improvement. The CGI is a clinician-completed measure, with values ranging from 1 (very much improved), 2 (much improved), 3 (minimally improved), 4 (no change), 5 (minimally worse), 6 (much worse), to 7 (very much worse). CGI-I scores of 1 (very much improved) or 2 (much improved) were considered to indicate an acceptable treatment response. A global measure of functional status was chosen as a primary outcome due to the broad array of symptomatology seen in pediatric RAP and the ambiguous relationship between functional status and symptoms of pain, anxiety, and depression in pediatric RAP. The CGI-I is a dichotomous primary outcome measure of global clinical improvement with clinical response be defined as a CGI-I score of 1 or 2 for at least two consecutive weeks.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Global Impression Scale - Severity (CGI-S)</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 0, 2, 4, and 8</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical Global Impression Scale - Severity (CGI-S) is a 7-point scale is a clinician-completed measure that requires the clinician to rate the severity of the patient's illness at the time of assessment relative to the clinician's past experience with patients who have the same diagnosis. Considering total clinical experience, a patient is assessed on severity of illness at the time of rating, with values ranging from 1 (normal, not at all ill), 2 (borderline ill), 3 (mildly ill), 4 (moderately ill), 5 (markedly ill), 6 (severely ill), to 7 (extremely ill).</description>

    <measure>Abdominal Pain Index (API)</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 0, 2, 4, and 8</time_frame>
    <description>The API is a well-validated and reliable measure of abdominal pain assessing the frequency, duration, and intensity of abdominal pain consisting of five items assessing the frequency, duration, and intensity of abdominal pain experienced during the prior 2 weeks. Two of the items are scored from 0 to 5, one is scaled 0 to 8, and two are scaled 0 to 10, with lower scores considered to be better than higher scores. Item scores are standardized using Z-scores and then summed to yield an index of abdominal pain that has been sensitive to change in previous epidemiological and treatment studies of FAP. Alpha reliability ranged from 0.80 to 0.93. The API will be a continuous primary outcome measure of abdominal pain.</description>

    <measure>Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale (PARS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 0, 2, 4, and 8</time_frame>
    <description>Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale (PARS) is a clinician administered measure of anxiety in children and adolescents. The PARS is comprised of a 50-item symptom checklist used to determine the presence or absence of specific anxiety symptoms during the prior week and 7 severity/impairment items, each scored from 0 to 5 . The the score on the 7 items allows the clinician to rate symptom severity and associated impairment on a range from 0 to 35, with higher scores reflecting greater symptom severity and associated impairment. The PARS is characterized by high interrater reliability (ICC = 0.97), adequate internal consistency (α = 0.64), and fair test-retest reliability (ICC = 0.55). There is preliminary support for convergent and divergent validity, and the PARS has demonstrated sensitivity to treatment effects in previously conducted clinical trials.</description>

    <measure>Children's Depression Rating Scale - Revised (CDRS-R)</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 0, 2, 4, and 8</time_frame>
    <description>Children's Depression Rating Scale - Revised (CDRS-R) is a clinician administered measure of depression in children and adolescents and provides data necessary to diagnose depressive disorder and rate the severity of depressive symptoms over time. The CDRS-R is composed of 17 items, most rated on a 1 to 7 scale, with a minimum score of 17 and a maximum of 113. Higher scores reflect greater depression severity, with scores of 40 and above generally considered to be reflective of a depressive diagnosis.</description>

    <time_frame>Weeks 0, 2, 4, and 8</time_frame>
    <description>Children's Global Assessment Scale (C-GAS) is an interview-based adaptation of the Global Assessment Scale developed to assess child and adolescent functioning during a specified time period. Scores range from one to 100, with scores of 70 or below reflecting abnormally low functioning and higher scores reflecting better functioning. The C-GAS has demonstrated reliability, as well as discriminant and concurrent validity. A CGAS score of &lt; 70 will be a requirement at study entry.</description>

        <title>Clinical Global Impression Scale - Improvement (CGI-I) Will be Used to Assess Overall Global Illness Improvement. CGI-I Scores of 1 (Very Much Improved) or 2 (Much Improved) Indicate an Acceptable Treatment Response.</title>
        <description>Clinical Global Impression Scale - Improvement (CGI-I) is a 7-point scale, with lower values being more favorable, used to assess overall global illness improvement. The CGI is a clinician-completed measure, with values ranging from 1 (very much improved), 2 (much improved), 3 (minimally improved), 4 (no change), 5 (minimally worse), 6 (much worse), to 7 (very much worse). CGI-I scores of 1 (very much improved) or 2 (much improved) were considered to indicate an acceptable treatment response. A global measure of functional status was chosen as a primary outcome due to the broad array of symptomatology seen in pediatric RAP and the ambiguous relationship between functional status and symptoms of pain, anxiety, and depression in pediatric RAP. The CGI-I is a dichotomous primary outcome measure of global clinical improvement with clinical response be defined as a CGI-I score of 1 or 2 for at least two consecutive weeks.</description>

        <description>The API is a well-validated and reliable measure of abdominal pain assessing the frequency, duration, and intensity of abdominal pain consisting of five items assessing the frequency, duration, and intensity of abdominal pain experienced during the prior 2 weeks. Two of the items are scored from 0 to 5, one is scaled 0 to 8, and two are scaled 0 to 10, with lower scores considered to be better than higher scores. Item scores are standardized using Z-scores and then summed to yield an index of abdominal pain that has been sensitive to change in previous epidemiological and treatment studies of FAP. Alpha reliability ranged from 0.80 to 0.93. The API will be a continuous primary outcome measure of abdominal pain.</description>

        <title>Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale (PARS)</title>
        <description>Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale (PARS) is a clinician administered measure of anxiety in children and adolescents. The PARS is comprised of a 50-item symptom checklist used to determine the presence or absence of specific anxiety symptoms during the prior week and 7 severity/impairment items, each scored from 0 to 5 . The the score on the 7 items allows the clinician to rate symptom severity and associated impairment on a range from 0 to 35, with higher scores reflecting greater symptom severity and associated impairment. The PARS is characterized by high interrater reliability (ICC = 0.97), adequate internal consistency (α = 0.64), and fair test-retest reliability (ICC = 0.55). There is preliminary support for convergent and divergent validity, and the PARS has demonstrated sensitivity to treatment effects in previously conducted clinical trials.</description>

        <description>Children's Depression Rating Scale - Revised (CDRS-R) is a clinician administered measure of depression in children and adolescents and provides data necessary to diagnose depressive disorder and rate the severity of depressive symptoms over time. The CDRS-R is composed of 17 items, most rated on a 1 to 7 scale, with a minimum score of 17 and a maximum of 113. Higher scores reflect greater depression severity, with scores of 40 and above generally considered to be reflective of a depressive diagnosis.</description>
