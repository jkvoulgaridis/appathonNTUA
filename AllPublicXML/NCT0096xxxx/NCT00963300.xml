      RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures, such as MRI, may help measure oxygen levels in tumor cells.
      It may also help doctors predict a patient's response to treatment and help plan the best
      treatment.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well MRI works in assessing hypoxia in patients
      with localized prostate cancer undergoing stereotactic body radiation therapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To characterize the status of global hypoxia within the prostate before stereotactic
           body radiotherapy (SBRT) as assessed by blood-oxygen-level-dependent and
           tissue-oxygen-level-dependent MRI.

        -  To characterize tumor vasculature and metabolism within the prostate before SBRT as
           assessed by dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging,
           respectively.

        -  Correlate prostate and normal tissue hypoxia before SBRT with clinical outcomes
           (toxicity and biochemical [PSA] control) after SBRT.

      OUTLINE: Within 1-3 weeks before beginning stereotactic body radiotherapy, patients undergo
      T2-weighted anatomic MRI, magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging,
      blood-oxygen-level-dependent and tissue-oxygen-level-dependent MRI, and dynamic
      contrast-enhanced MRI.
