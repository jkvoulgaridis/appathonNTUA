    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the influence of two superstructure materials
      Porcelain Fused to Metal (PFM) and PEEK on peri- implant soft and hard tissue reaction
      clinically.

      Nowadays the use of dental implants for restoring missing teeth has gained a wide acceptance,
      due to its high success rate.

      Dental implants differ from natural teeth in transmission of functional loads to the bone,
      where natural teeth and their periodontal ligaments provide proprioception, early detection
      of occlusal loads and have a shock-absorbing function. Sensitivity and mobility of natural
      teeth cannot be duplicated in osseointegrated implants,1 therefore most of the forces are
      concentrated at the crest of the ridge leading to different living reaction including bone
      resorption and subsequent implant loss.

      Minimizing the occlusal loads on osseointegrated implants through selection of a new
      superstructure material that can absorb part of this excessive force could be believed to be
      a determining factor in the long-term success of an implant treatment program.

      Many restorative materials are used nowadays for construction of final restoration of implant
      supported superstructures including porcelain fused to metal (PFM), all ceramic, zirconia,
      hybrid ceramics, and polyetheretherketone (PEEK). PFM restorations are still considered as
      the gold standard because of their excellent biocompatibility, consistent esthetics, superior
      strength, and marginal adaptation. Recently, the use of new resilient superstructure material
      like PEEK-based restoration on implant prosthetics could modify the occlusal forces with
      subsequent cushioning during function.

    <description>Visual analogue scales will be used before the treatment and at the follow-ups to record and evaluate subjective patient's perceptions including the appraisal of function eating, esthetics, sense, speech, and self-esteem. The patients were asked to mark their subjective perception in each category on a horizontal line (100 mm in length), 1 mm (the minimum score) corresponded to 1% of satisfaction and 100 mm (the maximum score) corresponded to 100% of satisfaction.</description>

    <description>Intraoral X-rays will be made using the long-cone parallel technique for the two groups. All radiographs were digitized for evaluation of the bone levels (BL) at different time points. The marginal BL was determined by measuring the distance between the implant shoulder (reference) and the most coronal bone-to implant contact. These measurements were made by two independent examiners mesially and distally of the implants and in 0.1-mm increments</description>

    <description>Gingival index of the two groups will be assessed by the Loe &amp; Silness gingival index as follow:
Grade 0: (Normal gingival) Natural coral pink gingival.
Grade 1: (Mild inflammation) Slight change in color, slight edema. No bleeding on probing.
Grade 2: (Moderate inflammation) Redness, edema and glazing. Bleeding on probing.
Grade 3: (Severe inflammation) Marked redness and edema. Tendency to spontaneous bleeding. Ulceration.</description>

    <description>Bleeding index of the two groups will be assessed by Modified sulcus bleeding index11 With a periodontal probe (PCB 12; Hu-Friedy, Leimen, Germany) inserted about 1mm into the peri-implant epithelium, the sulcus was scratched over its facial and oral surface as follow:
Grade 0: No bleeding.
Grade 1: Isolated points of bleeding.
Grade 2: The blood forms a confluence line at the epithelium.
Grade 3: Massive bleeding/spontaneous bleeding.</description>

    <description>The main concern of dental implants is their lack of elasticity, therefore with the use of PFM, all ceramic or zirconia crowns; the load is directly transferred to bone. That is why up till now researchers are in quest of different materials to enhance soft and hard tissue reaction around implant supported restorations. Recently the use of PEEK as a final restoration on dental implants has wide acceptance, due to its excellent biocompatibility and exceptional physical and chemical properties regarding toughness, hardness and elasticity. In term of load cushioning capacity of the prosthetic elements, PEEK has a comparable modulus of elasticity (4GPa) to that of bone (4.2GPa). Thus, the bone could allow bone stimulation favoring its remodeling without overloading</description>
