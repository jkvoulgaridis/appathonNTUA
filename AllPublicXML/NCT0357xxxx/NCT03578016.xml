  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:The quality of attachment is greatly influenced by parental sensitivity.
      Attachment based interventions are designed to promote parental sensitivity, to change
      parental mental representations and to improve understanding of the developmental needs of
      the child. Very few studies have investigated the effect of attachment-based interventions on
      psychiatric symptoms in children. Targeting parental sensitivity and the parent-child
      interaction might have an important impact on psychiatric symptoms in a clinical sample of
      children referred to child psychiatric services.

      Objectives: The primary objective is to investigate whether Circle of Security-Parenting
      (COS-P) has an effect on parental sensitivity in parents of children referred to child
      psychiatric services. The secondary objectives are to investigate the effect on children's
      behavioral and emotional symptoms and the parental stress and reflective functioning after 10
      weeks of intervention and at the 24 week follow-up. The study is also exploring the effect of
      parental attachment style, parental stress and parental psychopathology on the effect of the
      intervention.

      Methods: The trial will include 128 families of children (age 3-8 years) who are referred to
      child psychiatric services in a randomized and controlled design. Included families will be
      randomized to COS-P+ Treatment as Usual (TAU) or TAU only.

      Perspectives: Considering the important impact of the quality of the parent-child
      relationship on the child's well-being, it is essential to target it in interventions and to
      investigate the relation with psychiatric symptoms. Generally there is a lack of
      interventions targeting parental sensitivity in psychiatric child populations. Working with
      the parents on the child-parent relation, might have an important impact on their children's
      current psychiatric symptoms and could additionally prevent future psychopathology.
