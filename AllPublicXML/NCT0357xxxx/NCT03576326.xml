  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase II stratified randomized prevention trial will assess the efficacy of a behavioral
      economic theory-based financial incentive drawing program versus a control regimen to promote
      early childhood caries (ECC) preventive health behaviors (toothbrushing performance) for
      young children of predominantly Latino parents/caregivers in Early Head Start (EHS) and day
      care center programs.
