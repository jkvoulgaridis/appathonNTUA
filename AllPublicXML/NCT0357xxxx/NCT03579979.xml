    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is a prospective, multicenter, self-controlled clinical study. In order
      to meet the requirements of this plan, 130 breast cancer patients need the sentinel lymph
      node biopsy with novel near-infarred fluorescence imaging system produced by Beijing digital
      precision medical technology co., LTD. The fluorescence molecular imaging of indocyanine
      green (ICG) on imaging detection and the control group, routine medical using methylene blue
      test .The safety and efficacy of fluorescence and staining in sentinel lymph node biopsy of
      breast cancer were compared.

    <textblock>
      This trial was a prospective, multicenter, and self controlled clinical trial. The subjects
      who were in line with this scheme were detected by fluorimetry and staining, and the primary
      effectiveness evaluation index, secondary effectiveness evaluation index and safety
      evaluation index were established during the operation. Record evaluation. At present, in the
      clinic for sentinel lymph node biopsy of breast cancer, routine medical treatment is a blue
      staining method. A large number of clinical data show that the number of blue staining
      methods was 1-2.4, and the number of fluorescence detection is 2-3.7. Therefore, choosing a
      self controlled clinical trial can increase the number of sentinel lymph node detection.

    <description>During the operation, with the fluorescent molecular imaging instrument, the imaging agent (indocyanine green) is illuminated by the probe distance to the tissue surface 10-30cm, and is excited to produce the near infrared fluorescence of the specific wavelength (the human eye is not visible). The system uses a photoelectric coupler to collect the light of the specific spectrum, and the image is collected by the method of correction. The operation was performed to achieve real-time display of lesions.
The injection points were selected subcutaneously around the areola or the periphery of the tumor. 1% methylene blue 0.5ml was injected at each point, with a total of 2-3 points. Within 5 minutes, 2.5mg/ml ICG 0.5ml was injected at each point, with a total of 2-3 points.</description>
