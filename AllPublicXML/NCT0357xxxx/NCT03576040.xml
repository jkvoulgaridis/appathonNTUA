  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuroendocrine tumors (NET) are a network of rare tumors with common embryological origin.
      Functional imaging plays a major role in the extension assessment and tumor characterization
      of NETs. SPECT/CT with 111In-pentetreotide is the recommended test when tumors are well
      differentiated (grade G1 or G2). It has a real interest in diagnosis, in therapeutic
      decision-making (in particular by cold somatostatin analogues or in PRRT) and in the
      systematic follow-up of patients. Nevertheless, SPECT/CT procedure makes for a relatively
      long review. In addition, scintigraphy has a lower spatial resolution than PET technology and
      remains of limited interest for signal quantification.

      However, the ability to locate and quantitatively measure the absorption of
      radiopharmaceuticals in the target tissues is a major challenge in oncology for the
      characterization of the disease.

      Recent developments in radiopharmacy have made it possible to target NETs in PET imaging
      through the use of somatostatin analogues coupled with positron emitters, called 68Ga-DOTA
      peptides. The diagnostic performance of 68Ga-DOTApeptide PET/CT appears to be superior to
      SPECT/CT with 111In-pentetreotide. A marketing authorization has thus recently been issued in
      France for the use of 68Ga-DOTATOC.

      Historically, the recommended quantification method in PET was based on the instantaneous
      measurement in static acquisition (3D) of the maximum of the standardized uptake value
      (SUVmax). This approach has the disadvantage to measure the signal at a time &quot;t&quot; for a single
      voxel of the image. Dynamic acquisition methods (4D) have been proposed to extract a
      radiotracer absorption coefficient (Ki) for a lesion. Several studies have demonstrated the
      superiority of Ki versus SUVmax in 18FDG PET/CT for the diagnostic management, therapeutic
      evaluation and prognosis of various solid cancers.

      However, no work has validated this approach in PET / CT at 68Ga-DOTATOC as part of the
      prognostic evaluation of NETs.

      The objective of the study is to evaluate the prognostic value of the tumor absorption
      coefficient Ki resulting from a 4D whole-body dynamic acquisition in PET / CT at 68Ga-DOTATOC
      in patients with well-differentiated NETs grade I or II according to the WHO classification

    <intervention_name>Whole Body Dynamic 68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT</intervention_name>
    <description>68Ga-DOTATOC PET-CT will be performed in the nuclear medicine department of the University Hospital of Brest on a Biograph mCT S64 machine (Siemens medical, Erlangen, Germany) &quot;Time of Flight&quot; system after intravenous injection of 150MBq of 68Ga-DOTATOC. In the usual conditions for performing this exam, the patient must remain at a strict rest for 60 minutes following the injection of the tracer and before a static 3D acquisition. For this protocol, a complementary 4D dynamic acquisition (15-60 minutes post-injection) will be performed during this usual rest period.</description>
