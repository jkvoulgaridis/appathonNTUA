      This study is a multicentered and non-interventional prospective cohort study. Study centers
      shall be the institutions where the examinations, adopted in the ACO diagnostic criteria9)
      from The Japanese Respiratory Society, are performed at least once a year as a part of their
      regular practice. Physicians participating in the study will consecutively register by means
      of central registration outpatients who have the characteristics of COPD in the ACO
      diagnostic criteria9) from The Japanese Respiratory Society, and who have been confirmed to
      satisfy the inclusion criteria whereas not violating the exclusion criteria.

      will collect data including the patients' results from medical examinations by using the ACO
      diagnostic criteria, at each time point (on the registration, after 1 year, and after 2
      years). Electronic case report forms completed by participating physicians and questionnaires
      completed by patients will be used to collect data.
