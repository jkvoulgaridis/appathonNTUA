               2. Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB)

               3. All-cause dementia, possible or probable Alzheimer's disease (AD)

               4. Frontotemporal degeneration spectrum disorders, including possible or probable:

             i. Behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia

             ii. Progressive supranuclear palsy

             iii. Corticobasal degeneration

             e. Vascular dementia, including post-stroke dementia multi-infarct dementia and/or
             subcortical ischemic vascular dementia (SIVD)

          4. Has a designated study partner/caregiver

          5. Can come to the clinic for study visits with a study partner/caregiver

          6. If the subject is female, she must not be pregnant or breastfeeding. She must also be
             of non-childbearing potential (defined as either surgically sterilized or at least 1

             contraception or be abstinent.

          7. If the subject is taking an antipsychotic medication at the time of screening, the
             antipsychotic medication must be discontinued 2 weeks or 5 half-lives (whichever is
             longer)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          3. Has current evidence of an unstable neurological, cardiovascular, respiratory,
             gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, hematologic, or other medical disorder, including
             cancer or malignancies that, in the judgment of the Investigator, would jeopardize the
             safe participation of the subject in the study or significantly interfere with the
             conduct or interpretation of the study

          4. Has a known personal or family history of long QT syndrome or family history of sudden
             cardiac death

               1. intracranial mass lesion

               2. vascular malformation

               3. evidence of &gt;4 hemosiderin deposits

          6. The urine drug screen result at Visit 1 (Screening) indicates the presence of
             amphetamine/methamphetamine, barbiturates, cocaine, or phencyclidine (PCP). Subjects
             who test positive for amphetamines and who have a valid prescription may be retested
             if they agree to abstain from the medication for the length of their participation in
             the study. The presence of benzodiazepines, marijuana (THC), or opiates does not
             necessarily exclude the subject from the study, as assessed by the Investigator in
             consultation with the Medical Monitor.

          7. Has previously been enrolled in any prior clinical study with pimavanserin or is
             currently taking pimavanserinIs judged by the Investigator or the Medical Monitor to
             be inappropriate for the study for any reason

        Additional inclusion/exclusion criteria apply. Patients will be evaluated at screening to
        ensure that all criteria for study participation are met. Patients may be excluded from the
        study based on these assessments (and specifically, if it is determined that their baseline
        health and psychiatric condition do not meet all pre-specified entry criteria).
