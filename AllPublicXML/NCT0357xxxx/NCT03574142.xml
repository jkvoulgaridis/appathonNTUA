  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the safety, tolerability, and PK of single and
      multiple doses of Epanova in healthy male and female Chinese subjects and to allow comparison
      of these parameters with the Western population studied to date.

    <textblock>
      This is a single centre, open-label, single- and multiple-dose, PK study in Chinese healthy
      subjects. Approximately 14 subjects will receive a single oral dose of Epanova 4 g followed
      by a 72-hour washout period, and then receive Epanova 4 g orally once daily for 14
      consecutive days. Subjects will undergo screening evaluations to determine eligibility within
      4 weeks (28 days) prior to the first dose of investigational product (IP). Subjects will be
      admitted to the clinical pharmacology unit approximately 48 hours prior to the first dosing
      (Day -2) and will stay at the unit until at least 72 hours (Day 20) after their last dose of
      IP (Day 17). Blood samples will be collected for PK analyses. Subjects will be monitored
      closely for adverse events throughout the study.

             haematological, gastrointestinal, endocrine, immunologic, dermatologic, neurological,
             or psychiatric disease.

          4. Has a positive urine drug/alcohol breath testing at the screening visit or on Day -2.

          5. Habitual users of drug(s) of abuse.

          6. Has tested positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B (including
             surface antigen [HbsAg] positive healthy carrier), hepatitis C antibodies (HCV), or
             syphilis.

          7. Has used fish oil, other EPA and/or DHA containing supplements within 60 days of
             admission to the clinic.

          8. Has a known sensitivity or allergy to soybeans, fish, and/or shellfish.

          9. Has had a history of hypersensitivity or idiosyncratic reaction to compounds related
             to Epanova.
