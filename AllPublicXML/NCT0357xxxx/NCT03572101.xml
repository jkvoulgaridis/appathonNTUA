  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This observational study will gather outcome and experience data of patients living with
      advanced colorectal cancer and their caregivers. The primary objective is to measure how
      quality of life in this population changes over time (before, during, and after a palliative
      pathway becomes the new standard of care in Calgary, Alberta, Canada).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      1. Background and Rationale: Using palliative care early, e.g. concurrent with
           disease-modifying therapies or from the time of diagnosis of advanced cancer, enhances
           quality of life for patients and their families and is associated with lower healthcare
           resource costs at end-of-life. Despite the evidence that early use of palliative care
           benefits patients and the healthcare system, most patients are referred late in their
           disease (e.g. &lt;2 months from death). Our health services struggle to systematically
           provide early and integrated palliative care, to meet the needs of the cancer
           population. In Calgary, Alberta, typical of other Canadian centres, 60% of patients with
           metastatic gastrointestinal (GI) cancers have a late (&lt; 3 months from end of life) or no
           palliative care referral (i.e. no contact with any palliative care service/provider).
           This lack of timely and early palliative care is associated with aggressive cancer care
           in 50% of patients, as compared to 25% in those who received earlier palliative care.

           A Knowledge to Action (KTA) initiative called Palliative Care Early and Systematic
           (PaCES) has identified gaps in providing early and systematic palliative care to
           advanced colorectal cancer (aCRC) patients. To address these gaps, a comprehensive care
           pathway delivering early, systematic palliative care to aCRC patients in Alberta, Canada
           will be developed as a new standard of care. The pathway will be implemented first in
           Calgary, Alberta, with Edmonton, Alberta as control site, to allow for testing and
           refinement before dissemination to Edmonton and across Alberta. As a result of the
           development of this new care pathway, over the next 3 years changes are anticipated in
           the delivery of care for aCRC patients.

        2. Research question and objectives: This observational study will gather outcome and
           experience data of patients living with advanced colorectal cancer and their caregivers.
           The primary objective is to measure how quality of life in this population changes over
           time (before, during, and after a palliative pathway is introduced as the new standard
           of care in Calgary, Alberta).

        3. Methods: An observational cohort study with interrupted time series (ITS) data
           collection will allow us to assess secular trends, determine if there is evidence of
           serial dependencies in the monthly measures, and to compare measures following system
           changes in Calgary while observing the same measures over the same time periods in
           Edmonton. The primary outcome will be how does EQ5D5L (a standardized instrument for use
           as a measure of health outcome) change over time for patients and caregivers.
           Questionnaires will be administered to patients monthly for 10 months then every 3
           months until the end of the study or death. Questionnaires for the caregiver will be at
           enrollment, 1 month, then every 3 months until the end of the study.

    <description>The EQ-5D-5L tool will be used to characterize changes in patients' and caregivers' quality of life scores (index score and individual dimension scores) over time (i.e. as patients near end of life) and between cohorts (i.e. patients/caregivers in Calgary vs. patients/caregivers in Edmonton).</description>

    <measure>Edmonton Symptom Assessment System-Revised (ESAS-r) symptoms (pain, tiredness, drowsiness, nausea, lack of appetite, depression, anxiety, shortness of breath, and wellbeing)</measure>
    <time_frame>Patients: at enrollment and then monthly for 10 months, then every 3 months thereafter until death or end of data collection (31Dec2020), whichever came first.</time_frame>
    <description>The ESAS-r measures pain, tiredness, drowsiness, nausea, appetite, shortness of breath, depression, anxiety, and well-being, rated on a 0-10 scale of severity where 0 represents absence of the symptom and 10 represents the worst possible severity. The ESAS-r will be used to characterize the most common patient-reported symptoms, as well as changes in symptom scores (individual symptom scores as well as total score out of 90) over time (i.e. as patients near end of life), and between cohorts (i.e. patients in Calgary vs. patients in Edmonton).</description>

    <description>The Preparedness for Caregiving Scale is a tool that assesses caregiver readiness for providing care to another person, including preparedness for taking care of physical needs, emotional needs, accessing services, handling the stress of caregiving, making caregiving activities pleasant, handling emergencies, accessing health care system information, and overall preparedness. Items are rated on a 0-4 scale where 0 represents Not at all prepared and 4 represents Very well prepared. The Preparedness for Caregiving Scale will be used to characterize changes in caregivers' preparedness for caregiving (total score out of 32) over time (i.e. as patients near end of life) and between cohorts (i.e. caregivers in Calgary vs. caregivers in Edmonton).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Degree of engagement in advance care planning conversations</measure>
    <time_frame>Patients: at enrollment and then monthly for 10 months, then annually until death or end of data collection (31Dec2020), whichever came first.</time_frame>
    <description>The &quot;My Conversations&quot; tool is a questionnaire that assesses engagement in advance care planning conversations. The number of advance care planning conversation elements that a patient reports having discussed with a healthcare provider is scored on a 0-4 scale where 0 means no conversation elements and 4 means all conversation elements were discussed. The My Conversations tool will be used to characterize changes in the number of advance care planning conversation elements discussed over time (i.e. as patients near end of life), and between cohorts (i.e. patients in Calgary vs. patients in Edmonton).</description>

    <description>The Canadian Problem Checklist is a checklist of emotional, social/family/spiritual, practical, physical, mobility, nutrition, and informational concerns.

        All advanced colorectal cancer patients at the Cross Cancer Institute (Edmonton, Canada),
        Tom Baker Cancer Centre (Calgary, Canada) and Holy Cross Centre (Calgary) will be screened
        and invited by their oncology healthcare providers to join the patient outcome and
        experience data collection. A caregiver, identified by each enrolled patient, may be
        invited to participate. For the purposes of this study, caregivers are defined as family or
        friends who provide unpaid assistance with tasks such as transportation and person care.
        Advanced Colorectal Cancer (aCRC) is defined as primary or metastatic cancer that is
        unlikely to be cured, controlled, or put into remission with treatment.
