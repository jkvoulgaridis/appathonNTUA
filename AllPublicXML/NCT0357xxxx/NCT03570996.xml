    <textblock>
      A randomized trial comparing perioperative outcomes between bilateral transversus abdominis
      plane TAP catheters with patient controlled analgesia (PCA) to epidural for esophagectomy
      patients with a VATS chest approach. Further objectives are to determine pain requirements
      between multiple modalities of pain control and compare the subsequent sequelae of narcotic
      use and blood pressure control and to compare complications such as anastomotic leak, atrial
      fibrillation and perioperative morbidity and mortality between the two groups.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epidural analgesia is considered the 'gold standard' for post-operative analgesia following
      open esophagectomy. Epidurals have been shown to reduce post-operative pulmonary morbidity
      and mortality. However, epidurals are often associated with sympathetic blockade that creates
      hypotension and could therefore adversely affect the conduit. Pain management techniques that
      use peripheral nerve blockade are becoming more prevalent, reducing the need for an epidural.
      Transversus abdominis plane (TAP) catheters have been used in colorectal and abdominal
      surgery showing equivocal pain scores to epidurals. With the minimally invasive chest
      approach, the analgesia coverage focuses on the abdominal incision where both epidurals and
      TAPs are considered standard of care.

      The investigators have completed a retrospective study in preparation for a randomized
      control trial. The investigators previous retrospective study found that TAP blocks/catheters
      are a reasonable alternative to epidurals, providing adequate pain coverage for abdominal
      incisions. The study found no statistical difference in pain scores between the two groups.
      The TAP group had a lower prevalence of hypotension and lower crystalloid resuscitation
      needs. Pulmonary complications were similar between the two groups. This retrospective review
      showed that TAP blocks are a reasonable alternative to epidurals and may reduce episodes of
      hypotension. The investigators aim is to now expand this study to a randomized control trial.

    <description>Transversus abdominis plane catheter (TAP) for pain control in esophagectomy operations. TAP group will have bilateral subcostal TAP catheters and single shot bilateral rectus sheath blocks placed at the end of the surgery, prior to emergence. Bilateral subcostal TAP catheters will be bolused with 20ml of .2% ropivacaine on each side and then infused with .2% ropivacaine at 10ml/ hr for 75 hours each. Rectus sheath blocks will be bilateral bolus 20ml of .2% ropivacaine.</description>
