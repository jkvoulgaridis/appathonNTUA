  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After a stroke, it is very common to lose the ability to open the affected hand. The purpose
      of this study is to compare the effects of three different therapies on recovery of hand
      function after stroke and determine if any one is better than the other.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A single-blinded randomized controlled trial will be carried out to assess and compare the
      effects of 12 weeks of Contralaterally Controlled Functional Electrical Stimulation (CCFES),
      Cyclic Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (cNMES), and Task Oriented Training. Dexterity,
      upper limb impairment, and activity limitation will be assessed at 0 (baseline), 12 (end of
      treatment), and 36 weeks. The treatment dose will be the same for all three groups: 10
      sessions per week of self-administered treatment at home plus 2 sessions per week of
      group-specific occupational therapy in the lab.

    <description>Contralaterally Controlled Functional Electrical Stimulation (CCFES) uses an electrical stimulator and surface electrodes placed over the paretic finger and thumb extensors to deliver stimulation with an intensity that is proportional to the degree of opening of the contralateral unimpaired hand wearing an instrumented glove. Thus, volitional opening of the nonparetic hand produces stimulated opening of the paretic hand. During the lab visits, participants in the CCFES group will use CCFES to assist hand opening during occupational therapy task practice. During their home sessions, participants in the CCFES group will use CCFES to perform hand opening exercise.</description>

    <description>Cyclic Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (cNMES) uses an electrical stimulator and surface electrodes over the paretic finger and thumb extensors to deliver electrical stimulation to open the weak hand. The stimulation automatically turns on and off causing the weak hand to open repetitively for several seconds at a time. During the lab visits, participants in the cNMES group will receive occupational therapy task practice. During their home sessions, participants in the cNMES group will use cNMES to perform hand opening exercise.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Task Oriented Therapy</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Task Oriented Therapy (TOT) focuses on practicing using the weak hand to practice activities of daily living tasks. During the clinic visits, participants in the TOT group will receive occupational therapy task practice. During their home sessions, participants in the TOT group will practice using their hand to complete a list of tasks given to them by the therapist to ensure that the participant receives a high dose of task practice.</description>

    <intervention_name>Electrical Stimulator</intervention_name>
    <description>An electrical stimulator will be used to deliver electrical current through surface electrodes to produce hand opening by making the paretic finger and thumb extensor muscles contract. The stimulator can be programmed to turn on and off in a repetitive cyclic fashion (i.e., cNMES) or be programmed to deliver stimulation with an intensity that corresponds to the opening of a glove instrumented with sensors and plugged into the stimulator (i.e., CCFES).</description>
