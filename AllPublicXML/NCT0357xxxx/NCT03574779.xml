  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Niraparib is an orally available, potent, highly selective poly adenosine diphosphate-ribose
      polymerase (PARP) 1 and PARP2 inhibitor. This study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      niraparib novel treatment combinations in participants with advanced, relapsed, high-grade
      ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. The purpose of this study is to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of novel combinations of niraparib with other agents with
      strong scientific rationale for synergistic activity in participants with recurrent ovarian
      cancer. This study will consist of screening, treatment and end of treatment periods.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant must be female &gt;=18 years of age, able to understand the study procedures,
             and agree to participate in the study by providing written informed consent.

          -  Participant has histologically diagnosed high-grade recurrent epithelial (ie, serous,
             endometrioid, mucinous, clear cell) ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal
             cancer or recurrent carcinosarcoma of the ovary. Participants with high-grade mixed
             histology are also eligible.

             or PARP inhibitors given as maintenance is not counted as a separate line of therapy.
             If a therapeutic regimen is modified or changed for a reason other than lack of
             response or PD (such as allergic reaction, toxicity, or drug availability), this is
             not counted as a separate line of therapy.

          -  Participant has measurable disease according to RECIST version 1.1.

          -  Participant has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0

             administration is not permitted within 2 weeks of screening). b. Platelets
             &gt;=100,000/mcL without platelet transfusion support within 2 weeks of screening. c.

             and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &lt;=2.5* ULN, unless liver metastases are present, in
             which case they must be &lt;=5* ULN. g. International normalized ratio or prothrombin

             anticoagulant and elevated PTT may be eligible on a case-by-case basis after
             discussion with the Sponsor's Medical Monitor.

          -  Female participant (of childbearing potential) is not breastfeeding, has a negative
             serum pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to taking study treatment, and agrees to

             archival tumor tissue is available. Additionally, participant must be willing to
             undergo 1 on-treatment biopsy, provided it is deemed safe and feasible by the
             Investigator.

        Cohort A-specific Inclusion Criteria: In addition to the general inclusion criteria,
        participants must also meet the following additional criterion to be considered eligible to
        participate in this study.

          -  Participants must be resistant to the most recent platinum-based therapy, defined for
             the purpose of this protocol as progression within 6 months from completion of a
             minimum of 4 cycles of platinum-containing therapy. This should be calculated from the
             date of the last administered dose of platinum therapy to the date of the radiographic
             imaging showing disease progression. Participants with primary platinum-refractory
             disease as defined by those who progressed during or within 4 weeks of completion of
             first platinum-based chemotherapy are not eligible.

             study of an investigational agent within 4 weeks of the first dose of treatment.

          -  Participant has received prior systemic anticancer therapy including cytotoxic
             chemotherapy, PARP inhibitor, immune checkpoint inhibitors, hormonal therapy given
             with the intention to treat ovarian cancer, or biological therapy within 3 weeks of
             the first dose of study treatment.

             include, but are not limited to, significant cardiovascular disease, uncontrolled
             major seizure disorder, unstable spinal cord compression, superior vena cava syndrome,
             and any psychiatric disorder that prohibits obtaining informed consent.

          -  Participant has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy or laboratory
             abnormality that might confound the results of the study, might interfere with the
             participant's participation for the full duration of the study treatment, or is not in
             the best interest of the participant to participate.

          -  Participant has known active hepatitis B or hepatitis C.

        Cohort A-specific Exclusion Criteria:

             past 2 years (ie, with use of disease-modifying agents, corticosteroids, or
             immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (eg, thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic
             corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency) is not
             considered a form of systemic treatment.

          -  Participant received prior treatment with an anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 agent.

          -  Participant has received prior treatment with anti-angiogenic therapy with the
             exception of bevacizumab. (Participants who received prior bevacizumab are eligible
             only if they did not discontinue bevacizumab due to toxicity, as established by the
             Investigator).

          -  Participant has bowel obstruction, had bowel obstruction within the past 3 months, or
             is otherwise judged by the Investigator to be at high risk for bowel obstruction
             related to the underlying disease. Participant has any history of abdominal fistula,
             gastrointestinal perforation, or intra-abdominal abscesses. Evidence of recto-sigmoid

             demonstrate &lt;2 gram of protein in 24 hours to be eligible).

          -  Participant is at increased bleeding risk due to concurrent conditions (eg, major
             injuries or surgery within the past 28 days prior to start of study treatment, history
             of hemorrhagic stroke, transient ischemic attack, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or
             clinically significant hemorrhage within the past 3 months).

          -  Participant has a history of recent major thromboembolic event defined as follows:
             Pulmonary embolism diagnosed within 3 months of enrollment; and Lower extremity deep
             venous thrombosis diagnosed within 3 months of enrollment.
