  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study involves Vyxeos (CPX-351), a formulation of a fixed combination of the two
      anti-tumor drugs, cytarabine and daunorubicin that will be given as an infusion over 90
      minutes. This study will use what is called a &quot;liposome&quot; injection. This is a special fat
      capsule (called a liposome) that surrounds the cytarabine and daunorubicin and protects the
      drugs from being eliminated/destroyed by the body.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Complete Remission Rate (CR) + CR with Incomplete Recovery (CRi)</measure>
    <time_frame>At day 28</time_frame>
    <description>Expansion from phase II pilot to a phase II trial will depend on demonstration of CR/CRi amongst 4 of the initial 10 treated patients. Investigators will measure remission rate at day 28 to address the primary endpoint of complete remission (with or without complete hematologic recovery), as defined by Cheson Criteria (ref 27). For those with extramedullary disease, Lugano criteria will be used to assess response. This is a standard assessment of drug efficacy for phase 2 clinical trial design in acute leukemias, as response correlates closely with progression free- and overall survival (PFS and OS).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Progression Free Survival as defined by Cheson and Lugano Criteria, namely progression, failure to respond, or death, as assessed from time of first treatment. Progression Free Survival will be reported as per Cheson Criteria, and analyzed using a standard Kaplan-Meier approach. Patients will undergo bone marrow biopsy evaluation after each cycle of therapy per standard of care to facilitated assessment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Overall Survival as defined by Cheson and Lygano Criteria, namely death due to any cause as assessed from time of first treatment. Overall Survival will be reported as per Cheson Criteria, and analyzed using a standard Kaplan-Meier approach. Patients will undergo bone marrow biopsy evaluation after each cycle of therapy per standard of care to facilitated assessment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Minimal Residual Disease (MRD)</measure>
    <time_frame>At day 28</time_frame>
    <description>MRD will be studied as a dichotomous endpoint using a cutoff of 1x10^4 cells/transcripts as the lower limit for residual leukemia, and presented as the percentage of participants reaching this landmark as their best response. MRD assessment will be obtained with each bone marrow biopsy assessment.</description>
