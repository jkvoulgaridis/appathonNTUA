  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will assess the accuracy of food capture methods using a novel mobile application.
      This will be done by comparing the energy and nutrient content of reported foods against
      those of foods actually consumed (i.e., reported vs actual). Two methods of using the
      application will be tested:

        1. During each eating occasion to report foods and amounts consumed

        2. By taking photographs of every food consumed, using the camera functionality of the
           mobile application and using the application the following day (according to the
           availability of the study subjects) to report foods and amounts consumed. This is to be
           consistent with the concept of a 24-hour dietary recall.

      One group will use a standard 24-hour dietary recall method.
