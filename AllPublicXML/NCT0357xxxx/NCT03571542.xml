      Objectives:

      While a respiratory abnormality was found in 50% of pediatric renal transplant recipients in
      a study conducted in Belgium and the Netherlands in 2008, the respiratory status of
      transplanted children in France remains unknown. The primary objective of this study is to
      assess the prevalence of respiratory impairment and its characteristics in children with
      renal transplant. The secondary objective is to study its association with some potential
      risk factors such as immunosuppressive therapy or humoral immunodeficiency.

      Methodology:

      This interventional study aims to recruit the 385 children currently being followed by 5
      French pediatric renal transplant centers between June 2018 and November 2019. A clinical and
      functional respiratory assessment will be carried out during the routine annual follow-up of
      the transplant recipient. Children with clinical signs of concern or abnormal spirometry will
      be referred to a respiratory specialist. Pharmacokinetic assays of immunosuppressant therapy
      and the exploration of humoral function will also be performed. The prevalence and type of
      respiratory abnormalities will be described. Logistic regression will be used to explore the
      association between potential risk factors and impaired respiratory function.

      Expected results:

      This study will be the first to evaluate the respiratory status of children with renal
      transplants in France. The prospective, multi- centered nature of the study, in addition to
      the large cohort size (which represents two thirds of children with renal transplants in
      France) will guarantee current, reliable, and representative data for the target population.
      We will provide new knowledge by precisely characterizing the type of lung injury and looking
      for potential risk factors. If our study confirms the high prevalence of pulmonary impairment
      in children with renal transplants, systematic monitoring of respiratory function may be
      recommended to enable early diagnosis and management. The expected individual and public
      health benefits would be significant by limiting the appearance of long-term, irreversible
      sequelae (such as non-cystic-fibrosis bronchiectasis) and improving the quality of life of
      these patients.

    <description>We will analyse the relation between several exposure variables or the potential risk factors (medical past, medication, infectious diseases,...) and the presence of an alteration of the respiratory function.
Clinical datas will be gathered thanks to a questionnaire on the medical past and the respiratory state of the child.
The usual biological measures will be done at the annual check up (exploring immunity, pharmacological dosages, renal function, for example).</description>
