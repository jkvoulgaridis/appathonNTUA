    <textblock>
      This Phase I study is designed to evaluate the systemic exposure and safety of KX2-391
      Ointment in adult subjects when applied to an area of skin containing at least 5 clinically
      typical, visible, and discrete Actinic Keratosis lesions on the face or balding scalp.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a open-label, single center, pharmacokinetic, and safety study of KX2-391
      Ointment administered topically to the face or balding scalp of subjects with actinic
      keratosis.

      The study consists of Screening, Treatment, and Follow-up Periods. Eligible subjects will
      receive 5 consecutive days of topical treatment, to be applied at the same location. Activity
      (lesion counts) and safety evaluations will be performed.

             on:

               1. Medical history

               2. Physical examination (PE) findings

               3. ECG, clinical chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis results.

          5. In the case of a female of childbearing potential, TKL will initiate two forms of
             birth control at Screening and that at least one had to be in place for 30 days prior

             with spermicide, diaphragm with spermicide, abstinence, partner's vasectomy, tubal
             ligation). Abstinence or vasectomies are acceptable if the female subject agrees to

          6. Females of childbearing potential, must agree to continue to use two methods of birth
             control for 30 days following the last dose of study treatment;

          7. In the case of a female of childbearing potential, has a negative urine pregnancy test
             (UPT) on Day 1 prior to randomization and are willing to submit to a UPT at the end of
             study (EOS);

             is reproductively capable, must agree to use barrier contraception from Screening
             through 90 days after their last dose of study treatment;

          9. In the case of a female of non-childbearing potential, has had a hysterectomy or is
             postmenopausal (at least 2 years with no menses prior to enrollment);

         10. All subjects must agree not to donate sperm or eggs or attempt conception from
             Screening through 90 days following their last dose of study treatment;

          5. Anticipated need for in-patient hospitalization or in-patient surgery during the
             study.

          6. Treatment with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), imiquimod, ingenol mebutate, diclofenac,
             photodynamic therapy, or other treatments for AK within 2 cm of the treatment area,
             within 8 weeks prior to the Screening visit.

          7. Use of the following therapies and/or medications within 2 weeks prior to the

             study participation.
