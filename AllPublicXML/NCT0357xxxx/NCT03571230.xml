    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess efficacy of 10-day antimicrobial susceptibility test
      guided triple therapy for the first-line treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection, then
      comparing it with 14-day empirical tailored therapy to tell which one has a better
      performance in both efficacy and safety.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Helicobacter pylori(H.pylori), which infects about 50% of the global population, has been
      recognized as a main risk factor of multiple gastric pathologies, especially non-cardiac
      gastric cancer. Strongly evidence supports that H.pylori eradication is an effective approach
      to reduce the incidence of those pathologies. Antimicrobial susceptibility test can pick out
      sensitive drugs to kill Helicobacter pylori, and reduce secondary drug resistance. But, there
      is a lack of high quality RCT to compare its efficacy with empirical regimen in the
      first-line treatment.

      Our study aims to assess the efficacy of 10-day antimicrobial susceptibility test guided
      triple therapy for the first-line treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection. Comparing this
      regimen with 14-day Empirical Tailored Therapy to tell which one is better in clinic
      practice. We also want to find whether the 10-day antimicrobial susceptibility test guided
      triple therapy has less intestinal dysbacteriosis with a shorter duration.

    <description>Both intention to treat(ITT) and per-protocol(PP) analyses will be used for the assessment of the eradication rates of Helicobacter pylori infections in two groups. The ITT analysis includes all randomly assigned patients who take at least one dose of the study medications. The PP analysis is limited to patients who take over 90% of the study medications and complete follow-up.</description>

    <description>Patients in this group will receive a 10-day triple therapy for the Helicobacter pylori eradication. The regimen contains one proton pump inhibitor and two sensitive antibiotics determined by AST. The susceptibility of amoxicillin, clarithromycin, metronidazole, tinidazole, levofloxacin, furazolidone and tetracycline will be evaluated.
Drugs: 1.one proton pump inhibitor: lansoprazole 30mg bid for 10d 2.two sensitive antibiotics: amoxicillin 1000mg bid for 10d, clarithromycin 500mg bid for 10d, metronidazole 500mg tid for 10d, tinidazole 500mg tid for 10d, levofloxacin 500mg qd for 10d, furazolidone 100mg bid for 10d, tetracycline 750mg bid for 10d.</description>

    <description>Patients in this group will receive a 14-day bismuth-based quadruple therapy for the H.pylori eradication. The regimen contains one PPI, Colloidal Bismuth Pectin and two antibiotics based on personal medication history. If the patient has taken clarithromycin, roxithromycin and azithromycin for less than 2 weeks before, he will be treated with amoxicillin and clarithromycin. Otherwise, he will be treated with amoxicillin and furazolidone.
