    <textblock>
      A prospective, interventional, open-label, single-arm, proof-of-concept study: 18 women with
      Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) will be treated with 100 mg of Anakinra/Kineret® for 4
      weeks. 1 week after last injection patients will have a follow-up and a dexamethasone visit
      after a dexamethasone suppression test. Goal of this study is to investigate the effect of
      the Interleukin 1( IL-1) receptor antagonist Anakinra/Kineret® on laboratory and clinical
      features in women with PCOS.
