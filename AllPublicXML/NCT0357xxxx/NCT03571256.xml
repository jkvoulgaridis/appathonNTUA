    <measure>Change From Baseline in the TTS of the YGTSS at Week 8 Between High-Dose TEV-50717-Treated Participants and Placebo-Treated Participants</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>YGTSS rating scale is a semi-structured clinician rating instrument that provides an evaluation of the number, frequency, intensity, complexity, and interference of motor and phonic tics. YGTSS is composed of 11 items: 5 items for motor tic severity, 5 items for vocal tic severity, and 1 item for impairment. Each item for motor tic severity and vocal is rated on a 6-point scale (0 for none to 5 to severe). MTSS is the sum of the 5 items for motor tic severity and VTSS is the sum of the 5 items for vocal tic severity. TTS is the sum of MTSS and VTSS, ranges from 0 (none/absent) to 50 (severe). Higher scores indicate greater severity/worse outcome. Least square (LS) mean and standard error (SE) was calculated using mixed-model repeated-measures (MMRM) with treatment group, week (3 levels: Weeks 2, 4, and 8), and the treatment group by week interaction as fixed effects; and baseline TTS, region, and age group at baseline (2 levels: 6 to 11 years, 12 to 16 years) as covariates.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Tourette Syndrome-Clinical Global Impression (TS-CGI) Score at Week 8 Between High-Dose TEV-50717-Treated Participants and Placebo-Treated Participants</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The TS-CGI scale is a 7-point Likert scale that allows the clinician to use all available information to assess the impact of tics on the participant's quality of life. The TS-CGI is rated as follows: 1 (normal or no tics at all), 2 (borderline), 3 (mild), 4 (moderate), 5 (marked), 6 (severe), and 7 (extreme, incapacitating tics). Lower scores indicate better quality of life. LS mean and SE was calculated using MMRM with treatment group, week (3 levels: Weeks 2, 4, and 8), and the treatment group by week interaction as fixed effects; and baseline TTS, region, and age group at baseline (2 levels: 6 to 11 years, 12 to 16 years) as covariates.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the TTS of the YGTSS at Week 8 Between High-Dose TEV-50717-Treated Participants and Placebo-Treated Participants</title>
        <description>YGTSS rating scale is a semi-structured clinician rating instrument that provides an evaluation of the number, frequency, intensity, complexity, and interference of motor and phonic tics. YGTSS is composed of 11 items: 5 items for motor tic severity, 5 items for vocal tic severity, and 1 item for impairment. Each item for motor tic severity and vocal is rated on a 6-point scale (0 for none to 5 to severe). MTSS is the sum of the 5 items for motor tic severity and VTSS is the sum of the 5 items for vocal tic severity. TTS is the sum of MTSS and VTSS, ranges from 0 (none/absent) to 50 (severe). Higher scores indicate greater severity/worse outcome. Least square (LS) mean and standard error (SE) was calculated using mixed-model repeated-measures (MMRM) with treatment group, week (3 levels: Weeks 2, 4, and 8), and the treatment group by week interaction as fixed effects; and baseline TTS, region, and age group at baseline (2 levels: 6 to 11 years, 12 to 16 years) as covariates.</description>

        <description>The TS-CGI scale is a 7-point Likert scale that allows the clinician to use all available information to assess the impact of tics on the participant's quality of life. The TS-CGI is rated as follows: 1 (normal or no tics at all), 2 (borderline), 3 (mild), 4 (moderate), 5 (marked), 6 (severe), and 7 (extreme, incapacitating tics). Lower scores indicate better quality of life. LS mean and SE was calculated using MMRM with treatment group, week (3 levels: Weeks 2, 4, and 8), and the treatment group by week interaction as fixed effects; and baseline TTS, region, and age group at baseline (2 levels: 6 to 11 years, 12 to 16 years) as covariates.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the TS-CGI Score at Week 8 Between Low-Dose TEV-50717-Treated Participants and Placebo-Treated Participants</title>
        <description>The TS-CGI scale is a 7-point Likert scale that allows the clinician to use all available information to assess the impact of tics on the participant's quality of life. The TS-CGI is rated as follows: 1 (normal or no tics at all), 2 (borderline), 3 (mild), 4 (moderate), 5 (marked), 6 (severe), and 7 (extreme, incapacitating tics). Lower scores indicate better quality of life. LS mean and SE was calculated using MMRM with treatment group, week (3 levels: Weeks 2, 4, and 8), and the treatment group by week interaction as fixed effects; and baseline TTS, region, and age group at baseline (2 levels: 6 to 11 years, 12 to 16 years) as covariates.</description>

        <description>C&amp;A-GTS-QOL is a 27-item questionnaire that asks participant to assess the extent to which their quality of life is impacted by their symptoms. C&amp;A-GTS-QOL contains 6 subscales (cognitive, coprophenomena, psychological, physical, obsessive-compulsive, and ADL) and uses a 5-point Likert scale ranging from no problem to extreme problem. Following 3 questions from 27-item questionnaire were assessed in ADL C&amp;A-GTS-QOL subscale: Question 2 (Had difficulty with school or sport activities?), 24 (Felt you needed more help or support from other people?), and 26 (Had difficulty going out with other people?). Total score of ADL subscale ranged from 0 (no problem) to 12 (extreme problem). Lower score indicated better quality of life. LS mean and SE was calculated using MMRM with treatment group, week (3 levels: Weeks 2, 4, and 8), and treatment group by week interaction as fixed effects; and baseline TTS, region, and age group at baseline (2 levels: 6-11 years, 12-16 years) as covariates.</description>
