      &lt;Research Hypothesis&gt; The dynamics of immune systems by Olaparib and its changes by
      combination with immune-oncology agents will be uncovered.

      The combination of Olaparib with Durvalumab with paclitaxel is tolerable and efficacious in
      gastric cancer.

      &lt;Objectives&gt;

      Primary Objectives:

      To assess the effect of Durvalumab in combination with olaparib and paclitaxel on DCR
      (Disease control rate) in gastric cancer patients

      -Disease control rate (based on RECIST v1.1)

      Secondary Objective(s):

        -  Efficacy: overall response rate (RECIST 1.1, ir response), progression-free survival,
           duration of response, overall survival, overall survival at 6 month, overall survival at
           1 year, EORTC QLQ-C30,

        -  Safety: toxicity (CTCAE V4.1), irAE
