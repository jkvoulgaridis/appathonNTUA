      This trial studies how well standard and delayed fludeoxyglucose F-18 (FDG)-positron emission
      tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) given after standard radiation and chemotherapy
      works in assessing patients with head and neck squamous cell cancer that has spread to other
      places in the body. Diagnostic procedures, such as PET/CT, use radioactive material, such as
      fludeoxyglucose F-18, to find and diagnose head and neck tumors and may help to find out how
      far the disease has spread.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess the optimal imaging time using FDG positron emission tomography (PET) with
      comparison between a standard of care 1-hour scan (early) and the research scan of 3-hours
      scan (delayed) post radiotracer administration that maximizes separation of activity between
      lesion and non-lesional parenchyma (measured as lesion/background [L/B] ratio) in patients
      with head and neck primary squamous cell carcinoma following chemoradiation treatment.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive fludeoxyglucose F-18 intravenously (IV) over 1 minute and undergo PET/CT at
      70 and 180 minutes after injection at 12-14 weeks following standard chemoradiation (CRT)
      completion.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 30 days and then periodically for up
      to 6 months.

    <description>Determined by fludeoxyglucose F-18 (FDG) positron emission tomography. The optimal time point is defined as the time point that meets the following requirements: 1) it has the largest average lesion/background (L/B) ratio, and 2) if the delayed time point is greater, it must be significantly different from the initial time point at the 0.025 significance level. The acquired PET data will be reconstructed using iterative techniques with resolution recovery. All delayed time points will then be registered using rigid techniques to the standard of care initial PET/CT image. Volumes of interest around the largest nodal metastasis will be drawn and the standard uptake value (SUV) max will be calculated. A corresponding region for largest nodal metastasis will be drawn on the contralateral sternocleidomastoid muscle respective to each lesion to determine L/B ratio, where L is the lesion SUV max and B is the corresponding background SUV max.</description>
