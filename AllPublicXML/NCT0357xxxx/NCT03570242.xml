    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effects of a 12-week whole-body electromyostimulation (WB-EMS)
      training combined with individualized nutritional support on body composition, muscle
      strength and function, quality of life, fatigue and Inflammatory status on patients with
      gynecological cancer undergoing palliative anti-cancer Treatment. Furthermore, this study
      assesses the effect of this combined therapeutic approach within a 3 to 4-week pre-operative
      study Intervention on the period of hospitalization in gynecological patients undergoing
      curative anti-cancer Treatment.
