      The consequences of chronically insufficient sleep are both behavioral and medical. .
      Patients who undergo total knee or hip arthroplasty commonly complain of sleep fragmentation
      after hospitalization The aim of the present study is to evaluate the changes in objective
      and subjective sleep quality and perceived pain, untill the 10th hospitalization day, in
      patients who underwent total knee or hip arthroplasty.

      The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey found that 22% of the US population
      reported 6 h of sleep or less and another 15% registered 5 h of sleep or less per 24 h (1).
      The consequences of chronically insufficient sleep are both behavioral and medical. Quantity
      and quality of sleep represent important factors for the quality of life, which can have
      positive or negative influence on individual health (2-4). Patients who undergo total knee or
      hip arthroplasty commonly complain of sleep fragmentation after hospitalization (5,6) Such
      patients experience acute postsurgical pain and discomfort, including restriction of their
      leg movement to prevent dislocation of the hip implant in the acute stage. The results of
      previous post-surgery studies have shown that REM sleep was severely reduced and awake time
      increased on the first postoperative night compared with the preoperative night (7,8).It is
      necessary for patients to secure the appropriate amount and quality of sleep to facilitate
      recuperation after surgery. Sleep disturbance is also related to the presence of delirium.
      The aim of the present study is to evaluate the changes in objective and subjective sleep
      quality and perceived pain, untill the 10th hospitalization day, in patients who underwent
      total knee or hip arthroplasty.
