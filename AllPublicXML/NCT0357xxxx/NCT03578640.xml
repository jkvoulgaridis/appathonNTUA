  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and efficacy of a daily, fixed-dose, 8-week course combination of
      Elbasvir/Grazoprevir in treatment-naïve, non-cirrhotic patients who are mono-infected with
      hepatitis C, genotype 4.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of hepatitis C has gone through significant advances in the last few years with
      the development of direct-acting antivirals &quot;DAAs.&quot; Since 2013, many DAAs have been approved
      for the treatment of HCV with excellent efficacy and safety profiles. The major hurdle in
      treating patients on a large scale is the high cost of the current treatment regimens.
      Multiple approaches have been proposed, among them, a shortened treatment regimen of 6 to 8
      weeks rather than the standard 12-week-regimen. The strategy of shortening the treatment will
      help in reducing the cost by 33% to 50%. Thus, it will increase the availability of the
      treatment to more patients.

      Zepatier is a combination drug of Elbasvir (EBR), an NS5A inhibitor, and Grazoprevir (GZR), a
      potent NS3/4A inhibitor. This study is being proposed to address two main issues. First,
      collecting information on the safety and efficacy of a shortened course of zepatier (8 weeks
      instead of the standard 12 weeks) in patients who are treatment-naïve, non-cirrhotic and
      mono-infected with HCV. Second, to investigate whether this course provides similar clinical
      outcomes to the standard regimen in HCV-Genotype 4, which is the most common genotype in
      Saudi Arabia.

    <description>To assess the patient's quality of life, we will be using a self-administered questionnaire called the &quot;Hepatitis Quality of Life Questionnaire&quot; (HQLQ). The questionnaire has questions that aim to evaluate how well the patient can do his/her usual activities. Overall, the higher the score, the better the quality of life.
Assessment of the patient's quality of life will take place over three occasions. The first will be a baseline assessment upon initiating the treatment, the second will be at the last day of treatment (in other words, when the patient finishes the 8-week course), and the last will take place 24 weeks after the end of treatment.</description>
