  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is to further exploring the optimal switching strategy by evaluating the
      pharmacodynamic responses as well as adverse events in patients with complexity of coronary
      artery disease managed by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). All participants will be
      divided into three groups and recieving ticagrelor 90mg plus aspirin 100mg at 12 hours after
      the last dose of clopidogrel; recieving ticagrelor 90mg plus aspirin 100mg at 24 hours after
      the last dose of clopidogrel; recieving ticagrelor 180mg plus aspirin 100mg at 24 hours after
      the last dose of clopidogrel.
