      This study evaluate use of a translated Norwegian version of the Edinburgh cognitive and
      behavioral amyotrophic lateral sclerosis screen (ECAS-N) as an early predictor in
      car-driving, working and use of advanced life-prolonging therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive impairment is present in about 30-50% of the patients with amyotrophic lateral
      sclerosis (ALS). Screening of cognitive and behavioral impairment is a distinct
      recommendation in ALS-specific health care. However, knowledge in how cognitive impairment
      shall influence health-care professionals' information given to patients and in decision
      making is lacking.

      One of the major challenges in ALS management is the decision-making on advanced therapy.
      There is a lack of knowledge in how cognitive impairment in ALS shall be interfere on complex
      medical treatment that will affect quality of life or life itself. This means significant
      implications not only to the ALS patient and the community, but also the family and
      especially the spouse. Thus, further investigation of the ECAS-N and its potential in
      clinical use is needed. The scale may contribute a more proactive treatment better tailored
      to individual needs. The objective is to evaluate if the ECAS-N can be applied as an early
      predictor in car-driving, working and use of advanced life-prolonging therapy
