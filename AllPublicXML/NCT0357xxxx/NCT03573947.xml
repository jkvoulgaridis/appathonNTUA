      This is an open-label, non-randomized, phase II clinical research study designed to assess
      the safety and efficacy of nivolumab and ipilimumab in combination with paclitaxel in
      patients with treatment naïve NSCLC.

      Patients with histologically confirmed stage IV or recurrent non curable NSCLC of squamous or
      non-squamous histology, with no prior systemic anticancer chemotherapy or immunotherapy given
      as primary treatment for advanced or metastatic disease may be eligible to participate in
      this study.

      Patients enrolled into the study will be given the study drugs, nivolumab (360 mg) (Day 1)
      every 3 weeks, ipilimumab 1 mg/kg (Day 1) every 6 weeks, and paclitaxel 80mg/m2 on days 1 and
      8 of each 21- day study treatment cycle. Paclitaxel will be stopped after a total of 4-6
      cycles of treatment. Blood samples and possibly a small piece of tissue may be removed the
      patient's lung to see what type of lung cancer cells that she or he may have. Patients will
      also have other tests, exams, and procedures for study purposes and their standard of care.
      Subject participation in the study will last for up to approximately 48 months after the
      start of the study drug or until their condition worsens or they experience intolerable
      adverse events as deemed by the study doctor.

      There are possible patient risk to this study that include but are not limited to diarrhea,
      itching, rash and a feeling of weakness.
