  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to develop a typology of patients referred to the
      Geriatric Multidisciplinary Meeting (GMM) according to their demographic and clinical
      profile.

      The secondary objectives are:

        -  To distinguish the different types of answers given by the GMM according to the demands
           and situations.

        -  To study the factors associated with the orientation proposed by the GMM

        -  To examine the adequacy between the orientation proposed by the GMM and the pathway
           actually taken

        -  To compare the diagnoses made during the following year with the data collected during
           the GMM

      Increasing attention is paid to care pathways for elderly according to the principle of good
      care applied to the right patient at the right time and in the most appropriate care
      structure.

      Since 2007, the geriatric mobile team (GMT) of the Angers University Hospital has formalized
      a geriatric multidisciplinary meeting (GMM) in connection with the geriatric network and
      branch of the geographical sector, in order to optimize the provision of care for elderly
      patients at the territorial level.

      The weekly GMM brings together physicians from the geriatric department (GMT, acute care
      unit), memory center, long-term care and skilled nursing facilities, cognitive behavioral
      unit, psychiatry, retirement home, the local geriatric network of the city of Angers, the
      local information and coordination center, the home for autonomy and integration of Alzheimer
      patients (MAIA) and specialized Alzheimer (ESA) teams. Requests come either University
      Hospital services or from outside, via a standardized form. If necessary, additional data
      collection is carried out before the meeting by telephone with the patient, his family or the
      general practitioner. A letter explaining the decision of the GMM is sent to the applicant
      physician and to the general practitioner and recorded in the patient file.

      Collegial guidance decisions within the health care system seem to follow implicit rules.
      Given the growing number of files presented, the investigators want to theorize the adopted
      mode of reflection.
