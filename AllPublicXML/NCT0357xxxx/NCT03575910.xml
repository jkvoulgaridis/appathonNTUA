    <textblock>
      Heart transplantation is a life saving therapy for people with end stage heart failure. Acute
      rejection, a process where the immune system recognizes the transplanted heart as foreign and
      mounts a response against it, remains a clinical problem despite improvements in
      immunosuppressive drugs. Acute rejection occurs in 20-30% of patients within the first 3
      months post-transplant, and is currently detected by highly invasive heart tissue biopsies
      that happen 12-15 times in the first year post-transplant. Replacing the biopsy with a simple
      blood test is of utmost value to patients and will reduce healthcare costs. The goal of our
      project is to develop a new blood test to monitor heart transplant rejection. Advances in
      biotechnology have enabled simultaneous measurement of many molecules (e.g., proteins,
      nucleic acids) in blood, driving the development of new diagnostics. Our team is a leader in
      using computational tools to combine information from numerous biological molecules and
      clinical data to generate &quot;biomarker panels&quot; that are more powerful than existing diagnostic
      tests. Our sophisticated analytic methods has recently derived HEARTBiT, a promising test of
      acute rejection comprising 9 RNA biomarkers, from the measurement of 30,000 blood molecules
      in 150 Canadian heart transplant patients. Our objective is to study a custom-built HEARTBiT
      test in a setting and on a technology that enable clinical adoption. We will evaluate the new
      test on 400 new patients from 5 North American transplant centres. We will also track
      patients' HEARTBiT scores over time to help predict future rejection, and explore use of
      proteins and micoRNAs to improve HEARTBiT. Our work will provide the basis for a future
      clinical trial. The significance of this work rests in that it will provide a tool to
      identify acute cardiac rejection in a fast, accurate, cost-effective and minimally invasive
      manner, allowing for facile long-term monitoring and therapy tailoring for heart transplant
      patients.

      Rationale:

      Cardiac transplantation remains the main intervention for those with end-stage heart failure.
      Maintenance immunosuppression is given to all transplant recipients to prevent acute
      rejection and loss of the allograft. Despite great improvements in immunosuppressive
      therapies, acute rejection remains a clinical problem and occurs at varying severity in
      20-30% of patients within the first 3 months post-transplant. Timely detection of moderate
      rejection allows for treatment to be modified, preventing organ damage, graft failure and
      patient death. The current method to monitor for rejection remains the endomyocardial biopsy
      (EMB), a highly invasive and costly procedure that poses physical risks and emotional stress
      to patients, who must undergo 12-15 such tests during the first year post-transplant. EMB
      detects rejection only when tissue damage has occurred, and lacks sensitivity as it provides
      information about tiny pieces of the endomyocardium. Clearly, patients and clinicians would
      benefit from an effective, cheaper, less invasive diagnostic test that can indicate when an
      EMB is not needed.

      Our team used unbiased omics strategies and computational tools to identify potential
      biomarkers of treatable acute rejection (ISHLT grade 2R or higher) in peripheral blood. We
      hypothesize that there are distinctive RNA and protein signatures in blood that can be
      developed into a simple test to accurately indicate when heart transplant patients do not
      require EMB, and that studying these biomarkers in a clinically relevant setting will
      facilitate clinical adoption.

      Our Specific Aims are to:

        1. Evaluate the performance of HEARTBiT, a custom 9-mRNA biomarker test developed on the
           NanoString platform, in an environment suitable for clinical translation, on &gt;4000 newly
           collected samples from 400 patients across North America

        2. Examine the biomarker panel score and individual biomarkers serially across the first
           year post-transplant to identify predictive signatures of rejection and characterize
           underlying biology

        3. Develop and assess 5 promising protein biomarker candidates on NanoString, test 7
           candidate miRNAs, and evaluate combinatorial RNA-protein classifier performance metrics
           to improve HEARTBiT

      Expertise: Our team at the Centre of Excellence for Prevention of Organ Failure has over 10
      years experience in computational analysis of omics and clinical data to create biomarker
      tests that out-perform current gold standards. Our Biomarkers in Transplantation (BiT) study
      has been continuously funded by competitive grants, philanthropy and industry between
      2004-2017 and has generated many publications related to heart and kidney transplant
      rejection. Via our collaborators, we will have access to a Canadian Blood Services facility
      for testing our biomarkers, and patient samples from 5 major transplant sites (St.
      Paul's/Vancouver, Toronto, Nebraska, Newark Beth Israel, Duke).

      Outcomes: The HEARTBiT test will be ready for clinical utility studies. The test will have
      significant clinical and socioeconomic value by reducing EMBs for transplant patients and
      enabling the tailoring of therapy. Insights into the biology of immune rejection will also be
      enhanced.

    <description>The performance of HEARTBiT, a custom 9-RNA biomarker assay developed on the NanoString platform, will be evaluated in an environment suitable for clinical translation using a sample size of ~4000 newly collected samples from 400 HT patients. Performance will be assessed by applying an algorithm that combines the quantitative data of the 9 RNA into a single BPS. This score aggregates the influence of all RNAs and will be associated with an estimated probability that AR is occurring in the transplant recipient. The algorithm will establish a single cutoff thus producing a final binary test result (AR or NR/MR), or, if possible, two cutoffs to separate AR, MR and NR as ordered variables.</description>

        It is anticipated that up to 400 heart transplant recipients will be enrolled as
        participants. Given the prevalence of treatable AR observed at the recruiting sites, 40-50
        AR and 350 NR/MR are expected, excluding the time course (first year post-transplant)
        samples. Additionally, we plan on enrolling 30 normal control subjects. Comparisons will be
        made between AR, MR, and NR samples from independent patients.
