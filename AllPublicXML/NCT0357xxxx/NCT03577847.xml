      To counteract long term sequelae from stroke, ultrarapid diagnosis and treatment, high
      quality multidiciplinary in-hospital care and optimal long term rehabilitation is required.
      In this study, the investigators are moving the essential first diagnosis and treatment out
      into the community close to where the patient live, thus shortening the all important time
      from debut of symptoms to thrombolytic treatment improving the prognosis of stroke patients.

    <textblock>
      Stroke is an acute, potentially mutilating disease. To counteract long term sequelae three
      factors are essential: Ultrarapid diagnosis and treatment, high quality multidiciplinary
      in-hospital care and optimal long term rehabilitation. Initial diagnosis and treatment has up
      to now been completed within the hospital domain. This study will change that: moving the
      essential first diagnosis and treatment out into the community close to where the patient
      lives thus shortening the all important time from debut of symptoms to thrombolytic
      treatment. We will operate a local computer tomography (CT) service in the hands of community
      based non-specialized health care personnel (MD and nurse) acting under direct telemetric
      guidance from on call hospital specialists. Thus, the investigators will show that by
      combining current technological advances in real time video communication with an acutely
      well functioning cooperation between the community and hospital health service personnel the
      prognosis of stroke patients is improved.
