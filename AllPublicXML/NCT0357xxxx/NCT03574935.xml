  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is based on investigator team's ten year experience on diabetic ulcer and goes
      on further developing basic research and concluding clinical experience. The investigator
      team has recently developed &quot;Remove stasis to generate granulation tissue&quot; into &quot;Remove
      slough to generate granulation tissue&quot;. Investigators have applied the principle of &quot;Remove
      stasis&quot; in the medium and later stage of treatment to make &quot;Remove slough-Eliminate
      stasis-Generate granulation tissue&quot; become the basic principle of three-stage sequential
      treatment. Investigators will further conclude Chinese medicine therapy in the stage of
      &quot;Qing-Hua-Bu&quot; and evaluate safety, applicability and availability of it. Therefore, the
      research can help improve clinical diagnosis and treatment technique and transfer the study
      result of Chinese medicine experience on diabetic ulcer.

      Aim: Under guidance of &quot;Clear pus-Remove stasis-Supplement muscles&quot; theory, to observe
      clinical effectiveness of dynamic Chinese external therapy of &quot;Qing-Hua-Bu&quot; in treating
      diabetic ulcer and partially explain potential wound healing mechanism.

      Method: Clinical observation: To adopt the design method of open and parallel control test
      and include 150 diabetic ulcer patients. The treatment group was supplied with external
      clearing heat, removing stasis and supplementing deficiency Chinese medicine, while the
      control group was supplied with sulfadiazine silver cream, furacilin solution and bovine
      basic fibroblast growth factors (b-FGF) spray. To perform the dressing change for wound every
      day and persist in dressing change for two months. To record dynamic wound healing progress
      by digital camera. After finishing course, to compare wound healing, pus, exudate,
      granulation tissues and epithelial tissues and analyze these data by SPSS22.0.
