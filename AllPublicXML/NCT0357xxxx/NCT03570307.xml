      Study Objective: To compare the time to new pregnancy and pregnancy outcomes in women who
      received Misoprostol for uterus evacuation versus those treated surgically with dilatation
      and curettage.

      Study Population: Women to be admitted to the Lis maternity department for first trimester
      failed pregnancy. Patients will choose between medical versus surgical management. Of this
      group, women interested and successful in achieving a new pregnancy without first engaging in
      birth control methods will be included in our study.

      Inclusion Criteria: Women with first trimester failed pregnancy (up until week 12 according
      to LMP and up to CRL compatible with 11 gestational weeks) Exclusion Criteria: Women under
      the age of 18 or over the age of 45, women who conceived via fertility treatments, women with
      a molar pregnancy.

      Study Type: prospective study. Study Description: Women who visit the emergency department or
      gynecology clinic with a first-trimester miscarriage will be questioned regarding their
      subsequent family planning. In the event that the woman is interested in another pregnancy,
      and is not planning to use birth control methods prior to conception, the use of folic acid
      will be recommended, and she will receive an explanation of the research process. Women who
      agree to participate in the study orally and who sign a written consent form will be included
      in the study.

      Three to six months following uterine evacuation, study participants will receive a telephone
      call to assess whether they have conceived, and the case that they had not yet conceived,
      will receive a follow-up call after an additional three to six months.

      Each woman who conceived, will receive a follow-up call to assess the details of the birth.
      In the event that she did not give birth in the Lis Maternity Hospital, she will be asked to
      fax a copy of the release letter she received from the hospital.

      Type of Birth: Normal vaginal delivery, operative delivery, cesarean section. Birth details
      will be collected via the automated system in Lis in the event that the birth took These
      women will be included in the study and will be divided into two groups: surgical vs. medical
      management. The study will include roughly 200 women in each of the two groups.

      It will be clarified that:

        1. The researcher will confirm the identity of the participant at the outset of the
           telephone call.

        2. The researcher will request consent and introduce him or herself as a member of the
           research team from the Lis Hospital. In the event of refusal to participant, the
           research will apologize and terminate the telephone call.

      Study Parameters: 1 .Demographic Parameters of the two groups - age, gravity, parity,
      ethnicity, history of infertility.

      2. Comparison of the success of the surgical treatment versus medical management - in this
      case, failure is defined as the need for subsequent surgical treatment. This will include
      data on the percentage of women who received multiple doses of Misoprostol.

      3. A comparison of the time (in months) until a new pregnancy is conceived (from the data of
      the dilatation and curettage or the first dose of the Misoprostol) 4. Pregnancy Outcomes -
      first trimester miscarriage, obstetric outcomes, early deliveries, pregnancy complications -
      IUGR, placental abruption, pre-eclampsia, cesarean sections, neonatal outcomes. This data
      will be collected in multiple telephone conversations - three months after conception and
      following the delivery date.

        1. Validation of details of pregnancies that ended in miscarriage - was the pregnancy
           desired? Mode of conception (if fertility treatments - which?), months until conception,
           gestational age at the time that a non-viable pregnancy was diagnosed, mode of pregnancy
           termination. The details will be validated in relation to details in our automated
           system.

        2. At what month did the woman resume menstruation? Was an ultrasound performed to assess
           uterine evacuation prior to a new pregnancy conception?

        3. Details on pregnancy following dilatation and curettage - time to conception from
           pregnancy termination, pregnancy outcomes, gestational age at birth (or miscarriage),
           birth weight, Apgar scores, pH (if available).

        4. Data on fertility, age, obstetric history, time to conception of new pregnancies, need
           for fertility treatments.

      Mechanism of Anonymity:

      The primary researcher will be responsible for the removal of identifying data. After this
      data has been removed, in the event that it is still necessary to complete data on the
      participants, we will make contact with the participant and he will sign a telephone consent
      form regarding this data completion. In the event that no data is mission and/or after the
      data is completed through a telephone call, the identifying details will be removed in a way
      that it will be impossible to replace them. And the telephone consent forms will be saved in
      a cabinet that can be accessed only by the primary and secondary researchers.
