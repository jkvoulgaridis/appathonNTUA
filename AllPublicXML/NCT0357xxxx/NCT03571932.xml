  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a mixed methods process evaluation of a programmatic intervention to integrate family
      planning and immunization services at health facilities in Lofa and Grand Bassa counties in
      Liberia. MCSP used a longitudinal, pair-matched design to monitor the effect of integrating
      immunization and FP services on utilization of FP and routine immunization services. In Lofa
      and Grand Bassa counties, 36 facilities were pair-matched to intervention and comparison
      sites based on predetermined criteria. After approximately 9 months of implementation, MCSP
      conducted a qualitative study employing key informant interviews (KIIs) and focus group
      discussions (FGDs) at intervention and comparison sites, and with district-, county-, and
      national-level MOH supervisors and managers.

    <description>The approach involved integration of immunization and family planning services at health facilities. Vaccinators provided brief FP messages one-on-one to mothers and offered a referral for same-day, co-located FP services at the end of each routine immunization visit. For women coming directly for FP, if women had an infant with them, FP providers asked to see the child's health card, checked the return date for the next vaccination and reminded the mother of the date to return. For women without their child or the child health card with them, FP providers reinforced the importance of vaccination, and encouraged the mothers to bring their child for all their vaccines and complete the immunization schedule in a timely manner. A job aid, referral cards, and IEC materials were introduced to support the integration process.</description>
