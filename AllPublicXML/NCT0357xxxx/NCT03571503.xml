      A prospective pilot study will be conducted to investigate the effectiveness and safety in
      herniated lumbar disc (HLD) patients receiving integrative Korean medicine treatment
      including Doin (conduction exercise) at a Korean medicine hospital through assessment of
      pain, functional disability, and quality of life.

      A prospective single-center observational pilot study will be conducted to investigate the
      effectiveness and safety in herniated lumbar disc (HLD) patients with radiating leg pain
      receiving integrative Korean medicine treatment including Doin (conduction exercise) of the
      pelvic joint at Daejeon Jaseng Hospital of Korean Medicine through assessment of pain,
      functional disability, quality of life, satisfaction, and safety.

      The study is expected to be performed over a period of 6 months, during the former 3 months
      of the study period of which the Integrative Korean medicine treatment group will be
      recruited, and after a wash-out period of 2 weeks, during the latter 3 months of the study
      period of which the Doin with integrative Korean medicine will be recruited separately.

Doin (conduction exercise) will be performed as active and passive movement with the needles in situ to the aim of effective treatment of pain and functional disability by increasing the hip joint range of motion (flexion and extension) with physician guidance and isometric resistance exercise (flexion and extension) as needed. Doin (conduction exercise) sessions will be performed 1 session/day for the duration of hospitalized treatment while the patient presents radiating leg pain (NRS≥1).</description>
