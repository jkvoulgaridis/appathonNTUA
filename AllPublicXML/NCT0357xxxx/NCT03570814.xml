    <textblock>
      Cluster-randomised trial comparing co-administration of Azithromycin/Ivermectin/Albendazole
      with separate administration of Azithromycin and Ivermectin/Albendazole.

      The study will be conducted in Beneshangul-Gumuz region, Ethiopia. Within this district, a
      study group of 8,000 people (in approximately 40 clusters) will receive the azithromycin,
      ivermectin &amp; albendazole at a single time. A control group of 8,000 people (in approximately
      40 clusters) within the same district will receive the current MDA treatment schedule
      beginning with Ivermectin/Albendazole followed two weeks later with azithromycin. All drug
      dosing will be in line with standard FMOH and WHO Guidelines for MDA for trachoma and
      lymphatic filariasis.

      The study will randomly sort subdistrict communities (Gotes) into the trial arm and the
      control arm. The study will compare the number of adverse events (AEs) and severe adverse
      events (SAEs) between the two arms to determine if co-administration is not inferior to the
      standard treatment. The primary outcome will be to demonstrate the safety of the triple-drug
      administration as measured by incidence of AEs/SAEs following the MDA.

    <description>The incidence of self-reported adverse events following MDA. We will collect data on the presence of common symptoms/signs prior to drug administration. All patients will be reviewed 24-48 hours after treatment and asked to report adverse events. We will calculate the proportion of newly occurring adverse events following treatment and calculate the whether the proportion of patients experiencing an adverse event differs between study arms,</description>

          2. Less than 5 years of age (not eligible for ivermectin)**

          3. Pregnant women (azithromycin only, not eligible for albendazole and ivermectin)

          4. Lactating women (Only administered azithromycin and albendazole, not eligible for
             ivermectin)**

          5. History of allergies to the drugs being studied (azithromycin, ivermectin,
             albendazole)

          6. Residents who cannot swallow tablets

               -  Note that patients that are not eligible for IVM, will receive azithromycin and

                  up through the same procedure as the triple drug therapy to try to track any AEs
                  attributed to the two drug combination.
