      This study evaluate the effectiveness of the Virtual Reality Educational Program (RVEP) in
      the Paediatric Surgical Prehabilitation Unit to reduce the perioperative anxiety in children
      who undergo to elective surgery. Half of the patients will received the virtual reality
      program, and the other half will received de common treatment.

    <textblock>
      During preoperative time, anxiety is one of the most frequent problems in children, causing
      an important health problem as long with pain. In the surgical fields there are two
      especially stressful moments for the child, the first one is the parent´s separation, and the
      second is the anaesthetic induction, which in up to 42% of cases can be traumatic.

      Methods to treat paediatric anxiety have evolved in the last decades. Pharmacological therapy
      is one of the most used methods to treat anxiety in the immediate preoperative period, but
      complications and unwanted side effects are described. Due to this side effects, this study
      will evaluate the the effectiveness of the Virtual Reality Educational Program (RVEP) to
      reduce the perioperative anxiety in children.

    <measure>Preoperative Change of Paediatric Anxiety level</measure>
    <time_frame>3 days: 1.- On preanesthetic visit (7-10 days before surgery), using mYPAS scale. 2.- The surgery day, during parents separation, using mYPAS-SF. 3.- Postoperative day (24 hours after surgery), at hospitalization room, using a mYPAS scale.</time_frame>
    <description>It will be measured by modified-Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale (mYPAS) and its short form (mYPAS-SF).
The mYPAS score range is: 23,3 to 100, majors scores indicate anxiety. It's considerate an anxiety cut-off point scores &gt;40, and no anxiety &lt;40. The mYPAS-SF score range is 22,7 to 100.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Paediatric pain</measure>
    <time_frame>2 days. The surgery day and the postoperative day (24 hours after surgery).</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by Faces Pain Rating Scale o Wong Baker Faces. It consist in 6 faces, The faces represent &quot;no harm&quot; to &quot;worse damage&quot; and the score goes from 0 to 10.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Modified Aldrete postanesthetic recuperation</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day. The surgery day</time_frame>
    <description>It is a hetero-administered scale consisting of 10 items. Each item responds to a Likert scale of 0 to 2, with a total range ranging from 0 to 10. The cut-off point is at 80% of the maximum score, ie 18 points suggest adequate recovery after anesthesia.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Parental satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day. At hospital discharge (24 hours after surgery).</time_frame>
    <description>Numeric Scale indicate 0= unsatisfied and 10= totally satisfied.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Resources</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day. The surgery day.</time_frame>
    <description>Will be measured using a self-created questionnaire. It contains variables as:
Anaesthesia induction times (in minutes)
Time between the surgery ends and recovery discharge (in minutes)
Surgery times (in minutes)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Children's collaboration during anaesthesia induction.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day. The surgery day, during anaesthesia induction.</time_frame>
    <description>It will be measured by Induction Compliance Checklist (ICC). ICC score range is 0 to 10, 0 means collaborate and 10 no collaborate.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Paediatric Delirium</measure>
    <time_frame>2 days. The surgery day and the postoperative day (24 hours after surgery).</time_frame>
    <description>Paediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium (PAED). It consists of 5 items with 5 possible answers on a scale of 0 to 4, with a score of &gt; 10 indicating postsurgical agitation.</description>
