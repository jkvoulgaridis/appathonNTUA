  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The decreased cerebellar biometry during second and third trimester ultrasound examination is
      the main parameter to diagnoses cerebellar and pontocerebellar hypoplasia. Investigators
      already described that a transverse cerebellar diameter (TCD) below the 5th centile at second
      or third trimester scan is related to a high rate of fetal malformations, severe intrauterine
      restriction in growth, chromosomal anomalies and genetic disorders, therefore when facing a
      TCD below the 5th centile, patients should be referred for oriented sonogram, fetal MRI
      (Magnetic resonance imaging) and fetal karyotyping.

      However, prenatal counseling in case of an isolated decreased cerebellar biometry remains
      challenging since there are no data in the literature regarding the neurodevelopmental
      outcome of these newborns. The aim of this work is to evaluate the neurodevelopmental outcome
      of newborns with a prenatal isolated decreased cerebellar biometry, in order to improve
      prenatal counseling.
