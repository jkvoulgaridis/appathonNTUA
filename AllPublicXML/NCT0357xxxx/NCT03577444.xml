  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the association of genetic polymorphism such as the
      Brain-derived Neurotrophic factor (BDNF), in neurogenic dysphagia in those with brain lesion.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neurogenic dysphagia attributable to acquired brain lesions, such as after stroke and after
      traumatic brain injury, are one of leading causes of chronic disability world widely and it
      is expected to substantially increase over the next two decades. Among various sequalae,
      dysphagia can be observed in about 40% -60% of post-stroke patients and 20% -30% of them
      might suffer from recurrent aspiration pneumonia and may inhibit recovery and can even lead
      to death. Recovery after brain lesions can be explained by specific molecular events. It is
      proven that Genetic polymorphisms associated with impaired neural repair or plasticity might
      reduce recovery from stroke. Not only for the motor recovery, but genetic polymorphism is
      also crucial for the recovery of swallowing after stroke, however, only limited amount of
      studies are available. Therefore, it is urgent to determine whether the recovery of
      swallowing disorders after stroke is affected by the inherent polymorphism of the patient,
      whether the degree of recovery and brain plasticity associated with swallowing depend on the
      gene characteristics and polymorphism of the patient and whether recovery in swallowing
      parallel to the recovery observed in other functional areas (ie. hand recovery, truncal
      control recovery, ADL recovery).

      Based on the results of this study, results will be expected to help provide genetically
      tailored diagnosis and prognostication according to the gene polymorphism of the patient.
      Optimized treatment of the patient is expected to contribute to prevention of respiratory
      complications and improve functional outcome related to swallowing after stroke.

    <time_frame>initial 4 weeks, 3months after onset</time_frame>
    <description>The QOLS is a reliable and valid instrument for measuring quality of life from the perspective of the patient The descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. This decision results in a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state.</description>
