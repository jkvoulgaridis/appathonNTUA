  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLco) abnormalities are common in HIV+ individuals
      and associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The complexity and the
      individualized differences in causes of these abnormalities have been challenging to unravel
      using traditional approaches. In this proposal, the investigators construct a systems'
      modeling approach to identify novel molecular and clinical pathways contributing to DLco
      impairment in HIV+ individuals and to determine predictive signatures of DLco decline in
      order to develop strategies to treat and prevent abnormal lung function in this susceptible
      population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mechanisms of impairment of diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLco), which affects over
      50 percent of HIV+ individuals, are poorly understood. No therapies exist despite significant
      impact on quality of life and mortality. Identifying molecular pathways of DLco impairment in
      HIV+ individuals and developing ability to predict HIV+ individuals at risk of DLco
      impairment is thus of utmost importance for improving care. In this proposal, the
      investigators construct a systems' modeling approach to identify molecular and clinical
      pathways contributing to DLco impairment in HIV+ individuals. The investigators collect
      multiple parallel molecular datasets integrated with detailed pulmonary function,
      radiographic, and echocardiographic measurements to build a comprehensive, systems level
      model of DLco abnormalities in HIV and to develop predictive models of susceptibility to DLco
      worsening. As our preliminary data suggest that certain micro ribonucleic acid (miRNAs), such
      as the hypoxia-induced and metabolically active gene (miR-210), may play an important role in
      DLco abnormalities in HIV, the investigators then perform hypothesis-testing experiments to
      determine the impact of miRNAs on lung epithelial and endothelial cells. The investigators
      will utilize a well phenotyped cohort of over 500 HIV+ individuals with associated
      biospecimens to execute the aims.

      Participants identified to already have specimens available will be scheduled to have PFT
      testing, bronchoscopy including bronchial wash with brushes and blood collection.

    <description>The routine lung function endpoints of FVC(forced vital capacity), FEV1, FEV1/FVC, and FEF25-75% will be measured with the flow-volume loop recorder before and after bronchodilator administration. The system is calibrated for body temperature and pressure of saturated gas and volumes, per American Thoracic Society (ATS) standards . DLco will be measured using the automated single-breath procedure of the integrated testing system, which conforms with ATS standards.</description>
