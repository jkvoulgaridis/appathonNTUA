  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized open clinical trial to assess the added value of a comprehensive rehabilitation
      program on fall prevention and improve participation and activities of daily living. Baseline
      assessment, 6-month experimental intervention (experimental group) vs. usual rehabilitation
      programs and assessment at end of treatment and six months after treatment will be performed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      90 patients will be randomly patients will be stratified by disease type and randomized
      separately.

      The trial will be organized in Baseline assessment (clinical characteristics; fall
      predictors, chosen among the variables found to predict falls in the observational study),
      experimental intervention (experimental group) vs. usual rehabilitation programs (control
      group) and assessment at end of treatment and six months after treatment.

      The aim of the treatment will be the prevention of falls.

    <description>Each patient was given a fall diary and was followed for six months with telephone contacts for six months. The patient (or, if unavailable, the spouse or an informed caregiver) was inquired on targeted rehabilitation programs received during the follow up, the use of walking aid and any incurred falls, with date, circumstances, underlying cause and related injuries. A fall was defined as an unexpected event where the person inadvertently came to rest on the ground or other lower level subjects with &gt;1 falls in the 6 months follow up were categorized as &quot;faller&quot;.</description>

    <description>Participants in the experimental intervention group (education group) received an educational program and tailored home exercises. This intervention consist of multiple, interacting components supported by a handbook and audio-video material designed to teach people the skills, techniques, and strategies for preventing falls, and increase social participation and engagement in inactivity of daily living. . After the educational session, two one hour sessions were spent to teach safe balance exercises that were developed in preceding studies, the patient was invited to perform at home for 2 months.</description>
