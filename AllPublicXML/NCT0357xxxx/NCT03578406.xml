  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human papillomavirus infections 16 (HPV16) is known to be a high-risk factor to induce
      cervical cancers. To date, HPV16-related cervical cancer is still a major concern in
      developing countries where vaccination is not prevalent. Concurrent therapies for cervical
      cancers have limited response rate and high chance of relapse. However, HPV16-induced cancers
      provided an ideal target for T cell-based immunotherapy due to the non-self origins.
      Engineered T cells bearing a TCR (TCR-T) that can specifically recognize the presented HPV
      antigen become a viable approach to treat this type of cancer. Though engineered T therapies
      have been well-recognized in hematological cancers, solid cancer treatment has been a major
      hurdle due to the immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment. One key mechanism of
      tumor-elicited suppression is the PDL1-PD1 interaction which induces T cell exhaustion.
      Therefore, TCR-T cells armed with a PD1 antagonist could further enhance the efficacy of
      TCR-T in solid cancers.

Nine patients will be enrolled in this project, using a dose-climbing approach, with every three patients as a group. The first group of patients returned to 5x106/kg TCR-T cells, the second group returned to 1x107/kg TCR-T cells, and the third group returned to 5x107/kg TCR-T cells</description>
