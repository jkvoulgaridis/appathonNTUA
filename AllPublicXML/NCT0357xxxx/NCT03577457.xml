    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to identify any interaction between oxytocin and
      serotonin on neural and behavioral activity related to social reward and decision making by a
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, between-subject, pharmacological fMRI design

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Serotonin and oxytocin have been proved to play an important role in social reward processing
      and decision making in human. The aim of this study is to determine whether they interact in
      those essential human behaviors by a double-blind, placebo-controlled, between-subject,
      pharmacological fMRI design, in which 4 groups of healthy males will be administered with a
      random combination of nasal oxytocin (24 international units, IU) or placebo and acute
      tryptophan depletion (ATD, 75.2g) or placebo (a tryptophan-balanced mixture, 78.2g). The
      social-reward related neural activity and behavior will be assessed by a series of social
      reward task in and out of fMRI scanner and the decision making will be assessed by reversal
      learning task, ultimatum game (UG) and loss aversion task. The interaction between serotonin
      and oxytocin on brain networks will also be tested by resting state.

    <measure>Associations with Personalities of subjects</measure>
    <time_frame>before 30mins ATD or placebo administration</time_frame>
    <description>Personalities of subjects will be measured by a series of scales related to decision making and social reward, such as the Sensitivity to Punishment and Sensitivity to Reward Questionnaire (SPSRQ), which measures participants' sensitivity to reward and punishment. SPSRQ is a self-reported instrument that includes 48 yes/no questions divided into two subscales: Sensitivity to Reward (SR, 24 items, ranging from 0 (insensitive) to 24 (sensitive) to reward) and Sensitivity to Punishment (SP, 24 items, ranging from 0 (insensitive) to 24 (sensitive) to punishment). Associations between individual differences in personalities of subjects and differences in behaviors will be measured.</description>
