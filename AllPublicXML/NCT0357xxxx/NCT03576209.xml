      this trial will consist of 3 visits : Pretest, Posttest and Follow up measurements

        -  Pretest measurements (week 0)

           o Accelerometry : a subsample of participants form intervention and control groups
           (n=100) will be asked to wear an accelerometer (type GT3X) during 7 entire days prior to
           baseline measurements. (Timing : July-August 2018)

           o Baseline measurements : during the start up moment of the program all participants
           from intervention and control groups will be asked : (Timing : September-October 2018)

             -  To fill out the self-reported questionnaire (survey) : the survey is composed of
                existing validated scales : IPAQ, PSQI, SF-12, WEMWBS, HAQ-DI. (references of
                validated scales are provided in the 'outcome measures' section)

             -  To perform a walk test over 20 meters in order to determine the individual stride
                length

             -  To perform a 6 minute walking test in order to self-report perceived exertion and
                physical fitness (by Borg Scale) and to determine the individual entry level of the
                program (entry levels vary between 1-12)

             -  To wear the Pedometer (Omron® Walking Style one 2.0) on a daily basis and register
                the amount of daily steps in their personal registration forms

        -  Posttest measurements (week 12)

             -  Accelerometry : a subsample of participants form intervention and control groups
                (n=100) will be asked to wear an accelerometer (type GT3X®) during 7 days prior to
                posttest measurements. (Timing : October-November 2018)

             -  Posttest measurements : at the end of the program all participants will be asked :

      (Timing : October-December 2018)

        -  To fill out the self-reported questionnaire (survey). In addition to the pretest
           questionnaire, the validated scales ILI, Mael and Ashford (1992) and BREQ-3 will be
           added and will be filled out only by participants of the intervention groups

        -  To perform a 6 minute walking test in order to self-report perceived exertion and
           physical fitness (by Borg Scale)

        -  To inform the investigators on the amount of daily steps (measured with pedometer type :
           Omron® Walking Style one 2.0) during the 12 week program

             -  Focus groups : a subsample will be invited to take part in focus groups. During
                these focus groups, participants will be encouraged to discuss the program and
                possible effects in small groups (5 participants per group). A semi-structured
                interview guide will be used to guide the discussions.

                • Follow-up measurements (1 year after completing the program)

             -  Accelerometry : a subsample of participants form intervention and control groups
                (n=100) will be asked to wear an accelerometer (type GT3X) during 7 days, one year
                after finishing the program (follow up measurements) (Timing : October-November
                2019)

             -  Follow-up measurements : one year after completing the 12 week program, all
                participants will be asked :

      (Timing : October-December 2019)

        -  To fill out the self-reported questionnaire (survey)

        -  To perform a 6 minute walking test in order to self-report perceived exertion and
           physical fitness (by Borg Scale) o Focus groups : a subsample will be invited to take
           part in focus groups. During these focus groups, participants will be encouraged to
           discuss the program and possible effects, 1 year after the program. The focus groups are
           organized in small groups (5 participants per group) and a semi-structured interview
           guide will be used to guide the discussions.

    <intervention_model_description>The described trial is a controlled before-and-after study. In this study, observations are made before and after the implementation of a walking intervention during 12 weeks, both in groups participating in the program (intervention group) and in groups who are not participating in the program (control groups).
Observations are made in intervention and control groups. Participants of the intervention group are registered for participation in this health promotion program 'Lekker Actief' prior to the start of this trial. Participants are already assigned to intervention groups, therefore randomization is determined at individual level. The control groups are composed of participants who are not participating in the program (not receiving any intervention) or the controls are waitlist controls.</intervention_model_description>
