  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nonadherence to medications by patients requiring hemodialysis (HD) leads to unfavorable
      clinical outcomes.Limited data exist on the influence of pharmacists on pharmacoadherence by
      patients requiring HD. Therefore, we assessed the impact of patient-centered pharmacist care
      through the implementation of concepts of Medication Therapy Management (MTM) and
      motivational interview (MI) on pharmacoadherence and its outcomes in patients requiring HD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients were assessed at baseline for baseline characteristics, dialysis-related factors,
      and medications records

        1. Pharmacists conducted brief monthly interview for patients to assess the medications
           they are receiving

        2. A comprehensive interview for patients occurred at month 3 and 5 including concepts of
           MTM and MI

        3. MTM included a review of each participant's medications and personal medication record
           to identify the use of any over-the-counter medications, design of their
           medication-related action plan, formulation of specific therapeutic interventions, and
           referrals for discussion with their physician and subsequent documentation and
           follow-up. The therapeutic interventions accepted by the physician were further
           discussed with each patient/caregiver using the MI technique to encourage adherence and
           this discussion was documented in each patient's medication record.

        4. MI incorporated the main components reported in the literature: rolling with resistance;
           expressing empathy; avoiding argumentative behavior; highlighting the discrepancy
           between patients' current attitudes compared with the desired therapeutic goals; and
           empowering patients' self-efficacy
