  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kangaroo position (KP), the essential component of the Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) method, has
      been increasingly implemented, given the benefits of early skin-to-skin contact on the
      cerebral maturation of preterm infants. In addition it allows for parents to bond with their
      infants and humanize the care of fragile infants in neonatal units. Evidence on kinesthetic
      stimulation (KS) is scarce and currently there is no available evidence on KS during the KP.
      KS is associated with massage in this paper

      The objective is to study the impact of standardized KS delivered either in KP (KSKP) or in
      an incubator (KSI) on the early growth of very preterm infants.

      Patients and methods: Sixty six newborns â‰¤32 weeks of gestational age at birth received KS
      delivered 3 times/day during KP or in an incubator. They were randomized when the infants
      were considered eligibleto initiate KMC which was part of the routine care for all newborns
      in the Neonatal Care Unit (NCU). The primary outcome were the weight gain (g/kg/day) between
      randomization, 5, and 15 days after the start of the intervention and weight at 40 weeks of
      gestational age (term). The secondary outcomes were the same measures according to the
      chronological age (days of life) of the infant at randomization.

    <intervention_model_description>Two interventions groups of 33 each, participated in the study. The first group received Kinesthetic Stimulation in Kangaroo Position (KSKP) and the second group received Kinesthetic Stimulation In incubator (KSI ), both of the interventions were delivered by parents during the period of hospitalization and at home when the infant was discharged from Hospital until 40 weeks of gestational age.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>The nurses who did anthropometrics measures didn't know the interventions assigned to each participant of the study, because the night shift was in charge of taking the data at 7:00 am in the mornings and the interventions were delivered in the morning shifts from 8:00 am until 5:00 pm. No interventions were delivered in the night.</masking_description>

    <description>KSKP was applied daily at regular interval corresponding to the presence of parents. Our protocol is based on the Tiffany Field's protocol with some adjustments corresponding to the constraints of the hospital : the KS was applied 3 times a day and during 15 consecutive days in the hospital or at home and parents were responsible of delivering the intervention. Sunflower oil was used. During the first 5 days, parents performed KSKP with the support of the psychologist. After day 5, parents were expected to perform KSKP by themselves but could ask for help at any moment while in hospital or in the ambulatory follow-up. The KS always began approximately 60 minutes after the feed.</description>

    <description>The infant is in the incubator, unclothed with diaper. Parents delivered KSI with the infant in supine position, stroking with the flats of the fingers with moderate pressure. Five 1-minute intervals, consisting of six 10-s periods of stroking, were applied to the following body regions: head, back, both legs and arms. The same process was repeated in prone position. The last part of the intervention was composed of 6 flexions of each extremity.</description>
