  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic myomectomy represents the fertility-sparing gold standard approach for the
      management of subserosal and intramural uterine myomas: this technique allows faster
      recovery, less complications and improved surgical outcomes than laparotomy.

      Despite these validated cornerstones of minimally invasive gynecology, the best approach for
      specimen retrieval is still debated. Among these approaches, surgical specimen retrieval
      after laparoscopic myomectomy could be performed by mini-laparotomy, by power morcellation
      using morcellator inserted through one of the ancillary trocars, or by transvaginal
      extraction through an endobag inserted at level of the posterior vaginal fornix (between the
      utero-sacral ligaments).

      Unfortunately, mini-laparotomy has poor esthetic outcome and does not conform the current
      standards of minimally invasive surgery.

      In addition, on 24 November 24 2014 the Food and Drug Administration updated a Safety
      Communication about Power Morcellation, warning against the use of laparoscopic power
      morcellators in the majority of women undergoing myomectomy or hysterectomy for treatment of
      fibroids, due to the risk of spreading an unsuspected uterine sarcoma within the abdomen and
      pelvis.

      Considering this scenario, transvaginal extraction may represents a feasible approach for
      specimen retrieval. In this view, the current study aims to retrospectively compare surgical
      outcomes in women that underwent laparoscopic myomectomy with subsequent power morcellation
      (before the issuing of the abovementioned Safety Communication by the Food and Drug
      Administration) or transvaginal extraction (after the issuing of the abovementioned Safety
      Communication by the Food and Drug Administration) of the surgical specimens.
