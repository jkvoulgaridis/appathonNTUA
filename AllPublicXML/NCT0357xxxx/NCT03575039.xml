      A prospective, single arm clinical investigation evaluating safety and
      effectiveness/performance of the Microport CardioFlow VitaFlowTM II - Transcatheter Aortic
      Valve System for the treatment of symptomatic severe aortic stenosis via transcatheter access
      in increased surgical risk patients

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, single arm and controlled clinical investigation compared
      to recent historical results. The purpose is to evaluate the safety, performance and efficacy
      of the VitaflowTM II Transcatheter Aortic Valve system.

      The entire system including valve system, delivery system and introducer system. We will
      implant the valve system into subjects and followed up them for 5 years after the procedure.
      This clinical trial will be conducted in 15 sites in Europe.

    <description>Use the questions and score system to evaluate life quality of subjects at each The descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. This decision results in a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state.</description>
