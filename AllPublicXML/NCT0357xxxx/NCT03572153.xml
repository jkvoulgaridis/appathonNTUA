    <textblock>
      The long-term goal of this program of research is to determine safe and effective
      non-hormonal interventions for menopausal symptoms. The main goal of this study is to
      evaluate whether self-administered hypnosis can be used to significantly reduce hot flashes
      more than self-administered white noise hypnosis over 6 weeks of home practice. The
      investigators are also examining the impact of each hypnosis group on sleep, anxiety,
      perceived and measured stress, heart rate variability, and daily activities.

      This randomized, two arm clinical trial will evaluate the efficacy of self-administered
      hypnosis for the treatment of hot flashes in postmenopausal women using a 1:1 randomization
      schedule.

      Primary Objective

      To evaluate the efficacy of the self-administered hypnosis intervention for hot flashes
      compared to the self-administered white noise hypnosis.

      Hypothesis 1: Self-administered hypnosis will significantly decrease vasomotor symptoms (hot
      flash score of frequency and severity) compared to the self-administered white noise hypnosis
      at 6 weeks.

      Secondary Objectives

      To evaluate the efficacy of the self-administered hypnosis compared to self-administered
      white noise hypnosis for hot flash activity interference, sleep disturbance, anxiety and
      perception of benefit; with the expectation that there will be significant improvements among
      participants in the self-administered hypnosis group when compared with the self-administered
      white noise hypnosis group at 6 weeks. The investigators will also evaluate the effects of
      self-administered hypnosis compared to the self-administered white noise hypnosis at 12 weeks
      for all secondary outcomes except perception of benefit. Additionally, mediators (perceived
      stress, cortisol, and heart rate variability (HRV)) and moderators (hypnotizability and
      practice adherence) of hot flash reduction will be explored.

      Hypothesis 2.1: Compared to self-administered white noise hypnosis, the self-administered
      hypnosis intervention will result in significant improvements in hot flash activity
      interference, sleep disturbance, and anxiety at 6 and 12 weeks, and perception of benefit at
      6 weeks.

      Hypothesis 2.2 A decrease in perceived stress will be indicated in the self-administered
      hypnosis group due to the intervention, which will correspond and contribute to further
      decrease of the hot flash score at 6 and 12 weeks.

      Hypothesis 2.3 Diurnal salivary cortisol will demonstrate better circadian rhythms (steeper
      slopes) in those with larger hot flash reductions and in the self-administered hypnosis group
      compared to participants in the self-administered white noise hypnosis at 6 weeks.

      Hypothesis 2.4 Self-administration of hypnosis and greater hot flash reductions will result
      in higher resting and 24-hour parasympathetic activity, reflected as higher HRV at 6 weeks.

      Hypothesis 2.5 Higher hypnotizability scores and better adherence rates will be associated
      with greater reductions in hot flash scores in the self-administered hypnosis group.

      Hypothesis 2.6 Self-administered hypnosis will significantly decrease vasomotor symptoms (hot
      flash score of frequency and severity) compared to the self-administered white noise hypnosis
      at 12 weeks.

      Recruitment Plan

      Potential participants will be identified in three ways: postcard mailings and invitation
      letters; physician referrals and IRB approved chart screening; and flyers, advertisements and
      press releases. Physician referrals will come primarily from cancer centers at University of
      Michigan Cancer Center Breast Clinic in Ann Arbor, MI, and the Baylor Scott &amp; White Health
      Center in Waco, TX.

      At Michigan, key eligibility criteria will be used to identify potential eligible women
      through the Honest Broker Office. Charts will be further screened, with IRB approval, for
      eligibility. If eligible, women will be sent an invitation letter where they can opt in or
      out of being contacted to learn more about the study.

      In addition, at Michigan, outreach will occur through obstetrics and gynecology, mammography,
      and internal medicine clinics to enable recruitment of women without a history of breast
      cancer. Mass mailings and local advertisement may also be used.

      At Baylor University, a successful and proven method of accrual has been the use of mass
      mailings and local advertisement (e.g. newspaper, magazines, flyers). Additionally, Dr.
      Elkins is a medical associate with Baylor Scott &amp; White Health Center, which provides a
      direct connection with physicians and medical staff who will provide potential referrals.

      It is expected that each site (Baylor University and University of Michigan) will recruit
      approximately half of the participants. Accrual will be closely monitored and efforts to
      randomize an equal number at each site will be made.

      The study coordinators will provide education about the trial and a consent form for review
      both by phone and at the baseline/consent session. All other education beyond the baseline
      data collection will be provided at the second session 7-30 days later. Both sessions will be
      between 45-60 minutes. Sessions will be held at Dr. Barton's and Dr. Elkin's research
      offices, which each provide privacy, a recliner, a relaxing environment, and convenient
      parking.

    <measure>Hot Flash Daily Diary</measure>
    <time_frame>Daily for 8 total weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A Hot Flash Daily Diary will be used to measure the primary outcome of hot flash score. Participants will be asked to complete the Hot Flash Daily Diary every day for 8 weeks total to measure the daily frequency and severity (mild, moderate, severe, and very severe) of their hot flashes. Each level of severity is given a value and participants will rate the severity of each hot flash as they experience it and record it in their daily diary. A total hot flash score will be calculated for each participant.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hot Flash Related Daily Interference Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 &amp; 12-Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This is a 10-item scale that measures hot flash interference. The Hot Flash Related Daily Interference Scale asks respondents to rate the degree on a 0 (not at all) - 10 (very much so) scale that the hot flashes interfere with various daily activities as well as overall enjoyment or quality of life. The total score will range from 0-100. The higher the total score, the more likely hot flashes are interfering with the daily activities.This measure has been shown to be valid and internally consistent with Cronbach's alpha of .96.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Emotional Distress Anxiety Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 &amp; 12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This 29-item scale measures 5 domains of anxiety: 1) affective, 2)cognitive, 3) somatic, 4) behavioral, and 5) need for treatment. Items are scored on a scale from 1 (never) - 5 (always) with higher scores reflecting more severe anxiety. The total range for this scale is 0-145. This scale has shown excellent convergent and discriminate validity with other measures with a Cronbach's alpha .95.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6, &amp; 12 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>This is a 19-item self-report inventory designed to measure sleep disturbance. The 19 items are grouped into 7 sub-scales: 1) sleep quality; 2) sleep efficiency; 3) daytime dysfunction; 4) sleep latency; 5) sleep disturbances; 6) sleep duration; and 7) use of sleep medication.These seven sub-scales are scored on a scale of 0 (better) - 3 (worse) with higher scores indicating greater sleep pathology. The sub-scales are then added for a combined total score ranging from 0 (better) - 21 (worse). Alphas for the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index range from .70 to .80.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subject Global Impression of Change</measure>
    <time_frame>This will be completed only at 6 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>This is a 7-point item in which participants rate the change in hot flashes since beginning the study (ranging from 'very much better', 'moderately better', 'a little better', 'about the same', 'a little worse', 'moderately worse', to 'very much worse'). It has been used extensively for determination of minimally clinically significant differences in numerous oncology clinical trials.Four additional investigator-developed questions about satisfaction are included as well as two questions about the use of the audio recordings.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Diurnal Cortisol Rhythm</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline &amp; 6 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Saliva will be collected three times a day over two consecutive days at two time points during the study. Participants will be provided specific directions for the collection of saliva upon awakening (before getting out of bed), 30 minutes later (before eating, drinking, or tooth brushing), and finally at bedtime (around 10 pm, also before tooth brushing) and will be given a Saliva Collection Diary with questions to answer about their saliva collection. This procedure is well-established and considered valid for the measurement of diurnal cortisol rhythm.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Measures of Heart Rate Variability</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline &amp; 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The shift in autonomic balance from sympathetic dominance (stress response) to parasympathetic dominance (relaxation response) is a very likely candidate for the underlying mechanism of the effects of mind-body interventions on vasomotor symptoms. Relatedly, an increasing body of evidence indicates that hot flash events are associated with changes in heart rate variability.
The Polar V800, a mobile HRV recording device, will be worn to collect data over a 24-hour natural ambulatory period as well as two supine standardized 6-minute recording during the two days of cortisol collection. The 24hr and 6 min measurements will be completed (each on separate days) at pre and post-trial.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived Stress Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6, &amp; 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This is a 10-item scale that measures the degree to which situations in one's life are appraised as stressful. The scale provides the degree to which individuals find their lives to be unpredictable, uncontrollable, and overloaded, as well as measures the current levels of experienced stress. Items are scored on a scale from 0 (never) - 4(very often) for a total score ranging from 0-40. with higher scores reflecting more perceived stress. This measure has been shown to be valid and internally consistent, with an alpha of .83.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-Hypnosis Practice Log</measure>
    <time_frame>Daily during weeks 1-6 of the intervention and during week 12.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants in both groups will be given a log that will be completed daily. The log will provide space to put the date, whether or not the participant listened to their audio recording, the number of times they practiced (with or without the audio recordings), and provide a space for comments about any interruptions or barriers to listening to their assigned recording.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Elkins Hypnotizability Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>At Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>This is a 12-item research assistant administered scale for rating hypnotizability in the general population. The total scale ranges from 0-12. Each item is rated pass/fail, with higher scores indicative of greater hypnotizability. This scale has an excellent reliability with a Cronbach's alpha of .94.</description>
