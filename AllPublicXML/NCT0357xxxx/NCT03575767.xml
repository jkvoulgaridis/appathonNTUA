  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Graft-versus-Host Disease (GVHD) and relapse, which is mainly due to lack of
      Graft-versus-Leukemia (GVL), are the most frequent and severe complications of allogeneic
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). T cells expanded from mature T cells in
      the graft play a dominant role in development of GVHD and GVL early after allo-HSCT. Recent
      applications of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) to the T cells repertoire open a new avenue
      for us to look deeply into how these T cells dynamically adjust in the context of the
      recipient's environment.

      The main goal of this research study is to set up a mathematical model based on T cell
      receptor (TCR) sequencing to enable prediction for the key immunologic outcomes early
      post-transplantation. This study will deepen the understanding of the molecular mechanisms
      driving the most deadly post-transplantation complications, and serve as convincing evidence
      upon which to choose a better donor and a more proper transplantation approach.

      This observational trial will perform HTS for TCR β-chain complementarity determining region
      3 (CDR3) repertoires of grafts and peripheral blood samples from recipients
      post-transplantation and analyze the relationship between dynamics of TCR CDR3 repertoires
      and clinical outcomes early post-transplantation, especially including GVHD and relapse. The
      investigators want to know how the antigen environment in recipients drives dynamics of
      mature T cells from grafts in order to use the new discovered rules to better predict and
      treat the disease process.
