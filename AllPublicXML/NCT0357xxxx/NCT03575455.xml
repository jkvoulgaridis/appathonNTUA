      Determine the safety and efficacy of sub-maximal aerobic exercise during the subacute phase
      of recovery following sport-related concussion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the proposed study is to determine is exercise during the first 3-7
      days following a sport-related concussion can help improve the systemic neurological
      dysfunction following a concussion while examining the safety and efficacy of a 20-minute,
      low- to moderate-intensity (40-60% of HRMAX) controlled treadmill aerobic exercise as a
      therapeutic modality to improve cardiovascular, psychological, vestibulo-ocular, autonomic,
      and cognitive function.
