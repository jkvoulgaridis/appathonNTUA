    <description>12-week program of dietary behavior modification treatment (LEVA-method by Bertz et al, Am J Clin Nutr 2012;96:698.), leading to 6 kg weight loss (0.5 kg per week) and a healthier diet (less sugar, snacks, full fat products, more vegetables and fruit, smaller portion sizes). Weight is monitored by phone contact every second week. After 12 weeks, the women are followed up by e-mail contact for 9 additional months.</description>
