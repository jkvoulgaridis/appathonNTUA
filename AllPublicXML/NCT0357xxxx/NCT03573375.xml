      If participant agrees to take part in this study, participant will complete a series of
      questionnaires about exercise and participant's symptoms and physical abilities. These should
      take about 5 minutes to complete.

      Additionally, demographic information (such as participant's age, race, sex, zip code,
      specifics about participant's cancer type and care) will be collected from participant's
      medical record.

      Participant will complete the questionnaires 1 time, and participation in this study will be
      over after that.
