  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a supine MRI obtained immediately after a
      standard diagnostic prone MRI exam, without a second injection of gadolinium (Gd) contrast
      material, would be of sufficient quality to allow the Radiologist to define the tumor edges
      (&quot;segment&quot; the tumor) so that a 3-D image of the tumor can be generated to form a BCL.

      The purpose of this study is to find out whether additional MRI images taken with patients in
      a different position after completing a standard MRI are of sufficient quality to allow a
      radiologist to identify the edges of the tumor.

      These additional MRI images will only take about 10-15 minutes to obtain and will not require
      a second injection of contrast material.The information gathered in this study will make it
      more feasible to use a new device called the &quot;breast cancer locator&quot; to help surgeons more
      accurately remove breast cancers.

    <description>The patient will be placed in the prone position and undergo a standard Gd contrast-enhanced bilateral breast MRI. Immediately after the prone MRI is completed, the patient will be repositioned for the supine MRI. Prior to starting the prone MRI, the study MRI technician/investigator will explain to the patient and practice with the patient the steps needed to transition from the prone to the supine MRI, so as to facilitate a timely transition. Additional MRI images will only take about 10-15 minutes to obtain and will not require a second injection of contrast material.</description>
