  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In industrialized nations diabetic retinopathy(DR) is the most frequent microvascular
      complication of type 2 diabetes mellitus and the leading cause of visual impairment and
      blindness in the working-age population. The well-accepted strategy for prevention and
      treatment of diabetic eye complications focused on confirmed diabetic retinopathy, diabetic
      macular edema, cataract, etc, and there was no definitive therapy for preclinical central
      visual acuity (CVA) impairment, mainly because of its unknown pathogenesis. In our previous
      population-based study, the prevalence rate of early CVA impairment was as high as 9.1%, and
      that obviously limits the effects of diabetic eye diseases prevention and early-stage
      treatment strategy. Of note, the choriocapillaris is the only route for metabolic exchange in
      the retina within the foveal avascular zone, it was speculated that early CVA impairment is
      related to diabetic choroidopathy (DC). Recent research shows that the decreased macular
      choriocapillaris vessel density (MCVD) in diabetic eye ,which indicating early ischemia, is
      already present before diabetic macular edema can be observed; we have observed subfoveal
      choroidal thickness (SFCT) decreased significantly in the early CVA impairment patients.
      However, up til now, there was no epidemiology report on early CVA impairment in Chinese
      diabetes population. In the present study, we plan to conduct a 10-year perspective cohort
      observation of 2217 Chinese type 2 diabetic residents without diabetic retinopathy, diabetic
      macular edema, cataract and other vision impairing diseases, trying to find out related
      physical and biochemical risk factors. The results will facilitate discriminating high risk
      groups of early CVA impairment in diabetic patients. In the same time, a quantitative
      relationship between SFCT change, MCVD change and CVA change will be established. This study
      will demonstrate the role of DC in the occurrence of preclinical CVA impairment, and provide
      important theoretic evidence of blocking agents which target on DC.
