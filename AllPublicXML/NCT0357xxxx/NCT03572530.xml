  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to determine the optimum dose frequency of 5-Azacytidin (5-AZA) infusions
      into the fourth ventricle of the brain. The study's primary objective is to establish the
      maximum tolerated dose for infusions of 5-Azacytidine into the fourth ventricle in patients
      with recurrent ependymoma. The study's secondary objective is to assess the antitumor
      activity of 5-Azacytidine infusions into the fourth ventricle based upon imaging studies and
      cytology.

    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Dose-limiting toxicity will be defined as any of the following events:
New neurological deficit (grade 3 or higher) probably or definitely attributed to intraventricular 5-azacytidine infusions.
New adverse event involving any organ probably or definitely attributed to intraventricular 5-azacytidine infusions with the specific exclusion of: Grade 3 or higher nausea and vomiting &lt; 3 days duration and grade 3 or higher headache &lt; 3 days duration.</description>

    <measure>Number of participants with disease progression as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day after surgery to remove tumor (which is about 1 week before the first infusion)</time_frame>
    <description>The PI and radiologist will determine Response to treatment according to the following three categories. Disease progression corresponds with the &quot;Progressive Disease&quot; category.
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-target lesions. Stable Disease (SD) / Incomplete Response (IR): The persistence of one or more non-target lesions.
Progressive Disease (PD): The appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.</description>

             gm/dL (may receive RBC transfusions)
