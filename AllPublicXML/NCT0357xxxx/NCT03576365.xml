  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to pilot test a version of the intervention that has been
      tailored for participants with dysphonia. The study seeks to determine if the adapted
      intervention: a) increases perceived control over voice-related stressors and b) decreases
      stress and distress resulting from voice problems. The study will also explore the usability
      and acceptability of the program. The goal is to help people with voice problems achieve
      better voice and quality of life outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the investigator's voice clinic, a high prevalence of severe distress has been identified.
      Distress and voice handicap were positively correlated, and perceived control moderated the
      relationship. Perceived control is associated with less distress in a variety of medical
      conditions, has an impact beyond that of coping and personality, and can be increased via
      targeted intervention.

      This is a randomized controlled trial. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the
      two groups. Both groups involve completing surveys and receiving information online about
      voice problem.

      Participants complete an initial baseline assessment focused on voice function and emotions,
      including items from the Perceived Control Scale, Voice Handicap Index-10, Perceived Stress
      Scale, Brief Symptom Inventory-18. Finally, the participants will complete some brief
      feedback questions about the material.

      Next, twice a week for up to three weeks participants will complete check-ins from the online
      program. Participants in the intervention arm will complete self-guided exercises and brief
      assessment questions. Participants in the information-only arm will complete mini knowledge
      quizzes.

      All participants will complete brief a post-intervention assessment parallel to the baseline
      assessment. Lastly, they will have an opportunity to provide final feedback on their
      experience.

      Follow-up with each participant will occur one and three months after finishing the program.
      Questionnaires will be sent via email including Voice Handicap Index-10, Present Perceived
      Control-8, and questions regarding treatment adherence and voice outcomes.

    <measure>Perceived Control</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline assessment using a questionnaire, Perceived Present Control-8 (PPC-8).
The PPC-8 questionnaire has 8 questions about perceptions of present control over their voice problem, assessed on a 4-point Likert-type scale, with scores of 1-4 (1=Strongly Disagree, 2=Disagree Somewhat, 3=Agree Somewhat, 4=Strongly Agree). Total scores range from 1-32. Higher scores indicate more perceived control over the patient's voice problems.</description>

    <measure>Voice Handicap</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline assessment using a questionnaire, Voice Handicap Index-10 (VHI-10).
The VHI-10 questionnaire has 10 questions about voice problems and the effect it has on the patients life, assessed on a 4-point Likert-type scale, with scores of 0-4 (0=Never, 1=Almost Never, 2=Sometimes, 3=Almost Always, 4=Always). Total scores range from 0-40. Higher scores indicate a more problematic voice. The clinical cutoff for a problematic voice is a VHI-10 score of 10, where scores &gt;10 indicate voice problems. A change of at least 6 points is clinically significant.</description>

    <measure>Perceived Stress</measure>
    <time_frame>2 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline assessment using a questionnaire, Perceived Stress Scale-4 (PSS-4).
The PSS-4 questionnaire has 4 questions about perceived stress, assessed on a 5-point Likert-type scale, with scores of 0-4 (0=Never, 1=Almost Never, 2=Sometimes, 3=Fairly Often, 4=Very Often). Total scores range from 0-16. Higher scores indicate more perceived stress in the patient's life.</description>

    <measure>Psychological Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline assessment using a questionnaire, Brief Symptom Inventory-18 (BSI-18).
The BSI-18 questionnaire has 18 questions about psychological symptoms, assessed on a 5-point Likert-type scale, with scores of 0-4 (0=Not at all, 1=A little bit, 2=Moderately, 3=Quite a bit, 4=Extremely). Total scores range from 0-72. Higher scores indicate more extreme psychological symptoms. Patients with &quot;High Risk&quot; psychological symptoms have a score of 57 (75 percentile) or greater.</description>

    <measure>Patients' Adherence to Voice Therapy and Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Examine treatment adherence indicators available in the participants' medical charts after intervention is completed (e.g.., did they attend recommended speech therapy sessions, how adherent were they to their speech therapy exercise regimens, how many visits did it take for them to reach treatment goals). This will be assessed through a medical chart review and reported as a percent of sessions attended, percent exercises completed, and number of visits. All measures will be given equal weight and be used together to assess treatment adherence.</description>
