  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several studies show how patients with hyperoxia after cardiac arrest has increased
      mortality, but the association of hyperoxia before cardiac arrest and myocardial damage has
      never been investigated. Neither has the association between hyperoxia after cardiac arrest
      and myocardial injury.

      Our research hypothesis is that hyperoxia before cardiac arrest aggravates myocardial damage,
      secondly we wish to analyze the association between hyperoxia after cardiac arrest and
      myocardial injury.

      The exposure variables is oxygenation within 48 hours before and 48 hours after cardiac
      arrest, our primary outcome is myocardial damage and will be measured as peak troponin within
      30 days after cardiac arrest.
