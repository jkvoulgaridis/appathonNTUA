  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antibiotics like enrofloxacin are widely used in animal farming to treat and prevent
      bacterial infections. A previous study in poultry farms has shown that yardmen show
      significant concentrations of administered antibiotics in their urine. It is currently
      unclear how poultry yardmen are exposed to the administered antibiotics. The objective of
      this exemplarily study is to obtain information on the pharmacokinetics of the different
      uptake routes (oral, inhaled or dermal).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study subjects will be exposed to enrofloxacin at a concentration level representative for
      occupational exposure of yardmen at poultry farms.

      As three uptake-routes, oral, inhalation and dermal, are conceivable all three cases will be
      investigated. After administration blood and urine samples will be analysed for enrofloxacin
      and its main metabolite ciprofloxacin at several time points. The objective of this
      exemplarily study is to obtain information on the pharmacokinetics of the different uptake
      routes. If different exposure routes are characterized by different pharmacokinetics, such
      studies can be used to obtain a better understanding of general routes of exposure in
      occupational environments. On the basis of the results mitigation strategies can be
      developed, reducing the risk of exposure.

    <intervention_model_description>The subjects are exposed to 250 µg of enrofloxacin on three different dosing days that are separated by at least 7 days. On the first dosing day, enrofloxacin is administered via the dermal route. On the second dosing day, enrofloxacin is administered via inhalation of 5 mL solution in a concentration of 50 µg/mL by an ultrasonic nebulizer. On the third dosing day, enrofloxacin is administered orally as a 20 mL solution in a concentration of 12.5 µg/mL.</intervention_model_description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Volunteers who are overtly healthy as determined by medical evaluation including
             medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests (including a normal
             coagulation profile), ECGs, vital signs and spirometry.

          -  Normal spirometry FEV1 (Forced Expiratory Volume in the first second)≥80% of
             predicted, FEV1/Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) ratio ≥70%) at screening

          -  Non-smokers for at least one year and with a smoking history of less than 5 pack-years
             [number of pack years = (number of cigarettes per day/20) x number of years smoked].

          -  Body weight of ≥50 kg and a body mass index BMI (body mass index) of 20 to 24.9 kg/m2

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Significant history of or current cardiovascular, respiratory (eg asthma, chronic
             obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), bronchiectasis, active Tuberculosis [TB]),
             hepatic, renal, gastrointestinal, endocrine, hematological, autoimmune or neurological
