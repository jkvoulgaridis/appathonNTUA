  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Operations of oral maxillofacial surgery cause the blood escape into stomach and trachea.
      Therefore, throat packing is applied. Endotracheal tube cuff is not protective from
      aspiration. While packing is preventing blood leakage, it may cause postoperative pain due to
      the pressure. Packing placed between oropharynx and hypopharynx before surgery to prevent
      leakage to stomach and trachea. The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of two
      packing types in throat pain.
