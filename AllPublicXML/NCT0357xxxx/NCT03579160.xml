  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of topical beta-blockers, such as 0.25% timolol, in promoting wound healing is
      currently emerging in the academic literature. The investigators will enroll 82 patients who
      have their skin cancer surgically removed resulting in the need of a full-thickness skin
      graft. The objective of this randomized safety study is to determine the safety and efficacy
      of 0.25% timolol in promoting wound healing in full-thickness skin grafts compared to
      standard of care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The role of topical beta-blockers in promoting wound healing is currently emerging in the
      international literature. β2-Adrenergic receptors (B2AR) are the only subtype of
      beta-adrenoceptors expressed on skin. They can be found in secretory coil of apocrine glands,
      keratinocytes, fibroblasts and melanocytes. The distribution of these receptors provides
      insight on dermatological disorders that may be affected by β-blockers. Keratinocyte
      migration occurs by the facilitation of chemotaxis, the polarization of cells, and activation
      of extracellular signal-related kinases essential in the signaling of promigratory pathways.
      The B2AR activation inhibits keratinocyte migration by activating the serine/threonine
      phosphatase-2a, which downregulates phosphorylation of extracellular signal-related kinases
      necessary for migration. Therefore, B2AR antagonists prevent the phosphorylation of
      phosphatase-2a and have the downstream effect of extracellular signal-related kinase
      promotion, inducing a promigratory pathway in keratinocytes. Keratinocyte migration also
      occurs by galvanotaxis, a phenomenon in which cells migrate in response to electric stimuli.
      Keratinocytes can be stimulated to migrate with the formation of electrical poles and the
      application of electrical fields. The B2AR antagonists improve the ability of keratinocytes
      to respond to such migratory cues, whereas the B2AR agonists decrease keratinocytes' ability
      to respond, further implicating the use of topical timolol for recalcitrant wounds.
      Angiogenesis and dermal fibroblast proliferation are also regulated by B2ARs. The B2AR
      antagonists have been found to promote angiogenesis in chick chorioallantoic membrane assays
      and in vivo murine wound models. Dermal fibroblast migration is also increased (by 27%) when
      exposed to B2AR antagonists, and epidermal differentiation is improved with B2AR antagonists
      and β1- and β2-receptor antagonists.

      Full-thickness skin grafts (FTSG) are one of the most commonly performed procedures in
      dermatologic, plastic and burn surgery. Various experimental approaches to optimize the
      healing of FTSG receiving sites have been described; however, no clearly superior and easily
      applicable method has gained wide acceptance in daily practice.

      As indicated by preliminary evidence in other wound healing endeavors, 0.25% timolol gel may
      represent a commercially available, safe and simple, painless and relatively inexpensive
      treatment for improving healing of FTSG receiving site, as well as for improving cosmetic
      long term outcomes.

      To assess the efficacy and safety of topically applied 0.25% timolol gel in promoting wound
      healing in FTSG receiving site versus standard of care (SOC) by:

        1. Evaluating healing in response to treatment with 0.25% topical timolol gel versus SOC in
           terms of wound surface area and Graft Take Score at the receiving site of a FTSG at 7
           and 14 days;

        2. Evaluating cosmetic outcomes of the receiving site of a FTSG in terms of blinded
           physician (Vancouver Scar Scale, VSS) and patient (Visual Analogue Scale, VAS)
           assessment at 3 and 6 months' follow up;

        3. Evaluating the need for further scar revision (dermabrasion or pulsed dye laser [PDL])
           at the 6-month follow up;

        4. Evaluating patient discomfort during the healing process by means of a patient pain VAS;
           and

        5. Determining the side effects associated with 0.25% timolol gel versus SOC

    <intervention_model_description>The protocol will begin post-surgery. Eligible subjects will be assigned by computer-based randomization to case (0.25% timolol gel) or control (standard of care [SOC]) group and treated as follows:
Receiving site of FTSG/case group:
During surgery: application of 0.25% timolol gel (2 drops per cm2) on wound bed before FTSG is placed
During surgery: application of 0.25% timolol gel (2 drops per cm2) over FTSG after insetting of the graft
After bolster removal (7 days): daily cleansing and daily 0.25% timolol (2 drops per cm2) application for 4 weeks
Receiving site of FTSG/control group:
FTSG surgery as per SOC

    <description>A study physician will review the healed scar site to determine if there are potential cosmetic factors that could be improved through scar revision.

    <measure>Evaluating cosmetic outcomes of the receiving site of a FTSG via Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months' post-surgery and 6 months' post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Physician blinded to subject's treatment group uses VSS which documents scar appearance change over time via photos. VSS ranges from 0 (most desirable outcome) to 13 (least desirable). A lower score is considered a better outcome and a higher score is a worse outcome. VSS consists of 4 sub-scales, with each reporting a value. The &quot;pigmentation&quot; ranges from 0 (normal pigment) to 2 (hyperpigment); &quot;vascularity&quot; ranges from 0 (normal appearance) to 3 (purple appearance); &quot;pliability&quot; ranges from 0 (normal) to 5 (contracture); &quot;height&quot; ranges from 0 (normal/flat) to 3 (&gt;5mm). Sub-scale scores are combined to give an overall VSS score.</description>

    <time_frame>3 months' post-surgery and 6 months' post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Scar VAS rates subjects' graft cosmetic appearance. Each question ranges from 1 (no complaints w/ itch or pain/as normal skin) to 10 (worst imaginable itch or pain/very different from normal skin). Ranges from 6 (best outcome score) to 66 (worst outcome score); a lower score is considered a better outcome and a higher score is considered a worse outcome.</description>

    <time_frame>7 days post-surgery, and 14 days post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The Graft Take Score will be used to assess amount of graft take at each visit. Graft take is considered &quot;Good&quot; if 90%+ of the graft site is healed and pink/purple in color; &quot;Moderate&quot; if there is 50% healing, pink or purple in color, and &gt;50% of the graft has taken; and &quot;Poor&quot; if &lt;50% graft take.</description>

    <time_frame>7 days post-surgery, and 14 days post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Histogram planimetry is more accessible than automated analysis software programs, and it is based on the pixel count of a selected irregular area which is divided by the pixel count of 1 cm2 to find a result in terms of cm2 or mm2.</description>

    <time_frame>7 days' post-surgery, 14 days' post-surgery, 30 days' post-surgery, 3 months' post-surgery, 6 months' post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will be asked to complete a Visual Analogue Scale for scar assessment to rate how they think their graft sites appear cosmetically compared to normal skin, and any complaints about how painful they sites are, and how itchy they feel. Each question ranges from 1 (no complaints with itch or pain/as normal skin) to 10 (worst imaginable itch or pain/very different from normal skin). The score ranges from 6 (best outcome score) to 66 (worst outcome score), thus a lower score is considered to have a better outcome and a higher score is considered a worse outcome.</description>
