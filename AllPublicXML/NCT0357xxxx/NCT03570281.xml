  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: Cancer-related hypercoagulability plays an important role in the development of
      cancer-related stroke. With rapidly aging population and increasing cancer prevalence, cancer
      related stroke has become an important stroke subtype. Recent studies suggest that
      hypercoagulability is associated with poor prognosis and effective correction of coagulopathy
      maybe protective for survival in cancer related stroke patients. Optimal strategies to
      correct coagulopathy in cancer stroke patient remains to be determined. Currently, the use of
      low molecular-weighted heparin is recommended in these patients, but non-vitamin K oral
      anticoagulants (NOACs) could be safe alternative without the need for injection
      subcutaneously. Furthermore, NOACs could be an optimal treatment strategy for cancer-related
      stroke in terms of correcting coagulopathy with less injection related complication (ex. pain
      and infection) compared to Enoxaparin.
