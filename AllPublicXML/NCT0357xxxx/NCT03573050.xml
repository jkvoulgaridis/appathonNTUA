  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present clinical trial will be conducted to compare the bioavailability of rivastigmine
      and assess bioequivalence at steady-state of the Test product RIV-TDS 13.3 mg/24 h and the
      marketed Reference product Exelon® 13.3 mg/24 hours transdermal patch after multiple patch
      application. Each of both treatments will last 5 days.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single centre, open-label, randomised (order of treatments), balanced,
      2-period, 2-sequence, cross-over trial with multiple applications of rivastigmine transdermal
      patches. There will be no wash-out, i.e. the first investigational patch application of the
      second study period will take place the day of the last investigational patch removal of the
      first study period (direct switch-over).

      Prior to start of first treatment, there will be an adaptation phase with 4 consecutive
      applications of Exelon® 9.5 mg/24 hours transdermal patch over a period of 4 days (each patch
      will be applied for 24 hours). Following the removal of the last investigational patch in
      period II, there will be a post-treatment tapering phase with 2 consecutive applications of
      Exelon® 9.5 mg/24 hours transdermal patch over a period of 2 days (each patch will be applied
      for 24 hours).

      Furthermore, during the adaptation phase, both study periods and the tapering phase,
      scopolamine transdermal patches will be applied as co-medication to attenuate effects of
      rivastigmine and reduce Adverse Events.
