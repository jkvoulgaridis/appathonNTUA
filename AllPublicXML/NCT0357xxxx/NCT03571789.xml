      Vine™ is a permanent carotid filter designed to provide protection against embolic stroke in
      people with atrial fibrillation. It is implanted bilaterally in the common carotid arteries
      from a thin needle under ultrasound guidance. The procedure is performed without general
      anesthesia and takes minutes. The safety, feasibility and tolerability of Vine™ will be
      evaluated. Patients who are eligible will receive Vine™ and will be followed-up for a year
      after device implantation.

      CAPTURE is a prospective, single-arm, multicenter trial, designed to evaluate the safety,
      feasibility and tolerability of the Vine™ permanent carotid filter. The trial will enroll up
      to 30 patients, and will be conducted in up to five sites worldwide. All enrolled patients
      will be invited for non-invasive follow-up tests and clinical evaluations according to the
      study protocol.

    <description>Vine™ is a permanent carotid filter made from a single nitinol wire. It is configured to capture emboli exceeding 1.2mm in size, which originate in the heart and large arteries below the neck. Vine™ has a helical structure, with leading and supporting coils interposed by a filter section.</description>

    <description>The Vine™ is made of a super-elastic nitinol wire comprises a helix that resides within the CCA lumen and a linear stem that traverses the CCA wall. The helix includes three segments: supporting coils, filter, and leading coils.
The device is available in sizes of 6.0mm - 10.0mm (in 0.5mm intervals) to accommodate individual CCA diameters</description>
