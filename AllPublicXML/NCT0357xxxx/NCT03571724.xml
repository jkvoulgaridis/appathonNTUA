  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the impact of switching from usual brand cigarettes to very low nicotine
      cigarettes on cigarette consumption, smoking behavior, and biomarkers of exposure.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Very low nicotine (VLN) cigarettes contain a 'non-additive' level of nicotine. This study
      will switch smokers from their usual brand to VLN cigarettes. Periodically during the study
      the investigators will collect blood and measure nicotine exposure and also other biomarkers
      to see what effect switching has. The participants will also use a diary to record number of
      cigarettes smoked. Cigarette butts will also be collected.

    <description>Subjects will answer a MNWA-R questionnaire. The MNWA is considered as the briefest scale among the self-report measures of nicotine withdrawal symptoms currently available. The original MNWA was developed by Hughes and Hatsukami in 1986. It consisted of nine nicotine withdrawal symptoms including craving. The scale was modified to reflect changes made in the fourth edition of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) criteria for nicotine withdrawal. The total score of the scale range from 0 to 36 depending on participant's rate for the symptoms as not present (0), slight (1), mild (2), moderate (3), and severe (4). A high total score implies high nicotine addiction.</description>
