  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Creating or improving urban green space has the potential to be an effective and
      sustainable way to increase physical activity and improve other aspects of wellbeing in older
      adults. However, the size and quality of the existing evidence base is weak. There is
      particularly a lack of studies on older adults and in the United Kingdom. This study aims to
      evaluate the effect of four small local street greening intervention projects on older
      adults' physical activity and wellbeing over a one-year period. The street greening includes
      tree and flower planting, and artificial tree decorations. These projects are based in a
      deprived urban neighbourhood in Greater Manchester, United Kingdom.

      Methods: Eight unimproved comparison sites were selected to compare with the intervention
      sites. The researchers will measure physical activity and two other behavioural indicators of
      wellbeing (Connect: connecting with other people; and Take Notice: taking notice of the
      environment) using a newly developed observation tool. It is thought that the largest effect
      of the interventions will be on Take Notice behaviour due to improvements in the aesthetic
      quality of green space at the intervention sites. Baseline data collection occurred in
      September 2017 before the interventions were installed in November 2017. Follow-up data
      collection will be repeated in February/ March 2018 (6 months) and September 2018 (12
      months).

      Discussion: The present study offers a rare opportunity to evaluate the before-and-after
      effects of small-scale changes in urban green space, in an understudied population (older
      adults) and setting (United Kingdom). Although the interventions are expected to have small
      effects on peoples' behaviour, this study will address key weaknesses in previous studies.

    <description>The primary outcome will be a count per observation period of Take Notice behaviour at 12 months. Take Notice behaviour is the primary outcome because the interventions are expected to improve the aesthetic quality of green space by providing visual information of value to users, thus causing more overt appreciation in the intervention sites.</description>

    <description>The interventions are located on four publicly accessible sites; the total size of the floor area of green space in each of the intervention sites is small, ranging from 0.09 to 0.35 acres. Components of the interventions include tree and flower planting (expected to bloom by March 2018) and artificial tree decorations such as strings of small electric lights and tree socks (the interventions are hereafter collectively referred to as urban street greening). The total cost for all components across all four intervention sites is approximately £6,000, although this excludes artist fees connected to the project. All components of the interventions were implemented within a one week period in November 2017 by two arborists, two local artists, staff members at Southway Housing Trust, and local community members from Old Moat and a local school.</description>
