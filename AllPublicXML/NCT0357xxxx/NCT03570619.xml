      This study will attempt to determine the efficacy of checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy with
      nivolumab and ipilimumab combination therapy followed by nivolumab monotherapy in patients
      with metastatic prostate cancer harboring loss of CDK12 function.

    <textblock>
      This study investigates the efficacy of checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy in patients with
      metastatic cancer with CDK12 mutations. The study includes two cohorts of patient groups:
      castration resistant metastatic prostate carcinoma and other solid tumor histologies. Both
      cohorts receive the same treatment with the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab followed
      by nivolumab.

    <measure>The proportion of patients with CDK12 loss of function metastatic CRPC (Cohort A) that respond to treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 months post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The primary objective is overall response rate (ORR) of patients with metastatic CRPC. Response will be defined as a 50% decline in PSA (prostate specific antigen) from baseline as determined by PCWG3 criteria.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The proportion of patients that respond to treatment in Cohort B.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 52 weeks after start of therapy</time_frame>
    <description>Overall response will be defined as patients that achieve either a partial response or complete response using RECIST 1.1 criteria.
Complete response (CR) is defined as disappearance of all target lesions, determined by two separate observations conducted not less than 4 weeks apart. There can be no appearance of new lesions.
Partial response (PR) is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD. There can be no appearance of new lesions.</description>

    <measure>Radiographic progression free survival time (rPFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 52 weeks after start of therapy</time_frame>
    <description>Radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of radiographic progression. Progression is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started, or the appearance of one or more new lesions.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression free survival time (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 months post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Progression is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression. Progression is defined as:
Either, Radiographic progression: At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started, or the appearance of one or more new lesions OR, PSA Progression: For rising PSA after an initial decline from baseline, the PSA is recorded from the start of therapy to first PSA increase that is ≥ 25% and ≥ 2ng/mL above the nadir, which is confirmed by a second value 4 or more weeks later, confirming a rising trend. If there is no initial decline from baseline, PSA progression is defined as ≥ 25% increase and ≥ 2 ng/mL increase from baseline beyond 12 weeks.</description>
