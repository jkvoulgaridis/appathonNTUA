  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators assessed overall physical activity and sleep quality in subjects with knee
      osteoarthritis(OA) at baseline, and at four and 12 weeks following initiation of physical
      therapy. Subjects received a course of manual physical therapy with interventions targeted to
      relevant impairments in the lower quarter. No progressive activity intervention or guidance
      on sleep hygiene was included. The purpose of this study was to assess a relationship between
      manual physical therapy and habitual physical activity and sleep behavior in individuals with
      knee OA.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Total Steps Per Day from baseline to 4 weeks and 12 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week of monitoring at baseline, 4 weeks and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Steps per day were measured with an ActiGraph accelerometer (model wGT9X Link), ActiGraph Corp., Pensacola FL). The ActiGraph accelerometer measures triaxial acceleration and provides information about the intensity and duration of the physical activity associated with movement.</description>

    <measure>Change in Total Sedentary Time from baseline to 4 weeks and 12 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week of monitoring at baseline, 4 weeks and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Total Sedentary Time was measured with an ActiGraph accelerometer (model wGT9X Link), ActiGraph Corp., Pensacola FL). The ActiGraph accelerometer measures triaxial acceleration and provides information about the intensity and duration of the physical activity associated with movement. Total time spent in sedentary was calculated based on established on established cut points, reported in minutes per day and converted to a percentage of daily activity. Higher percentage indicated more time spent in sedentary behavior.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Sleep Efficiency from baseline to 4 weeks and 12 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week of monitoring at baseline, 4 weeks and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep efficiency is defined as the total sleep time relative to the time in bed. Higher scores indicated better sleep efficiency, with scores above 85 considered to be in the normal range. Sleep monitoring was performed using the Micro Motionlogger Sleep Watch (Ambulatory Monitoring Inc., Ardsley, NY) on the non-dominant wrist.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) from baseline to 4 weeks and 12 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Collected at baseline, 4 weeks and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The primary patient-reported outcome was the Western Ontario and McMaster's University Arthritis Index(WOMAC). It is a widely used, proprietary standardized questionnaire used by health professionals to evaluate the condition of patients with OA of the knee and hip, including pain, stiffness, and physical functioning. This scale runs from 0 to 240 points with lower scores indicating improved symptoms and function.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in 400-meter walk time from baseline to 4 weeks and 12 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Collected at baseline, 4 weeks and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The 400-meter walk test was administered to quantify walking endurance. The test was conducted a 100-meter-long course with four lengths being completed. Timing using a digital stopwatch began from the initial movement from standing at the start until the subject completed the fourth length of the course. Total time (sec) was recorded, with longer time indicating worse physical function</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in 20-meter walk time from baseline to 4 weeks and 12 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Collected at baseline, 4 weeks and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The 20-meter walk test was performed in a hallway located in the PT Clinic which was free from any potential barriers to ambulation. The 20-meter walk course was clearly marked with bright cones at each end. Participants were instructed to wear their regular footwear and to use any assistive devices they normally use for ambulation. Total time (sec) was recorded and converted to meters per second, with a lower value indicating worse physical function.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Timed Up and Go (TUG) time from baseline to 4 weeks and 12 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Collected at baseline, 4 weeks and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The TUG is a simple test of mobility designed to assess dynamic balance. Participants were expected to wear their regular footwear and use any assistive devices they normally use for ambulation. Total time (sec) was recorded with a lower value indicating worse physical function.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Five Times Sit to Stand(5TSTS)time from from baseline to 4 weeks and 12 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Collected at baseline, 4 weeks and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The 5TSTS was used to determine lower extremity functional strength. Participants were instructed to stand from a chair and return to sitting five times as quickly as possible with arms folded across the chest. Total time in seconds was measured with a digital stopwatch and started with initial movement to stand on the first repetition and ended after completely standing upright on the 5th repetition, with longer time indicating worse physical function</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in acceleration while stepping off a curb from baseline to 4 weeks and 12 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Collected at baseline, 4 weeks and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Vertical acceleration forces were measured with Shimmer3 monitors (Shimmer Sensing, Dublin, Ireland) at the waist and lower leg in order to assess instrumented evaluation of stepping off a raised platform while walking. This task is ubiquitous in daily activity throughout the lifespan. There is no greater risk with this test than stepping off a typical curb. Participants completed the task under close supervision by research staff by stepping down from a 20 cm raised platform in the PT clinic to simulate a curb. 5 trials were completed with both lower extremities at each time point.</description>
