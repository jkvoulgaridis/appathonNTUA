  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Assessment of the upper sensory block level during neuraxial analgesia for labor and delivery
      is an essential component of clinical management and patient safety. A variety of methods
      have been used for testing the sensory block such as cold, light touch, sharp touch or prick
      and transcutaneous electrical stimulation. In addition to the diversity of methods, the
      endpoints used by investigators have also been variable, considering total or partial
      responses as endpoints. Not surprisingly, a variable sensory block level could be identified
      as a result of the different methods and types of question asked by the examiner. Another
      complicating factor is the lack of standardization of the direction of the testing as it
      relates to anesthetized and non-anesthetized areas. This lack of standardization may result
      in a difference of several dermatomes in the level that two different assessors might record
      for the same patient. Considering a clinical research scenario, it may be difficult to
      replicate results and implement clinical practices. The objective of this study is to
      determine the degree of agreement between two methods of assessing the sensory block level to
      cold in women receiving epidural analgesia for labor (anesthetized to non-anesthetized
      segments versus non-anesthetized to anesthetized segments).
