      Regular physical exercise was adapted to the situation of the patient with hemodialysis to
      help improve the quality of life of the patient

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It has been observed that programs that combine aerobic and resistance exercise can increase
      muscular strength and endurance, functional capacity and quality of life of patients in
      Hemodialysis. Aerobic exercise and muscular endurance during dialysis increase blood flow at
      the muscular level with an increase in capillary surface area, which dynamizes the flow of
      urea and toxins from the tissues to the vascular compartment, which could improve the
      effectiveness of dialysis In addition, moderate regular exercise can modulate the
      inflammatory response, which would be beneficial in patients with chronic kidney disease

    <time_frame>baseline, 3 month and 6 month</time_frame>
    <description>The measurement of Klotho in plasma (obtained from peripheral blood collected in tube with EDTA 3K anticoagulant) was performed by ELISA, with Well-wash 4 MK microplate washer (Thermo Electron Corporation) and Mutiskan EX microplate reader (Thermo Electron Corporation ), using the Human soluble α-Klotho Assay kit (Immuno-Biological Laboratories Co., Ltd, Japan). All samples were analyzed in duplicate following recommendations.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in Physical performance sit and stand at 6 month</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 month</time_frame>
    <description>patients' performance in the 10-repetition sit to stand (STS-10), The STS-10, an index of lower-extremity strength, measures the time (in seconds) required to perform 10 consecutive repetitions of sitting down and getting up from a chair. Participants began the test with their arm crossed on their chest and sitting with their back against the chair. They were instructed to perform the task &quot;as fast as possible,&quot; starting and finishing at the sitting position. Time was measured with a stopwatch (ONstart 100, Geonaute, France) to the nearest 0.1 second.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in Physical performance 6MWT at 6 month</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 month</time_frame>
    <description>The 6MWT was used as a marker of endurance capacity. It was performed on a 17-meter corridor with marks on every meter, and time was measured with a chronometer. (ONstart 100, Geonaute, France). Participants were asked to cover the longest distance possible during six minutes by walking (not running) continuously and turning around at the final mark. No verbal encouragement was given during the test; however, feedback regarding the remaining time was available. Participants were allowed to rest during the test, and to use any ambulation aid that they used during daily life.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in Physical performance handgrip force at 6 month</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 month</time_frame>
    <description>Maximal isometric handgrip force has been suggested as a useful tool for the continuous assessment of muscle mass and function in dialysis patients. It was measured in both hands using a manual dynamometer (T.K.K.5401, Takei Scientific Instruments, Japan) while participants were in a standing position, with the arm extended and parallel to the body, and without moving the wrist. They performed two maximal repetitions with each hand interspersed with one-minute rests, and the mean of all four trials was analyzed.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in Mental and health status (Beck Depression Inventory) at 6 month</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 month</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in depression symptoms were assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). In this self-reported questionnaire 21 items are rated on a four-point severity scale and summed to give a total score, being a higher score suggestive of more severe depression. The BDI has proven a valid depression screening tool in dialysis patients, being one of the most commonly used questionnaires to assess this condition in this patient population. The Scale of this questionaire is: No depression (0 - 13 points); Low depression (14 - 19 points); moderate depression (20 - 28 points); several depression (≥29 points)</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in Mental and health status (Health-related QoL &lt;HRQoL&gt; ) at 6 month</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 month</time_frame>
    <description>Health-related QoL (HRQoL) was assessed using the Short-Form 12 (SF-12) health survey, a short version of the SF-36. A physical (PCS) and a mental component score (MCS) are calculated from this self-reported questionnaire. SF-12 has proven reliable and valid in dialysis patients, being associated with short-term and long-term mortality in this population. The questionnaire is divided into three dimensions which have the following scales: EQ-EVA (visual analog scale) scores from 0 to 100 where 0 is the worst health state imaginable and 100 the best state, EQ-Descriptive. Better state of health self-perceived (11111) and worse (33333) depending on the answers given in each one of the sections of the questionnaire and EQ-Index. Better health status: values of 1 or close to 1 and the states closest to death.</description>

    <description>After 3 first month without intervention and also during the time of hemodialysis, the patients star the exercise programe, the first part of the session, an exercise was carried out for cardiovascular work (pedaling on ergometer) and muscle toning, with special attention to the muscular development of the lower limbs (exercises with elastic bands and / or weighted ankles). The session increased in duration and intensity as the physical action program progressed throughout the duration of the permitted period (3 months) and always attending to the individual needs of each subject. In addition, each of the participants will be given a series of recommendations of exercise practice to be carried out during non-hemodialysis days, in order to complement the work done during the sessions.3 month later the investigator evaluated all the variable again (T3)</description>
