    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine the effect of intranasal lidocaine on pain score in
      pediatric patients with migraine. Patients with significant pain after oral analgesics and
      plan for intravenous (IV) abortive therapy will be asked to participate. Half of patients
      will be given intranasal lidocaine and the other half will be given placebo. Pain scores and
      associated migraine symptoms (i.e. nausea, vomiting, photophobia, phonophobia, avoidance of
      activities, and aura) will be monitored and compared between the groups.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a double-blinded, randomized-controlled trial using intranasal lidocaine to
      provide fast-acting pain relief in pediatric patients presenting with migraine to an urban
      pediatric emergency department (ED). Typically, abortive therapy for migraine in many
      emergency departments begins with oral analgesics such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen.
      However, many patients with inadequate pain relief after oral analgesics will require
      intravenous (IV) medications to abort their migraine symptoms. These medications can take up
      to thirty minutes or more for the onset of action to begin, potentially leaving patients in
      significant pain during that time. Also, obtaining IV access in children can be
      time-consuming and technically difficult, further delaying time to pain relief. Subjects will
      be given either intranasal lidocaine or placebo while awaiting IV placement and IV
      metoclopramide administration. Pain scales and associated migraine symptoms will be compared
      between the two arms before study medication administration and again at 5, 10, and 20
      minutes.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Pain Score</measure>
    <time_frame>The NRS will be administered prior to study medication administration at baseline. As well as at 5 minutes, 10 minutes, and 20 minutes after study drug administration.</time_frame>
    <description>The numeric rating scale (NRS) will be used to assess subjects' pain severity. This pain scale is numbered by increments of one, with a minimum score of zero and a maximum score of ten. With zero, as &quot;no pain&quot;, and ten as &quot;worst possible pain&quot;. We will compare the change of median pain score from baseline to three discrete time points after study medication administration for the patients who receive intranasal lidocaine compared to placebo. For this study, we will assume a decrease in pain score of 3 or more from baseline to any of the post study medication administration time points to be clinically significant.</description>

    <measure>The Number of Subjects with Improvement of Associated Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Prior to study drug administration at baseline and 20 minutes after study drug administration.</time_frame>
    <description>The presence or absence of nausea, vomiting, photophobia, phonophobia, aura, and avoidance of daily activities will be asked to each subject at baseline. At 20 minutes each subject will be asked to respond &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; if each associated symptom has subjectively improved.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Number of Subjects Who Receive IV Pain Medications</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>All subjects will be ordered to receive IV metoclopramide. If a subject's pain significantly improved after intranasal drug administration and before IV metoclopramide administration, then metoclopramide will be held, as per discretion of the treating physician. At the end of the study the treating physician will document on the data collection sheet if the subject received IV pain medications.</description>
