  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the research is to evaluate the clinical value of fractional exhaled nitric
      oxide(FeNO) ,impulse oscillometry(IOS) and mid-expiratory flow (MEF) in patients with cough
      variant asthma.

      The present study has the following objectives:

      to evaluate the relationship between BHR and mid-expiratory flow, to assess the diagnostic
      accuracy of fractional exhaled nitric oxide，impulse oscillometry and mid-expiratory flow in
      CVA with special regard to its discriminating value between CVA and other causes of a chronic
      cough, to estimate prognostic value of BHR and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) count
      in predicting response to asthma treatment.

    <description>Patients with chronic nonproductive cough for more than 8 weeks based on physician's opinion will be subjected to FeNO, impulse oscillometry(IOS) and pulmonary function. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to evaluate the clinical value of FeNO and small airways indices in CVA diagnosis. The optimal cutoff point for the level of FeNO and IOS is also determined.</description>
