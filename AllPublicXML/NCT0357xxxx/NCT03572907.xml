  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The patients in this study are all born with a cleft lip and palate. They underwent several
      interventions in childhood to take care of it.

      Professor Gleizal offered them a secondary rhinoplasty aimed at normalizing the appearance of
      their nose.

      In this malformative and multioperated context, typical nasal deformities affect the tip of
      the nose, which appears to be sagging and asymmetrical. Scarred soft tissues exert an
      important retractile force against which conventional rhinoplasty techniques often remain
      insufficient.

      The use of columellar struts makes it possible to give again projection to the tip of the
      nose but when this strut is made from cartilage or bone, it is absorbed with the time.
      Moreover, these interventions require a remote removal of the site of interest (costal
      cartilage, tibial crest, calvaria) which generates additional morbidity.

      The investigators propose an alternative using a synthetic graft of titanium. This material
      has been used for many years for its excellent biocompatibility and trauma resistance.

      28 patients were able to benefit from this technique between March 1, 2016 and March 1, 2018.

      The investigators wish to evaluate the aesthetic and functional results from the patient's
      point of view by submitting them to one validated rhinoplasty questionnaire after the end of
      the patient's inclusion.
