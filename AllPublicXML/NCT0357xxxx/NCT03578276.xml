      To compare the use of a compounded eye drop containing an antibiotic, a non-steroidal and
      steroidal anti-inflammatory to standard of care that is the use of 3 different topical
      medications to prevent inflammation and infection after routine cataract surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cataract surgery is one of the most commonly performed surgeries in the world today. To
      improve the overall procedure outcome, prophylactic topical antibiotics and
      anti-inflammatories (steroidal and non-steroidal, NSAID) are frequently used to decrease the
      risk of postoperative infection (e.g., endophthalmitis) and intraocular inflammation (e.g.,
      macular edema, CME).

      Even though, the large body of literature that supports the significance of prophylactic eye
      drops prior to surgery, patient compliance is a common problem. Different factors have been
      associated with patient's lack of compliance. It could be due to patient's inability to self-
      administer the drops, lack of understanding of the importance of using the prophylactic
      treatment as well as understanding the instructions of how to administer the drops and its
      storage, or just forgetfulness or the fact that they don't like to put the drops multiple
      times a day for 2-4 weeks, therefore they just avoid doing it. About 64% of patients adhere
      to the prescribed treatment.

      There is a new alternative that combines the most commonly used antibiotic and
      anti-inflammatories into a single drop. The use of a single drop compounded ophthalmic
      solution may offer advantages such as increased compliance, patient comfort and reduced
      ocular toxicity. T

      The purpose of this study is to compare the Pred-Gati-Brom formulation to the standard
      topical drops regimen that includes the topical use of Gatifloxacin, Bromfenac and
      Prednisolone acetate 1%.
