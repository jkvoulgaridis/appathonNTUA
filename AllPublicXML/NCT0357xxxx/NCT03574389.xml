          -  Healthy infants and children as determined by medical history, physical examination,
             and judgment of the investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participation in other studies involving investigational drug(s)/vaccine(s) since
             birth (Cohort 1 only) or in the 6 months prior to study entry (Cohorts 2, 3, and 4)
             and/or during study participation.

          -  Other acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition, including recent laboratory
             abnormality, that may increase the risk associated with study participation or
             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of
             study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject
             inappropriate for entry into this study.

          -  Vaccination with licensed or investigational pneumococcal vaccine.

          -  Previous vaccination with licensed or investigational Hib vaccine.
