  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypothesis:The conventional surgical approach is to raise large flaps to completely and
      exceedingly expose the area of interest. Since the results were unsatisfactory due to limited
      regenerated periodontal tissue, an alternative approach to access the intra-bony defects was
      proposed, this approach is called minimally invasive techniques which use incisions just
      large enough for debridement and generally involves reflecting the papilla only using
      specialized instruments to access the intra-bony defect and debridement.

      Aim of the study:Is to evaluate the gain in clinical attachment level and bone after
      treatment of the intra-bony defects by Minimally Invasive Surgical Technique when compared to
      Open Flap Debridement in patients with intra-bony defects.

      Study setting:Study will be conducted in the Oral Medicine and Periodontology department,
      Faculty of Oral and Dental Medicine - Cairo University, Egypt.Patients will be selected from
      the outpatient clinic of the department of Oral Medicine and Periodontology-Cairo University.

      Prior to the start of the study each patient will receive initial periodontal therapy
      consisting of proper oral hygiene instructions and full-mouth scaling and root planing. Six
      weeks after completion of the initial therapy, a re-evaluation will be performed to confirm
      that the patients meet all the inclusion criteria for the study.

      Evaluation of the patient's oral hygiene and a written consent will be obtained from the
      patients who will participate in the trial. Blinded periodontist will record the clinical
      measurements prior to surgery using a periodontal probe.

      Prior to surgery, a stent will be fabricated for each site using diagnostic casts and acrylic
      resin. Each stent will rest on the occlusal surfaces of at least 4 teeth and had a vertical
      notch marking the facial and lingual position of the intra-bony defect. A periapical
      radiograph using paralleling technique using extension cone paralleling (XCP) film holder
      will be performed for each patient to evaluate alveolar bone loss using DIGORA system.

      Surgical procedure:The patients will be randomly assigned into two groups; Group A (Control):
      Patients receiving Open Flap Debridement (OFD). Group B (Test): Patients receiving Minimally
      Invasive Surgical technique (MIST).

      The operator will anesthetize the surgical sites for both groups. For the OFD technique,
      buccal and lingual intrasulcular incisions will be done extending at least one tooth mesial
      and distal to the tooth associated with the intrabony defect. Full thickness mucoperiosteal
      flaps will be reflected to allow access for debridement of the defect.

      Surgical debridement will be carried out to remove subgingival plaque, calculus and
      granulation tissue. The surgical sites will be irrigated with sterile saline. Surgical flaps
      will be sutured to the pre-surgical level with 5-0 vicryl suture utilizing a vertical
      mattress suturing technique achieving primary closure.

      For the Minimally Invasive Surgical technique, it will be carried out with 2.5 X optical
      magnification dental loupes. After local anaesthesia, an envelope flap without vertical
      releasing incisions will be performed. The defect-associated interdental papilla will be
      accessed either with the simplified papilla preservation flap (SPPF) in narrow interdental
      spaces or the modified papilla preservation technique (MPPT) in large interdental spaces. In
      the SPPF, a diagonal incision traced as close as possible to the buccal side of the papilla
      col will be performed, whereas in the MPPT a horizontal incision traced on the buccal side of
      the papilla will be done. Intrasulcular incisions will be performed from the interdental side
      to the buccal and lingual sides of the teeth neighboring the defect; tiny buccal and lingual
      flaps will be elevated to expose the bone crest.

      All incisions will be done using microsurgical ophthalmic blades. Buccal and lingual flaps
      will be elevated using sharp dissection only. Granulation tissue adherent to the inner
      surface of flaps will be carefully removed with microscissors to provide full access and
      visibility to root surfaces. Defect debridement and root planing will be performed with a
      combination of mini-curettes. Then sutures will be placed using 6-0 vicryl suture.

      Postoperative medication:Administration of amoxicillin (500 mg tabs) T.I.D for 7 days),
      Chlorhexidine rinse (B.I.D for 14 days). Ibuprofen 600 mg tabs 1 every 8h in case of
      unbearable pain.

      Patient self-care instructions: Sutures will be removed 2 weeks post-surgically. Patients
      will be asked to abstain from mechanical oral hygiene procedures in the surgical area for 2
      weeks. After this period, patients will be instructed to continue mechanical tooth brushing
      again of the treated sites using a soft toothbrush.

      The outcomes will be measured at 1 week, 3 and 6 months post-operatively.
