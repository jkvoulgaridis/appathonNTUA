  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anemia is the most common form of malnutrition, affecting approximately 1.6 billion people
      world-wide. Most commonly caused by iron deficiency, its adverse effects include increased
      mortality (especially during childbirth), impaired cognitive development among children,
      chronic fatigue, and reduced lifetime earnings. While iron deficiency is the main cause of
      anemia worldwide, its etiology is complex and it can also be caused by an insufficient intake
      of other micronutrients such as Vitamin A, B9, B12 and folate as well as by helminthic
      infections and malaria.

      Research in India and elsewhere has shown that under ideal (controlled) conditions, anemia
      can be reduced by consumption of iron-fortified food and other micro-nutrients. However, much
      less is known about the effectiveness of such interventions under actual program conditions
      on a large scale. This trial proposes to address anemia and other micronutrient deficiencies
      by providing micronutrient fortified rice through the Public Distribution System (PDS) of
      Tamil Nadu in a manner that requires no change in behaviour by end-user households and that
      can feasibly be conducted on a large scale.

      This trial is designed as a rigorous cluster-randomized controlled trial with the full
      collaboration of the government of Tamil Nadu. The trial will follow a randomized cluster
      design at the Fair Price Shops (FPS) which distribute rice in the Tamil Nadu PDS. Fair Price
      Shops will be assigned randomly either to the treatment or the control arm, and will either
      be provided fortified rice for distribution, or the standard, non-fortified rice.

  <detailed_description>

      The proposed project will leverage the existing state-run public distribution system (PDS) to
      provide fortified rice using a domestically manufactured rice grain (Fortified Rice Kernels,
      or FRK). FRKs are grains made from rice flour, highly enriched with iron and other
      micronutrients (such as Vitamin A, B9 and Vitamin B12), and shaped like a conventional grain
      of rice. It is mixed into conventional rice in specified ratios (1g of FRK 100g of
      conventional rice) and is almost indistinguishable from conventional rice in appearance and
      taste. For this study, rice will be fortified using FRKs containing iron, zinc, vitamin A and
      vitamins B1, B3, B6, B9 and B12.

      The Tamil Nadu PDS already provides up to 20 kilograms of rice at no cost to all households
      in the state, with an additional 15 kilograms to households identified as particularly poor.
      This is done through a widespread network of Fair Price Shops (FPS). The proposed study
      (implementation and accompanying evaluation) will be conducted as a cluster-randomized
      controlled trial, with baseline and follow-up surveys conducted 12-15 months apart. In the
      interim, 110 Treatment FPS will be randomly assigned to receive fortified rice, and another
      110 randomly assigned Control FPS will continue receiving conventional rice. The
      investigators plan to conduct the study in one sub-district of Tamil Nadu with a population
      of about 1/2 million people.

      In a cluster, the study team will randomly select 40 households to participate in the
      baseline and followup surveys and household members meeting the eligibility criteria, i.e.
      women between 12 and 40 years and children between 6 and 59 months, will be enrolled. These
      surveys will collect information about dietary patterns and socioeconomic status, and
      importantly, will also collect objectively measured health indicators (biomarkers and
      anthropometric measures), to test directly for anemia and micronutrient deficiencies.

      To implement the intervention, the Government pre-existing PDS system, will be used. Every
      household in Tamil Nadu has a card that entitles it monthly to a pre-specified quantity of
      rice (and other goods) from a specific location that belongs to a network of so called Fair
      Price Shops (FPS). These FPS in turn receive rice from government-run warehouses (called
      godowns) where rice is delivered from a central procurement system and then bagged.

    <intervention_model_description>This project (implementation and accompanying evaluation) will be conducted as a cluster-randomized controlled trial, with baseline and follow-up surveys conducted 12 months apart in the same individuals. In the interim, 110 Treatment Fair Price Shops (FPS) will be assigned randomly to receive rice fortified with iron and other micronutrients, and another 110 Control FPS will be assigned randomly to conventional Public Distribution System (PDS) rice. The control arm therefore represents the status quo and serves as a control group against which any improvements observed in the treatment group will be gauged.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Change in hemoglobin level from baseline to endline using Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDT)</measure>
    <time_frame>This will be assessed at baseline and at endline after 12-15 months of intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDT), using Hemocue machine, will be used to measure Hemoglobin concentrations in 40 women and 40 children tested in each FPS catchment area (total sample size 17600 women and children). Hemoglobin (Hb) will be tested with the HemoCue analyzer, a portable, accurate system for measuring Hb. Hb measures will be used to calculate prevalence of anemia among the target population of women and young children. The test requires less than 0.5 ml of blood and delivers results in approximately 15 minutes.</description>

    <description>Hemoglobin (Hb) will also be measured separately in a sub-sample of individuals (10 children and 10 women per FPS) using Dried Blood Spots (DBS) that will be transported to a lab for analysis. It will take up to 15 minutes for each respondent.</description>

    <measure>Change in Transferrin Receptor (TfR) level from baseline to endline using DBS</measure>
    <time_frame>This will be assessed at baseline and at endline after 12-15 months of intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Transferrin Receptor (TfR) will also be measured separately in a sub-sample of individuals (10 children and 10 women per FPS) using Dried Blood Spots (DBS) that will be transported to a lab for analysis. TfR is a good indicator of iron stores in the body, and this marker is expected to improve following food fortification. C-Reactive Protein (CRP) will also be measured. CRP is useful both to detect the presence of inflammation and to identify cases where measured TfR is likely to give a biased account of iron stores, given that TfR becomes elevated in the presence of acute and sometimes chronic infections; thus, TfR will be corrected for inflammation using CRP. It will take up to 15 minutes for each respondent.</description>

    <description>Anemia measured by RDT (Hemocue machine) and DBS: Hb measured from RDT, i.e. Hemocue machine, and DBS will further be categorized to estimate the prevalence of anemia among the study population using established Hb thresholds.

No anemia: Hb &gt;= 11 g/dL
Mild anemia: 10 &lt; Hb &lt; 10.9 g/dL
Moderate anemia: 7 &lt; Hb &lt; 9.9 g/dL

    <description>110 Fair Price Shops (FPS) in Chidambaram, Tamil Nadu, India will be assigned randomly to receive rice fortified. Rice will be fortified using Fortified Rice Kernels (FRKs) containing iron, zinc, vitamin A and vitamins B1, B3, B6, B9 and B12. All households receiving rice from the PDS will receive fortified rice instead of conventional PDS rice, and members of households sampled for baseline will have blood samples and demographic surveys taken at a baseline visit, and another visit at 12-15 months after the baseline visit. Because a given FPS only receives rice from a single upstream distributor (godown) it should be straightforward to ensure that fortified rice reaches the appropriate treatment FPS and only those FPS.</description>
