  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoporosis is an increasing public health problem. Involution of bone mass in women is due
      to a reduction in sensitivity of the bone to the mechanical stress due to the slow-down of
      the bone turnover after 35 years old. Osteoporosis is a silent disease combining a decrease
      in bone mass (quantity) and an impaired bone microarchitecture (quality) leading to an
      increased risk of fracture. Bone microarchitecture is an important element to be taken into
      account in assessing the bone properties, as demonstrated by numerous ex vivo studies.

      Bone densitometry only identifies 50% of osteoporotic fractures. The other half of the
      fractures appears in osteopenic women. The measurement of bone mineral density is too limited
      to assess risk of fracture. Bone microarchitecture can be assessed through a peripheral
      quantitative computed tomography scan (computed tomography peripherical - pQCT). The
      microarchitecture data allow the calculation of bone strength index (BSI) and stress strength
      index (SSI) highly predictive of fracture risk. These qualitative determinants of bone
      fragility are the most relevant to evaluate effect of physical activity over a short period
      compared with bone mineral content and density, which requires several months of constraints.
      Biochemical markers of bone turnover, specifically those of bone resorption, are predictive
      of the risk of osteoporotic fracture.

      Physical activity can reduce the risk of fracture up to 20-35% via direct effects on bone
      strength, at any age. However, response of bone varies with modalities of exercise. Repeated
      exercise produces greater bone adaptations than a single bout. Moreover, it has been well
      demonstrated since 1970 that bone responds to a dynamic stimulation, but not a static
      stimulation, with a dose response relationship. It has been confirmed in premenopausal women.

      The effect of physical activity on microarchitectural bone parameters (porosity and density
      of cortical and trabecular) has not been investigated in primary prevention. This original
      study would highlight the effect of short-term specific physical activity on the prevention
      of bone fragility (qualitative) observed with age in premenopausal women.

      The main hypothesis is that a spa residential program including physical activity will have
      greater benefits on bone cortical porosity than a spa residential program alone or physical
      activity alone, in premenopausal women.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The ThermOs protocol was designed to provide a better understanding of the effect of physical
      activity on microarchitectural bone parameters (porosity and density of cortical and
      trabecular), in prevention of bone fragility among premenopausal women.

      In the present protocol, parameters are measured on four occasions (baseline, 10 days, at 6
      months and at 12 months).

      Statistical analysis will be performed using Stata software (version 13; Stata-Corp, College
      Station, Tex., USA). All statistical tests will be two-sided and p&lt;0.05 will be considered
      significant. After testing for normal distribution (Shapiro-Wilk test), data will be treated
      either by parametric or non-parametric analyses according to statistical assumptions.

      Inter-groups comparisons will systematically be performed 1) without adjustment and 2)
      adjusting on factors liable to be biased between groups.

      Analysis will be performed using anova or Kruskal-Wallis (KW) tests. When appropriate
      (p&lt;0.05), a post-hoc test for multiple comparisons (Tukey-Kramer after anova and Dunn post
      KW) will be used. Linear regression (with logarithmic transformation if necessary)
      considering an adjustment on covariates fixed according to epidemiological relevance and
      observance to physical activity will complete the analysis. Relations between quantitative
      outcomes will be analyzed using correlation coefficients (Pearson or Spearman) and compared
      with Chi-squared or Fischer test. Longitudinal data will be treated using mixt-model analyses
      in order to treat fixed effects group, time and group x time interaction taking into account
      between and within participant variability.
