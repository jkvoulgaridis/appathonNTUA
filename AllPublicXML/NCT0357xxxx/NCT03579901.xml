      undergoing primary breast augmentation, primary breast reconstruction or revision breast
      surgery.

      Motiva Implants® Silicone Gel-filled Breast Implants, SmoothSilk® both Round and Ergonomix®,
      have not been approved by FDA, and the purpose of this study is to collect scientific
      evidence of the safety and effectiveness of these implants. Motiva Implants® have been
      approved for commercial distribution in over 60 countries, including the United Kingdom,
      Sweden, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Japan, Australia, Brazil, and South Korea.

      This clinical study is a multicenter, single arm study. The population consist of 800
      patients in four cohorts and an MRI subpopulation of 250 patients to verify the rates of
      rupture.

      Safety will be assess by incidence, severity, method of resolution, and duration for all
      complications on a per implant and per subject basis. And effectiveness will be measured by
      and overall patient satisfaction, and co-primary endpoints for breast measurements. As
      secondary endpoints physician satisfaction and three quality of life questionnaires annually
      and at 1,2,4,6,8 and 10 years respectively.

      Patients will be follow up through a 10 year period to guaranty the safeness of the devices,
      patients will attend a baseline visit and from the day of subjects will be asked to make
      visits at the following time periods after the surgery: 3-6 weeks, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
      and 10 years. Each investigator will perform an evaluation of the status of the implant and
      will examined the presence of any post-surgical complications.

      Specifically, for primary augmentation subjects, breast measurements and 3D imaging and for
      all subjects' photographs, an evaluation of your nipple and breast sensitivity will be
      performed.

      It is the investigator´s choice if additional 3D imaging will be performed for subjects in
      the revision augmentation, primary reconstruction and revision reconstruction cohorts at any
      or all of the annual study visits.

      A review of the subjects current medications, continued cancer therapy (if applicable),
      mammography results (if applicable), and MRI scan at visits 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 (for MRI
      sub-study subjects) could also be conducted. In addition, study investigators will evaluate
      the breasts for capsular contracture and any other complications that may arise, annually and
      in unscheduled visits.
