  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of RT001 in patients with
      Infantile Neuroaxonal Dystrophy (INAD).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm open-label study with a structured observation of INAD patients treated
      with RT001. Enrolled subjects will undergo observation and testing to determine the effect of
      RT001 treatment. Fifteen eligible subjects will be treated with RT001 for long-term
      evaluation of efficacy, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Modified Ashworth spasticity scale</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in the Modified Ashworth spasticity scale. The Modified Ashworth scale measures resistance during passive soft-tissue stretching and is used as a simple measure of spasticity. It is performed in the supine position, while moving the limb at the same speed that the limb would move if dropped naturally. It is performed a maximum of three times for each joint, and prior to any stretching of the limb and is scored from 0 to 4, with 4 the most severe measure.</description>

    <measure>Hammersmith and CHOP-INTEND neuro-development scales</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in the composite score of the Hammersmith and CHOP-INTEND neuro-development scales.
The Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination (HINE) includes 3 sections containing 26 items that assess different aspects of neurologic function. Section 1 assesses cranial nerve function, posture, movements, tone, reflexes, and reactions. Section 2 assesses developmental milestones. Section 3 is a behavioral assessment. Each section includes 7-10 items scored on a 5-point scale with 0 as the absence of activity, and a maximum score of 4 points.
The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Infant Test of Neuromuscular Disorders (CHOP-INTEND) is used to evaluate the motor skills of infants. CHOP-Intend includes 16 items used to assess motor skills. Each item is graded on a scale of 0-4 and total score ranges from 0-64. A higher score indicating better motor skills.</description>

    <measure>Parental global clinical impression scale</measure>
    <time_frame>6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment at 6 months and 12 months of parental global clinical impression questionnaire. Parents will complete a questionnaire assessing the effect of study drug on elements of activities of daily living and vital functions.</description>

    <measure>Parental severity assessment and visual analogue scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Monthly for 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Longitudinal assessment of monthly parental severity assessment and visual analogue scale.
The parents will complete a visual analogue scale assessing the child's mood. The scale is scored 0-5 with 5 being typically happy. The parents will also complete a questionnaire assessing the severity of the impact of the disease on elements of activities of daily living and vital functions.</description>
