  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised, controlled, cross-over study to determine the effect of indirect
      bronchial challenge testing upon volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the exhaled breath of
      adults with well-controlled, mild-to-moderate asthma.

      Participants will undergo baseline evaluation including clinical history, spirometry, exhaled
      nitric oxide measurement (FeNO), phlebotomy (blood eosinophil count), and sampling of exhaled
      breath VOCs. Participants will be randomised to receive either an indirect bronchial
      challenge test using mannitol dry powder (MDP) or a sham bronchial challenge, followed by
      further sampling of breath VOCs. The study will consist of a consent visit and two assessment
      visits with participants allocated to receive one of the two challenges (MDP or sham) at each
      assessment. Data will be analysed to determine the effect of bronchial challenge upon exhaled
      breath VOC profiles.
