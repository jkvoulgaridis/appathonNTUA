    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to describe relapse rates among participants receiving services
      in the SEEC program high intensity resource use. For purposes of this study, relapse will be
      defined as: Psychiatric hospitalization; Psychiatric emergency department visits; Ambulatory
      acute services (Partial Hospitalization Program, Intensive Outpatient Program, Crisis House
      stay).

      Schizophrenia is a severe mental illness that is one of the leading causes of long-term
      disability in the world. Recognizing the need for improved early treatment for participants
      diagnosed with Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective Disorder, a model was created for a
      &quot;sustainable early episode clinic, SEEC.&quot; The goal of the SEEC model is to provide early
      intense intervention in 3 phases, with an ongoing maintenance phase, enabled by technology,
      resulting in improved participant outcomes and reduced long-term economic and social burden
      of schizophrenia. This study will last for up to a 36-month period.

    <intervention_model_description>This is an open label, quasi-experimental study of adult patients with Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective Disorder within five years of diagnosis who are receiving SEEC intervention in phases. Approximately 50 patients will be enrolled in the study. Caregivers who would like to participate will also be included. Patients will be followed prospectively over the study period up to 36 months.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>High Intensity Service Utilization Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>The rate of high intensity service utilization that is count per unit of time for mental health services will be reported. It is evaluated as the number of psychiatric hospitalizations, behavioral health emergency department visits, and number of times referred to a partial hospitalization program (PHP), intensive outpatient program (IOP), or Crisis Unit.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Healthcare Utilization Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>Overall healthcare utilization rate that is count per unit of time of the healthcare resources which were utilized by the participants over over the time will be reported.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Clinician-Rated Dimensions of Psychosis Symptom and Severity (CRDPSS) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>The CRDPSS is an 8 item measure that assesses the severity of mental health symptoms that are important across psychotic disorders including:
Delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, abnormal psycho-motor behavior, negative symptoms, impaired cognition, depression and mania. Each item on the measure is rated on a 5 point scale with a symptom specific definition of each rating level: 0 = none, 1= equivocal, 2= present but mild, 3= present and moderate, 4= present and severe. Total Score is taken as summation. High score indicates worsening of symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Clinical Global Impressions Scale (CGI-S)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-S measures illness severity and is rated on a 7-point scale, with the severity of illness scale using a range of responses from 1 (normal) through to 7 (among the most severely ill participants).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Personal and Social Performance (PSP) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PSP has 4 domains of functioning considered in this scale: (a) Socially useful activities including work and study, (b) Personal &amp; Social Relationships, (c) Self Care (d) Disturbing and aggressive behaviors. All rated from absent, mild, manifest, marked, severe and very severe. Scores of 1-30 reflect functioning so poor that the participant requires intensive support of supervision. 31-70 varying degree of difficulties 71-100 reflect only mild difficulties.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Perceived Family Burden Scale (PFBS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>The purpose of the PFBS scale is to measure the burden of schizophrenia on the family of a participant. It is a 24-item questionnaire rated on a 5 point Likert type scale: 0 = the behavior isn't present and doesn't bother the relative, 1 = the behavior is present and doesn't bother the relative, 2 = the behavior is present and bothers the relative &quot;a little&quot;, 3 = the behavior is present and bothers the relative &quot;considerably&quot;, 4 = the behavior is present and bothers the relative &quot;a great deal&quot;. High score indicates worsening of burden.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Heinrichs-Carpenter Quality of Life Scale (QLS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>The QLS is used to evaluate defect symptoms and impaired functioning in non-hospitalized schizophrenic participants. It is a 21-item scale providing information on symptoms and functioning in the preceding 4 weeks. Each item is rated on 7 point scale. A sub scale score is being used in 4 sections ranging from 0-56. Low score represents worse functioning. Then a total score is taken by adding the 4 sections. Range of possible scores, 0-126. Lower sub scale scores and total scores indicates lower quality of life.</description>
