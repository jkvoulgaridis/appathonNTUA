  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the addition of a lidocaine patch to ibuprofen in the treatment of acute
      musculoskeletal pains. Half of the participants will get only ibuprofen for their pain, while
      other half will receive lidocaine patch plus the ibuprofen. After addition of the pain
      medications, the participants will be followed for their pain scores and return visits.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ibuprofen and other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory pain medications have been traditionally
      used for relief of mild to moderate acute musculoskeletal pains. However, if this medication
      did not work, a different modality for pain control would be added to the original regimen.
      In recent times, lidocaine patch has been introduced as a separate modality for pain control.
      This medication is thought to help by selectively inhibiting voltage-gated sodium channels in
      nociceptors involved in pain response. Given the separate modality, it would be prudent to
      see whether the addition of lidocaine patch to the ibuprofen would help relieve the pain
      moreso than the antiinflammatory-only regimen.

    <description>Change in self-reported pain intensity level. Baseline will be prior to intervention, and change will be assessed 30 minutes and 60 minutes after intervention, and at discharge. A repeat pain intensity level will also be asked 48-72 hours after discharge. This measure will also examine change of baseline numerical score from initial visit. Each item is scored 0-10 (0=No pain, 10= Worst pain possible).</description>
