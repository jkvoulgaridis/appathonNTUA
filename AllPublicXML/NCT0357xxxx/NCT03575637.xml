  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To explore whether adding olanzapine to paclitaxel chemotherapy could improve chemotherapy
      tolerance and improve patient quality of life and prolong treatment failure time (TTF) in
      advanced gastric cancer after failure of first-line chemotherapy.

      This is a multi-center prospective randomized controlled open clinical study. Patients will
      formally be enrolled after they had been screened and signed informed consent. Baseline
      examinations will be started after entry into the group. Those who meet the criteria for
      inclusion and exclusion were dynamically randomized at 1: 1. The experimental group will
      receive olanzapine and paclitaxel until treatment failure and the control group will receive
      paclitaxel until treatment failure.
