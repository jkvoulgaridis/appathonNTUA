      Objectives:

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of denosumab on bone turnover
      in individuals with fibrous dysplasia (FD). Secondary objectives are to determine the effect
      of denosumab on bone pain, FD lesion intensity as revealed in 18F-sodium fluoride PET/CT bone
      scan, and to determine the effect of denosumab discontinuation on bone turnover re-bound
      after discontinuation.

      Study Population:

      Up to 14 adult subjects with FD may be enrolled to ensure complete study data on 9 subjects.

      Design:

      This study is a single center, open label pilot study of once-monthly dosing of denosumab.
      Subjects will be treated for 6 months, after which they will be followed by an 8-month
      observation period. A final visit will occur 21 months after denosumab discontinuation.
      Dosing will be adopted from studies in adults on treatment for giant cell tumors, with
      denosumab administered at 120 mg per dose every 4 weeks, with loading doses on days 7 and 14
      of month 1.

      Outcome Measures:

      Primary:

      Assessment of the effects of denosumab on:

      1. Markers of bone turnover:

      Beta-crosslaps C-telopeptides (bone resorption marker)

      Procollagen-1-propeptide (bone formation marker)

      Secondary:

      Assessment of the effects of denosumab on:

        1. Bone histomorphometric indices:

           Mineralized perimeter

           Bone formation rate

           Cortical width

           Cortical area

           Osteoid width

           Osteoid perimeter

           Mineral apposition rate

        2. Surrogate markers of a direct therapeutic effect of denosumab on FD lesions:

           Semi-quantitative changes in RANKL, Ki67 (marker of cell proliferation), p16 (marker of
           cell senescence), and/or apoptosis index before and after treatment, as assessed by
           immunohistochemistry

           Changes in sentinel lesion intensity, measured quantitatively by uptake on 18Fsodium
           fluoride PET/CT bone scan.

        3. FD-related bone pain assessed by the Brief Pain Inventory (Short Form) , a validated
           self-reporting tool for assessment of pain.

      Exploratory Endpoints:

        1. Effect of denosumab initiation and discontinuation on

           Serum calcium, phosphorus and parathyroid hormone

           Serum RANKL and osteoprotegerin (OPG), and RANKL/OPG levels

        2. Effect of denosumab discontinuation, as measured by the following outcomes:

           Biochemical markers of bone metabolism: beta-crosslaps C-telopeptides, procollagen-1
           propeptide, bone specific alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, NTX-telopeptides

        3. Effect measured by change in other outcome measures, such as:

      Bone density assessed by DXA

      Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation evaluation

                  98-D-0145

               4. Confirmed diagnosis of Fibrous Dysplasia

               5. Self-reported FD-related bone pain at a site of FD, present for at least 3 months

               6. Ability to understand and provide informed consent

               7. Willing and able to complete the protocol scheduled assessments and medication
                  regimen

               8. Willing and able to take calcium and vitamin D supplements provided by NIH

               9. Women of child bearing potential must use two forms of acceptable contraception:
                  hormonal contraception (birth control pills, injected hormones or vaginal ring);
                  intrauterine device and/or barrier methods (condom or diaphragm) used with
                  spermicide. Surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, tubal ligation, or vasectomy in
                  a partner) is considered one form of contraception therefore only one other form
                  of contraception will be required in these subjects. Verbal confirmation will be
                  obtained at screening that two forms of acceptable contraception are being used,
                  and that the subjects agree to use the two forms of contraception from the time
                  they sign study consent through five months after study completion (19 months
                  total).

              10. Serum calcium or albumin-adjusted serum calcium within the normal range for the
                  NIH laboratory.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Administration of denosumab within the previous year

          2. Use of bisphosphonates within one year prior to first day of the denosumab
             administration (Day 0). Examples of bisphosphonates include: pamidronate (Aredia),
             Alendronate (Fosamax) and Zoledronate (Zomata).

          3. Prior history, or current evidence, of osteomyelitis/osteonecrosis of the jaw or
             presence of an active dental or jaw condition which requires oral surgery

          4. Planned invasive dental procedure for the course of the study

          5. Presence of non-healed dental or oral surgery

          6. Orthopedic procedure performed less than 12-weeks prior to first day of the denosumab
             administration (Day 0)

          7. Acute fracture less than 12-weeks prior to first day of the denosumab administration
             (Day 0)

          8. 25-hydroxyvitamin D level than 30 ng/mL (patients will be eligible for re-screening
             after a repletion period lasting no longer than 6 months)

          9. Untreated or inadequately treated hypophosphatemia, defined as serum phosphate levels
             below the NIH normal range (patients will be eligible for re-screening after
             initiation or optimization of phosphorus replacement no longer than 6 months)

         10. Subject is pregnant or breast feeding, or planning to become pregnant or breastfeed
             while on study and through 5 months after completion of treatment

         11. Use of another investigational agent within the last 3 months prior to the first day
             of the denosumab administration (Day 0)

         12. Subject has known sensitivity to any of the products to be administered during the
             study (e.g. polyketide antibiotics, mammalian derived products, calcium, or vitamin D)
