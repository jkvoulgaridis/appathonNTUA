      Dietary choices, quality of life and stress will be evaluated in a sample of 100
      undergraduate students who are in their first year of university. Students will be randomized
      into the following two groups; intervention arm (students who will use a preventative
      self-care program for 12 weeks) vs. control arm (students who will not use a preventative
      self-care program for 12 weeks).

      When individuals look after their own health using online applications they can expect
      similar or even better health outcomes compared to those obtained by using conventional
      methods. These kind of tools are popular among University students. Due to the many changes
      and challenges that students face in the first year of University, this sector of our
      population is at higher risk of presenting nutritional problems, anxiety, depression and
      suicidal thoughts.

      Recently, a Canadian online application called My Viva PlanÂ® became available. This program
      is based on preventive self-care and it includes three key pillars of health: nutrition,
      fitness, and mindfulness. Changes in dietary choices, quality of life and stress will be
      evaluated in a sample of 100 undergraduate students who are in their first year of
      university. Students will be randomized into the following two groups; students who will use
      the program vs. students who will not use the program. Questionnaires regarding physical
      activity, mindfulness and mental well-being will be evaluated at baseline, week 6 and week
      12. Body composition characteristics using bioelectrical impedance analysis will be collected
      at the start and end of the study (baseline and week 12).

      The objective is to determine if the use of an online application based on preventive
      self-care will result in better food choices, better quality of life, and reduced stress in
      first year university students.
