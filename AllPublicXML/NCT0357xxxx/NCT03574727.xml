  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nerve entrapment as a cause of chronic abdominal pain is frequently overlooked. A series of
      nerves pass through the muscles of the abdomen before reaching the skin to carry sensations.
      They can get trapped within the muscles leading to severe pain resulting in a condition known
      as Abdominal Cutaneous Nerve Entrapment Syndrome (ACNES). ACNES affects between 10-30% of
      patients with chronic abdominal wall pain. A definitive diagnosis of ACNES is obtained by
      anaesthetising these nerves. Initial management includes education and avoidance of known
      triggers. It is common practice to inject steroid with local anaesthetic during the
      diagnostic injections itself to prolong pain relief. Like other nerve entrapment conditions,
      this is also refractory to medical treatment. Hence repeated injections and nerve entrapment
      release surgery are commonly carried out.

      In Aberdeen, a number of patients have been treated for this condition. A cohort of patients
      have benefitted with injection alone while recurrence has been noted in patients who have
      undergone surgery. This project aims to gain more understanding about the clinical course of
      patients with suspected ACNES by evaluation of the clinic progress.
