    <textblock>
      The advantage of the EMG-driven exoskeletons is that patient's own muscle power known as
      Residual Muscle Power is used to move the extremity while many other robotic devices work and
      drive impaired limb based on machine directed force. However, it is not clear which group of
      patients are suitable for EMG driven exoskeletons use and there has not been any established
      treatment protocol.

      The aims of the study are 1- to investigate the effectiveness of the EMG-driven exoskeleton
      for hand rehabilitation in patients with acute stroke. 2- to understand which group of the
      patients may give the best response to the EMG-driven technology and how should be the
      treatment protocol designed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Improving the rehabilitation outcome of the upper extremity in stroke patients has been an
      ongoing challenge in the rehabilitation field. Up to 85% of stroke survivors experience a
      certain degree of paresis of the upper limb at the onset and only 20% to 56% of survivors
      regain complete functional use of the affected upper limb despite the therapeutic
      interventions in first 3 months . Recovery of upper limb function is generally slower and
      non-complete.

      To support and speed up a recovery process, there are many robotic devices currently used in
      the stroke units. Unlike one-on-one treatment applied by clinicans, robotic devices can
      provide repetitive, task oriented movements,with greater intensity, stimulating and engaging
      environment for user, hence alleviating the labour-intensive aspects of hands-on conventional
      therapy. There are a number of complex robotic devices that have been developed over the last
      two decades to assist upper arm training in rehabilitation.

      Using EMG driven exoskeleton, commercially known as the Hand of Hope (HOH), has been shown
      its efficacy to improve patient's grip and pinch ability, muscle coordination and improve
      functional daily living tasks in patients even after 3,4,8,10 and 14 years after onset of the
      stroke. In addition to continuous investigation efforts needed to be spent, there has not
      been established any treatment protocol using EMG-driven exoskeletons. Since Stroke patients
      need to be focused on their own residual muscle power, clear indications for EMG-driven
      exoskeletons i.e., Hand of Hope, need to be established.

      An investigation designed to highlight all these points will make an important contribution
      to the therapeutic approach using EMG-driven hand robotics for the hand rehabilitation after
      stroke.

    <description>Fugl-Meyer assessment was first used in 1975 to assess post-stroke physical performance. 33-item upper extremity subscale of the Fugl-Meyer scale evaluates movements, coordination/speed and pain in the shoulder, elbow, forearm. The highest score for the upper extremity is 66.</description>

    <description>ARAT is a performance test, first described by Lyle in 1982. This test is produced by the upper extremity function test and shows upper extremity function and skill. ARAT consists of four subdivisions and 19 functional items that evaluate grasp, grip, pinch and gross motor movement on the both side. The highest score is 57.</description>
