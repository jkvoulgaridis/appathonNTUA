  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recording mandibular movements plays an important role in stomatognathic system diagnosis and
      has been the subject of numerous research projects. This study presents theoretical
      assumptions and a practical solution in the form of a novel method of mandibular motion
      assessment.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the presented method, mandibular movements are recorded by a mono vision system where a
      digital camera is fixed on a special extension arm attached to patient's head. During
      movement the camera records changing positions of two markers placed on two selected two
      points on a patient's face. With such data, it possible to assess the absolute range of
      mandibular abduction as well as displacements from optimal trajectory occurring during
      movement, which indicative of stomatognathic dysfunctions.

    <description>To examine the mandible's movements, vision analysis was employed and performed with the digital camera which featured 1920 x 1080 resolution and was fixed on an aluminium extension arm attached to a headset worn by the subject.The camera was aligned parallel to the subject's face at a distance of 0.3 meters. The study used two 10 mm x 5 mm reference markers, which were accurately reproduced on the camera recorded images. In line, one marker was put on the medial cleft above the upper lip, and the other one was positioned below the first one in a straight line, in the middle of the chin. Then, the patient was asked to open maximally and close the mouth twice.To establish the mandible's trajectory, the line was drawn between the positions of the two markers to connect the two points. The line's parameters were calculated only during initial measurements and were constant throughout the study.</description>
