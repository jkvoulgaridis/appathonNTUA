  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Four scores are usually performed to detect OSA (Obstructive Sleep Apnea) patients. These
      four scores are: STOP-Bang, P-SAP, OSA50 and DES-OSA. These scores have been previously
      validated. However, a comparison between scorers in the realization of these scores has never
      been performed.

        For all the patients include in the study, the four scores (STOP-Bang, P-SAP, OSA50, and
        DES-OSA) will be performed several times by various scorers.

        The agreement between scorers will be statistically evaluated.
