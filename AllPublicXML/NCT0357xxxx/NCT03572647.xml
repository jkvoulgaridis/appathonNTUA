  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The epoetin is a glycoprotein and endogenous hormone, which is primarily synthesized by
      specific epithelial cells lining the kidney peritubular capillaries, and regulates continuous
      formation of red blood cells. This is a pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics study, in which
      each subject will receive the investigational product in different periods, as randomisation
      (Teste or Comparator). The evaluation of the profile included serum dosage of medications and
      reticulocyte count in peripheral blood.

      This a prospective randomized and crossover study for evaluation of pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics of two epoetins formulations. The subjects will receive in each confinement
      period 4000 IU one of the investigational product subcutaneously, according to randomisation,
      separated by a washout period of 4 weeks. The evaluation of the profile between products
      included serum dosage of medications and reticulocyte count in peripheral blood. Safety
      evaluation data will include report od all adverse events (including type, frequency,
      intensity, seriousness, severity and action taken related to the investigational product
      study).
