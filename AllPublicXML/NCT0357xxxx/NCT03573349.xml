  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a feasibility study and the goal of this project is to evaluate whether ACC
      glutamine, quantified as a CSF-corrected absolute concentration percent change from baseline,
      is associated with clinical remission, Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)
      total score of =9, to the anti-glutamatergic antidepressant ketamine. As MRS is expensive, we
      also aim to study a correlation between peripheral glutamate and central glutamate level.

      Aims:

      This feasibility study aims to better understand the neurobiology of major depression and how
      ketamine may therapeutically impact brain function. This research may provide important
      insights into the mechanism of ketamine response, thus, potentially increasing the likelihood
      of successful treatment interventions and decrease the number of ineffective treatments
      and/or risk for serious side effects.

      SPECIFIC AIMS:

      Primary aim: Evaluate change in central glutamate (i.e. MR spectroscopic CSF corrected
      glutamate in ACC) and peripheral glutamate (i.e. high-performance liquid chromatography
      [HPLC] measured glutamate) after a single 40-minute infusion of i.v. racemic ketamine, and
      change in symptoms of depression measured using MADRS scale in patients with
      treatment-resistant major depression (baseline to 24 hours) (n=10).

    <description>We will enroll 20 adults with treatment-resistant unipolar major depression and will provide one i.v. ketamine infusions (0.5 mg/kg, infused over 40 minutes) and measure their depressive symptom responses. Adults (aged 18-65 years) with treatment-resistant depression will be included. Biomarkers will be developed using blood samples from study subjects, taken prior to (predictive biomarkers), during (at 20 minutes), and following ketamine treatment (change biomarkers). This will be an open label feasibility trial.</description>
