    <textblock>
      The ultimate objective of the proposed line of research is to determine if cryoanalgesia is
      an effective adjunctive treatment for pain in the period immediately following various
      painful surgical procedures; and, if this analgesic modality decreases the risk of persistent
      postoperative pain, or &quot;chronic&quot; pain. The objective of the proposed pilot study is to
      optimize the protocol and collect data to power subsequent, definitive clinical trials.

      Specific Aim 1: To determine if, compared with current and customary analgesia, the addition
      of cryoanalgesia decreases the incidence and severity of post-surgical pain.

      Hypothesis 1a (primary): The severity of surgically-related pain will be significantly
      decreased on postoperative day 2 with the addition of cryoanalgesia as compared with patients
      receiving solely standard-of-care treatment.

      Hypothesis 1b: The incidence of chronic pain will be significantly decreased one year
      following surgery with the addition of cryoanalgesia as compared with patients receiving
      solely standard-of-care treatment.

      Hypothesis 1c: The severity of chronic pain will be significantly decreased one year
      following surgery with the addition of cryoanalgesia as compared with patients receiving
      solely standard-of-care treatment.

      Specific Aim 2: To determine if, compared with current and customary analgesia, the addition
      of cryoanalgesia improves postoperative functioning.

      Hypothesis 2a: Following primary unilateral knee and shoulder arthroplasty as well as rotator
      cuff repair, joint range of motion will be significantly increased within the year following
      surgery with the addition of cryoanalgesia as compared with patients receiving solely
      standard-of-care treatment.

      Hypothesis 2b: Following video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, inspiratory spirometry will be
      improved within the month following surgery with the addition of cryoanalgesia as compared
      with patients receiving solely standard-of-care treatment.

      Subjects will be individuals undergoing unilateral or bilateral mastectomy; upper or lower
      limb amputation; primary, unilateral total knee or shoulder arthroplasty; primary, unilateral
      rotator cuff repair; video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery; and burn-related skin grafting of
      the lateral thigh. Those who consent to participate in this study will have standard
      preoperative peripheral nerve blocks administered and catheters inserted: paravertebral
      blocks or a fascial plane block (e.g., erector spinae plane block) for mastectomy,
      femoral/sciatic for lower limb amputation, and brachial plexus (or terminal nerves) for upper
      limb amputation; femoral or adductor canal for total knee arthroplasty; interscalene for
      shoulder arthroplasty or rotator cuff repair; thoracic epidural for video-assisted
      thoracoscopic surgery (VATS); and lateral femoral cutaneous nerve for skin grafting of the
      lateral thigh.

      Treatment group assignment (randomization). Subjects with successfully-administered
      peripheral nerve blocks (defined by sensory changes in the appropriate nerve distribution)
      will be allocated to one of two possible treatments:

        1. cryoneurolysis

        2. sham cryoneurolysis (placebo control)

      Randomization will be stratified by surgery type (e.g., mastectomy, upper limb amputation,
      and lower limb amputation). Computer-generated randomization lists will be used to create
      sealed, opaque randomization envelopes with the treatment group assignment enclosed in each
      envelope labeled with the randomization number.

      The specific nerves targeted will depend on the surgical site: intercostal nervesblocks (4
      levels depending on the specific surgical approach) for mastectomy; femoral/sciatic for lower
      limb amputation, and brachial plexus (or terminal nerves) for upper limb amputation;
      infrapatellar branch of the saphenous nerve for knee arthroplasty; suprascapular nerve for
      shoulder surgery; intercostal nerves for VATS procedures, and the lateral femoral cutaneous
      nerve for skin grafting of the lateral thigh. The cryoneurolysis sites will be cleansed with
      chlorhexidine gluconate and isopropyl alcohol. Using the optimal ultrasound transducer for
      the specific anatomic location and subject anatomy (linear vs curvilinear array), the target
      nerves will be identified in a transverse cross-sectional (short axis) view.

      Cryoneurolysis probes are available for a console neurolysis device (PainBlocker, Epimed,
      Farmers Branch, Texas) that either (1) pass nitrous oxide to the tip inducing freezing
      temperatures; or, (2) vent the nitrous oxide at the base of the probe so that no gas reaches
      the probe tip, resulting in no temperature change. Importantly, these probes are
      indistinguishable in appearance, and therefore treating physicians, subjects, and all
      clinical staff will be masked to treatment group assignment [only the treating
      physician/investigator performing the cryoneurolysis with be unmasked]. An
      angiocatheter/introducer may be inserted beneath the ultrasound transducer and directed until
      the probe tip is immediately adjacent to the target nerve (lidocaine 2% will be administered,
      as needed, to anesthetize the angiocatheter track). The angiocatheter needle will be removed,
      leaving the angiocatheter through which the appropriate Epimed probe will be inserted until
      it is adjacent to the target nerve. The cryoneurolysis device will be triggered using 3
      cycles of 2-minute gas activation (active or sham) separated by 1-minute defrost periods. For
      active probes, the nitrous oxide will be deployed to the tip where a drop in temperature to
      -70Â°C will result in cryoneurolysis. For the sham probes, the nitrous oxide will be vented
      prior to reaching the probe shaft, resulting in a lack of perineural temperature change. The
      process will be repeated with the same treatment probe for any additional nerves (e.g., all
      nerves will receive either active cryoneurolysis or sham/placebo, and not a mix of the two
      possible treatments).

      Statistical Analysis. The limb amputation, total knee and shoulder arthroplasty, rotator cuff
      repair, VATS, and skin grafting subjects will be included in pilot studies to help power a
      future clinical trials, so the investigators will enroll a convenience sample and not have a
      pre-determined primary endpoint or statistical plan. However, the end points of most interest
      will be average pain score on postoperative day 2 for shoulder arthroplasty and skin grafting
      subjects, range-of-motion at 6 weeks for the rotator cuff repairs, range-of-motion for knee
      arthroplasty, and FEV1 for the VATS procedures.

      For the subjects having mastectomy, the investigators will power this study for an acute pain
      end point which will provide conclusive results for that end point; but, the data will also
      be used to help power a subsequent large, multicenter clinical trial for a chronic
      pain-related end point (which will require far more subjects than the investigators will
      enroll for the current study).

      For the mastectomy subjects, sample size calculations are centered around the hypothesis that
      cryoneurolysis decreases the incidence and severity of post-mastectomy pain in the week
      following surgery. To this end, the primary outcome is the average NRS (as administered as
      part of the Brief Pain Inventory) queried on the afternoon of postoperative day 2. The
      difference in the distribution of NRS between groups will be assessed using the Mann-Whitney
      U test. The investigators approximate power using the two-sample t-test. Assuming a standard
      deviation of 2.25 NRS points,2 and minimum clinically meaningful difference of 2 NRS points,
      n=30 patients per group provide 86% power with two-sided alpha=5%.

      The t-test approximation was confirmed by simulating integer valued NRS scores in the range 0
      to 10. One group was simulated by rounding normally distributed data with mean 1.5 and
      standard deviation 2.5 (resulting in median of 2 and interquartile range 0 to 3); and the
      other with mean 3.5 and standard deviation 2.5 (resulting in median of 4 and interquartile
      range 1 to 5). Note these resulting summary statistics are consistent with Ilfeld et al
      (2014). When 10,000 trials were simulated under these assumptions, the Mann-Whitney U test
      provided 89.5% power, and Type I error was maintained at 4.85%.

      Differences between groups in demographic variables and secondary endpoints will be assessed
      with the Mann-Whitney U test for continuous or ordinal data, and Fisher's Exact test for
      categorical data. Box-and-whisker plots will be used to visualize distributions by group.

      R version 3.4.4 (R-project.org) was used for sample size calculations and simulations; and
      the most recent version of R will be used at the time of analysis.

    <description>The Brief Pain Inventory SF is designed to assess pain and its impact on physical and emotional functioning. It has established reliability and validity, with minimal inter-rater discordance, and is recommended by the Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials (IMMPACT) consensus statement. The Brief Pain Inventory is comprised of three domains: (1) pain, with four questions involving &quot;worst&quot;, &quot;average&quot;, &quot;least&quot;, and &quot;current&quot; pain levels using a 0-10 Numeric Rating Scale; (2) percentage of relief provided by pain treatments with one question (reported score is the percentage divided by 10 and then subtracted from 10: 0 = complete relief, 10 = no relief); and, (3) interference with 7 questions involving physical and emotional functioning using a 0-10 Likert scale (0 = none; 10 = complete).</description>
