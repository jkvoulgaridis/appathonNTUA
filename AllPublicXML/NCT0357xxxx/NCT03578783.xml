  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to test the effect of PSD502 (the study medication) compared to
      placebo in subjects with premature ejaculation. PSD502 is a topical (applied to skin)
      anesthetic spray containing a mixture of two drugs called lidocaine and prilocaine that will
      be applied to the penis. Half of the subjects will receive PSD502 and half will receive
      placebo.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will assess whether the bothersome symptoms of premature ejaculation (PE) are
      helped when treated with PSD502 by answering questionnaires such as the 'Premature
      Ejaculation Bothersome Evaluation Questionnaire' (PEBEQ) and 'Index of Premature Ejaculation©
      (IPE) and some additional questions about premature ejaculation.

      The study will also measure the effect of PSD502 on the Intravaginal Ejaculatory Latency Time
      (IELT). This is the time between when the penis enters the vagina and when the subject starts
      to ejaculate in the vagina.

      Subjects are stratified based on whether they are circumcised or uncircumcised and within
      each stratified group subjects are randomized to PSD502 (lidocaine prilocaine spray) or
      placebo in a 1:1 ratio.

          -  Subjects taking tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) or
             selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), for indications other than PE, where
             the dose has been changed within 4 weeks of Screening or it is planned that the dose

             6 PD) deficiency or currently using medications that would increase susceptibility to
             methemoglobinemia (e.g., anti-malarial agents) or has congenital or acquired
             methemoglobinemia, or is at risk of industrial exposure to agents causing
             methemoglobinemia.
