      This study evaluates an adolescent transition package (ATP) to support HIV infected
      adolescents transitioning form pediatric/adolescent care to adult care. Ten clinics will
      receive the intervention and 10 will receive standard of care transition services.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Adolescent Transition Package (ATP) will include two components. The validated Namibia
      comic book for disclosure (to be used with children over 10 years of age) and transition
      booklet &quot;Taking Charge&quot; developed by stakeholders in Kenya.

      The disclosure tool includes a cartoon book, readiness and tracking tools used in clinic and
      health care worker training material. The intervention progresses from incomplete to complete
      disclosure using a narrative about soldiers fighting the battle of infection as the rationale
      for taking medicine. This tool has been validated for use in Namibia.

      The adapted transition toolkit includes a transition booklet, tracking tools to be used by
      health care workers and a readiness assessment checklist to be completed by study staff. The
      booklet has 4 chapters addressing key areas to support adolescents gain the knowledge and
      skills they need in adult care. The 4 chapters are: HIV treatment literacy, self management,
      communication and support.

    <description>The scale name is the &quot;Taking Charge transition readiness assessment&quot;. The scale measures readiness to transition to adult care. The scale has questions measuring attainment of knowledge and skills to navigate adult care systems. The scale is divided into 4 domains: HIV literacy (maximum score is 5, minimum 0), self-management (maximum score is 9, minimum 0), communication (maximum score is 5, minimum is 0) and support (maximum score 3, minimum is 0). The higher the score the more prepared an adolescent is to transition to adult care. For this outcome, scores across all domains will be summed to get a total readiness score (maximum score 22, minimum 0).</description>
