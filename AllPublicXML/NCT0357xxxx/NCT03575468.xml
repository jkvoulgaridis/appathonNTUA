  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop and pilot test an enhanced behavioral coaching
      intervention for dual users of cigarettes and electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) who
      call tobacco quitlines for help quitting smoking.

      The specific aims of this research are to:

        1. Develop an Enhanced ENDS Coaching (EEC) intervention to improve standard quitline
           treatment for dual users who contact the quitline for help quitting smoking and are
           using ENDS, and train tobacco cessation coaches to deliver the intervention.

        2. Phase 1 (n=10): Assess preliminary EEC acceptability and feasibility, and refine the
           intervention with 10 dual users. Hypothesis 1: ENDS users will rate the helpfulness and
           usability of EEC positively and will exhibit increased knowledge about ENDS and
           cessation aids.

        3. Phase 2 (n=100): Evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of EEC compared to quitline
           treatment as usual (TAU) in a randomized pilot study of 100 smokers who use ENDS and are
           seeking help with quitting smoking. Hypothesis 2a (engagement): EEC participants will
           complete as many or more coaching calls than TAU. Hypothesis 2b (acceptability,
           satisfaction; assessed via 3-month survey): EEC will have satisfaction at least as high
           as the TAU group and rate their quit plan development experience more positively.
           Hypothesis 2c (beliefs; assessed at 3-month survey): EEC participants will report more
           accurate knowledge and beliefs about ENDS, smoking, and FDA-approved cessation
           medications.

    <description>In Phase 2, average treatment satisfaction and acceptability rating will be compared for EEC and TAU participants. Full 1-6 scale description: 1 - very satisfied; 2 - satisfied; 3 - somewhat satisfied; 4 - somewhat dissatisfied; 5 - dissatisfied; 6 - very dissatisfied. Participants can also respond &quot;I don't know&quot; or &quot;I prefer not to answer&quot;. On scale 1-6, 1 is the best outcome.</description>

    <description>In Phase 2, Knowledge and Beliefs about ENDS, Smoking, and FDA-approved Cessation Medications will be assessed via 14 belief questions designed for this study, and compared for EEC and TAU participants. Answers are reported on a 4 or 5 point scales (answer scales are tailored to the content of the specific question). Responses to individual items will be described. The questionnaire will be evaluated and refined, if needed, during Phase 1 of the study.</description>

In addition to the standard quitline cessation program, the enhanced program will include education (via quit coaches and two tailored quit guides), behavioral support tailored to dual users, and shared decision making strategies to address how and why FDA-approved quitting aids and ENDS are being used and to develop an integrated quit plan based on callers' decisions.</description>
