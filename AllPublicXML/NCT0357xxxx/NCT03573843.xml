  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a pilot randomized controlled trial, comparing a group of older patients with
      standardized non-pharmacological delirium prevention plus a basic tablet versus a group with
      standardized non-pharmacological delirium prevention plus a tablet with a software of
      cognitive stimulation (PREVEDEL).

      Software:It is a local development, including a interprofessional team of delirium healthcare
      experts, older patients and a team og engineers. The software was developed during the first
      year of this project and was inscribed for author rights.

      Inclusion criteria: Older patients &gt; 65 y.o. Admitted to medicine room or intermediate care
      unit &gt; 48 hrs, and informed consent to participate.

      Exclusion Criteria:Delirium positive, neuroleptic use, dementia, and non-spanish speakers.

      The study was approved by ethical committee of Hospital Clinico University of Chile
      Standardized Non-pharmacological intervention: Health workers were previously educated in
      delirium, and environmental issues were implemented. This intervention coverage in nine
      different domains: orientation, early mobilization, environmental noise and light, sensorial
      deficit, sleep, hydratation, drug reduction, and family participation.

      Intervention: All patients will have a tablet with or without the software PREVEDEL between
      09:00-19:00 hrs.

      Measures: delirium will be monitoring with CAM (Confusion Assessment Method) twice a day for
      5 days.

      Primary outcome: Delirium rate between both groups Secondary outcomes:Long of stay, severity
      od delirium, time of use of electronic device, and Barthel to discharge.
