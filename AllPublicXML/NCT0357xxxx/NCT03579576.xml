  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project will evaluate cost and treatment outcomes of a simplified hepatitis C virus (HCV)
      testing, treatment and care model integrated with HIV testing and treatment among key
      affected populations including people who inject drugs (PWID) in Myanmar.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Affected populations will be screened for HCV and HIV and treated with direct a fixed-dose
      combination of sofosbuvir 400 mg/velpatasvir 100 mg (SOF/VEL) orally once daily for 12 weeks
      with or without weight-based ribavirin. Before and after completion of the treatment course
      viral load assessments will be undertaken using low-cost laboratory monitoring for comparison
      to standard HCV viral load measurement. Up to 800 patients enrolled on treatment will be
      followed up at 4, 8, 12 and 24 weeks when Sustained Viral Load ( SVL) will be determined.
      Safety monitoring will be undertaken at applicable visits for those on Ribavirin and all
      adverse events will be reported based on Good Clinical Practice. In addition to assessing to
      assessing cost outcomes, the project will assess HCV treatment efficacy in terms of sustained
      virologic response at 12 weeks after end of HCV treatment (defined as undetected HCV RNA or
      less than lower limit of detection), compare the cost of low cost HCV viral assay platforms
      to standard of care, assess rates of ART initiation and virologic suppression of HIV-infected
      persons within the simplified HCV testing and treatment model and impact of HIV co-infection
      in participants on the HCV treatment outcome of sustained virologic response (SVR12). The
      project will be conducted 3 treatment sites in Yangon, Mandalay, and Kachin state in Myanmar.

    <measure>Estimated cost of HCV screening per patient screened and per case identified and the cost per successfully treated patient for HCV mono-infected and co-infected participants</measure>
    <time_frame>Two years. This will be after data on Viral load response is complete.</time_frame>
    <description>The average cost to the provider per patient achieving SVR12 will be estimated, as will the average cost per other outcomes achieved, such as per patient screened and per patient remaining in care by other specified endpoints, stratified by HIV status and by any other important patient or site characteristics that are identified as drivers of cost. The study will also estimate the average cost to &quot;produce&quot; a successful outcome (SVR12), which is the ratio of total costs for the intervention for the entire sample enrolled to the number of patients achieving the primary outcome. This latter estimate captures the costs incurred for patients who do not have successful outcomes and thus relates resource utilization to health outcomes.</description>

    <measure>Overall Sustained Viral load response (SVR12) across all groups of HCV genotype, fibrosis stage, HIV and HBV co-infection.</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks ( 12 weeks post treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>This will be the main treatment outcome of all patients initiated on treatment. Baseline viral load is done at entry with treatment initiated for those positive and eligible. Patients initiated on treatment will be assessed for viral load response at 24 weeks ( 12 weeks post treatment). This will also help in development of Care cascade for HCV testing, treatment and SVR12 in key populations co-infected with HIV/HCV, HIV/HCV/HBV, HBV/HCV and HCV mono-infected.</description>
