  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the clinical safety and patient satisfaction with the high power
      magnet system for the aesthetic improvement of buttocks. The study is a prospective
      multi-center open-label single-arm study. The subjects will be enrolled and assigned into a
      single study group. Subjects will be required to complete four (4) treatment visits and three
      follow-up visits - 1 month, 3 months and 12 months after the final treatment. Study will be
      conducted at several study sites.

      At the baseline visit, subject's weight will be recorded. Subjects will receive Buttocks
      Evaluation Questionnaire to fill in.

      The treatment administration phase will consist of four (4) treatments, delivered twice a
      week. The applicator will be applied over the gluteal area. Visible contractions will be
      induced by the device.

      At the last therapy visit, the subject's weight will be recorded. In addition, subjects will
      receive Subject Satisfaction, Buttocks Evaluation and Therapy Comfort Questionnaires to fill
      in.

      Safety measures will include documentation of adverse events (AE) including subject's
      experience of pain or discomfort after the procedure. Following each treatment administration
      and at the follow-up visits, subjects will be checked for immediate post-procedure adverse
      event assessment.

      Post-procedure evaluation (follow-up visits) will be conducted 1 month, 3 months and 12
      months after the final treatment. A weight measure will be conducted. Also, subject's
      satisfaction and buttocks evaluation will be noted.

    <description>The 5-point Likert scale Subject Satisfaction Questionnaire will be used for an analysis of the subject's opinion of the therapy results. Subjects will be evaluating agreement with three different statements (concerning satisfaction with therapy results and appearance of abdominal area after therapy) by choosing an answer on a scale between 1 (Strongly disagree) and 5 (Strongly agree). Minimally 80% of the treated subjects should report the agreement with all three statements given in the questionnaire (answers &quot;Agree&quot; and &quot;Strongly agree&quot;) in order to claim subject's satisfaction with the therapy outcome.</description>

    <description>The 7 point Likert scale Buttocks Evaluation Questionnaire will be used for an assessment if there is a change in subject's perception of their own buttocks area before and after the therapy session. The total possible score ranges from 4 points (lowest possible satisfaction) to 28 points (highest possible satisfaction).</description>

    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Therapy comfort will be noted at the last therapy visit. Subjects will be asked to evaluate the agreement with the statement concerning the conformity of the study treatment. Subjects will be evaluating the agreement by choosing an answer on a scale between 1 (Strongly disagree) and 5 (Strongly agree). Based on a given answers, the therapy comfort will be calculated.</description>
