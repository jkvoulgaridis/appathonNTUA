  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial investigates the influence of the use of a Smartone App, on changes in general
      well being and the occurrence of symptoms during a tumor therapy. With this documentation,
      medical professionals should be enabled to judge the influence of symptoms on quality of life
      during different time periods, between planed visits on site.

    <textblock>
      The study will examine the number, characteristics and intensity of electronically reported
      symptoms and therapy side effects depending on treatment and characteristics of patients with
      cancer of breast, colon, prostate, lung and hematological malignancies during a three-month
      period from the initiation of therapy. This period frequently represents the duration of a
      therapeutic regimen.

      The level of agreement κ between the ECOG/CTCAE ratings by physicians at the time of the
      regular consultation, and the ratings derived from the daily PROs between consultations, will
      be analyzed in order to determine the reliability and utility of self-reported electronic
      symptom monitoring.

      The purpose is to evaluate different qualities of symptoms self-reported electronically
      between consultations with respect to the course of treatment application, out-patient
      settings, gender and age. In particular, outpatients with frequent (weekly) consultations
      will be compared to patients with infrequent consultations (3-weekly or less frequent).

      The study will also aim to identify the conditions and factors that might increase the
      likelihood of an unplanned consultation or emergency hospitalization.

      In particular, the proposed study design and associated primary and secondary endpoints will
      enable us to test the following hypotheses:

        1. In patient groups with infrequent outpatient visits (3-weekly or less) as is determined
           by the treatment schedule, the level of agreement κ between ePRO-derived ECOG/CTCAE
           ratings and physician-derived ECOG/CTCAE ratings (at time of consultation) is at least
           as high as in patient groups with weekly visits for symptoms having occurred within the
           week before the visit. However, κ is expected lower in the group with infrequent visits
           for symptoms having occurred more than 2 weeks prior to consultation, due to higher
           fidelity of ePRO-derived ratings for long-ago symptoms.

        2. Regular visits of outpatients undergoing infusion therapy (as determined by the
           treatment schedule) do not significantly decrease the number of unplanned and emergency
           consultations necessary.

        3. Young female and older male patient groups report significantly more severe and
           worsening symptoms and side effects.

      Patients with the most common types of cancer in the treatment center will be included:

      Breast, Colon, Prostate, Lung, Hematological malignancies

    <description>The app is used to record the study parameters for a period of 90 days.
The following measures are used for data collection:
Interview during regular consultation with doctor
Web-App for gathering doctors data
&quot;Consilium&quot; Smartphone App for gathering patient data During the course of care, the patient enters in a regular manner symptoms and treatment side effects in the Smartphone app. A continuous capture of the symptoms and treatment side effect is provided. If no entry is made within 3 days the patient is prompted to enter the data via a push message.
Well-being through a patient rating on a visual analog scale
Registration of symptoms and treatment side effects is done through the app
After completion of the study patients will be questioned according to:
• Usability and usefulness of the Smartphone app</description>
