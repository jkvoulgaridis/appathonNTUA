  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The surgical procedure can be considered a transition in the patient's life. The transition
      can generate instability and produce negative effects, which may be temporary or permanent.
      Failure to prepare people to deal with the unexpected, such as diagnosing a disease, such as
      cancer, and surgical necessity can be a frightening and frustrating experience, developing
      painful and distressing feelings, involving their family members as well.

    <textblock>
      A preoperative orientation process with potential benefits to the patient has been adopted
      for some surgical procedures. However, recently some surgical specialties such as orthopedics
      have been implemented in their routine a potentially modifiable conduct of the emotional
      trauma of a surgery, is the use of the preoperative advice and orientation, in order to
      attain an ability to increase the client's satisfaction, to facilitate the recovery, decrease
      the rate of complications without increasing reintegration, decrease hospitalization time and
      health costs without additional patient risk. There is a belief among surgeons that
      preoperative counseling and counseling is vitally important for a post-operative outcome.
      Despite this, there is a paucity of well-conducted studies that examine the importance of the
      need for preoperative counseling with detailed information to analyze the yearnings and needs
      as well as the emotional impact. In addition, there are few studies evaluating the emotional
      impact and impact in the postoperative period in general of detailed preoperative counseling
      in patients with gynecological tumors submitted to laparotomy and minimally invasive surgery.
      For these reasons, this study aims to evaluate whether the application of detailed and clear
      preoperative counseling and education about the surgical procedure to be performed, as well
      as all the perioperative guidelines that involve the procedure versus the usual preoperative
      orientation and preoperative, can have an impact on the level of anxiety of the patient and
      the companion, as well as assess the degree of satisfaction of the companion.

    <description>The investigators will measure anxiety levels using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.The HADS is a fourteen item scale that generates ordinal data. Seven of the items relate to anxiety and seven relate to depression. Each item on the questionnaire is scored from 0-3 and this means that a person can score between 0 and 21 for either anxiety or depression. The HADS uses a scale and therefore the data returned from the HADS is ordinal.</description>

    <description>It is composed of patients scheduled for surgical treatment by tumors of the uterine cervix, vulva, ovary or endometrium, who will receive preoperative and postoperative guidelines according to the usual routine for the perioperative period of the present institution. Patients and their followers of the control group will participate in a preoperative consultation with the surgeon to discuss the indication of the procedure and its risks, benefits and alternatives to the procedure being indicated, if any.

    <description>Composed of patients scheduled for surgical treatment by tumors of the uterine cervix, vulva, ovary or endometrium who will receive preoperative counseling and education through a pre-defined protocol after preoperative consultation with the surgeon. The counseling session will take place with at least one companion. The purpose of this session is to supplement, re-emphasize and strengthen the perioperative guidelines. An illustration (explanatory folder) will be used to demonstrate the location of the surgery, how the scar will be and on which sites of the abdomen and organs the surgery will cover. All this counseling and education will be applied at the same time to the patient and her companion. At the end of the intervention, a space will be left open for both the patient and the companion to ask questions and questions.
