  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, single arm, open-lable phase 1 study to determine the safety and
      efficacy of autologous or donor-derived allogeneic T cells expressing CD19 chimeric antigen
      receptors (referred to as &quot;CD19-CAR-T cells&quot;) in patients with relapsed or refractory acute
      B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia (R/R B-ALL).

      Primary objective:

      To investigate the safety and efficacy of autologous or HLA-haploidentical Allo-CD19-CAR-T
      cells in the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory acute B-cell lymphoblastic
      leukemia.

      Secondary objective:

      To Assess the patient's quality of life after receiving the treatment.
