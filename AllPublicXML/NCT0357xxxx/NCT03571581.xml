  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the feasibility and acceptability of a phone-delivered
      mindfulness intervention to improve medication adherence among outpatients with heart
      failure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This project seeks to study the role of mindfulness training (MT) in the promotion of
      medication adherence among patients with chronic heart failure. The investigators will assess
      the feasibility and acceptability of this approach in this population and determine whether
      MT improves medication adherence. A prospective pre/post design study will be conducted among
      50 stable outpatients with HF and sub-optimal medication adherence. MT sessions (one 30-min
      session/week over 8 weeks) will be phone-delivered by qualified mindfulness instructors. Data
      will be collected at baseline, and at 2- and 6-months since baseline.
