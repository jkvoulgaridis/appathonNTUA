  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the potential ability of vinegar to significantly
      decrease visceral fat in healthy adults with &quot;central obesity&quot;. During the 8-week trial,
      participants will either consume a low-dose vinegar pill (control treatment) or a vinegar
      drink twice per day.

      Research Aim and Hypothesis H1 Daily vinegar consumption will be associated with loss in
      visceral fat (as measured by DXA) after 8 weeks compared to the placebo treatment
      (low-vinegar pill) in a group of healthy adults with &quot;central obesity&quot;.

      H2 Daily vinegar consumption will be associated with a decrease in abdominal circumference
      after 8 weeks compared to the placebo treatment (low-vinegar pill) in a group of healthy
      adults with &quot;central obesity&quot;.

      This randomized, placebo-controlled experimental trial will last 8 weeks. At the initial
      visit (consenting visit lasting about 20 minutes) the participant will sign the consent and
      complete a short health questionnaire and a short questionnaire on tooth erosion. Body height
      and weight and waist circumference will also be measured. Qualifying participants will be
      stratified by gender, age, weight, and waist circumference, then randomized into two groups:
      the intervention group, vinegar drinks (VIN) or the control group, vinegar pills (CON). The
      participants will know which treatment they are given but they will not know which group
      (control vs. placebo) they are in. Those who receive the VIN will be instructed to drink 2
      tablespoons of red wine vinegar (provided) mixed with water twice each day for weeks 1 to 8
      of the trial. Those in the CON group will be instructed to take one vinegar pill (provided)
      each day for weeks 1-8 of the trial. Participants will be instructed to maintain their
      current diet and exercise habits during the study.
