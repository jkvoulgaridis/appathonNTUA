  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study was to test whether motivational interviewing (MI)
      provided over the mobile phone would reduce alcohol use among adults, including people living
      with HIV/AIDS, visiting primary care in Kenya. Heavy alcohol users voluntarily consented to
      being randomized to one of three study arms: standard in-person MI, mobile MI, or waitlist
      control receiving no intervention for 1 month followed by mobile MI. Alcohol use problems
      were assessed using validated screeners and changes in alcohol use were assessed at 1 month
      and 6 months after receiving the intervention. The investigators hypothesized that alcohol
      use would reduce after MI treatment compared to waitlist control, there would be no
      difference between standard in-person MI and mobile MI, and these reductions would be
      sustained out to six months following the intervention.

    <description>In-Person Motivational Interviewing (MI) is the standard form of MI treatment delivered in person face to face at the primary care office. MI is a type of brief intervention that uses open-ended questions, affirmations, reflective listening, and summarizing as key tools and has been shown to treat a range of problem behaviors, including alcohol use disorders, by helping participants to identify and address ambivalence towards changing the behavior. MI is delivered in a communicative style that promotes individual autonomy and improves self-efficacy. The investigator provides counseling in-person with the participant for one session of MI lasting approximately 30 minutes.</description>
