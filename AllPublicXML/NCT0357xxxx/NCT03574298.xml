      This study evaluate the effect of radical prostatectomy on involuntary pelvic floor muscle
      contraction

    <textblock>
      Radical prostatectomy may cause stress urinary incontinence (SUI). That poses problem in
      terms of quality of life. There are many treatment options available for patients with SUI,
      but the exact mechanism is not known. We compared, in continent and incontinent men
      post-radical prostatectomy, the correlation between the temporal course of pelvic floor
      activation during cough.

      Simultaneously, recordings of electromyographic activity of external anal sphincter (EAS EMG)
      and external intercostal muscle (EIC EMG) during coughing will be made with a pair of
      pre-gelled electrodes. Cough effort cause an involuntary pelvic contraction. Intercostals
      muscles recording was chosen because they are one of the muscular components of cough
      initiation with diaphragm muscle. 24h pad-weighing test is used to quantify urinary
      incontinence. We will measure the latency between the onset of the EIC EMG and the EAS EMG
      (RT3), during a cough effort. We will also measure the duration of the contraction, the
      maximum EAS EMG activity and the area under the curve.
