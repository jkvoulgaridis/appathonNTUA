  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of the SujuKE study is to test the effectiveness of workplace cognitive
      ergonomics development program designed to decrease cognitively disrupting work conditions
      and work-related cognitive stress, and to improve work flow. The cognitive ergonomics
      workplace intervention includes cognitive ergonomics workshop, work experiments, and
      intervention task questionnaires. Its effect on changes in subjective measures of work
      conditions, work flow, stress, and work productivity will be studied. The hypothesis is that
      cognitive ergonomics intervention decreases the level of cognitive strain related to work
      conditions, and this change is associated with higher level in work flow, well-being, and
      productivity at work.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the modern work life, performing work tasks rely on cognitive function, i.e. mental
      processes that are involved in processing information, such as attention, working memory,
      decision making and learning. Furthermore, the conditions at work include situations that
      require cognitive capacity. Information overload, multitasking and interruptions are typical
      features in any work. Thus, in the modern work life, work is knowledge work or information
      work by nature, and cognitive strain is a notable psychosocial risk factor. Not only task
      demands per se can exceed natural limitations of human cognitive capacities, but also the
      conditions at work can make it demanding for a human to perform.

      Research shows that psychosocial stress, including cognitive stress, challenges wellbeing,
      safety and productivity at work. Cognitively straining conditions, such as disruptions,
      interruptions and information overload are related to higher levels of work stress,
      occupational accidents, and cognitive failures at work. It is essential to decrease harmful
      consequences to individual workers, organizations, and the society by managing psychosocial
      risks typical to cognitively demanding work tasks and conditions.

      SujuKE study focuses on ergonomics (or human factors) practices that aim to ensure
      'appropriate interaction between work, product and environment, and human needs, capabilities
      and limitations'. In cognitive ergonomics, the focus is on making human-system interaction
      compatible with human cognitive abilities and limitations, particularly at work. The aim is
      to apply general principles and good practices of cognitive ergonomics that help to avoid
      unnecessary cognitive load at work and that improve human performance.

      The aim of the SujuKE study is to improve the conditions of knowledge work and promote the
      flow of work and reduce work strain. There are studies which show that decreasing
      disruptions, providing uninterrupted working time, and reducing information may lead to
      improved work flow and productivity. In the SujuKE-study, several sources of cognitive strain
      are restricted and concrete methods to help improve cognitive ergonomics will be worked on
      and implemented at workplace. The objective of the project is to obtain research evidence of
      the effects of cognitive ergonomics development programme on working conditions, the flow of
      work, well-being at work, and the productivity at work.

      During the SujuKE project, the investigators will implement measures at the workplace that
      aim to facilitate work and reduce strain. The objective of the project is to obtain research
      evidence of the effects of these measures on working conditions, the flow of work, well-being
      at work, and the productivity at work. The study is carried out by the Finnish Institute of
      Occupational Health (FIOH) and funded by the Finnish Work Environment Fund.

    <intervention_model_description>Cluster randomization with stratification allocated groups selected by participating organizations to treatment and control groups. Primary stratification was by the organization. Within-organization stratification took into account the size, the type of work tasks and the response rate in the first survey of cluster. Participating organizations entered all together to 36 clusters, each with individuals for the intervention and active control groups (N=638 individuals). The intervention (and active control) receive different types of workshops, individual tasks and team tasks. Additional information is available from non-randomized passive control group (N=289 individuals).
Participating organizations were recruited by informing about the study. Participating units included knowledge workers, whose work tasks are cognitively rather than physically demanding.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Change in cognitive strain prevalence</measure>
    <time_frame>1: Baseline measurements: 10-16 weeks before the intervention phase. 2: End-of-treatment measurements: 18-28 weeks after the baseline measurements. 3: Follow-up 4m: 16 weeks after the end-of-treatment. 4: Follow-up 10m: 40 weeks after end-of-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Cognitive strain prevalence measures prevalence of disruptions, interruptions, and information overload.
There are two items on disruptions, three items on interruptions, and seven items on information overload including memory load, multitasking, and problems with instructions (Brain@Work survey by FIOH).
Response scale is from 1 to 5, higher number indicating higher prevalence (Scale: More rarely; Monthly; Weekly; Daily, or almost daily; Many times a day) Total score is a factor score including all 12 items.</description>

    <description>Measured a) for the main themes of the intervention study. There are two items on disruptions, three items on interruptions, and seven items on information overload including memory load, multitasking, and problems with instructions (Brain@Work survey by FIOH).
Furthermore, measured b) with all 39 items from FIOH Brain@Work Index questionnaire including 13 subscales.
Response scale is from -3 to 3 (seven-point), negative values reflecting motivation-energization, positive values reflecting strain, zero reflecting neither. Higher number indicates higher load (Scale: Motivate-Energize Very much; Quite a lot; Somewhat; Cause strain Somewhat; Quite a lot; Very much).
Total scores are averaged a) over the 12 items (disruptions, interruptions, information overload) and b) over the 39 items (all 13 subscales) weighted with their estimated prevalence (5 point scale, higher values reflecting higher prevalence).</description>
