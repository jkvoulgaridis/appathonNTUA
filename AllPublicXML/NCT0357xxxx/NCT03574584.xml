  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is investigating new medicines for weight control in people with high body weight.
      The study looks at how the study medicines work in the body. Participants will get
      semaglutide and either NNC0165-1562 or &quot;dummy&quot; medicine -which treatment participants get is
      decided by chance. Participants will get 2 injections per week for 5 months. A study nurse at
      the clinic will inject the medicine with a thin needle in a skin fold in the stomach. The
      study will last for about 7 months. Participants will have 27 visits to the clinic.

             Index less than 1%, such as implants, injectables, oral contraceptives, intrauterine
             devices, diaphragm or cervical cap+spermicide) combined with a highly effective method
             of contraception for their male partner(s) (e.g. condom with spermicide), or are
             pregnant, breast-feeding or intend to become pregnant.

          -  Male subjects who are not surgically sterilised (vasectomy) and are sexually active
             with female partner(s), who are not using a highly effective method of contraception

             as implants, injectables, oral contraceptives, intrauterine devices, diaphragm or
             cervical cap+spermicide), or intend to donate sperm in the period from screening until
             3 months following administration of the investigational medical product.
