      This is a window of opportunity study for patients with resectable squamous cell carcinoma of

    <textblock>
      This is a single center, open-label, non-randomized, pre-operative window of opportunity
      study for patients with resectable squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity who are
      considered suitable for curative-intent surgical resection, with pre-operative Sitravatinib
      and Nivolumab. A total of 12 patients who are evaluable for correlative studies, are planned
      for enrollment.

      This study will involve treatment with Sitravatinib and Nivolumab, tests and procedures done
      for safety and the collection of blood samples for biomarker research. Tissue samples (fresh
      biopsy or archival tissue) will also be collected for biomarker research and evaluation.
