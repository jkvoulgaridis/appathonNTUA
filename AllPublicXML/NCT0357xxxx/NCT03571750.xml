  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BSA is a novel, computerized intervention specifically designed for active military personnel
      with the intent to reduce two risk factors known to be associated with suicide outcomes.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have focused on the identification of malleable risk factors for
      preventative intervention in a number of types of psychopathology including suicidality. In
      the case of Perceived Burdensomeness (PB) and Thwarted Belongingness (TB), theory suggests
      that they may be malleable, though this has received little empirical attention. Taken
      together, the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide and related empirical literature suggest that
      targeting PB/TB should offer a novel and important avenue to reduce suicidality. This
      inspired the investigators' efforts to create and evaluate an intervention - called Building
      Stronger Allies (BSA) - designed to reduce these factors.

    <description>BSA was developed to model the educational and behavioral techniques commonly employed in the treatment of individuals with mood psychopathology. The psychoeducation portion uses Cognitive Behavioral Therapy principles to correct problematic ideas and behaviors related to PB/TB. More specifically, the program was designed to correct &quot;myths&quot; regarding PB/TB. The program emphasizes the idea that social interaction is a critical need, just like other basic needs such as the need for food and water. Participants are taught that negative beliefs about being isolated and being a burden are usually inaccurate. Following this, behavioral activation techniques are introduced as a way to decrease isolation and feelings of burdensomeness.</description>

    <description>In the HET condition, participants will spend approximately the same amount of time with a program that will present information regarding the importance and benefits of a maintaining a healthy lifestyle and then will provide guidelines to achieve a healthy lifestyle. HET is shown to engage participants with beneficial information while being inert with respect to the risk mechanisms of interest (i.e., PB/TB). The program covers a number of health related topics including: diet, alcohol use, water consumption, exercise, and sleep. The program reviews with the Participants how to monitor their own daily health habits, which will be reinforced by the Smartphone application.</description>
