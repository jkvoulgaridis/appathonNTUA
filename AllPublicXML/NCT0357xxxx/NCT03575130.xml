  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The cornea forms our &quot;window to the world&quot;. Hence, its transparency is of utmost importance
      for vision. Corneal endothelium plays a central role in the maintenance of a transparent
      corneal stroma. It limits stromal fluid uptake from the anterior chamber of the eye through
      the formation of tight junctions. Simultaneously, fluid is actively transported from corneal
      stroma into the anterior chamber. This maintains the corneal stroma in a state of relative
      dehydration, thereby ensuring a constant distance of stromal collagen lamellae to each other,
      which in turn forms the basis for transparency of this tissue. If however corneal endothelial
      function is impaired, stromal swelling leads to corneal clouding and loss of vision.

      Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy represents the most common form of corneal dystrophy. It
      occurs sporadically, however in some cases autosomal dominant inheritance has been described.
      This condition leads to progressive loss of corneal endothelium (typically around the age of
      50-60 years), causing visual impairment due to swelling and opacification of corneal stroma.

      Cell culture experiments have been able to show that chemical inhibitors of Rho-Kinase
      promote corneal endothelial cell proliferation and reduce apoptosis, while topical
      application in an animal model promoted corneal endothelial wound healing. This has prompted
      the notion of using topical Rho-kinase-inhibitor treatment to support endothelial cell
      regeneration in Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy.

      Since September 2014, Rho-kinase-inhibitor eye drops (ripasudil) are clinically available in
      Japan for reduction of intraocular pressure in Glaucoma patients. Ripasudil eye drops
      therefore represent a strong candidate for safe and effective adjunctive treatment in
      patients with Fuchs corneal endothelial cell dystrophy.
