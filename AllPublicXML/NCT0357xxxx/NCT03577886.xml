  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of an oral solution of
      CDX-6114 when administered as a single dose in healthy volunteers.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in approximately 32 healthy
      volunteers who are 18 to 55 years old. Four cohorts are planned, each consisting of 8
      subjects; the cohorts as planned are 0.225, 0.75, 2.25, and 7.5 g in oral solution.
      Increasing doses of CDX-6114 will be assessed sequentially until the final dose is evaluated
      or any of the stopping criteria are reached. Subjects will each receive a single dose and
      then will be followed for a total of 22 days (3 weeks).
