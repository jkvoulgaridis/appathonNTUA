  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in France (54,000 cases in 2011). About 20,000
      radical prostatectomies (PR) per year are performed. Despite the progress of PR over the past
      20 years, the rate of erectile dysfunction post PR varies between 30 and 90% and only 16% of
      operated men recover their pre-treatment erections.

      There is currently no validated post-prostatectomy rehabilitation protocol. The associations
      of patients, including the National Association of Prostate Cancer Patients have a very
      strong demand for treatment of sexual problems after treatment.

    <description>Patients in the experimental group are offered to participate in a 6-session therapeutic education program on sexuality, ranging from 15 days before surgery to approximately 3 months after. This in addition to the current care by the teams of care about sexual rehabilitation (information and medication prescriptions).</description>

    <description>Patients will benefit from the first session of preoperative therapeutic education, then the next 5 sessions will be done postoperatively over a period of 4 month and a half.
Session 1: The first session will be devoted appropriately to patient education. It will take place on the day of the preoperative anesthesia consultation.
Session 2: day of discharge from hospital. Make the patient adhere to the concept of post PR erectile rehabilitation in the same way as sphincter reeducation.
Session 3: Presentation of available treatments, start intracavernous injections.
Session 4: Acquisition of know-how on treatment management. Reduce anxiety. Session 5: Encourage the resumption of intercourse very gradually. The presence of the partner will be advised.
Session 6: measure of the evolution of the representations and knowledge of the patient. The skills of the patient will be evaluated from problem situations, motivation scale. The know-how will be evaluated using observation grid.</description>
