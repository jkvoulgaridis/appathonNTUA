  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with acute, displaced distal radius fractures will be randomized at the time of
      emergency room evaluation to one of two commonly accepted splinting methods for displaced
      distal radius fractures: sugar tong splints or volar/dorsal clam shell splints. Reduction
      will be performed in the usual, standard fashion and the selected splint applied. Standard
      radiographic measurements of alignment, including radial height, volar tilt and inclination
      will be measured on pre- and post- reduction radiographs by a single reviewer- who will be
      blinded to splint application type. At the first fracture follow-up visit, typically
      occurring between 5-10 days, as in standard practice, repeat radiographs of the wrist will be
      taken, and the same reviewer will measure alignment. As a secondary outcome, patients will
      also complete the disabilities of the arm, shoulder and hand (DASH) questionnaire at this
      visit, to compare patients' ability to perform activities of daily living with their
      respective splints.

    <description>A 2-part splint made of 8-10 layers of plaster. The piece traverses from the distal volar crease of the hand to the volar aspect of the proximal forearm. The second piece runs along the dorsal aspect of forearm from metacarpal heads to proximal forearm. The elbow is left free. In the same fashion as the sugar tong splint, the skin is protected with cotton cast padding (webril) and held in place with ace wrap</description>
