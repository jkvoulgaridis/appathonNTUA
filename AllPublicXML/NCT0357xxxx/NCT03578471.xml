  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An EEG study using continuous speech stimuli to assess neural language processing in a
      hearing impaired population. Participants listen to short radio excerpts in different Signal
      to Noise Ratios (SNR) and answer comprehension questions as well as listening effort
      questions. We assess the effect of different algorithms on neural language processing as well
      as subjective listening effort. Each participant hears 12 randomized segments of speech
      (about 4min long each) with different settings on their hearing aid (reference condition,
      noise reduction algorithm, beam forming algorithm). This will be a controlled, single blinded
      and randomized active comparator clinical evaluation which will be conducted mono centric at
      Sonova AG Headquarter based in Stäfa.

    <description>Neural language processing will be assessed through the EEG data collected while the participant is listening to running speech (neurophysiological data). Analysis of the brainstem response, cortical entrainment, N400 and alpha power are planned. EEG data is measured in Volt (mV), and entrainment data is analysed through coherence (frequency-based measure of correlation between the acoustic and the neural signal). N400 and alpha power are measured on the variance of mV over time.</description>

    <description>The subjective Listening Effort rating will be assessed through self-reported individual listening effort on a scale from &quot;extreme effort&quot; to &quot;no effort&quot;.</description>

    <description>Each participant will be fitted with the Noise Reduction (NR)(Sound Changing) program on the same hearing aid. Noise Reduction principle is a sound processing algorithm to remove noise from a speech signal to improve the speech intelligibility and comfort. The Noise Reduction is working spatially independent.</description>
