  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators found that there is inflammation in the chest drainage in patients after
      the Fontan operation. The investigators want to test the theory that Colchicine, an anti-
      inflammatory medication, can decrease the inflammation in the chest tube drainage after the
      Fontan operation, and can decrease the amount of time that patients having this surgery will
      have drainage.

    <description>Colchicine is an alkaloid approved in 1961 for the use in Familial Mediterranean Fever in adults and children 4 years of age or older. It has been widely used for decades in other indications, such as Gout, recurrent pericarditis, pericardial effusions and other inflammatory diseases. This drug is commercially available and is approved in children 4 years and older.</description>
