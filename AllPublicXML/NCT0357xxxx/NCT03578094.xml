  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to explore breastfeeding and complementary feeding practices of mothers in
      the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and its relation to the early life determinants of obesity and
      non-communicable diseases (NCDs). This research study will follow a prospective cohort
      approach. Two hundred and fifty mother-infant pairs will be followed for 18 months.

      The hypothesis of this research study is that exclusive breastfeeding of the infant will
      provide potential protective effect against cardiometabolic risk factors. This study will
      also hypothesize that mothers who exclusively breastfeed their newborns would experience
      greater postpartum weight and body fat loss than mothers who are not breastfeeding.

      United Arab Emirates(UAE) is facing two critical situations: high incidence of obesity and
      chronic diseases and suboptimal infant feeding practices as reported by the Ministry of
      Health in the UAE. So early identification of preventive markers of cardiometabolic risk
      factors in breast milk is important for developing early intervention strategies to optimize
      health care for individuals and communities especially in countries suffering from high rates
      of obesity and chronic diseases such as the UAE.

      The purpose of this study is to prospectively follow up with the mothers and their infants
      (from 0-18months of infants age). It will explore breastfeeding and complementary feeding
      practices of mothers in UAE and its relation to the early life determinants of obesity and
      non-communicable diseases (NCDs). It will examine the components of human milk which might
      offer a protective benefit against obesity and its health consequences in infancy. It will
      also evaluate the feeding practices of the mothers and her nutritional status and relates it
      to their infants' growth and development.

      It is expected that this research study will fill an important knowledge gap in the
      understanding of the feeding practices of mothers and its relation to early-life determinants
      of obesity and other chronic diseases in the UAE.
