      In this study, cerebral oxygenation and tobacco-related attentional bias in smokers and
      non-smokers will be measured with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

      In this study, the oxygen extraction fraction (OEF), the cerebral blood flow (CBF) and the
      cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) are to be measured in smokers and non-smokers using
      MRI. On the one hand, the influence of chronic smoking (i.e. smokers versus non-smokers) and
      on the other hand the effect of acute nicotine administration (in smokers) on these
      parameters will be examined. Furthermore, the influence of these parameters on fMRI results
      is to be investigated using the example of a stimulus-reaction task. It can be assumed that
      the OEF does not change through nicotine administration, but differs in smokers and
      non-smokers and is associated with the strength of tobacco addiction in smokers. CBF and
      CMRO2 are expected to be reduced in abstinent smokers, but can be normalized by nicotine
      administration. In this study, 20 smokers and 10 never-smokers will be investigated.
      Never-smokers will be examined once with MRI and questionnaires, whereas smokers will be
      examined twice: before and after a smoking break.
