  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate if modern technology such as smartphone applications can
      be used to facilitate lifestyle changes and thereby improve health-related quality of life in
      gainfully employed persons in the general population in Stockholm, Sweden. The hypothesis is
      that at follow-up, the intervention group that use the new application will have improved
      health-related quality of life and other lifestyle habits including diet, physical activity
      and sleep, as well as biomarkers, compared to a control group.
