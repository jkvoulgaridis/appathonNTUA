    <measure>Percentage of Participants with Grade 3 or Higher Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>TEAEs are defined as undesirable events not present prior to medical treatment, or an already present event that worsens either in intensity or frequency following the treatment. Adverse events (AEs) will be graded using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0. Here grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self-care activity of daily living (ADL), grade 4: Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated and grade 5: Death related to AE.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Dose Reductions</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 24</time_frame>

  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to First Dose Reduction</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Time to first dose reduction was calculated as the time period from the first dose to the first dose reduction.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>ORR at 24 weeks is defined as the proportion of participants with best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). CR is defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (less than [&lt;] 10 millimeter [mm] short axis). PR is defined as at least a 30 percent (%) decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. ORR = CR + PR.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From date of first dose of study drug until documentation of disease progression or death from any cause (whichever occurs first) or up to approximately Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time from enrollment of participant in to study to the first sign of Progressive Disease (PD) or death due to any cause if the participant dies without experiencing PD. Disease progression per response evaluation criteria in solid tumor (RECIST) v1.1 was defined as at least a 20% relative increase and 5 mm absolute increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions (taking as reference the smallest sum on study) recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants with Greater Than or Equal to (&gt;=) Grade 2 Other TEAEs</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>TEAEs are defined as undesirable events not present prior to medical treatment, or an already present event that worsens either in intensity or frequency following the treatment. The severity of all AEs will be graded according to CTCAE where grade 2: Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate instrumental ADL, grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self-care ADL, grade 4: Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated and grade 5: Death related to AE.</description>
