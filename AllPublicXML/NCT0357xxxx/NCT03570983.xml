  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The work proposed herein aims to provide the first prospective, randomized comparative
      efficacy data between Melphalan and BEAM treatment regimen in the Multiple Myeloma (MM)
      patient population. The risk of such a study is deemed reasonable and ethical since: a)
      previous works have closely examined the safety and toxicity of the BEAM regimen and the
      doses to be delivered in this protocol are well below the toxicity levels; b) phase III
      trials of BEAM have provided reasonable data regarding the efficacy in lymphomas c) Early,
      retrospective data suggests that BEAM may be efficacious in MM however due to the lack of
      prospective controlled randomized clinical trial, there is adequate equipoise regarding its
      efficacy and moreover its comparative efficacy in relation to Melphalan and; D) there are
      known limitations in the standard-of-care for MM, Melphalan, namely, relatively low rates of
      complete response at the time of Autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT) and poor
      progression free survival.
