  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The researchers are conducting this study to see if pharmacogenomic testing before surgery
      helps the doctor to choose which medications will work best for the patient.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants, undergoing total knee replacements, will be randomized into two groups. Both
      groups will receive pharmacogenomics (PGx) testing preoperatively. The PGx guided group will
      have their results reviewed by the clinicians during their treatment and the results may
      guide clinical decisions. The control group results will be sealed until completion of
      treatment and clinicians will not have access to this information. These participants will
      undergo standard treatment dosing and medication selection.

    <intervention_model_description>All subjects meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria will undergo pharmacogenomic testing. A pharmacist will review the pharmacogemic report and make recommendations for patients in the interventional group.

    <measure>Change in Overall Benefit of Analgesic Score (OBAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 48 hours following PACU discharge</time_frame>
    <description>The overall benefit of analgesia score (OBAS) is a daily multi-dimensional survey that assesses analgesia benefits, opioid-related adverse events (ORAEs), and patient satisfaction. It is a seven-item scale, with items ranging from( 0 = not at all) to(4 = very much). To calculate the Total OBAS score, compute the sum of scores in items 1-6 and add '4âˆ’score in item 7'. Low score indicates high benefit.</description>
