      To discuss necessity of cholecystectomy for patients with stones in their bile ducts and
      gallbladders in the absence of absolute operation indications of cholecystectomy after
      clearance of bile duct stones with ERCP.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cholecystectomy was recommended for patients with stones in their bile ducts and gallbladders
      in European and American countries after clearance of bile duct stones with ERCP, which
      reduced the incidence of biliary events. However, some researches showed that the incidence
      of biliary events was not reduced but increased.The purpose of this study is to discuss the
      necessity of cholecystectomy for patients with stones in their bile ducts and gallbladders in
      the absence of absolute operation indications of cholecystectomy after clearance of bile duct
      stones with ERCP.
