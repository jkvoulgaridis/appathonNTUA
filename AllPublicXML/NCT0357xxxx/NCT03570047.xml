  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An anticoagulation therapy is a critical treatment to prevent thromboembolism in non-valvular
      AF (NVAF) patients. Warfarin, a vitamin K antagonist, is the first oral anticoagulant
      approved for the treatment for prevention of thromboembolism and it had long been the only
      oral anticoagulant until the first non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs).
      However, its safety and effectiveness remains unknown in real-world clinical practice in
      Japan

      An anticoagulation therapy is a critical treatment to prevent thromboembolism in non-valvular
      AF (NVAF) patients. Warfarin, a vitamin K antagonist, is the first oral anticoagulant
      approved for the treatment for prevention of thromboembolism and it had long been the only
      oral anticoagulant until the first non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs).
      However, its safety and effectiveness remains unknown in real-world clinical practice in
      Japan. This study will evaluate the risk of stroke/SE as well as the risk of bleeding in the
      real world settings in Japan in patients with NVAF who initiated any of OACs (apixaban,
      dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban, or warfarin)

    <description>Event rate per 100 participant-years for first occurrence of stroke and systemic embolism events after index date was reported. Stroke events included the composite of any ischemic and any hemorrhagic stroke events (non-traumatic extradural hemorrhage). Systemic embolism events were defined as any of the following: abdominal aortic embolism, aortic embolism, acute arterial occlusive disease of arteries of upper extremities, femoral arterial occlusion and acute arterial occlusive disease of arteries of lower extremities, iliac artery embolism, hepatic artery embolism, thromboembolism, embolic infarction, aortic embolism, subclavian artery stenosis. Index date was defined as date of first prescription of any OACs (warfarin, apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban or edoxaban) during the observation period of approximately 7 years (2011-2017). Pseudo datasets refers to number derived using IPTW method and are different from the actual participants included in the reporting arm.</description>

    <description>Event rate per 100 participant-years for first occurrence of major bleeding event after index date was reported. Major bleeding after index date was identified using hospital claims which had a bleeding diagnosis code as the first listed in International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD)-10 diagnosis code. An event occurrence of major bleeding was defined as that appears as &quot;21: Disease name behind hospitalization&quot; in database.

Index date was defined as the date of the first prescription of any OACs (warfarin, apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban or edoxaban) during observation period.</description>

        <title>Event Rate Per 100 Participant-Years For First Occurrence of Stroke and Systemic Embolism Events After Index Date</title>
        <description>Event rate per 100 participant-years for first occurrence of stroke and systemic embolism events after index date was reported. Stroke events included the composite of any ischemic and any hemorrhagic stroke events (non-traumatic extradural hemorrhage). Systemic embolism events were defined as any of the following: abdominal aortic embolism, aortic embolism, acute arterial occlusive disease of arteries of upper extremities, femoral arterial occlusion and acute arterial occlusive disease of arteries of lower extremities, iliac artery embolism, hepatic artery embolism, thromboembolism, embolic infarction, aortic embolism, subclavian artery stenosis. Index date was defined as date of first prescription of any OACs (warfarin, apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban or edoxaban) during the observation period of approximately 7 years (2011-2017). Pseudo datasets refers to number derived using IPTW method and are different from the actual participants included in the reporting arm.</description>

        <title>Event Rate Per 100 Participant-Years For First Occurrence of Major Bleeding Events After Index Date</title>
        <description>Event rate per 100 participant-years for first occurrence of major bleeding event after index date was reported. Major bleeding after index date was identified using hospital claims which had a bleeding diagnosis code as the first listed in International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD)-10 diagnosis code. An event occurrence of major bleeding was defined as that appears as &quot;21: Disease name behind hospitalization&quot; in database. Index date was defined as the date of the first prescription of any of OACs (warfarin, apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban or edoxaban) during the observation period of approximately 7 years (2011-2017). Pseudo datasets refers to number derived using IPTW method and are different from the actual participants included in the reporting arm.</description>

        <description>Event rate per 100 participant-years for first occurrence of ischemic stroke after index date was reported. Index date was defined as the date of the first prescription of any of OACs (warfarin, apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban or edoxaban) during the observation period of approximately 7 years (2011-2017). Pseudo datasets refers to number derived using IPTW method and are different from the actual participants included in the reporting arm.</description>

        <title>Event Rate Per 100 Participant-Years For First Occurrence of Major Gastrointestinal Bleeding Events After Index Date</title>
        <description>Event rate per 100 participant-years for first occurrence of major gastrointestinal bleeding events after index date was reported. Major gastrointestinal bleeding after index date was identified using hospital claims which had a gastrointestinal bleeding diagnosis code as the first listed ICD-10 diagnosis code. An event occurrence of major bleeding was defined as that appears as &quot;21: Disease name behind hospitalization&quot; in database. Index date was defined as the date of the first prescription of any of OACs (warfarin, apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban or edoxaban) during the observation period of approximately 7 years (2011-2017). Pseudo datasets refers to number derived using IPTW method and are different from the actual participants included in the reporting arm.</description>

        <title>Event Rate Per 100 Participant-Years For First Occurrence of Any Intracranial Hemorrhage Event After Index Date</title>
        <description>Event rate per 100 participant-years for first occurrence of any intracranial hemorrhage event after index date was reported. Any intracranial hemorrhage was defined by ICD-10 diagnosis codes and participants were considered to have &quot;any intracranial hemorrhagic event&quot; if pre-defined any intracranial hemorrhagic-associated ICD-10 diagnosis codes appeared in the records. Index date was defined as the date of the first prescription of any of OACs (warfarin, apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban or edoxaban) during the observation period of approximately 7 years (2011-2017). Pseudo datasets refers to number derived using IPTW method and are different from the actual participants included in the reporting arm.</description>
