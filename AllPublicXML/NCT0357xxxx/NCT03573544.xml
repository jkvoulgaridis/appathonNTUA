    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of OBI-888 as
      monotherapy. And to characterize the safety and preliminary clinical activity profile of the
      MTD dose of OBI-888 administered as monotherapy in patients with locally advanced or
      metastatic solid tumors.

             disease that requires systemic steroids or other immunosuppressive medications. Local
             steroid injections, intermittent use of topical, inhaled, ophthalmologic,
             intra-articular, topical, or intranasal corticosteroids, or systemic corticosteroids

             excluded from the study.

          4. Presence of primary immunodeficiency or receiving systemic steroids of &gt;10 mg/day of
             prednisone or equivalent or other immunosuppressive agents within 14 days prior to the

             Events [NCI CTCAE] version 4.03), except for alopecia and laboratory values listed in
             the inclusion criteria.

          8. Receipt of any prior therapy targeting Globo H.

          9. Known hypersensitivity to OBI 888 or its excipients.

             metastases.

         11. Any medical co morbidity or psychiatric illness that is life threatening or, in the
             opinion of the Investigator, renders the patient unsuitable for participation in a
             clinical trial due to possible noncompliance, would place the patient at an
             unacceptable risk and/or potential to affect interpretation of results of the study.
