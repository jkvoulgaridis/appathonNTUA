  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SJCAR19 is a research study seeking to evaluate the use of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T
      cell therapy, a type of cellular therapy, for the treatment of pediatric, adolescent and
      young adult patients with relapsed or refractory CD19+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).
      CAR therapy combines two of the body's basic disease fighters: antibodies and T Cells. For
      this type of therapy, peripheral (circulating) immune cells are collected and then undergo a
      manufacturing process to engineer them to more effectively kill cancer cells. The SJCAR19
      product will be manufactured at the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital's Good
      Manufacturing Practice (GMP) facility.

      The main purpose of this study is to determine:

        1. The largest dose of SJCAR19 that is safe to give,

        2. How long SJCAR19 cells last in the body,

        3. The side effects of SJCAR19, and

        4. Whether or not treatment with SJCAR19 is effective in treating people with refractory or
           relapsed ALL.

      SJCAR19 is a Phase I/II clinical trial evaluating the use of SJCAR19 (CD19- specific CAR
      engineered autologous T-cells) in pediatric, adolescent and young adult patients with
      relapsed/ refractory CD19+ ALL. Treatment will include a single treatment course, with most
      patients receiving a lymphodepleting chemotherapy preparative regimen of fludarabine/
      cyclophosphamide, followed by a single infusion of SJCAR19.

      This protocol contains a 3-part consent process: 1) to proceed with autologous apheresis, 2)
      to proceed with manufacturing of the SJCAR19 product, and 3) to receive treatment with the
      SJCAR19 product (initially as Phase I, then proceeding to Phase II). The Phase I portion will
      evaluate the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SJCAR19.

      The Phase II portion will evaluate the efficacy, and provide further safety evaluation, of
      SJCAR19 in an expansion cohort at the MTD determined in the Phase I portion of the study.
      Additionally, for both the Phase I/II portions of the study there are correlative studies
      evaluating the biology of this treatment as well assessments into patient/caregiver
      experiences with undergoing this treatment.

    <description>Patients in both the Phase I and Phase II portion of the study will receive lymphodepleting chemotherapy (unless determined by PI that lymphodepletion is not necessary), followed by a single infusion of the patient-derived SJCAR19 cellular product. The most commonly used lymphodepleting chemotherapy regimen will consist of the agents: Fludarabine and Cyclophosphamide. They will also receive Mesna. Dosing of SJCAR19 on the Phase I study will follow a dose escalation schema, with dose changes based on dose-limiting toxicities. In the Phase II study, SJCAR19 dosing with follow the maximum tolerated dose, as determined in the Phase I portion.
Cells for infusion are prepared using the CliniMACS System.</description>

    <description>The mechanism of action of the CliniMACS Cell Selection System is based on magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS). The CliniMACS device is a powerful tool for the isolation of many cell types from heterogeneous cell mixtures, (e.g. apheresis products). These can then be separated in a magnetic field using an immunomagnetic label specific for the cell type of interest.</description>
