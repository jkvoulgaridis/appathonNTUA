  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the USE-MI system hardware and software to see if it can
      accurately measure when subjects take their HIV-related medications and help them remember to
      take these medications. With the use of a smartwatch and smartphone &quot;app&quot;, investigators hope
      to be able to monitor medication adherence in real-time and send subjects electronic
      reminders when they may have forgotten to take their medication.

    <textblock>
      Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) treatment is most likely to be successful when patients
      are committed to taking their medications as prescribed (medication adherence). For maximum
      benefit, researchers found that patients receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) to treat HIV
      infection and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to prevent HIV infection have need consistent,
      high levels of adherence for maximum benefit. However, some patients struggle to take their
      HIV-related medications regularly and that can lead to losing on the benefits the medication
      can provide - either suppressing the HIV infection so people do not get sick from it or
      transmit it, or failing to prevent infection when someone is exposed.

      Objectives: Conduct an evaluation of USE-MI to assess accuracy, robustness, acceptability of
      the system.

      All subjects will continue to take their ART or PrEP medication as prescribed by their
      regular doctor. The USE-MI system is being developed as a behavioral intervention to enhance
      medication adherence. In the pilot phase, the investigators plan to enroll 10 subjects to use
      the USE-MI system for 1 month to get initial feedback about the system. In the second phase,
      up to 50 subjects will begin using the USE-MI for up to 6 months to assess accuracy,
      robustness and acceptability of the system.

    <description>Evaluate the use of the USE-MI system after 6 months of follow-up. At each monthly visit, subjects will complete a questionnaire about their medication-taking habits, plus the study staff will perform a manual count of their pills. Subjects will be asked for feedback about improving the system, whether they found it helpful, and whether they would be willing to continue to use such a system</description>

    <description>Pilot Phase: 10 subjects will continue with their ART or PrEP medication and begin using the USE-MI system. Subjects will wear a smartwatch every day to monitor their pill taking activity for 1 month and receive weekly phone calls to obtain feedback on the system. During the first call, subjects will respond to 2 questionnaires about how they are taking their daily ART or PrEP pill(s).
Second Phase: Up to 50 subjects will continue with their ART or PrEP medication and begin using the USE-MI system. Subjects will wear a smartwatch every day to monitor their pill taking activity for up to 6 months. During their first month, subjects will receive weekly phone calls to obtain feedback on the system. During the first call, subjects will respond to 2 questionnaires about how they are taking their daily ART or PrEP pill(s). Subjects will come to the research office every month to complete a brief questionnaire about how they are taking their daily ART or PrEP pill(s).</description>
