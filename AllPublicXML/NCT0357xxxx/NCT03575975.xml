  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who have had a total ankle joint replacement surgery typically have limited movement
      in their ankles possibly due to the fact that commonly used ankle joint prosthetic devices
      only allow limited axes of motion.

      This study will evaluate the ability of a Scandinavian Total Ankle Replacement (STAR)
      mobile-bearing prosthesis and INBONE 2 fixed-bearing prosthesis to restore triplanar motion
      in the tibiotalar (ankle) joint following a surgical arthroplasty (total joint replacement)
      procedure.

      3D X-ray video motion analysis will be utilized to quantify range of motion measurements in
      two groups of ankle prosthesis users and a group of matched control participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      15 study participants will include those using a Stryker STAR prosthesis and a Wright Medical
      INBONE 2 prosthesis and a group of matched control subjects.

      CT scans of lower limb anatomy (ankle-foot complex) will be obtained for all subjects to be
      converted into 3D bone surface models for use in the joint motion tracking software.

      Each participant will participate in one day of data collection with an X-Ray Motion Analysis
      (XMA) system. High-speed biplanar XMA system will capture video images of the skeletal
      motions within the foot-ankle complex during normal movement. Subjects will walk and perform
      controlled movements in the capture volume within the XMA system.

      Following data collection, the 3D bone surface models will be mapped to the sagittal (side
      view), coronal (front view), and axial (top view) plane skeletal motions demonstrated in the
      collected x-ray videos. Motion tracking data will then be used to accurately animate the 3D
      bone models to demonstrate the active range of ankle-foot joint motions during voluntary
      movement and gait.

      Resulting range of motion measurements in dorsiflexion/plantarflexion, internal/external
      rotation, and inversion/eversion will be used to determine the extent to which normal motion
      in the ankle-foot complex has been restored in ankle prosthesis users.

        Study participants meeting the eligibility criteria will be convenience-sampled from within
        the metro-Atlanta area. Eligible participants with either a STAR or INBONE 2 prosthesis
        will be identified from among clinical populations treated at the Emory University
        Hospital. Control group participants will be convenience-sampled from within the
        metro-Atlanta area.
