  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MicroPort Orthopedics (MPO) is conducting this post market clinical follow-up (PMCF) study to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of its total hip arthroplasty (THA) components marketed in
      the European Union (EU). These types of studies are required by regulatory authorities for
      all THA devices that do not have medium to long-term clinical evidence available at the time
      of gaining approval to market in Europe. This study has been designed in accordance with the
      medial device directives (MEDDEV) 2.12/2 rev 2.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Component Survivorship</measure>
    <time_frame>10 years post-operative</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint is to evaluate component survivorship of the PROCOTYL® C Acetabular Components out to 10 years follow-up. Percentage of hips survived with no revision or replacement at 10-year.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To determine the cumulative incidence of component revision at specified intervals out to 10 years follow-up;</measure>
    <time_frame>2-5 years, 5-7 years, and 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of hips that were revised or replaced at each of the intervals namely for Early (2-5 years), midterm (5-7 Year), and long-term (10-year) evaluation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To characterize functional scores, as assessed by Oxford Hip.</measure>
    <time_frame>2-5 years, 5-7 years, and 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>The study will be reporting the final Oxford Hip score, which is a summary over 12 items. Each of these items is 5-level Likert scale such as from 'not at all' to 'totally'.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To characterize functional scores, as assessed by EQ-5D-3L scores.</measure>
    <time_frame>2-5 years, 5-7 years, and 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-5D-3L data will be summarized over 5 domains, namely, mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each domain has 3 levels: no problems, some problems, and extreme problems.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        To be included in the study, subjects must meet all of the following criteria:

          -  Has previously undergone primary Total Hip Arthroscopy for any of the following:

          -  Non-inflammatory degenerative joint disease such as osteoarthritis, avascular
             necrosis, ankylosis, protrusio acetabuli, or painful hip dysplasia;

          -  Inflammatory degenerative joint disease such as rheumatoid arthritis;

          -  Correction of functional deformity

          -  Subject was implanted with the specified combination of components, namely, PROFEMUR
             Xm Femoral Stems or PROFEMUR Gladiator Plasma, Femoral Stems and PROCOTYL C Acetabular
             Components

          -  Subject is willing and able to complete required study visits or assessments

        Previously implanted bilateral subjects can have both THAs (Total Hip Arthroscopy) enrolled
        in the study provided:

          1. the specified combination of components were implanted in both,

          2. all other aspects of the Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria are satisfied,

          3. enrollment does not exceed the subject count specified in the Clinical Trial
             Agreement, and

          4. the subject agrees to a second Informed Consent document specific to the second THA.
             Prospective enrolment of a previously unimplanted hip is not permitted in this study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects will be excluded if they meet any of the following criteria:

          -  Subject was skeletally immature (less than 21 years of age) at time of implantation

          -  Subject has a non-MicroPort or Wright Medical Technology component implanted (femoral
             heads, acetabular shells, acetabular liners) in the enrolled Total Hip Arthroscopy

          -  Subject has a PROFEMUR Neck Varus/Valgus CoCr (cobalt-chromium) 8 Degree, Part number
             PHAC 1254 implanted in the enrolled Total Hip Arthroscopy

          -  Subject is currently enrolled in another clinical investigation which could affect the
             endpoints of this protocol

          -  Subject is unwilling or unable to sign the Informed Consent document

          -  Subject has documented substance abuse issues

          -  Subject has an emotional or neurological condition that would pre-empt their ability
             or willingness to participate in the study
