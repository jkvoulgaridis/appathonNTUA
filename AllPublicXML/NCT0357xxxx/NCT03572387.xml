  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open-label, randomized, cross-over, pilot study of reprogramming
      therapy in patients with recurrent PCa based on rising PSA only. The primary objectives are
      to compare the disease progression-free rate at the end of 12 weeks between 5-AZA+ATRA and no
      therapy and to assess safety of the 5-AZA and ATRA combination. All study enrollees will
      receive Lupron. After one month, they will be assigned in a 1:1 randomization to either the
      `5-AZA+ATRA' group or the `no therapy' group. Patients in the `5-AZA + ATRA' group will
      receive treatment on a 28-day cycle, in the absence of prohibitive toxicities, for 3 cycles.
      Patients will initially be observed for 3 cycles under either no therapy or combination
      therapy, before crossing over to receive the opposite treatment for another 3 cycles in the
      absence of prohibitive toxicities. After the treatment period, all patients will be followed
      for a total of 24 months from the start of the study or until the events leading to
      discontinuation are observed.

          -  Males ≥ 18 years.

          -  ECOG performance status of ≤ 2

             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with

          -  Significant active cardiac disease within the previous 6 months
