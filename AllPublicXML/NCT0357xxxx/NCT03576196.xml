    <textblock>
      Study Design: A double-blind randomized controlled study.

      Background: Patients operated on for carpal tunnel release surgery may persist with pain
      after surgery, which could be modulated by psychosocial factors such as depression,
      catastrophic thinking and kinesiophobia.

      Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy of a preoperative session in pain neuroscience education
      combined with postoperative therapeutic exercise in the perception of pain, functionality and
      psychosocial variables in patients following carpal tunnel release.

      Methods: Thirty participants were randomly assigned to the pain neuroscience education group
      combined with postoperative therapeutic exercise (n = 15) or to the control group with
      preoperative usual care combined with postoperative therapeutic exercise (n = 15).
      Evaluations included the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Disability of Arm, Shoulder, and Hand
      Questionnaire (QuickDASH), pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS), Tampa scale of kinesiophobia
      (TSK-11) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) . A basal, fourth and twelfth week
      measurement was made.

    <measure>Change of Disability in upper-limb</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline Disability at fourth and twelfth week</time_frame>
    <description>The Perception of patients of their disability in upper-limb evaluated by The Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) Spanish version Outcome Measure is a 30-item scored 1-5. The assigned values for all completed responses are simply summed and averaged. Scoring: The assigned values for all completed responses are simply summed and averaged and higher values represent a worse Disability in upper-limb.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of Pain Interference: Kinesiophobia</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline Kinesiophobia at fourth and twelfth week</time_frame>
    <description>Kinesiophobia will be evaluated by Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK-11SV) (Spanish adaptation. Gómez-Pérez, López-Martínez y Ruiz-Párraga, 2011). Scoring: Items are summed, with a total score from 11-44 and higher values represent a worse outcome (more pain interference in behavior).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of Emotional status: Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD).</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline emotional status at fourth and twelfth week</time_frame>
    <description>Patient's emotional state will be evaluated by Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD), which assess the level of anxiety and depression. Subscales and score range are Anxiety (0-21) and Depression (0-21). Scoring: items of each subscale are summed, indicating: 0-7 normality, 8-10 probably case, 11-21 anxiety or depression clinical case. Higher values represent a worse outcome.</description>

    <measure>Change of Pain evaluation:</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline Pain at fourth and twelfth week</time_frame>
    <description>Pain will be measured by the Visual Analog Scale for pain (VAS) from 0 to 10, where higher values represent a worse outcome (0 is no pain and 10 the maximum pain experienced).</description>

    <description>Single session of pain neuroscience education a week prior to surgery, of an individual character, lasting approximately 30 minutes, performed by a physiotherapist trained. The main contents addressed in the educational session were: neurophysiological aspects of pain, biopsychosocial aspects of pain, concept of peripheral and central sensitization, using audio-visual support, examples and metaphors for a better understanding by the patient, as reported in previous studies.
This treatment was combined with a hand therapy session seven days after the surgery, verbal and written instruction was given to the patients to perform exercises at home of active sliding of the digital flexor tendon, active opposition of the thumb and active range of flexion and extension of the wrist.</description>
