    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of egg intake on markers of HDL
      function and immune inflammation in healthy adults.

      28 healthy men and women (age 18-35 years old) will be recruited to participate in a 16-week
      randomized crossover study. Upon enrollment, all subjects will enter a 4-week run-in egg-free
      period where they will refrain from consuming any egg-based foods (Period 1). Subjects will
      then enter the first intervention period, where they be randomly assigned to consume either 3
      whole eggs/day or the equivalent amount of egg white-based egg substitute/day for 4 weeks
      (Period 2). Afterwards, subjects will enter a 4-week washout period where egg-based foods are
      restricted (Period 3), followed by a second intervention period, where they be assigned to
      the alternative whole egg- or egg white-based treatment for 4 weeks (Period 4). Subjects will
      come to the Department of Biology at Fairfield University every two weeks to check-in, and to
      pick up their egg products during the intervention periods. Subjects will be asked to
      maintain their normal diet and physical activity practices throughout all periods of the
      study. Subjects will complete 5-day dietary records and physical activity logs at the end of
      each study period.

    <measure>Fasted HDL lipid composition</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>HDL subfractions (d = 1.063-1.21) will be isolated from plasma by ultracentrifugation collected at the end of the run-in period and two intervention arms. HDL fractions will be analyzed for glycerphospholipid (phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, lysophosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol) and sphingolipid (sphingomyelin) composition by mass spectrometry. Each lipid class will be presented as a percent (%) of total HDL lipids.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cholesterol-accepting capacity of serum</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The cholesterol efflux from macrophages to subject serum will be measured at the end of the egg-free run-in period and both intervention periods using a fluorescent cholesterol efflux kit. Results will be expressed as % cholesterol efflux, calculated as (fluorescence intensity of media/[fluorescent intensity of cell lysates + media]) x 100.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Inflammatory potential of peripheral blood mononuclear cells</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) will be isolated at the end of the egg-free run-in period and both intervention periods. PBMCs will be cultured ex vivo and stimulated with lipopolysaccharide. Media will be collected to measure tumor necrosis factor alpha concentrations (pg/mL) in cell media.</description>
