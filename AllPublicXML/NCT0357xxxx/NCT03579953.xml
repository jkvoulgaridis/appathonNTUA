  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prior and recent evidence suggests a role of medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) in cigarette
      smoking. Episodic Future Thinking (EFT) has also been shown to be associated with increased
      delayed discounting and reduced cigarette self administration. In the present study, we will
      examine whether a single administration of theta-burst transcranial magnetic stimulation
      (tbTMS) can increase Episodic Future Thinking and delayed discounting while reducing craving
      for nicotine.

      The purpose of this study is to develop theta burst transcranial magnetic stimulation (tbTMS)
      as a potential treatment for nicotine addiction. Theta burst TMS is a non-invasive technique
      that uses magnetic pulses to temporarily stimulate specific brain areas in awake people
      (without the need for surgery, anesthetic, or other invasive procedures). This study will
      test whether tbTMS over the forehead can produce a reduction in things that may prompt
      individuals to want to smoke cigarettes. TMS has been approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration as an investigational tool as well as a therapy for depression. However, TMS
      is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration as a treatment for nicotine cravings and
      other addictions.

      This study consists of one consent session and one TMS session. Participants will be asked to
      complete a series of questionnaires and computer assessments about nicotine both before and
      after a single tbTMS session.
