      This phase I trial studies the side effects of nivolumab and IRX-2 and how well they work in
      treating participants with stage III-IVA oral cavity cancer or human papillomavirus
      (HPV)-positive oropharyngeal cancer that can be removed by surgery. Monoclonal antibodies,
      such as nivolumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. IRX-2
      may &quot;turn on&quot; the immune system and stimulate an immune response against tumor cells. Giving
      nivolumab and IRX-2 followed by surgery may work better at treating oral cavity and
      oropharyngeal cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety profile of combination immunotherapy, nivolumab + IRX-2, for HPV+
      oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) and HPV- oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma
      (OCSCC).

      II. To assess the oncologic efficacy of neo-adjuvant immunotherapy using pathologic
      confirmation of response after surgical resection.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To correlate tumor microenvironment histopathology with pathologic findings, with
      progression free survival (PFS) and other outcome parameters in patients with resectable
      OPSCC and OCSCC after the above treatments.

      II. To evaluate swallowing function before and after surgery and risk-adjusted adjuvant
      therapy.

      III. To evaluate quality of life (QOL), swallowing perception and performance, voice
      outcomes, and head and neck symptoms.

      OUTLINE: Participants receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15,
      cyclophosphamide IV on day 1, and IRX-2 subcutaneously (SC) over 10 consecutive days between
      days 4-21 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning days
      25-30, participants undergo surgery.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3 months, every 3 months for
      2 years, then every 6 months for 2 years.

    <description>Non-hematologic toxicities will be evaluated via the ordinal Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) standard toxicity grading. Hematologic toxicity measures of thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and leukopenia will be assessed using continuous variables as the outcome measures (primarily nadir) as well as categorization via CTC standard toxicity grading. Overall toxicity incidence as well as toxicity profiles by dose level and patient will be explored and summarized.</description>

    <measure>Change in tumor size determined by central radiology review by radiologists blinded to the treatment regimen</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 4 years</time_frame>
    <description>Tumor changes will be determined by a comparison of the imaging studies (contrast-enhanced computed tomography [CECT] or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) obtained pre-treatment and just prior to surgery. Percent changes in tumor size will be determined by radiology at the site. If the change is not clear to the radiologist at the site, then the PI must be notified and two radiologists at Emory will be asked to independently review the scans and a decision will be made.</description>

          -  HPV-ASSOCIATED OROPHARYNX SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA COHORT: Symptomatic cardiopulmonary
             disease (including congestive heart failure and hypertension), coronary artery
             disease, serious arrhythmia or chronic lung disease; patients with these conditions
             who are stable with relatively minor symptoms and who are appropriate candidates for
             surgical treatment of their tumor need not be excluded

          -  HPV-ASSOCIATED OROPHARYNX SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA COHORT: Myocardial infarction within
             the last 3 months

          -  HPV-ASSOCIATED OROPHARYNX SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA COHORT: Evidence of distant
             metastases (M1 disease) or other concurrent primary malignancy

          -  HPV-ASSOCIATED OROPHARYNX SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA COHORT: Known infection with
             hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or HIV

          -  HPV-ASSOCIATED OROPHARYNX SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA COHORT: Signs or symptoms of
             systemic bacterial infection (use of antibiotics to treat superficial infection or
             contamination of tumor shall not, by itself, be considered evidence of infection)

          -  HPV-ASSOCIATED OROPHARYNX SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA COHORT: Stroke or other symptoms of
             cerebral vascular insufficiency within the last 3 months

          -  HPV-ASSOCIATED OROPHARYNX SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA COHORT: Allergy to ciprofloxacin (or
             other quinolones), acetylsalicylic acid

          -  HPV-ASSOCIATED OROPHARYNX SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA COHORT: Previous diagnosis of
             invasive cancer from which the individual is NOT disease-free AND that has required
             treatment within the past 5 years, except for superficial skin, cervical cancer
             in-situ, well-differentiated thyroid or early stage prostate or bladder cancer (i.e.,
             treatment with curative intent and long term disease-free expectations)

          -  HPV-ASSOCIATED OROPHARYNX SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA COHORT: Prior axillary dissection

          -  HPV-ASSOCIATED OROPHARYNX SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA COHORT: History of pneumonitis or
             interstitial lung disease
