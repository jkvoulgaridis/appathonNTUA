  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The accomplishment of a treatment with Intratissue Percutaneous Electrolysis of additional
      form to the accomplishment of eccentric exercises and stretching program in patients with
      chronic lateral epicondyle tendinopathy is more effective than the accomplishment of an
      additional treatment with dry needling or eccentric exercises program realized of isolated
      form.

    <textblock>
      Experimental study randomized with double blind, whose purpose is to compare three protocols
      in those who apply different protocols of physical therapy to themselves in three groups of
      intervention with patients with chronic lateral epicondyle tendinopathy.

      There take part in this study people of both sexes, with ages between 18 and 65 years, all of
      them present chronic lateral epicondyle tendinopathy.

    <time_frame>Pre-intervention; Post-intervention (1 week after); Follow up (26 and 52 weeks after)</time_frame>
    <description>The Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) Outcome Measure is a 30-item, self-report questionnaire designed to help describe the disability experienced by people with upper-limb disorders and also to monitor changes in symptoms and function over time. The DASH Outcome Measure contains one optional, four-item modules intended to measure symptoms and function in workers whose jobs require a high degree of physical performance.</description>

    <measure>Pain, as measured by Visual Analog Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-intervention; Intervention (4 weeks); Post-intervention (1 week after), Follow up (26 and 52 weeks after)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be explained that a score of 0 indicates the absence of pain whereas a score of 10 represents the maximum tolerable pain.</description>

    <measure>Pressure pain thresholds (PPTs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-intervention; Intervention (4 weeks); Post-intervention (1 week after), Follow up (26 and 52 weeks after)</time_frame>
    <description>Level of pressure tolerated by the patient just before feeling pain. The pressure is done with a digital algometer Type II(Somedic). PPTS will be assessed bilaterally in extensor carpi radialis brevis tendon and tibialis anterior muscle.</description>

    <measure>Pain free grip strength</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-intervention; Intervention (4 weeks); Post-intervention (1 week after), Follow up (26 and 52 weeks after)</time_frame>
    <description>Grip strength before feeling pain. The tool used is a hydraulic hand dynamometer (Baseline). Subjects will be asked to gradually increase the grip strength while the elbow is extended and pronated and arm alongside of the body. They will be asked to stop when pain is felt. We will take three measures with each elbow.</description>
