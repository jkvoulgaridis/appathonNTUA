  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-stroke individuals continue to suffer from significant motor impairments years after the
      stroke. Motor recovery is usually limited to the first 6 month after the stroke, in which the
      majority of improvements occur at the first three months. Error augmentation (EA) training
      using a robotic apparatus was suggested to enhance motor recovery by exploiting the
      adaptation mechanisms within the intact cerebellum in individuals who sustained cortical
      stroke.

      The aim of this study is to investigate whether error augmentation training for the upper
      extremity may enhance motor recovery in individuals that sustained cortical stroke.

      Fifty post-stroke individuals will be randomaly assigned into either EA training (study
      group- SG) or robotic training in null field environment (control group- CG). Both groups
      will carry out the same treatment protocol on the robotic device in addition to the standard
      rehabilitation protocol of the rehabilitation center. Treatment protocol will be consisted of
      about six training sessions on the robotic device, taken twice or three times a week for two
      to three weeks. Each training session will be composed of 20-30 minutes upper extremity
      training with or without EA force field.

      Motor performance will be evaluated before and after the treatment protocol by the Fugl-Meyer
      Assessment scale.
