  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, the treatment of cervical cancer in early stages is performed with a radical
      surgery called Radical Hysterectomy with Pelvic Lymphadenectomy. This surgery, when indicated
      correctly, in early stages of this disease, has a cure rate of approximately 90% at 5 years,
      compared to the same Pelvic Radiotherapy. However, it is known that most patients with early
      stage cervical cancer are young (average age 45) and treating these patients with
      radiotherapy would have a loss of hormonal function by damage to the ovaries and damage in
      sexual function by radiotherapy effects in the vagina. Furthermore, if the patient has a
      pelvic recurrence, the option of radiotherapy treatment could not be offered. Due to the
      factors listed above, nowadays, in young patients with good clinical conditions and tumors in
      early stages, radical surgery is a good option. In this radical surgery there is a need for
      removal of the parametrium, and different degrees of pelvic denervation may occur causing
      damage of urinary function.Currently, there is no consensus about the correct moment of
      catheter removal and evaluation of urinary function using the residual urine test. While in
      some services the urinary catheter is removed on day 1 postoperatively, in others it is
      removed on the 14th day postoperatively. For these reasons, this study aims to compare the
      early catheter removal (day 1 postoperatively) versus standard in the investigator's service
      (7 days postoperatively) withdrawal. If this study detect that the patients may remove the
      urinary catheter on day 1 postoperatively, much less cost, discomfort, pain and comorbidities
      associated with the use of indwelling catheter for prolonged periods occur, such as urinary
      tract infection, use of antibiotics and even hospitalization for this reason.
