    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well stereotactic body radiation therapy works in treating patients
      with kidney cancer that has spread to other places in the body. Stereotactic body radiation
      therapy uses special equipment to position a patient and deliver radiation to tumors with
      high precision. This method can kill tumor cells with fewer doses over a shorter period and
      cause less damage to normal tissue.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the feasibility of incorporating stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) as
      a component of definitive local treatment for oligometastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC).

      II. To estimate the 12-month progression free survival (PFS) rate after study enrollment
      utilizing a strategy of definitive local treatment to all sites of disease in oligometastatic
      RCC as measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 (RECIST 1.1).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the effect of SBRT on cellular replication, measured by ki-67 staining.

      II. To determine the systemic therapy free survival at 12 months. III. To estimate the
      overall survival at 12 months after study enrollment. IV. To estimate the freedom from new
      lesion development at 12 months. V. To determine the treatment related toxicities associated
      with SBRT as part of definitive local therapy for oligometastatic RCC.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo SBRT over 1 day to 3 weeks based on the judgment of the treating radiation
      oncologist.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 and 12 weeks, and then
      every 18 weeks for 1 year.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Oligometastatic RCC patients (less than or equal to 5 sites of metastases at the time
             of study entry).

          -  Pathologically confirmed diagnosis of RCC of any histology.

             treatable with SBRT and can be biopsied.

          -  Be willing and able to undergo biopsy of a lesion planned for SBRT both post treatment
             and pretreatment. In the event that a lesion amenable to SBRT was biopsied prior to
             enrollment, this material can be used in lieu of a planned biopsy if the tissue is
             available for review and ki-67 staining at MD Anderson.

          -  Be greater than or equal to 18 years of age on the day of signing informed consent.

               -  NOTE: Patients may be allowed on this trial without a biopsy if they are deemed
                  medically unfit for biopsy or if the biopsy poses undue risk in the opinion of
                  the treating physician(s).

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-2.

               -  NOTE: If subject is unable to walk due to paralysis, but is mobile in a
                  wheelchair, subject is considered to be ambulatory for the purpose of assessing
                  their performance status.

          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to 1,000 /mcL (within 28 days
             prior to study enrollment).

          -  Platelets greater than or equal to 50,000 / mcL (within 28 days prior to study
             enrollment).

          -  Hemoglobin greater than or equal to 9 g/dL or greater than or equal to 5.6 mmol/L
             (within 28 days prior to study enrollment).

          -  Calculated creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 30 mL/min creatinine
             clearance (CrCl) using the Cockcroft-Gault formula (within 28 days prior to study
             enrollment).

          -  Serum total bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 mg//dl (except for subjects with
             Gilbert syndrome, who may have total bilirubin less than 3.0 mg/dl) OR direct
             bilirubin less than or equal to ULN for subjects with total bilirubin levels greater
             than 1.5 mg/dl (within 28 days prior to study enrollment).

          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT]) and
             alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase [SGPT]) less than
             or equal to 3 X upper limit of normal ULN OR less than or equal to 5 X ULN for
             subjects with liver metastases (within 28 days prior to study enrollment).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Receipt of &gt; 1 line of systemic therapy directed towards the metastatic disease. NOTE:
             Systemic therapy as a component of prior definitive therapy directed towards
             non-metastatic disease will be allowed. For example, patients receiving adjuvant IL-2
             after nephrectomy for an initial M0 diagnosis and who subsequently developed
             metastatic relapse will be allowed on study. In this instance, there will be no
             mandatory wash-out period required for enrollment. At trial entry the patient must
             have received their last dose of systemic therapy e.g. last intravenous (IV)
             administration or oral (PO tablet/pill) administration 4 weeks prior to initiation of
             the first dose of radiation.

          -  Has a diagnosis of active scleroderma, lupus, or other rheumatologic disease which in
             the opinion of the treating radiation oncologist precludes safe radiation therapy.

          -  Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial as determined by the treating physician
             and/or member of the study team.

          -  Has a metastatic effusion (e.g. pleural effusion or ascites). Note that patients with
             an effusion that is too small to sample will be eligible for the trial.

          -  Presence of diffuse metastatic processes including leptomeningeal disease, diffuse
             bone marrow involvement, and peritoneal carcinomatouses, which by the discretion of
             the treating physician cannot be treated definitively.

          -  Is pregnant or expecting to conceive or within the projected duration of the trial at
             the screening visit.

               -  NOTE 1: Female subject of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or
                  serum pregnancy within 28 days prior to study registration up to the first
                  fraction of radiation.

               -  NOTE 2: If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum
                  pregnancy test will be required.
