    <textblock>
      Current knowledge: To the best of our knowledge, no studies have reported the correlation
      between pulmonary function and the vascular endothelial function in diabetic patients during
      the preclinical period. Indeed, diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy are the leading causes
      of end-stage renal failure and acquired blindness, respectively. However, when investigators
      treat patients with type 2 diabetes, investigators seldom consider the pulmonary vascular
      injury induced by glycemia. Experimental studies have shown that pulmonary function and
      Vascular endothelial function change during the preclinical stages of diabetic retinopathy.
      Researchers have already established that compared to healthy subjects, patients with type 2
      diabetes have a reduced alveolar gas exchange capacity. The NO and ET-1 can be used to assess
      the Vascular endothelial function.

      What this paper contributes to our knowledge: Regulating glycemia can improve Vascular
      endothelial function . This study suggests that detecting the NO and ET-1 would allow for the
      prediction of changes in pulmonary function during the preclinical stages of diabetic
      retinopathy and the degree of retinopathy in the future.
