  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This early phase I trial studies how well levorphanol works as a second line opioid in
      reducing pain in patients with cancer that may have spread to other places in the body.
      Levorphanol may work better in controlling cancer pain. The primary end point is either at
      day 10 +/- 1 or any day after 2 days of rotation to levorphanol if the patient reaches
      his/her baseline personalized pain goal (PPG) in situations where opioid rotation is
      performed due to uncontrolled pain and &lt;/= 4 breakthrough opioid doses are used.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the proportion of successful opioid rotation (OR) from morphine equivalent
      daily dose (MEDD) to levorphanol at the primary end point. to levorphanol at the primary end
      point. The primary end point is either at day 10 +/- 1 or any day after 2 days of rotation to
      levorphanol if the patient reaches his/her baseline personalized pain goal (PPG) in
      situations where opioid rotation is performed due to uncontrolled pain and less than or equal
      to 4 breakthrough opioid doses are used.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the median opioid rotation ratio (ORR) in patients undergoing successful
      opioid rotations from morphine equivalent daily dose (MEDD) to levorphanol in the Supportive
      Care Center (SCC) or Pain Clinic.

      II. To determine the effect of levorphanol on cancer pain (as measured by change in Edmonton
      Symptom Assessment System's [ESAS] pain item from baseline) in cancer outpatients undergoing
      opioid rotation to levorphanol at the primary end point of treatment.

      III. To determine the association between the opioid rotation ratio from MEDD to levorphanol
      and baseline MEDD prior to opioid rotation.

      IV. Measure levorphanol related side effects using the opioid side effect scale at day 10 +/-
      1 of starting levorphanol.

      V. Determine what percentage of patients rotated to levorphanol achieve their personalized
      pain goal.

      VI. Determine the predictors of successful opioid rotation from other opioids to levorphanol.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive levorphanol orally (PO) every 8 or 12 hours for 30 days. Patients may
      receive opioid regimen including hydrocodone, morphine sulfate, hydromorphone hydrochloride,
      oxycodone, and oxymorphone hydrochloride for breakthrough pain.

    <description>Bayesian methodology developed by Peter Thall will be used to monitor the study. This method decides whether levorphanol is promising relative to the standard medicine. Will estimate the proportion of successful opioid rotation along with a 95% confidence interval. Association between successful opioid rotation and demographic/clinical characteristics will be examined by Chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test when appropriate. Logistic regression model will be employed to assess the effect of demographic/clinical characteristics on the presence of successful opioid rotation.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Opioid rotation ratio (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Will be calculated by levorphanol mg (day 10 +/- 1) over MEDD (day 0). ORR will be summarized using standard descriptive statistics such as mean, standard deviation, median and range.

    <measure>Change of Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) pain score</measure>

    <description>Pain score change will be summarized using standard descriptive statistics such as mean, standard deviation, median and range. Wilcoxon rank-sum test or Kruskal-Wallis test will be applied to examine the difference on pain score change between/among patients' characteristics groups. Since ESAS pain score will be measured daily from day 0 to day 10 +/- 1 and on day 30 +/- 3, mixed model will be applied to examine the differential changes over time for ESAS pain score, adjusting for other covariates of interest. ORR and baseline MEDD will be presented by scatter plots. Correlation will be assessed between levorphanol dose on day 10 +/- 1, ORR and baseline MEDD suing Pearson or Spearman correlation coefficient when appropriate. Linear regression models will be applied to estimate the linear association between levorphanoal dose on day 10 +/- 1, ORR and baseline MEDD.</description>

    <measure>Personalized pain goal (PPG)</measure>
