    <textblock>
      The purpose of the Shanghai Diabetic Eye Study (SDES) was to guide and regulate eye health
      screening of two hundred thousand people with diabetes in the communities in 16 districts in
      Shanghai, build up the ranks with the general practitioner as the backbone combined, and
      provide comprehensive, continuous, and dynamic information service to diabetic eye disease
      health management. We expect to form a &quot;screening, finding, referral, follow-up and health
      management&quot; diabetic eye disease working mode, integrate medical care and precaution closely,
      promote the classified management and referral, reduce the prevalence rate of diabetic eye
      disease, blindness and visual impairment of DR, and improve diabetics consciousness of eye
      health maintenance. At the same time, we will also improve the device configuration of eye
      health screening and relevant personnel training mechanism in the community health service
      centers, thus upgrading the level of eye disease prevention and treatment in Shanghai.

      Community-based cross-sectional samples of the archives management of adults with diabetes
      aged 35 years and above in 241 community health service centers (CHSC) in 16 districts in
      Shanghai, were obtained through proportional sampling (32%). Field screening, remote
      diagnosis, comprehensive assessment, referral, and eye health management of diabetics were
      the main study processes. Field screening mainly included visual acuity assessment,
      autorefraction examination, and non-mydriatic fundus photography. The designated medical
      institutions (DMI) of each district are responsible for the remote diagnosis and
      comprehensive assessment of diabetic eye diseases, especially diabetic retinopathy (DR),
      based on comprehensive evaluation of eye and general condition through the remote reading
      system (RRS) and Shanghai eye health information service system (SEHISS). The staff of CHSC
      urged the referral objects promptly for further diagnosis and treatment in DMI. According to
      the diagnosis after clinically confirmed, all the study participants will be recommended
      appropriate eye health management
