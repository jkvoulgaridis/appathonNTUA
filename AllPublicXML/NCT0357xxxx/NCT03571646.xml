  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to document how often and how severe are the breathing
      difficulties that patients suffer, while recovering on a general ward following a serious
      operation

      This is a prospective, 2-center, 2-phase pilot study of post-surgical adult patients on the
      hospital ward at high risk of developing respiratory and cardiovascular events. Phase I, 70
      patients will be 1:1 randomly allocated to Capnostream 20p monitoring system or to PM1000N-RR
      pulse oximeter monitoring system and the alarms of both devices will be silenced and the
      screen information blinded, to establish a baseline for the incidence of respiratory events.
      Phase II, 140 patients will be 1:1 randomly allocated to Capnostream 20p or to PM1000N-RR
      monitoring but the screen information will be visible at the bedside and through the Vital
      Sync™ remote patient monitoring system.

    <intervention_model_description>The occurrence of at least one of the following RC markers will be considered as primary endpoint for patients monitored by Capnostream 20p during both study Phases: (1) SpO2 ≤ 90% for ≥ 3 minutes.(2) RR ≤ 8 or ≥ 22 bpm for ≥ 3 minutes. (3) etCO2 ≤ 15 or ≥ 60 mmHg for ≥ 3 minutes. (4) Apnea episode lasting &gt; 30 seconds.

    <masking_description>During the study Phase I, the alarms of both devices will be silenced and the screen information blinded, as is the current clinical practice. During the study Phase II, the screen information will be available and the nursing staff will be instructed to respond to both devices' alarms based on a pre-defined hospital protocol.</masking_description>
