  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hemay005 is a novel phosphodiesterase type 4(PDE4) inhibitor being developed for the
      treatment of psoriasis. A total of approximately 24 subjects will be randomized into 3
      cohorts(15mg, 30mg, 60mg), approximately 8 healthy subjects will be enrolled (6 active and 2
      placebo) at each dose cohort. This study includes an 28-day Screening Period, a 1-day single
      dose and 7-days multiple doses Treatment Period, and an End of Study Visit occurring
      approximately 11days (±3 days) after study drug administration.
