  <brief_title>Effect of Plasma Sodium Concentration on Blood Pressure Regulators During Hemodialysis</brief_title>
  <official_title>Is the Lower Incidence of Intradialytic Hypotension During Hemocontrol Dialysis in Comparison With Standard Hemodialysis Attributable to Enhanced to Higher Plasma Vasopressin Levels or to Enhanced Sympathetic Activity and/or to Less Nitric Oxide Production</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intradialytic hypotension (IDH) is a frequent and serious complication that may occur during
      hemodialysis treatment. The investigators and others have shown that the Hemocontrol
      biofeedback system is associated with improved hemodynamic stability. Hemocontrol is a
      technique that guides the patients' blood volume along a pre-set trajectory by continuously
      adjusting the ultrafiltration rate and dialysate conductivity. In a recent pilotstudy, the
      investigators found significantly higher plasma vasopressin levels during the first hour of
      dialysis with Hemocontrol in comparison with standard hemodialysis. Increased vasopressin
      levels may contribute to intradialytic hemodynamic stability during hemodialysis by enhanced
      vasoconstriction. These results, however, did not prove directly that the improved
      hemodynamic stability with Hemocontrol is indeed caused by higher initial plasma vasopressin
      levels. Alternative explanations might be that 1) the higher initial plasma sodium levels
      with Hemocontrol dialysis enhance activity of the sympathetic nervous system directly,
      causing vasoconstriction and thereby improved hemodynamic stability and/or 2) that the higher
      initial plasma levels of sodium in Hemocontrol inhibit the release of nitric oxide by the
      vascular endothelium. Another goal of this study is to investigate whether vasopressin is
      removed with hemodialysis.
