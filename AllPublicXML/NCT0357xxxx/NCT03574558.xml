    <textblock>
      The &quot;MD-Logic Switch Advisor&quot; is a software product that is designed to assist in insulin
      dosage decision making and has two components:

      A. MD-Logic Switch Advisor for initiation of pump therapy - this product is designed to
      assist physicians in decision making when initiating insulin pump therapy.

      B. MD-Logic Switch Advisor for patients who use insulin pump therapy and need to switch to
      MDI (Multiple Daily Injections).

      This feasibility study will be divided to two parts:

      part A - will include up to 20 patients to evaluate in a feasibility study the switch Advisor
      from MDI to pump therapy part B - will include up to 20 patients to evaluate in a feasibility
      study the switch Advisor from pump therapy to MDI The main objective is to evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of using the MD-Logic Switch Advisor to determine insulin dosing for
      subjects with type 1 diabetes using pump therapy who wish to switch to from pump to MDI
      therapy and vice versa.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject has documented Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, as defined by the American
             Diabetes Association and World Health Organization (ADA/WHO) for at least 3 months
             prior to study enrolment ( Part A of the study) or at least 6 months (Part B of the
             study)

          2. Insulin dose requirement is equal or above 0.5/unit/kg

          3. The subject age is â‰¥ 6 years and below 30 years at the time of enrolment

          4. A1c &lt; 10%

          5. The subject uses multiple daily injections to deliver insulin and wish to switch to
             pump therapy (Part A of the study) or the subject uses pump therapy for at least 3
             months and is willing to switch to multiple daily injections for the study period
             (Part B of the study)

          6. The subject is willing to follow study instructions

          7. Subject is available for entire study duration

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any significant diseases / conditions including psychiatric disorders and substance
             abuse that in the opinion of the investigator is likely to affect the subject's
             ability to complete the study or compromise patient's safety, or that influence
             metabolic control (e.g. anemia, significantly impaired hepatic function, renal
             failure, history of adrenal insufficiency).

          2. Subject is taking or has taken oral or parenteral glucocorticoids within 1 month prior
             to screening or plans to take oral or parenteral glucocorticoids within the planned
             study duration. Exceptions: Short term oral or paraenteral glucocorticoids up to 7
             days

          3. Subject has known allergy to medical grade adhesives

          4. Subject is participating in another study of a medical device or drug that could
             affect glucose measurements or glucose management or receipt of any investigational
             medical product within 1 month prior to screening (visit1)

          5. Female subject of child-bearing potential who have a positive pregnancy test at
             screening, is pregnant, breast-feeding, or planning to become pregnant within the
             planned study duration (or is not using adequate contraceptive methods)

          6. Subject diagnosed with current eating disorder such as anorexia or bulimia

          7. Subject has a history of one or more episodes of Diabetes Keto-acidosis requiring

          8. Subject has visual impairment or hearing loss, which in the Investigator's opinion,
             may compromise patient ability to perform study procedures safely (child and parent
             should be evaluated as a unit)
