  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized crossover trial in patients with Pulmonary Hypertension (PAH, CTEPH) to assess the
      acute response to simulated altitude (FIO2: 15.1% = equivalent to 2500m above sea level) on
      non-invasive cardiac output assessments by Finapres® &quot;NOVA&quot; Technology at rest and under
      exercise.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low altitude baseline measurements will be performed in Zurich (470m asl) including
      Echocardiography, right heart catheterization, six-minute walk test (6MWT), pulmonary
      function test, clinical assessment and blood gas analysis at rest and under exercise.

      Randomly assigned to the order of testing, the participants will be tested under simulated
      altitude (FiO2: 15.1% with the &quot;AMC Altitrainer&quot;) and shamed altitude with the same device.

      During the exposure to simulated altitude (FiO2: 15.1%) and shamed altitude of 1 hour each,
      the participants cardiac output non-invasively assessed will be measured throughout the whole
      intervention.
