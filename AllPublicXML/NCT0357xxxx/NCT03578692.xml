  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute severe ulcerative colitis [ASUC] patients have high risk of no response to medical
      treatments and might miss the best timing for surgery when waiting for the medical response.
      Thus, we investigated whether biomarkers which could early predict the surgery risk of
      patients with ASUC on admission.

    <description>Medical treatments involve glucocorticoids, Immunosuppressant and biologicals for ulcerative colitis. The Oxford Index measured everyday, consisting of CRP and stool frequency, is used to evaluate the response to the treatment. If the Oxford Index does not reduce after 5-day medical treatment, this situation is deemed as no response to medical treatment</description>

    <description>The protocol for patients assigned to surgery group was as follows. ASUC patients were admitted in, estimated their baseline situations and tested their blood and fecal indicators including PCT, IL-6 and FC on admission. All patients were treated according to the ECCO guideline 2012. Patients who showed bad response to medicine (glucocorticoid for 5 days and rescue therapy for 3 days) were recommended and classified in the surgery group. Their baseline manifestations were collected and compared with the medical group, to exploit the baseline indicators with great sensitive and specificity predicting the high risk for surgery.</description>
