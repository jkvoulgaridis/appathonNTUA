  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The full program is focused on identifying and reducing risk factors surrounding falls. Based
      on previous research, we believe that occupational therapy group classes and adaptive yoga
      are an ideal pairing to reduce fall risk. The occupational therapy sessions will consist of
      lecture, group discussion, and activities designed to target biological, behavioral,
      environmental, and socioeconomic factors that contribute to fall risk specifically for people
      with Parkinson's disease.
