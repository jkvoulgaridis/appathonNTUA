      The investigator will conduct a pilot study evaluating the feasibility and acceptability of
      providing a computer-based program (CBT4CBT), used for the treatment of substance use
      disorders, in a church setting. Forty Black adults with a current DSM-5 alcohol or substance
      use disorder will utilize the 'CBT for CBT' program over a period of 8 weeks. Primary
      outcomes will be acceptability and feasibility of providing the treatment in a church
      setting. If found to be acceptable and feasible, with preliminary promise for reductions in
      substance use, the next step would be to adapt the computer intervention for this population
      and conduct a randomized controlled trial.

    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Feasibility is a composite variable (yes/no indicator). This will be determined by counting the number of participants completing the CBT4CBT intervention with significant reductions in drug use, as measured by mean change scores in the severity and quantity of substance use, and functioning over the course of treatment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Program Acceptability</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Acceptability of treatment will be assessed by giving each participant a post-intervention satisfaction survey that assesses satisfaction with the intervention, perception of outcome, attitudes about spiritual practices accompanying CBT4CBT modules, and whether the participant would recommend this program to a friend. To evaluate the acceptability of CBT4CBT with BSUD in a church setting and to identify if religious behaviors led by trained church based health advisors (CHA), may increase the likely suitability of this intervention within the Black church.</description>
