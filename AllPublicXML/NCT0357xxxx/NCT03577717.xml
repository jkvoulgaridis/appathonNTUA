    <textblock>
      Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is the prodrome of the cognitive function declining before
      Alzheimer's disease or other dementia showed up, the impairments of language, visuospatial
      relationship, attention, and memory included and instrumental activities of daily living
      (IADL) influenced. MCI is considered as a transitional stage between normal aging and mild
      dementia, and the patients with MCI has differently fluctuated cognitive functions in a
      period of time, such as from normal cognition to MCI or developing to dementia. The annual
      conversion rate (ACR) of older adults with normal cognition developed to MCI is 30%, and 5%
      in clinical setting, and community, respectively. Not all of patients with MCI develop to
      Alzheimer's disease, the reversion of patients with MCI to normal cognition exists. However,
      MCI is a significant risk factor. The ACR of older adults with normal cognition or MCI
      developed to dementia is 1-2%, and 5-15%, respectively; moreover, about half of patients with
      MCI developed to dementia in 5 years.

      Cognitive training (CT) improves cognitive functions with repetitive practicing standardized
      cognitive tasks of specific cognitive functions, such as memory, attention, or problem
      solving. CT has widely defined including strategy training, in which contained cognitive
      exercise, strategy indicating and practicing to reducing cognitive impairments and improving
      performances. CT is more effective for MCI. Recently, computer-based CT (CCT) with many
      advantages gradually replaced the traditional paper-pencil form. Brief systematic review
      showed that the computer-based intervention had positive effects on behavioral symptoms, such
      as depression and anxiety, in patients with MCI and/or dementia. Previous studies
      demonstrated that computer-based intervention exhibited moderate treatment effects on overall
      cognitive functions in patients with MCI, and also had positive effects on learning,
      short-term memory, and behavioral symptoms.

      Older people with cognitive impairments is expected to increase by global aging. It is
      important for improving or maintaining cognitive functions of older adults with MCI. The
      efficacy of the CCT on cognitive functions, neuropsychiatric symptoms, daily functions, and
      brain activated imaging of the magnetoencephalography (MEG) of in older adults with MCI is
      worth to explore for busy clinical practice.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study design was a prospective and single-blinded randomized controlled trial. 36
      participants with MCI were recruited and demographic data (age, gender, education level
      /years of education, marriage status etc.) were also collected. The MCI participants
      underwent the comprehensive review at baseline including neuropsychological assessment and
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging or Computerized Tomogram. Randomization treatment assignment will
      be generated by the random number table and assign the patient's intervention group
      accordingly. Sealed opaque envelopes containing the CCT group, or the dosage-matched control
      group sheets will be prepared and given to the therapists.

      Based on the t-test effect size of index d 1.00 indicates, an estimated 17 participants in
      each group will be required for a power of 0.80 with a two-sided type I error of 0.05.
      Considering the 5% (q) drop rate, we will need to recruit 18 participants (N/1-q) for each
      group. The participants were randomly allocated to either the CCT group (18 participants) or
      the dosage-matched control group (18 participants) with individualized intervention for 30
      minutes a day, 3 times a week for 4 consecutive weeks. Clinical outcome measures, and the
      imaging of the MEG were administered at pre- treatment, post-treatment and 1-month follow-up
      for further analysis.

      Statistical analysis was performed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS)
      version 19.0. In statistical testing, two-sided p value ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically
      significant. The distributional properties of continuous variables were expressed by mean ±
      standard deviation (SD), categorical variables were presented by frequency and percentage.
      The differences in the distributions of continuous variables, categorical variables between
      the treatment and control groups were examined using two-sample t-test, Wilcoxon rank-sum
      test (or Mann-Whitney U test), and chi-square test. In addition, the minimum norm estimates
      (MNE), source-based time-frequency analysis, cross-frequency coupling, and functional
      connectivity were used to explore the differences of the activation of brain functions in
      participants between different treatment groups. The t-test was used to explore the
      differences of reaction time, rate of correction, and physical signals in stimulus reaction
      test of the MEG between in participants between different treatment groups. The correlation
      statistics was used to explore relationships between the scores of outcome measurements and
      the physical signals.

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Imaging change of the MEG</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 month, 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The 1-back working memory paradigm was used to explore the efficacy of each intervention. When one figure matches with the previous one, the participant needs to press the button for response as soon as possible. The Go-Nogo paradigm was to explore the reaction-inhibition functions. The participant needs to press the button for Go stimulus (1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9), and inhibits to press the button for Nogo stimulus (3, 7). Paired-stimulus paradigm is widely used for assessing the activation and inhibition functions of sensory cortex. The same of two stimuli (S1, S2) would show within 500 ms interval, and the magnitude of induced reaction of the second stimulus (S2) would be inhibited in normal physical condition. Calculating the S2/S1 ratio of paired-stimulus quantified the inhibition functions of sensory cortex, the much less ratio indicating the greater inhibition functions.</description>
