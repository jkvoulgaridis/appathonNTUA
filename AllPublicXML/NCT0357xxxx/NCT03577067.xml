  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although mortality after liver surgery reduced during the last three decades to less than 2%,
      post-operative course is still complicated in a range of 20-50% of cases.The identification
      of one or few factors which could detect the real risk of complicated post-operative outcome,
      may help anesthesiologist to decide whether admit a patient to ICU or not.The primary aim of
      this study was to evaluate whether RRI, alone or along with other items, can predict
      post-operative complication after hepatic resection.
