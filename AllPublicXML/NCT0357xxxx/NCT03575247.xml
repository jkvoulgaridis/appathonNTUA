  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glucocorticoids are widely used for the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases. Although
      glucocorticoids are effective in controlling disease symptoms, continuous use of the drugs
      can lead to suppression of adrenal hormones or excessive cortisol level in the blood stream.
      That is, excess blood cortisol level due to glucocorticoid exogenous supply can either
      inhibit the 'hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis' for adrenal hormones production or result
      in Cushing symptoms.

      In the period between 1989 and 2008 in the UK, it was estimated that 0.6%-0.8% of the general
      adult population were long-term users of oral glucocorticoids. However, there is no data on
      the risk of adrenal suppression and Cushing syndrome due to chronic use of glucocorticoids in
      the UK to date.

      The aim of the study is to investigate the risk of adrenal insufficiency and Cushing syndrome
      due to long-term use of glucocorticoids in England.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adrenal insufficiency is a clinical condition that is associated with a deficiency of adrenal
      hormones, mainly: glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids. Cushing syndrome is also a
      condition that stems from the existence of persistent high cortisol level in the body. The
      majority of Cushing syndrome cases are exogenous (iatrogenic or due to use of medication).

      Glucocorticoids are widely used for the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases. Although
      glucocorticoids are effective in controlling disease symptoms, continuous use of the drugs
      can lead to suppression of adrenal hormones or excessive cortisol level in the blood stream.
      That is, excess blood cortisol level due to glucocorticoid exogenous supply can either
      inhibit the 'hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis' for adrenal hormones production or result

      the risk of adrenal suppression and Cushing syndrome due to chronic use of glucocorticoids in
      the UK to date

      The aim of the study is to investigate the risk of adrenal insufficiency and Cushing syndrome
      due to long-term use of glucocorticoids in England. This is a retrospective cohort study of
      people diagnosed with at least one of six chronic inflammatory diseases (polymialgia
      rheumatica, giant cell arteritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis,
      vasculitis and inflammatory bowel disease).

      This study will be based on the analysis of existing primary care health records routinely
      collected, linked to hospital and mortality data.
