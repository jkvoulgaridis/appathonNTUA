  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      &quot;Indocyanine Green (ICG) is a dye used as an indicator of hepatic function considering its
      capacity to be eliminated only by the bile. Thus, ICG tend to remain in liver tumors.

      The hypothesis of CAMVIC study is that the use of fluorescence imaging during laparoscopic
      hepatic surgery will allow to detect small subcapsular superficial lesions undetected by
      other diagnostic methods, which will improve the results of the oncologic treatment.&quot;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      &quot;Thanks to the property of ICG to release a fluorescent signal when excited by a Near Infra
      Red (NIR) light source, ICG fluorescence has been widely used during several clinical
      situations (angiography, lymphography,..). Few years ago it has been shown that hepatic
      tumors could be seen with a NIR camera able to view ICG fluorescence thanks to the depot in
      or around the tumor of the dye injected during preop.Since, this fluorescence imaging
      technique potential has been underlined to identify tumors undiagnosed before surgery.
      Pre-operative examination of hepatic lesions is based on 3 points:

        -  visual examination

        -  two-hand palpation

        -  intra-operative ultrasound.

      During laparoscopic hepatic surgery it is not possible to palpate the liver thus peroperative
      examination of the liver surface is harder than during open surgery. Moreover per-operative
      ultrasound is not a reliable tool in order to explore liver surface. However the latest
      development of NIR cameras able to view ICG fluorescence could add a benefit in laparoscopic
      surgery in view of its capacity to detect superficial lesions, even those of small
      dimension.&quot;
