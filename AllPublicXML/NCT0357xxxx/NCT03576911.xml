  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomised placebo controlled trial of Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) vitamin
      supplementation in a sample of patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. CoQ10
      is produced in the mitochondria of our cells, and is involved in the production of energy.
      However, some people do not produce enough CoQ10, which can result in difficulties with
      concentration and memory, depressive symptoms, low energy levels and high blood pressure. The
      study will examine the impact of taking oral CoQ10 supplementation on patients with
      schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coenzyme-Q10 (CoQ10) is an essential cofactor in the mitochondrial electron-transport-chain
      in addition to being a potent lipophilic antioxidant. Deficits in CoQ10 status have been
      linked to cardiovascular disease, cognitive decline, fatigue, and depression. CoQ10
      supplementation may have a potential therapeutic value for patients with schizophrenia and
      schizoaffective disorder. This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised trial that
      will compare neurocognitive performance and symptoms of schizophrenia and schizoaffective
      disorder in participants randomised to active CoQ10 compared to scores from participants who
      received placebo. CoQ10 will be administered at a dose of 300mg/day, delivered in 3 doses of
      100mg each. Participants will take CoQ10/placebo for 6 months. At three time points
      (baseline, 3 months and 6 months) each participant completes a neurocognitive and
      psychological battery of assessments. Blood pressure is monitored, and blood samples to
      assess mitochondrial function and plasma CoQ10 status are taken at each assessment.
