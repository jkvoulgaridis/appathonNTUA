  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine how 25(OH)D3 clearance is affected by vitamin D3
      supplementation using a gold standard pharmacokinetic approach. We expect that this study
      will enhance interpretation of available diagnostic tests, inform the results of ongoing
      large clinical trials of vitamin D supplements, and help develop new strategies to target
      vitamin D to improve health.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in metabolic clearance of D6-25(OH)D3</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Metabolic clearance is calculated as the administered dose of 25(OH)D3 divided by the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC). AUC is calculated using the linear trapezoidal method. Change in clearance of D6-25(OH)D3 will be calculated as D6-25(OH)D3 clearance measured during CLEAR-PLUS minus D6-25(OH)D3 clearance previously measured during participation in the related study protocol (without vitamin D3 supplementation).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in AUC of D6-25(OH)D3</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>AUC is calculated using the linear trapezoidal method. Change in the AUC of D6-25(OH)D3 will be calculated as D6-25(OH)D3 AUC measured during CLEAR-PLUS minus D6-25(OH)D3 AUC previously measured during participation in the related study protocol (without vitamin D3 supplementation).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in terminal half-life of D6-25(OH)D3</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Terminal half-life is equal to ln2/k, where k is the slope of the terminal regression line estimated using ≥3 plasma concentrations. Change in the terminal half-life of D6-25(OH)D3 will be calculated as D6-25(OH)D3 half-life measured during CLEAR-PLUS minus D6-25(OH)D3 half-life previously measured during participation in the related study protocol (without vitamin D3 supplementation).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in volume of distribution of D6-25(OH)D3</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Volume of distribution in the central compartment is calculated as dose/C0, where dose is the administered dose of 25(OH)D3 and C0 is the initial (estimated) concentration of drug in plasma. Change in the volume of distribution of D6-25(OH)D3 will be calculated as D6-25(OH)D3 volume of distribution measured during CLEAR-PLUS minus D6-25(OH)D3 volume of distribution previously measured during participation in the related study protocol (without vitamin D3 supplementation).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in metabolic formation clearance of D6-25(OH)D3 metabolites.</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Metabolic formation clearance is calculated as the daughter metabolite plasma AUC divided by the AUC of D6-25(OH)D3 (metabolite/parent AUC ratio). AUC is calculated using the linear trapezoidal method. Changes in the metabolic formation clearance of D6-25(OH)D3 metabolites will be calculated as metabolic formation clearance measured during CLEAR-PLUS minus metabolic formation clearance previously measured during participation in the related study protocol (without vitamin D3 supplementation).</description>
