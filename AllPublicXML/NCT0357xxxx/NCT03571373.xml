  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to analyse effectiveness and safety signals of current treatment
      strategies in routine practice for patients with pediatric-onset inflammatory bowel disease
      (PIBD) and to correlate this to their individual risk factors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this prospective observational study children with newly diagnosed inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD) will be included in the inception cohort. The primary aim of the inception
      cohort is to analyse the effectiveness and safety signals of current treatment strategies and
      to correlate them to individual risk factors. In order to capture information on rare and
      severe complications in PIBD as well, the safety registry was designed to estimate incidence
      and prevalence rates of these complications and get more insight in disease and treatment
      characteristics of these patients.

        Inclusion Criteria Inception cohort:

        Newly diagnosed patient, &lt;18 years of age, with a likely diagnosis of IBD or a confirmed
        diagnosis of IBD can be included in the study. In order to be eligible to continue in the
        study the subject must meet all of the following criteria:

          -  Diagnosis is based on history, physical examination, laboratory, endoscopic,
             radiological and histological features according to the revised Porto criteria (1)

          -  Diagnosis has been made or is confirmed within 2 months of inclusion

          -  Data on all diagnostic procedures are available for inclusion in the database

          -  Informed consent of patient (if indicated) and parents has been obtained

          -  Concerning the patients of whom biological specimens will be included: patients have
             not started IBD treatment yet

        Inclusion Criteria Safety Registry:

        Any child with IBD &lt;19 years old with complications as detailed in the agreed safety
        monitoring list (or future updates of the list of conditions) can be reported. For the
        initial reporting of incident cases no patient identifiable details will be required.

        Exclusion Criteria Inception cohort:

          -  Inability to read and understand the patient and family information sheets (for
             example insufficient knowledge of national language, where no health advocate or
             family member is available to translate and ensure full understanding of the study)

          -  Informed consent of patient or parents has not been obtained when required

          -  Patients on similar treatments as for IBD but for other conditions, or known with
             conditions directly affecting the IBD (e.g. immunodeficiency or major gastrointestinal
             resections)

        Exclusion Criteria Safety registry: none.
