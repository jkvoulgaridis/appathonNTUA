  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of JNJ-64619178 in
      participants with relapsed/refractory B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) or advanced solid
      tumors and also to identify the recommended Phase 2 dose(s) (RP2Ds) of JNJ-64619178 for NHL
      and advanced solid tumors (Part 1) and to confirm the tolerability of JNJ-64619178 in
      participants with lower risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) (Part 2).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of JNJ-64619178, and to
      select a dose(s) and regimen(s) that may be used in future clinical development. Study
      evaluations will include safety, pharmacokinetics, biomarkers and efficacy evaluations
      (Disease Assessments). Adverse events will be evaluated throughout the study. The study is
      divided into 4 periods: a screening phase, a pharmacokinetic run-in phase, a treatment phase,
      and a post treatment follow-up phase. An end-of-treatment visit will be completed less than
      or equal (&lt;=) 30 days (+7 days) after the last dose of study drug or prior to the start of a
      new anticancer therapy, whichever comes first.
