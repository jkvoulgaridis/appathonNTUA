      The present study is an exploratory study. Patients who meeting the enrollment conditions for
      relapsed or refractory B-cell lymphoma receive a single intravenous dose of CD20-CART cells.
      The research with the open-label, single arm running control methods in order to initially
      observe the safety, tolerability, and cellular pharmacokinetics of CD20-CART cell drugs.

      The main purpose:

      To preliminary explore the safety, tolerability and cellular pharmacokinetics of CD20-CART
      cell agents in the treatment of relapsed or refractory B-cell lymphomas.

      The Secondary purpose:

      The following indicators for preliminary observations of CD20-CART cells in the treatment of
      relapsed or refractory B-cell malignant lymphoma.

        1. The determination of lymph nodes to evaluate the anti-tumor effect caused by the input
           of CD20-CART cells agents.

        2. Assessing the ability of CD20-CART cell agents to inhibit the migration of bone marrow
           and lymph node tumor foci.

        3. Assess the killing ability of CD20-CART cell agents to tumor cells in vitro, for
           patients whose tumor cells could obtain.

        4. Disease control rate (DCR) (=CR (complete disease remission) + PR (partial remission of
           disease) + SD (stable disease), short-term efficacy assessment); Overall survival (OS)
           and progression-free survival (PFS) (long-term efficacy assessment).
