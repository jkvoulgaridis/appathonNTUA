  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endometrial cancer (EC) is the most common gynecologic malignancy in the developed countries
      and is the fifth most common cancer among women worldwide. Typically present well or
      moderately differentiated, early stage endometrioid histotype with a prognosis usually
      favorable. Pelvic lymph nodes (LNs) represent the most common site of extra-uterine disease
      in patients with clinical early stage disease and the role of lymphadenectomy in early stage
      EC has been one of the major controversies in gynecology oncology. Lymphadenectomy doesn't
      improve survival or reduce disease recurrence although supported to provide prognostic
      information and allowing tailoring of adjuvant therapy. Nevertheless, lymphadenectomy is not
      performed without serious short-term and long-term morbidity. Although surgical staging is
      the most accurate and standard method to determine LNs involvement, the introduction in
      clinical practice of a non-invasive modality that allows an accurate staging of EC would be
      essential. Available evidence report the accuracy of Positron Emission Tomography and
      Computed Tomography (PET/CT) for the detection of LN metastasis in EC with a sensitivity of
      63% and specificity of 94.7%. This prospective comparative analysis between PET/CT,
      histological findings, and follow up data will be performed to investigate the sensitivity,
      specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and accuracy of
      integrated PET/CT for nodal staging of EC per patient and per LN chain analyses, in women
      affected by intermediate (grade 1 and 2 endometrioid lesions with deep myometrial invasion &gt;
      50% or grade 3 endometrioid lesion with &lt; 50% myometrial invasion) or high risk (grade 3
      endometrioid lesion with deep myometrial invasion &gt; 50% or non-endometrioid histotype)
      early-stage EC. Furthermore, the preoperative classification of EC in intermediate and
      high-risk class will allow to investigate its prognostic value.
