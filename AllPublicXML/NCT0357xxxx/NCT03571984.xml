  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer (BC) ranks second among all the types of cancer and is equally common in
      developing as well as developed countries. Breast cancer is most common type of cancer
      worldwide and its diagnosis as well as early treatment is associated with distress. The aim
      of this study is to explore the feasibility of integrating a 'Moving on After Breast Cancer
      (ABC)' manual developed by service user (Dr A Saleem) with Cognitive Behavior Therapyfor
      Pakistani women who are breast cancer (BC) survivors attending primary care and oncology
      services in Pakistan B) refine the Moving on ABC plus so as to develop a culturally
      appropriate therapeutic programme to be tested in a future definitive randomized controlled
      trial.

    <textblock>
      According to an estimate of World Health Organization (2000) cancer was responsible for 12%
      of all the deaths from all causes worldwide and rate of cancer is expected to increase 50% by
      the year 2020. In Pakistan every ninth women has a chance of developing breast cancer, which
      is highest rate in Asia. The estimated incidence rate of breast cancer in Pakistan is
      50/100,000. Despite the high association of distress with breast cancer, data on prevalence
      of depression in women with breast cancer especially in low income countries is limited .

      The proposed project consists of two phases: 1) Phase 1: Integration of the two existing
      interventions Moving On ABC and the Cognitive Behavior Therapy and the refinement of the
      integrated intervention. 2) Phase 2: Feasibility Randomized Control Trial (RCT). Sample size
      of Phase II will be comprised of 50 patients. Patients will be divided into two groups. One
      group (n = 25) will receive Group moving on ABC Plus intervention and other group (n = 25)
      will receive routine care. The total sample size of the effectiveness trial 354.
