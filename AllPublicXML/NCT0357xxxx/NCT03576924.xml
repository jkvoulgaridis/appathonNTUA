  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with prediabetes have blood sugar levels that are higher than normal and is linked to
      the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Improving cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) in
      adults with prediabetes is important for preventing CVD. The primary aim of this study is to
      improve the CRF among adults with prediabetes by improving exercise adherence through
      providing choice to self-select their own exercise type and intensity.
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial has been informed by self-determination theory. The theory states that individuals
      who choose their own activities report increased internal reasons/motivations, as opposed to
      external reasons (to satisfy another person's suggestions) for the behavior. Internal
      motivation for performing a behavior are linked with increased pleasure with the behavior and
      improved adherence.

      The primary outcome is improvement in CRF from baseline to 12-months post-intervention. The
      secondary outcomes are changes in exercise adherence from baseline to 6- and 12-month
      post-intervention. Tertiary outcomes include self-reported changes in in-task affective
      responses during the exercise intervention, as well as baseline to 6- and 12-month
      post-intervention changes in exercise-related motivation and enjoyment in free-living,
      unsupervised exercise. A total of 201 low active adults (18 to 70 years) with prediabetes
      will be randomized to a 3-week supervised intervention involving behavioral counseling and
      one of three exercise conditions, either: 1) imposed high-intensity interval training
      (Imposed-HIIT; n=67/group); 2) imposed moderate-intensity continuous training (Imposed-MICT),
      or 3) choice between MICT or HIIT (CHOICE). It is hypothesized that the CHOICE condition will
      have higher improvements in CRF (primary outcome) from baseline to 12-month
      post-intervention, and exercise adherence (secondary outcome) from baseline to 6- and
      12-months post-intervention, compared to individuals in the IM-MICT or IM-HIIT. For the
      tertiary outcomes, the CHOICE condition will show greater in-task affective responses during
      the exercise intervention. We further except greater changes in exercise-related motivation
      and enjoyment for the CHOICE condition from baseline to 6- and 12-months post-intervention
      compared to IM-HIIT and IM-MICT conditions. This proposed trial would provide theory- and
      evidence-based information whether providing choice for engaging in HIIT or MICT is
      associated with improvements in CRF, exercise adherence, and exercise enjoyment.

    <description>Moderate-Intensity Continuous Training (MICT) is continuous exercise for 30 min/session at 60-65% of heart rate max for 5 times/week, consistent with the physical activity guidelines of 150 min/week of moderate activity. Individuals are asked to engage in MICT exercise only (IM-MICT) during the supervised and unsupervised exercise sessions. During the supervised exercise the intensity will be based on the HR monitors, and affective and psychophysiological responses of perceived exertion. The exercise training is paired with 30 min behavioural counselling that is identical for all three interventions.</description>

Total session duration is 15 min for 5/week and it matches the guidelines of 75 min of vigorous exercise per week. During the supervised and unsupervised exercise sessions participants will perform a 15 min bout of HIIT. During the supervised exercise the intensity will be based on the HR monitors, and affective and psychophysiological responses of perceived exertion.

    <description>Participants will first be familiarized with HIIT and MICT in randomized, counter-balanced order and subsequently they will always self-select the exercise type for the supervised and unsupervised exercise sessions. The IM-HIIT and IM-MICT protocols will match to the parallel imposed conditions. During the supervised exercise the intensity will also be based on affective and psychophysiological responses of perceived exertion. Throughout the 3-week intervention as well as during the 12-month follow-up, participants in the CHOICE condition will be told to choose either HIIT or MICT each time they exercise. The exercise training is paired with 30 min behavioural counselling that is identical for all three interventions.</description>
