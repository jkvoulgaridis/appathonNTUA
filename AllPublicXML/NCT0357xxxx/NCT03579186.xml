  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Specific aim: To determine whether optokinetic stimulation can improve gait abnormalities.

      Hypothesis: Optokinetic stimulation stimulates the vestibular system and can improve
      vestibular induced gait disorders.

    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study designed to determine whether or not the optokinetic stimulation
      improves gait in patients with gait abnormalities, specifically vestibular induced gait
      disorders. The study population will consist of patients already receiving a gait assessment
      through the Brain Fit Club (BFC) at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. This gait
      assessment involves walking and posture evaluations. Patients will complete a gait assessment
      as part of their normal BFC evaluation. Those who consent to participate in the study will
      then complete a gait assessment while receiving optokinetic stimulation. The investigators
      will compare baseline gait and postural control before and during OKS stimulation.
