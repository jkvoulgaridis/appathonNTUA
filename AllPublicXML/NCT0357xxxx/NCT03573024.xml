  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to treat non-elderly adult patients, who were previously untreated for acute
      myeloid leukemia, using venetoclax and azacitidine.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II study that seeks to treat patients ages 18-59 who have acute myeloid
      leukemia but have never been treated before. It will use venetoclax and azacitidine, and
      patients can receive up to four cycles of this medication. Depending on the level of
      recovery, patients will either be forced to come off study or have the option to continue the
      medication, receive maintenance therapy, or pursue an allogeneic stem cell transplant.

It will be dose escalated to a target dose of 600 mg in the following manner: 100 mg on day 1, 200 mg on day 2, 400 mg on day 3 and 600 mg on day 4. The patient then continues to take the 600mg dose for the remainder of the 28 day cycle. Each dose of venetoclax will be self-administered with approximately 240 mL of water within 30 minutes after the completion of a meal, preferably breakfast. The dose should be administered at the same time each day. On days the subject is given azacitidine, venetoclax must be given first.</description>
