    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial will compare the effectiveness and acceptability of a
      computerized treatment targeting anxiety sensitivity compared to an active control: Physical
      Health Education Treatment (PHET) to determine efficacy among military personnel when
      delivered over the Internet.

      Purpose: To investigate the efficacy and acceptability of a computerized stress sensitivity
      treatment delivered online among a population of U.S. military personnel.

      The objective of the current proposal is to evaluate the efficacy of the Cognitive Anxiety
      Sensitivity Treatment (CAST) program in an online RCT through Amazon's Mechanical Turk with
      Veterans and military personnel. The primary outcome variables will be traumatic stress,
      anxiety, and depressive symptoms. The study is being conducted at Florida State University.

      Specific Aims: (1) Evaluate the efficacy of the CAST program delivered over the Internet
      among Veterans and military personnel; (2) Assess acceptability and usability of the CAST
      program delivered over the Internet without in person appointments; (3) Determine the
      feasibility of using Amazon's Mechanical Turk to recruit and conduct a fully online
      randomized controlled trial of a computerized treatment.

      Veterans or active duty personnel (N = 100) who are at increased risk for mental health
      problems, as indicated by elevated anxiety sensitivity, will be recruited through Amazon's
      Mechanical Turk. Mechanical Turk is an online marketplace for individuals interested in
      completing computerized tasks, such as research surveys, for compensation. Participants will
      complete self-report symptom measures before and after the intervention as well as at a
      4-month follow-up appointment. The intervention is a single session and lasts approximately
      45 minutes. The intervention contains educational material to dispel commonly held false
      beliefs about the dangerousness of experiencing anxiety symptoms, for example elevated heart
      rate or a difficulty concentrating. Then participants are guided through an exercise designed
      to bring on these uncomfortable bodily sensations to help participants reduce the amount of
      distress these symptoms cause. Participants will also be asked to provide feedback related to
      acceptability and usability of the intervention.

    <time_frame>Baseline; change from baseline to immediately post intervention, change from baseline to 4 month FU</time_frame>
    <description>The Anxiety Sensitivity Index - 3 (ASI-3; Taylor et al., 2007) is an 18-item self-report measure of AS. This scale was developed to provide a more stable measure of the three most widely recognized AS subfactors (cognitive, social and physical concerns) than the original ASI provides. The measure has shown good psychometric properties (Taylor et al., 2007).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline; change from baseline to immediately post intervention, change from baseline to 4 month FU</time_frame>
    <description>The Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7; Spitzer et al., 2006) is a 7- item self-report measure of generalized anxiety. Participants rate the frequency with which they experience anxiety-related symptoms on a scale of 0 (Not at all) to 3 (Nearly every day). The GAD-7 exhibited excellent internal consistency and good test-retest reliability (Spitzer et al., 2006). Total scores range from 0-21 with higher scores indicating greater anxiety symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Change in Depressive Symptoms Module (PHQ-9).</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; change from baseline to immediately post intervention, change from baseline to 4 month FU</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Health Questionnaire - Depression (PHQ-9) is the 9-item depression module of the larger Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ;Spitzer et al., 1999) which was designed to assess eight DSM-IV diagnoses, including major depressive disorder. The PHQ-9 exhibited excellent internal reliability and excellent test-retest reliability (Kroenke et al., 2001). Total scores range from 0-27 with higher scores indicating greater depressive symptoms.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline; change from baseline to immediately post intervention, change from baseline to 4 month FU</time_frame>
    <description>The Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) is a brief, 20-item self-report instrument that assesses the 20 DSM-5 symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder. We will use the PCL-5 to obtain total symptom severity scores and DSM-5 symptom cluster severity scores for each participant.</description>

    <description>The System Usability Scale (SUS) is a 10 item self-report questionnaire assessing general usability of a given program (Brooke, 1996). The SUS total score ranges from 5 to 50 with higher scores indicating better usability.</description>

    <measure>Client Satisfaction</measure>

    <description>The Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ) is an 8 item self-report questionnaire assessing general satisfaction with services of treatment received by the individual (Attkisson and Zwick, 1982). The CSQ has shown high reliability and internal consistency (Attkisson and Zwick, 1982). Total score ranges from 8 to 32 with higher scores indicating greater satisfaction.</description>

    <description>The Cognitive Anxiety Sensitivity Treatment is a computerized treatment that is a combination of psychoeducation plus interoceptive exposure for anxiety sensitivity (AS). The psychoeducational component will focus on the nature of stress and its effect on the body. Interoceptive exposure (IE) exercises, designed to correct the conditioned fear to these bodily sensations, will be explained and practiced.</description>
