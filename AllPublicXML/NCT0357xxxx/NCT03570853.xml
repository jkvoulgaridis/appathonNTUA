      This study is to evaluate the effects of the SMART-3RP (Stress Management and Resiliency
      Training Relaxation Response Resiliency Program) on physician and academic faculty
      well-being, perceived stress, burnout, compassion, and job satisfaction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Burnout is a serious problem in healthcare, resulting in absenteeism, decreased job
      satisfaction, decreased empathy, anxiety, depression, increased medical errors and decreased
      patient satisfaction. A growing number of studies have demonstrated that programs
      incorporating mind-body practices increase resilience in healthcare providers and can reduce
      burnout and perceived stress while increasing empathy. The Benson-Henry Institute for Mind
      Body Medicine (BHI) has developed a clinical program for patients known as the Stress
      Management and Resiliency Training Relaxation Response Resiliency Program (SMART-3RP or SMART
      Program for short). This study is to evaluate the effect of the SMART-3RP on physician and
      academic faculty well-being, perceived stress, burnout, compassion, and job satisfaction.

    <description>This is an 8-week, multimodal resiliency program that targets stress with 4 main components: mind-body skills (participants learn a variety of meditation techniques, mini relaxations, walking meditation, and yoga), traditional stress management techniques, healthy lifestyle behaviors (sleep, exercise, nutrition, and social support), and cognitive reappraisal and adaptive coping skills (borrowed from cognitive behavioral therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy, and positive psychology). The program consists of 8, 1.5 hour sessions.</description>
