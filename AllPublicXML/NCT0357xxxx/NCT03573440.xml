        -  The subject will be asked to meet the student investigators at the Loma Linda Student
           Pavilion, sign an informed consent form, sign in, and provide an email address and phone
           number.

        -  After the initial briefing, the subject will be asked to eat their meal with an

           questionnaire and be reminded to bring the same meal the following week.

      Visit 2:

        -  The subject will be asked to meet the student investigators at the Loma Linda Student
           Pavilion with the same meal as the previous week.

        -  After receiving a brief education session, the subject will be asked to eat their meal
           with an investigator present.

        -  The subject must inform the investigator verbally when they are feeling full.

        -  After the subject has decided to end their meal, they will be asked to fill out a
           questionnaire and be reminded to meet the investigator at the same time the following
           week.

      Visit 3:

        -  The subject will be asked to meet the student investigators at the Loma Linda Student
           Pavilion.
