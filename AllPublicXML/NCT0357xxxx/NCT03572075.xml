  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of our study is to evaluate the impact of pelvic floor physiotherapy in symptomatic
      patients affected by deep infiltrating endometriosis, using 3D/4D transperineal ultrasound
      for evaluation of pelvic floor morphometry, NRS (Numerical Rating Scale) for evaluation of
      symptoms and validated questionnaires investigating intestinal, sexual and urinary functions.

      These results will be compared with those obtained from symptomatic patients affected by deep
      infiltrating endometriosis following the standard care procedure that does not provide pelvic
      floor physiotherapy.

      Symptomatic, nulliparous women with deep infiltrating endometriosis are included in the
      study.

      During the first medical examination, endometriosis related symptoms are assessed using NRS
      (Numerical Rating Scale); intestinal, sexual and urinary functions are evaluated with
      validated questionnaires (Knowles-Eccersley-Scott-Symptom Questionnaire (KESS), Female Sexual
      Function Index (FSFI), Bristol Female Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (BFLUTS)); pelvic floor
      morphometry at rest, during pelvic floor contraction and during Valsalva manoeuvre is
      evaluated using 3D/4D transperineal ultrasound through the assessment of the levator hiatus
      area (LHA). Gynaecological examination, transvaginal and transabdominal ultrasound are
      performed.

      After the first medical examination, enrolled patients are randomized into two groups:
      patients in Group A receive standard care procedure and pelvic floor physiotherapy; patients
      in Group B receive standard care procedure only. Pelvic floor physiotherapy protocol consists
      of six sessions (weeks 1, 3, 5, 8, 11 from the randomization). After four months from the
      first medical examination, endometriosis related symptoms, intestinal, sexual and urinary
      functions and pelvic floor morphometry are reassessed for all patients, using the same
      procedures, comparing the two groups and evaluating the impact of pelvic floor physiotherapy.

    <description>Women are firstly asked to rest and then contract the pelvic floor muscles (PFM) until the maximal cranioanterior displacement of the anorectal angle is attained.
The anorectal angle is defined as the angle between the posterior wall of the rectal ampulla and the anal canal.
All scans are obtained using a Voluson E6 system (GE Healthcare, Zipf, Austria) with RAB 8-4-MHz volume transducer for all acquisitions. Measurements were evaluated using a dedicated software (4DView 14.4; GE Healthcare, Zipf, Austria).</description>

    <description>Patients are firstly asked to rest and then contract the pelvic floor muscles looking at the ultrasound screen in order to be aware of the contraction of the pelvic floor muscles and improve it. Voluson E6 system (GE Healthcare, Zipf, Austria) with RAB 8-4-MHz volume transducer is used for all acquisitions.</description>
