  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project explores whether meditation increases breastmilk supply in mothers who are
      pumping milk for infants in the NICU. Mothers will be randomly assigned to daily meditation
      while pumping using an app designed for meditation for new mothers, and their breastmilk
      volume will be measured after one week of meditation versus a control group with measurements
      at the same time points. Investigators will also determine whether mediation improves
      breastfeeding confidence and reduces stress, anxiety and depression symptoms in these
      mothers. Finally investigators will examine the effect on salivary cortisol levels.

    <description>Comparison in the change in scores of Perceived Stress Score: NICU between Meditation Group and Control Group.
This is a 26-question written questionnaire that evaluates parental stress in relation to the experiences of having an infant in the NICU.
Subscales are the following:
Sights and Sounds (5 questions) Baby looks and behaves and Treatments (14 questions) Relationship/Parental Role (7 questions)
Question responses are on a scale of NA, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Total scores range from NA to 130.A higher score on the scale indicates higher stress.</description>

This is a 40-question written questionnaire that evaluates anxiety symptoms. Comparison of Baseline/Infant Day of Life #1 to Post-intervention/Infant Day of Life # 10.
Question responses are on a scale of 1-4
Total score ranges from 40-160. Scores are weighted using a scoring tool. A higher score is higher anxiety.</description>

This is a 18-question questionnaire that evaluates breastfeeding self-efficacy in breastfeeding mothers of infants in the NICU. This scale will be used to assess breastfeeding self-efficacy.
Question responses are on a scale of 1-5. Total score ranges from 18- 9. A higher score indicates higher confidence.</description>
