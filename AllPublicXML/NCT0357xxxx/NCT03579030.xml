    <textblock>
      This first-in-human, Phase 1, single-center study will evaluate single ascending doses (SAD)
      and multiple ascending doses (MAD) of RTA 1701 conducted in 2 parts. Part 1 (SAD) of this
      study will be conducted in approximately 56 healthy participants in up to 7 groups. Each
      group will consist of up to 8 participants who will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive a
      single dose of RTA 1701 or placebo, respectively. Safety, tolerability, and available
      pharmacokinetics in each group will be assessed by the Safety Monitoring Committee prior to
      dose escalation.

      Part 2 (MAD) of this study will be conducted in approximately 30 healthy participants in up
      to 3 groups and will commence after safety data for the highest dose in the SAD phase has
      been evaluated. Each group will consist of up to 10 participants who will be randomized in a
      4:1 ratio to receive 14 daily doses of RTA 1701 or placebo, respectively. Safety,
      tolerability, and available pharmacokinetics will be assessed in each dosing group prior to
      dose escalation
