      This study seeks to identify morphologic changes, such as increase in fibrous cap thickness
      (FCT), in atherosclerotic plaques associated with treatment with evolocumab and maximally
      tolerated statin therapy with or without additional lipid-modifying medication in patients
      presenting with non-ST-segment elevation (NSTE)-ACS using optical coherence tomography
      (OCT;primary, secondary, and exploratory endpoints) and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS;
      exploratory endpoints only)

             plaque

          -  An eligible LDL-C level via local lab assessment based on statin use at screening

        No statin use: greater than or equal to 130 mg/dL Low- or moderate-intensity statin use
        greater than or equal to 80 mg/dL High-intensity statin use greater than or equal to 60
        mg/dL

          -  Meets all the following criteria at the qualifying coronary angiogram:

        Angiographic evidence of coronary artery disease (CAD) with greater than or equal to 20%
        reduction of lumen diameter by angiographic visual estimation, in addition to the culprit
        plaque.

        Left main coronary artery must not have a greater than 50% reduction in lumen diameter by
        visual angiographic estimation.

        May not be the culprit vessel for the current or a previous myocardial infarction (MI).

        Has not undergone prior percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass
        grafting (CABG), and may not be a bypass graft.

        May not be a candidate for PCI or CABG currently or over the next 12 months, in the opinion
        of the investigator.

        Must be accessible by the OCT catheter.

        Targeted segment:

    <ipd_time_frame>Data sharing requests relating to this study will be considered beginning 18 months after the study has ended and either 1) the product and indication have been granted marketing authorization in both the US and Europe or 2) clinical development for the product and/or indication discontinues and the data will not be submitted to regulatory authorities. There is no end date for eligibility to submit a data sharing request for this study.</ipd_time_frame>
    <ipd_access_criteria>Qualified researchers may submit a request containing the research objectives, the Amgen product(s) and Amgen study/studies in scope, endpoints/outcomes of interest, statistical analysis plan, data requirements, publication plan, and qualifications of the researcher(s). In general, Amgen does not grant external requests for individual patient data for the purpose of re-evaluating safety and efficacy issues already addressed in the product labelling. Requests are reviewed by a committee of internal advisors. If not approved, a Data Sharing Independent Review Panel will arbitrate and make the final decision. Upon approval, information necessary to address the research question will be provided under the terms of a data sharing agreement. This may include anonymized individual patient data and/or available supporting documents, containing fragments of analysis code where provided in analysis specifications.
