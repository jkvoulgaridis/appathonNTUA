  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aromatherapy has been proven to be effective for treating patients with postoperative nausea
      and vomiting (PONV) after surgery, but few studies analyze its effect on preventing PONV.
      Most studies use aromatherapy once patients become nauseous, but this study will address a
      gap in the literature with relation to the effect of aromatherapy in the prevention of PONV.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to determine if aromatherapy will prevent postoperative
      nausea and vomiting (PONV). Peppermint aromatherapy will be used preemptively to test for
      effectiveness, decreased PONV, and the ability to avoid anti-emetics. This study will seek to
      demonstrate that peppermint aromatherapy is a simple, cost effective way to prevent PONV
      after anesthesia. By decreasing the need for anti-emetics and incidence of PONV, patients may
      have a quicker recovery time and experience less side effects from anti-emetics, such as
      increased sedation. This problem is significant to patients and society as it may demonstrate
      that the inhalation of peppermint can ease PONV and decrease costs due to anti-emetics, wound
      dehiscence, and prolonged hospital stay. This study may lead to higher levels of patient
      satisfaction; if the patients are not nauseated they may be more satisfied with their care.
