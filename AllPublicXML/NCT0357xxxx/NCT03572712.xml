  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transcutaneous capnography (PtcCo2) recently showed good agreement with blood gases to assess
      hypercapnia. There is no study that has evaluated the benefit to realise systematically a
      nocturnal PtcCo2 in the follow-up of home-ventilated patient with obesity hypoventilation
      syndrome (OHS). The investigators will evaluate the intake bring by nocturnal transcutaneous
      capnography, compared to nocturnal oximetry and blood gases, to diagnose nocturnal alveolar
      hypoventilation in a population of patient presenting an OHS, treated by non invasive
      ventilation (NIV) at home .

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be evaluated once a year in consultation with a blood gases, and then a
      nocturnal recording at home including a transcutaneous capnography and an oximetry.

      Some data will be registered too : cardiovascular and neurological comorbidities, diabetes
      mellitus, treatment, parameters of the non-invasive ventilation, duration of compliance and
      apnea-hypopnea index (if available).

      The investigators will perform a sequential analysis of nocturnal hypoventilation with first
      blood gases, then nocturnal oxymetry and to finish nocturnal PtcCo2. It will allow us to
      determine if PtcCo2 catch up some nocturnal hypoventilation, undetected by the first two
      exams.

      The investigators plan that the study will last 18 months. The analysis will be descriptive.
      Quantitative variables will be described with mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum and
      median. Quantitative variables are presented with number and percentage.

        The pneumology department at Nantes University Hospital follows approximately 400 patients
        treated by non-invasive ventilation, 250 of whom have SOH The investigators plan to include
        150 patients in the active patient line followed at Nantes University Hospital, which will
        make it possible to obtain the number of patients necessary to obtain satisfactory power
        while taking into account the fact that a certain number of transcutaneous capnographies
        will not be conclusive.
