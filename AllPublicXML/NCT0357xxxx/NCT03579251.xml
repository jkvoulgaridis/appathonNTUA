  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study aims to develop an intervention that is strategic in that it will 1) be a
      focused on an approach that combines an in-person session with post-session, two-way text
      messaging to continue the intervention and reinforce the gains from the in-person session and
      2) ultimately find HIV+ Black men who have sex with men who have left HIV care where they are
      likely to present (e.g., city and county health clinics, community-based organizations,
      emergency rooms).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this application is to develop and conduct a preliminary test of a
      &quot;portable&quot; intervention, &quot;Black Men's Care&quot; (BMC), to re-engage in HIV care HIV+ Black men
      who have sex with men who have left HIV care (+BMSM-LC) that is flexible with respect to
      where it can be conducted. The aims of the study are: Aim 1—to conduct formative research to
      develop BMC content and optimize its delivery; Aim 2—to develop BMC, a theory-based,
      combination in-person and text messaging (mHealth) intervention for +BMSM-LC; and Aim 3—to
      evaluate the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary outcomes of BMC in preparation for
      submitting an R01 proposal to finalize and conduct an efficacy trial of BMC. Aims 1 and 2
      will comprise the formative phase of the proposed study. Aim 1 will consist of
      semi-structured interviews with 2 staff members at each of 3 city and county health clinics,
      3 community-based organizations, and 3 emergency rooms to identify effective settings for
      intervention. Aim 2 will consist of semi-structured interviews with 10 +BMSM-LC and 10 HIV+
      Black men who have sex with men who remain in care to develop intervention content. Findings
      from these semi-structured interviews and Aim 1 will be used to develop a preliminary
      intervention protocol that will be refined across 2 sets of 3 sequential, single-subject
      iterations of the intervention sampled by age (n=3 for ages 18 to 29 years, n =3 for ages 30
      and up). For Aim 3, a pilot study of 18 +BMSM-LC purposively sampled by age will assess
      acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary outcomes of BMC for re-engaging +BMSM-LC in care.
      The research and career development activities of this K23 proposal will allow the PI to
      achieve the goal of becoming an independent, R01-funded investigator. The PI will gain a
      broad range of critical skills (e.g., intervention development; qualitative research methods;
      trial design, safety monitoring, and process and outcome evaluation) and experiences to
      address the health needs of vulnerable populations at greatest risk of morbidity and
      mortality.

    <description>The measure assesses participants' satisfaction with the intervention. Response options range from 1 (a lower degree of satisfaction) to 4 (a higher degree of satisfaction), and the mean of the eight items will be calculated to yield an overall score. Higher values indicated greater satisfaction.</description>
