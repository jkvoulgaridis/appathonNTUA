      The best renal replacement therapy is kidney transplantation. It improves end-stage renal
      kidney disease (ESRD) patients quality of life and increases their survival, but still
      remains risky. Morbidity in kidney transplantation is dominated by two main complications :
      acute graft rejection and infections. To maintain an accurate balance between rejection and
      infection, immunosuppressive therapy must to be used with caution and kept into a tight
      spectrum.

      The investigators dispose of a new test measuring interferon gamma production after T cells
      and Natural Killers (NK) in vitro stimulation : QuantiFERON Monitor® (QFM). They hypothesized
      QFM monitoring could improve management after kidney transplantation providing functional
      immune data to optimize balance between rejection and infection.

      The investigators aim to assess whether QFM could be an objective biomarker to predict
      infection and rejection risks after kidney transplantation.

      The best renal replacement therapy is kidney transplantation. It improves end-stage renal
      kidney disease (ESRD) patients quality of life and increases their survival, but still
      remains risky. Morbidity in kidney transplantation is dominated by two main complications :
      acute graft rejection and infections. According to literature, acute rejection appears in
      more than 10% of kidney graft recipients. The first month after transplantation is frequently
      affected by bacterial infections such as pneumopathies (4.5 to 16%), urinary tract infections
      (22.7 to 56.7 %), surgical site infections (7.3 to 18.5%) and bacteremia (3.5 to 4.6%). Then,
      during the first year, infections, most of them opportunist ones, are essentially due to
      cytomegalovirus (8%), BK virus (most than 10%) and herpes simplex reactivation (most than
      50%). Those immunosuppressed patients can also develop community acquired infections :
      respiratory tract infections (flu or bacterial pneumonias) or urinary tract infections.
      Therefore, long-term anticalcineurin use can lead to chronic graft dysfunction. To maintain
      an accurate balance between rejection and infection, immunosuppressive therapy must to be
      used with caution and kept into a tight spectrum. To guide physicians maintaining this
      balance, therapeutic drug monitoring is performed in routine.

      An objective marker for cellular immune response, based on cellular immunodeficiency status
      specific for each patient could, guide a personalized immunosuppressive treatment. The
      investigators now dispose of a new test measuring interferon gamma production after T cells
      and Natural Killers (NK) in vitro stimulation : QuantiFERON Monitor® (QFM). They hypothesized
      QFM monitoring could improve management after kidney transplantation providing functional

      They aim to assess whether QFM could be an objective biomarker to predict infection and
      rejection risks after kidney transplantation.

      The investigators plan to perform a monocentric interventional prospective study. They will
      dose QFM at D0, before patients discharge (between D7 and D21), M3 and M6 after kidney
      transplantation. Patients will be followed up to 24 months.

      Their primary endpoint will be non specific cellular immunity evaluation after kidney
      transplantation using serial measurements of QFM. Their secondary endpoints will be : (i)
      correlate QFM levels with infectious risk, (ii) and with graft rejection, (iii) correlate QFM
      levels with lymphocytes sub-populations monitoring.
