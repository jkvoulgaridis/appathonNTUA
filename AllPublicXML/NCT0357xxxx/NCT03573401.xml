  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to test the safety and efficacy of photodynamic therapy (PDT) with
      the medication Ameluz® performed with the PDT-lamp BF-RhodoLED® in comparison to the
      respective placebo treatment for superficial basal cell carcinoma (BCC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted as randomized, double blind and vehicle-controlled ( 4:1 ratio of
      verum (BF-200 ALA; Ameluz®) to vehicle (placebo)) clinical trial at 15 sites in the United
      States of America (US). Each site should randomize between 10 and 20 subjects.

      Each subject will complete a clinical observation period that will last for up to 7 months
      (up to 4 weeks screening and pre-randomization period, and up to 6 months clinical
      observation period) followed by a 5-year follow-up (FU) period after the completion of the
      first PDT cycle.

      The treatment of superficial BCC lesion(s) comprises of up to two PDT cycles each with two
      PDT sessions one to two weeks apart of each other. 12 weeks after the first PDT of the first
      cycle lesion(s) will be assessed clinically and only subjects with remaining BCC lesion(s)
      will be retreated in the second PDT cycle starting the same day. For clinically completely
      cleared subjects the clinical observation period of the study will end and these subjects
      will enter the FU part of the study.

      For each subject a Main Target Lesion will be defined that will be excised either 12 weeks
      after the first PDT of the first cycle, if clinically cleared, or at the end of the clinical
      observation period in order to histologically confirm the clinical assessment. Additional
      Target Lesions will be assessed clinically, only. Randomization will be stratified by the
      number of lesions (1 vs ≥2 Lesion(s)).

      Definitions of complete responders comprise of:

        1. Complete response of the Main Target Lesion which is assessed 12 weeks after the start
           of the last PDT cycle that included treatment of the Main Target Lesion and is defined
           as a Main Target Lesion that is completely clinically and histologically cleared.

        2. In general, clinically complete responders are categorized 12 weeks after the start of
           the last PDT cycle according to clinical assessment only and are defined as subjects
           with all lesions (Main plus Additional Target Lesions) clinically cleared.

      Verum and vehicle are indistinguishable. However, treatment is accompanied with typical
      adverse events (AEs). In order to guarantee the blind status of the investigator assessing
      efficacy after each PDT cycle, a second investigator or delegated person will perform drug
      application and light treatment as well as all safety evaluations at visits where PDT is
      applied and during the phone call 1 week after each PDT cycle, respectively. Both
      investigators (delegated person(s)) are not entitled to exchange information about the study
      outcome and side effects.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Willingness and ability to sign the informed consent form and Health Insurance
             Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) form. A study-specific informed consent
             form and a HIPAA form must be obtained in writing for all subjects prior to starting
             any study procedures.

          -  Men or women ≥18 years of age.

          -  Presence of ≥1 naïve sBCC lesion in the treatment areas face/forehead, bald scalp,
             extremities and/or neck/trunk, all of which are, according to the clinical judgement
             of the investigator, likely to be histologically confirmed as sBCCs. Lesions should
             not be within the embryonic fusion planes (H-zone), especially within 2 cm of the hair
             zone or on the ears. In case of multiple lesions, one lesion is defined as Main Target
             Lesion which will be excised at the end of the clinical observation period. Only
             eligible naïve sBCCs, confirmed by histology taken at screening, are allowed to be
             included in the study as Main or Additional Target Lesions. Thus, eligible sBCCs must
             lack any histological evidence of aggressive growth patterns (e.g. severe squamous
             metaplasia, infiltrative/desmoplastic features or basosquamous features). BCCs
             assessed as non-naïve (e.g. previously treated or recurrent) or non-eligible by biopsy
             taken at screening (and in a distance &gt;5 cm from the next lesion included in the
             study) should be excised by surgery or removed by cryotherapy in a timely manner.
             Other treatments for these lesions are not allowed during the study.

          -  The diameter of each eligible lesion should be ≥ 0.6 cm, and the entire treatment
             field must not exceed ~20 cm². The treatment field is defined as the field to which
             IMP is applied, usually including the target lesions and margins surrounding the
             lesions of up to 1 cm. For the Main Target Lesion, the maximal lesion size should be
             such that surgical excision without a skin transplant is feasible according to the
             investigator's judgement.

          -  Target BCC lesions must be discrete and located within 1-2 illumination areas (the
             illumination area is defined by the effective illumination area of the BF-RhodoLED®
             device with approximately 6 x 16 cm).

          -  Willingness to receive up to 4 PDTs within 3.5 months and excision of the Main Target
             Lesion either at Visit 5, if clinically cleared, or at the end of the clinical
             observation period 12 weeks after the start of the last PDT cycle (Visit 8),
             irrespective of whether the treated Main Target Lesion was clinically cleared or not.

          -  Free of significant physical abnormalities (e.g. tattoos, dermatoses) within the
             potential treatment field plus a 5 cm radius surrounding the target lesion(s) as they
             may interfere with examination or final evaluation.

          -  Willingness to stop the use of moisturizers and any other cosmetics within the
             treatment field plus a 5 cm radius surrounding the target lesion(s) 48 hours prior to
             an office visit and 48 hours after each PDT session. Sunscreen will be allowed, but
             should not be applied to the treatment field plus the 5 cm radius surrounding the
             target lesion(s) within approximately 24 h prior to a clinical visit.

          -  Acceptance to abstain from extensive sunbathing and the use of a solarium during the
             clinical observation period. Subjects with sunburn within treatment areas cannot be
             included until fully recovered.

          -  Healthy subjects and subjects with clinically stable medical conditions, including,
             but not limited to controlled hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II,
             hypercholesterolemia, and osteoarthritis, will be permitted to be included in the
             study if their medication is not prohibited by this protocol.

          -  Women of childbearing potential are permitted to participate in this study only if
             they have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening and are willing to use a highly
             effective method of contraception during the clinical observation period of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of hypersensitivity to 5-ALA or any ingredient of BF-200 ALA which includes
             soybean phosphatidylcholine.

          -  Hypersensitivity to porphyrins.

          -  Current treatment with immunosuppression therapy.

          -  Presence of photodermatoses.

          -  Presence of porphyria.

          -  Presence of clinically significant inherited or acquired coagulation defect.

          -  Evidence of clinically significant (CS) unstable medical conditions, such as:

               -  Metastatic tumor or tumor with high probability of metastasis.

               -  Cardiovascular disease class III, IV (New York Heart Association [NYHA]).

               -  Immunosuppressive condition.

               -  Hematologic, hepatic, renal, neurologic, or endocrine condition.

               -  Collagen-vascular condition.

               -  Gastrointestinal condition.

          -  Clinically relevant cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, neurologic, endocrine, or other
             major systemic diseases that complicate implementation of the protocol or
             interpretation of the study results.

          -  Gorlin Syndrome or Xeroderma pigmentosum.

          -  Presence and/or physical treatment of skin tumors other than (naïve) sBCC (e.g.
             malignant melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), Bowen's disease, aggressive BCC or
             nBCC diagnosed at the screening visit by clinical assessment) within a distance of ≤ 5
             cm from the nearest target lesion within 4 weeks prior to PDT (Visit 2) until the end
             of the clinical observation period. However, biopsied lesion(s) that were not
             confirmed eligible at screening and which are located at a distance of &gt; 5 cm from any
             lesion(s) that will be included in the study can be surgically removed. Treatment by
             PDT or topical medication during the course of the clinical observation period of the
             study triggers exclusion of the subject.

          -  If lesion(s) are assessed as non-eligible by biopsy during initial screening and these
             lesions are localized within a distance of 5 cm from an otherwise suitable lesion,
             this suitable lesion must be excluded from the study.

          -  Αny AK lesions within the treatment field (lesion area including margin of 0.5 to 1.0
             cm).

          -  Any topical medical treatment of AK, other non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSC), or
             melanoma (except for IMP treatment of the target lesion(s)) starting 12 weeks prior to
             Visit 2 (PDT-1) and lasting until the end of the clinical observation period.

          -  Any other topical medical treatment of the skin 12 weeks prior to Visit 2 (PDT-1)
             until the end of the clinical observation period, with the exception of:

               -  Topical treatments with corticosteroids (allowed throughout the clinical
                  observation period of the study).

               -  Topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs such as diclofenac)
                  (allowed throughout the clinical observation period of the study with the
                  restriction of 7 days prior to and 7 days after PDTs).

          -  Start of intake of medication with hypericin or systemically acting drugs with
             phototoxic or photoallergic potential within 8 weeks prior to screening.

          -  Any of the systemic treatments listed below, within the designated period prior to PDT
             and during the clinical observation period.
