    <time_frame>Maximum of 1 year 4 months (From 1-July-2015 to 30-November-2016)</time_frame>
    <description>Event rate was defined as number of events divided by 100 participant-years. Hemorrhagic stroke, ischemic stroke and systemic embolism requiring hospitalization identified using hospital claims which had hemorrhagic, ischemic stroke or systemic embolism Korean standard classification of diseases (KCD) code, whichever came first (first occurred event used). KCD code: hemorrhagic stroke = I60-62, I690-692; ischemic stroke = G459, I63, I693; systemic embolism = I74. Hospitalization and brain CT/MRI codes were used for ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke.Hospitalization and any CT/MRI codes were used for systemic embolism. Index date = the first prescription date of study drugs during intake duration. Participants were identified as NOAC user or Warfarin user depending on the date when they first used NOAC or Warfarin during intake duration.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Data was retrieved from Korean Health Insurance Review &amp; Assessment Service (HIRA) database, of participants who were diagnosed with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) from 1-January-2007 up to and including index date, who newly initiated non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs), warfarin or used aspirin during intake duration.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>It is a retrospective, observational study. Index date: first prescription date of study drugs during intake duration. Intake period: between 1-July-2015 to 30-November-2016. Inverse probability of treatment weighted (IPTW) method was used to analyze outcome measures to balance participant’s characteristics among reporting arms.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Event rate was defined as number of events divided by 100 participant-years for first occurrence of systemic embolism. Systemic embolism requiring hospitalization was identified using hospital claims which had systemic embolism KCD code = I74. For systemic embolism, hospitalization and any CT or MRI codes was used. Index date= the first prescription date of study drugs during intake duration.</description>

        <description>Event rate was defined as number of events divided by 100 participant-years for first occurrence of intracranial hemorrhage events after index date was reported. Intracranial hemorrhage requiring hospitalization was identified using hospital claims which had an intracranial hemorrhage KCD code (I60, I61, I62, I690, I691, I692, S064, S065, S066, and S068) and brain CT or MRI codes. Index date = the first prescription date of study drugs during intake duration. Participants were identified as NOAC user or Warfarin user depending on the date when they first used NOAC or Warfarin during intake duration.</description>

            <groups_desc>Cox proportional hazards model was used to compare event rates between the treatment groups. To check the proportional hazards assumption, the graphical methods and statistical tests using the time-dependent covariate were used. If there were evidence of violation in the proportional hazards assumption in graphical methods, the statistical tests were used and if the evidence of assumption violation still existed, the value of HR at year 1 as an extended Cox model was used.</groups_desc>
