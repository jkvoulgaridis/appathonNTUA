  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is the second cause of death and third of disability in the adult population, By 2020
      it is projected like the fourth cause of disability-adjusted life year (DALY) and by 2030 it
      is estimated that it will lead the global burden of morbidity from chronic noncommunicable
      diseases. As a consequence of stroke, patients show a certain degree of dependence and spend
      most of their time with a caregiver, especially since the subacute phase of the stroke. 80%
      of patients who survive have motor problems. The proper care during the first three months
      will significantly improve until 95% the patient rehabilitation. Caregivers have reported the
      need for information about clinical, prevention and treatment of stroke, like information
      about specific tasks of patient care, mobilizations, exercises, etc. Therefore, it is
      necessary to train and educate the caregivers in physical aspects of care, recovery and
      secondary prevention. However, oversaturated health systems, insufficient number of
      specialists, social inequity, limited coverage and speed of access to health services are
      factors that make difficult to educate caregivers. Studies have demonstrated that the
      Information Technology applied to health is a promising solution to educate and empower the
      patient, carer and family. For instance, the use of educational videos to improve the level
      of practice or knowledge of patients with chronic pain and chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease. This project aims to evaluate the efficacy of the use of educational videos for
      caregivers of patients in subacute phase of stroke through of the change of the level of
      practice, knowledge and satisfaction.

      Sample size A sample size of 10 participants, it is possible to detect minimum differences of
      10% to 20%, with standard deviations of 5% to 10%.

      Statistical analysis plan The data collected will be entered into a database in Microsoft
      Excel, to be analyzed by the Epi Info statistical program. The qualitative variables will be
      analyzed by frequencies and percentages, the quantitative variables by arithmetic mean and
      standard deviation, some of them categorized for its interpretation. The bivariate analysis
      between two qualitative variables will be carried out using Fisher's exact test, the analysis
      between a qualitative variable and a quantitative one will be carried out through the
      Mann-Whitney U tests (non-normal distribution) and Student's t test (normal distribution).
      After the intervention, the level of practice and knowledge of the caregivers on the basic
      management of patients in the subacute phase of the stroke will generate a variable called
      &quot;change of score&quot;, whose p-value should be less than 0.05.

      Plan for missing data Due to the characteristics of the intervention, the investigators do
      not expect much loss to follow up patients after recruitment. However, all missing data will
      be reported as such.

    <intervention_model_description>Pre-experimental study design The level of practice and knowledge of the caregiver will be evaluated according to the video(s) corresponding to the session. Patient participation is expected for the evaluation of the caregiver's level of practice. After thirty minutes of use of the video, the level of practice and knowledge of the caregiver will be evaluated again for the same video. In each session this methodology will continue until the eighth video. At the end of all the videos, the level of satisfaction of the caregivers in relation to the videos will be evaluated.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>Before and after 30 minutes of watching each video the participant will be evaluated. This method will be used for the 8 videos developed. Therefore, there will be a change in the practice level.</time_frame>
    <description>We will use the &quot;evaluation form of the practice level&quot;, a check list with items that the caregiver should perform for the 8 activities represented in the 8 videos, for each activity a minimum of 4 items and a maximum of 9 items will be evaluated. The number of items for each activity is summed, so the total number of items is 49. Therefore, the minimum score is 0% (the caregiver performed 0% of items) and the maximum score is 100% (the caregiver performed 100% of items). The higher percentage represents a better result. This instrument will be review for experts, so the number of items could change.</description>

    <time_frame>Before and after 30 minutes of watching each video, the participant will be evaluated. This method will be used for the 8 videos developed. Therefore, there will be a change in the knowledge level.</time_frame>
    <description>We will use the &quot;evaluation form of the knowledge level&quot;, which was designed for the study, a questionnaire with one-answer questions related to 8 activities represented in the 8 videos, for each activity a minimum of 2 questions and a maximum of 4 questions will be evaluated. The number of questions for each activity is summed, so the total number of questions is 25. Therefore, the minimum score is 0% (the caregiver answered correctly 0% of questions) and the maximum score is 100% (the caregiver answered correctly 100% of questions). The higher percentage represents a better result. This instrument will be review for experts, so the number of questions could change.</description>

    <measure>Satisfaction level</measure>
    <time_frame>After of watching all the videos, the participant will be evaluated. Minimum 1 video and maximum 3 videos will be evaluated per day. Therefore, minimum 3 days and maximum 8 days will be needed. The days will not be necessarily followed.</time_frame>
    <description>We will use the &quot;evaluation form of the satisfaction level&quot;, which was designed for the study, a questionnaire with 3 questions of Likert scale and 2 opened questions related to the 8 videos. Therefore, the results will be reported according to each question. This instrument will be review for experts, so this could change.</description>
