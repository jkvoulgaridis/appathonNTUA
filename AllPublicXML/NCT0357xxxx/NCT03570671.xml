  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With regard to the characteristics of spasm segment, had been clearly described by other
      invasive imaging methods including intravascular ultrasound and optical coherence tomography.
      However, there is potential risk during these invasive procedures, such as severe myocardial
      ischemia or fatal arrhythmia.

      Presently available imaging test for coronary artery disease in multi detector-row computed
      tomography angiography (MDCTA) evaluation has high diagnostic accuracy to evaluate coronary
      artery stenosis. However, previous report assessing imaging findings or diagnostic accuracy
      of MDCTA in patients with vasospastic angina (VSA) is lacking.

  <detailed_description>

      Previously investigators analyzed the characteristics of coronary spasm segment in an
      observational individual dataset, suspected VSA patients (n=20) underwent dual-acquisition of
      MDCTA (initial and intravenous nitrate injected CT imaging), the diagnostic accuracy showed
      sensitivity: 73%, specificity: 100%, positive predictive value: 100%, and negative predictive
      value: 56%.

      Further study is necessary because previous analysis presented limited sample size and
      deficiency of healthy control.

      Therefore, investigators hypothesis that dual-acquisition of MDCTA in noninvasive tool for
      coronary assessment provide more information of coronary characteristics, and the diagnostic
      efficacy would be non-inferior as compared with the invasive coronary imaging modality in
      coronary spasm-induced angina attacks.

    <description>MDCTA procedure: all subjects will undergo MDCTA without a vasodilator (&quot;initial CT&quot;) in the early morning before the ergonovine provocation spasm test. Subsequent &quot;IV nitrate CT&quot; will be allowed at a 3-day washout period after the first contrast usage. The scan protocol for the IV nitrate CT is as follows: during continuous injection of the intravenous vasodilating agent (isosorbidedinitrate 2 mg/hr), blood pressure will be checked every 2 minutes. When both the systolic and diastolic blood pressure decrease by 10 mmHg in comparison to the initial value, the CT scan initiate and images will be acquired during the nitrate infusion.
Investigators define the positive criteria for VSA on MDCTA as follows:
Significant stenosis (≥ 50%) with negative remodeling but no definite evidence of plaques, which completely dilated on IV nitrate CT, or
Diffuse small diameter (&lt; 2mm) of a major coronary artery with beaded appearance which completely dilated on IV nitrate CT.</description>
