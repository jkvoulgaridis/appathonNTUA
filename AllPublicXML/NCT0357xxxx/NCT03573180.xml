    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the prevalence of dental caries using CAST index among a
      group of Egyptian children in primary dentition stage.

      Egyptian children aging from three to six years old attending the Outpatients' Clinic of both
      of Pediatric Dentistry Department, Faculty of Dentistry, Misr University for Science and
      Technology and the Pediatric Dentistry and Dental Public Health Department, Faculty of
      Dentistry, Cairo University will be examined using Caries Assessment Spectrum and Treatment

      -  A custom made examination chart (Appendix 1) will be filled for each child including
           date, name, age, address, gender, medical history and any previous dental treatment.
           Parents' data includes: level of education and oral hygiene level.

        -  Prior to performing dental examination, the child will be asked to rinse his mouth with
           tap water and the teeth will be cleaned with cotton.

        -  The examiner will carefully inspect all surfaces of the teeth.

        -  All the primary teeth will be evaluated using CAST index as shown in Table 1.

        -  Each child will be given two printed sheets translated into Arabic, of his diagnosed
           caries status, the oral hygiene measures needed to inform the parents about the oral
           health status and how to keep good oral health and to indicate the need for treatment
           for children diagnosed with dental caries, and dietary bad habits that should be avoided
           to prevent caries occurrence.
