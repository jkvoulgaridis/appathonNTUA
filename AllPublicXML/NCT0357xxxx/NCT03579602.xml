  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many types of cancer are primarily treated with surgery and patient survival is directly
      related to the extent to which the tumor is able to be removed. It is often difficult for
      surgeons to distinguish tumor tissue from normal tissue or to detect tumor cells that have
      spread from the original tumor site, resulting in incomplete removal of the tumor and reduced
      patient survival. In some sites, such as the brain, it is critical to avoid damage to normal
      tissue around the tumor to prevent adverse effects of surgery on function. Tozuleristide is a
      drug that is thought to attach to tumor tissue and then fluoresces (glows) when a special
      light from the Canvas is shined on it. It is hypothesized that tozuleristide, when imaged
      with the Canvas, will improve surgical outcomes by allowing surgeons to visualize the edges
      of the tumor or other ambiguous tissue in real-time as they operate. The purpose of this
      study is to evaluate how well tozuleristide imaged with Canvas work at helping to distinguish
      between tumor and normal tissue during surgery in pediatric primary central nervous system
      tumors.

      Subjects who provide voluntary written informed consent, or have it provided by their legally
      acceptable representative, will be screened for eligibility. Subjects meeting all of the
      inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be eligible to participate.

      Surgical excision will occur at least 1 hour and no more than 36 hours after tozuleristide
      administration. Surgery will be performed by a neurosurgeon and the Canvas will be operated
      by a designated Imaging Operator. Fluorescence of tumor and ambiguous tissue during surgery
      will be assessed and scored. Biopsy samples of these tumor and ambiguous tissues will be
      collected for pathology analysis.

      All subjects will be monitored for safety during their participation in the study.

                  half-lives since last administration of monoclonal antibodies)

               4. Immunotherapy: at least 42 days after completion of any cellular immunotherapy,
                  such as CAR-T cell therapy

               5. Prior surgery for CNS tumors is allowed

               6. Prior tozuleristide: at least 1 week after prior dose of tozuleristide if

          6. Written informed consent must be obtained from the subject or parent or legal guardian
             prior to the conduct of study activities. Routine clinical tests, e.g., MRI, clinical
             laboratory studies, may be used for screening requirements. Assent, when appropriate,
             will be obtained according to institutional guidelines.

          7. The risks of treatment with tozuleristide during pregnancy have not been evaluated.
             Female subjects of child-bearing potential must agree not to attempt to become
             pregnant or undergo in vitro fertilization and, if participating in sexual activity
             that could lead to pregnancy, must use 2 reliable methods of contraception
             simultaneously for 30 days after surgery. Male subjects must agree not to attempt to
             father a child and, if participating in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy,
             must use 2 reliable methods of contraception simultaneously for 30 days after surgery

             potential must agree to use 2 effective forms of contraception from the time of
             enrollment until 30 days post-surgery

          2. Subjects with on-going serious medical conditions (poorly controlled asthma, diabetes,
             heart disease) such that participation in the study could put the subject at increased
             risk of worsening their condition

          3. Subjects planned to undergo only a diagnostic biopsy procedure, without intent to
             resect tissue for therapeutic purposes (e.g., stereotactic pontine biopsy)

          4. Subjects who in the opinion of the investigator are not willing or able to comply with
             randomization procedures or other study-required study procedures and observations.
