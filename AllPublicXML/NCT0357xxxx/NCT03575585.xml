  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prior research has shown that many individuals with substance use disorders engage in
      HIV/sexual risk behaviors, and could strongly benefit from HIV prevention interventions that
      were delivered as part of their substance abuse treatment. However, discussions about sexual
      risk are not occurring at an appropriate frequency in treatment settings. This project will
      test the effects of counselor training and coaching, combined with a brief assessment and
      feedback tool, on counselor-patient communication about sex and on patient sexual risk
      behavior.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a 2 x 2 nested factorial design clinical trial. Counselors were randomized to 1) Standard training [2 hours on using a BEST feedback report] or 2) Enhanced training [Standard + 8 hours on discussing sexual risk with patients + monthly coaching]. Patients of participating counselors completed the BEST assessment and were randomized to receive no feedback or a personalized BEST feedback report, and were followed up at 3-, and 6-months (patients). Counselors were assessed at baseline, post-training and 3-months.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The Condom Barriers Scale (CBS) (Doyle, Calsyn &amp; Ball, 2009; St. Lawrence et al., 1999) completed by patient participants is a self-report instrument consisting of 29 items worded as short statements and rated by participants on a 5-point Likert-type scale from 1 (strongly agree) to 5 (strongly disagree). Items reflect attitudes about condoms, which may act as barriers towards condom use. Scores are obtained on four conceptual domains: Partner Barriers (8 items), Effects on Sexual Experience (7 items), Access/Availability (8 items), and Motivational Barriers (6 items) and Total Score.</description>

    <measure>Patient HIV transmission knowledge</measure>

    <description>Patients' HIV knowledge was assessed via self-report using the 18-item HIV Knowledge Questionnaire (HIV-KQ-18: Carey &amp; Schroder, 2002). Items, such as &quot;A woman can get HIV if she has anal sex with a man,&quot; are answered &quot;true,&quot; &quot;false,&quot; or &quot;don't know.&quot; Scores range from zero to 18.</description>

    <measure>Patient risk reduction activities</measure>
    <time_frame>3- and 6-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Self-report of engagement in lifestyle risk reduction activities in the 90 days prior to 3- and 6-month follow-up, assessed via the Lifestyle Enhancement Survey. The Lifestyle Enhancement Survey (Calsyn, unpublished), was designed to assess the degree to which patient participants were using strategies to avoid sexual risk and to disentangle their sexual behavior from substance use. Originally designed for a prior pilot study, the version used for this study was modified to align with suggestions included in the Personalized Feedback Report.</description>

    <measure>Counselor sexual attitudes</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 1-week post-training and 3-months</time_frame>
    <description>To assess change in counselor sexual attitudes, we used 20 items of the 25-item Sexual Attitude Scale (Hudson, Murphy &amp; Nurius, 1983), an instrument intended to measure the extent to which a participant &quot;adheres to a liberal or a conservative orientation toward human sexual expression&quot; (Hudson et al., 1983, pp. 258). On a 5-point scales, ranging from &quot;Strongly Disagree&quot; to &quot;Strongly Agree,&quot; participants rate items, such as &quot;I think there is too much sexual freedom given to adults these days.&quot; To reduce participant burden, we abbreviated the scale, removing 5 of 20 items. Two additional items were slightly revised to update language.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Counselor self-efficacy for discussing sex</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 1-week post-training and 3-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Sexual Intervention Self-Efficacy Scale (Miller &amp; Byers, 2008) used 16 items via 4 subscales: Comfort/Bias Self-Efficacy (4 items; e.g., I will be able to treat clients with sexual problems even when I don't necessarily agree with their decisions/actions), Skill Self-Efficacy (5 items; e.g., I am unfamiliar with the techniques used to intervene with individuals who have sexual concerns/problems), and Confidence in Ability to Relay Accurate Information (7 items; e.g., I am confident that I can relay accurate information to clients about sexual orientation/identity issues). We also included 3 of 4 items from Miller &amp; Byers (2008; 2012) Willingness to Treat Sexual Issues Scale (e.g., If a couple told me that they were having a sexual problem I would refer them to another clinician). Items were on a 6-point scale (&quot;Strongly Disagree&quot; to &quot;Strongly Agree&quot;). Total scale score equaled the mean of all items. Scoring (after some item reversal) is toward greater self-efficacy.</description>

    <ipd_description>The investigative team will make available copies of the BEST survey items, pseudocode for the BEST feedback report, and the counselor training curriculum to other researchers wanting to evaluate their usefulness. Data for this project will consist of quantitative data from patient and counselor assessments. We plan to make the data available to other researchers using two data sharing methods suggested by the NIH Data Sharing Policy brochure. First, we plan to publish information on processes and findings in a timely manner in appropriate peer- reviewed journals that are available online or through requests for copies made directly to the author(s). We will also respond to data requests made directly to the Principal Investigators by removing all identifying information from the data and making them available on a CD-ROM or by posting them on a secure web site. These data will be available at the end of the project after our primary outcome paper is published.</ipd_description>
