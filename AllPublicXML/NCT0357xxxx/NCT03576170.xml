  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent decades, following an increased longevity in Hong Kong, there is a drastic increase
      in the prevalence chronic conditions, including dementia. Behavioral and psychological
      symptoms of dementia (BDSP) seem to be the main reasons of suffering for many older adults.
      This condition does not only pose a burden to the whole family but also the healthcare
      system.

      While conventional treatment of BPSD using pharmacotherapy and non-pharmacological treatments
      has been effective for managing symptoms, owing to the adverse side effects caused by
      anti-psychotic drugs and the short effective period incurred by non-pharmacological
      interventions, development of alternative and non-pharmacological approaches for the
      management of behavioral disturbances and pain is of urgent need. Research has shown that
      aromatherapy (both administered through inhalation and therapeutic massage) has been
      effective in reducing behavioral disturbances of dementia patients. These findings support
      the premise that aromatherapy and the investigators hope to provide further evidence to
      support the use of aromatherapy as an evidence-based mainstream intervention for reducing
      behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD).

      Whilst there is sufficient evidence to support the effectiveness of aromatherapy, few studies
      compared the effectiveness of the use of aromatherapy by inhalation and/or therapeutic
      massage. The investigators aim to address the above research gaps on the clinical application
      of aromatherapy on BPSD, with a focus on comparing the differential effectiveness between
      administration by inhalation and administration by therapeutic massage. The proposed research
      aims to (1) test the efficacy and effectiveness of aromatherapy on the symptom management of
      BPSD in older adults; (2) compare the effects of aromatherapy-scent (i.e., inhalation) and
      aromatherapy-touch (i.e., therapeutic massage) in older adults with BPSD. This study also
      explores the benefits of aromatherapy on cognitive functioning, functional performance and
      social engagement as secondary outcomes.

      A randomized, controlled, and single blinded trial is proposed. 120 older adults with BPSD
      will be randomly assigned to aroma inhalation (intervention), aroma-touch or wait-list
      (control) treatments. The primary outcomes measured are a caregiver-rated inventory of
      agitated behaviors and abnormalities of mood and psychotic phenomenal, cognitive functioning,
      functional performance and social engagement (secondary outcome) will be assessed three time
      points the study hypotheses are supported, the findings will provide empirical support for a
      treatment option that could improve psychological well-being and also improve cognitive
      functioning, functional performance, and social engagement of older adults.

    <measure>Chinese Version of the Cohen- Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 2-months after intervention and after the completion of the intervention in four months</time_frame>
    <description>It is a care-giver rated inventory to assess agitation in elderly persons and records the frequency of occurrence of BDSP at different period of time and thus can be used for assessing the changes among three times points (baseline, 2-months after intervention and after the completion of the intervention) in four months. It includes descriptions of 29 agitated behaviors, and each is rated on a 7-point scale of frequency. The total scores range from 29 points to 203 points, a higher score of CMAI indicates more frequent agitation behaviors.</description>

    <measure>Chinese Version of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 2-months after intervention and after the completion of the intervention in four months</time_frame>
    <description>It is used to assess the changes of the abnormalities of mood and psychotic phenomena among three times points (baseline, 2-months after intervention and after the completion of the intervention) in four months. If the response to the domain question is &quot;No&quot;, the informant goes to the next question. If &quot;Yes&quot;, the informant then rates both the Severity of the symptoms present within the last month on a 3-point scale and the associated impact of the symptom manifestations on them (i.e. Caregiver Distress) using a 5-point scale. The NPI-Q provides symptom Severity and Distress ratings for each symptom), and total Severity and Distress scores reflecting the sum of individual domain scores ranging from 0 to 36 and ranging from 0 to 60 respectively.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline, 2-months after intervention and after the completion of the intervention in four months</time_frame>
    <description>Cantonese Version of Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE) is a brief 30-point questionnaire used to assess the change of the cognitive functions among three time points (baseline, 2-months after intervention and after the completion of the intervention) in four months. The range of the score is from 0 point to 30 points, which a lower score indicates the worse cognitive functions.</description>

    <description>Chinese Version of the Barthel Index-100 is used to measure the change of the performance in activities of daily living (ADL) among three time points (baseline, 2-months after intervention and after the completion of the intervention) in four months. Scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating greater independence.

    <description>The change of the social engagement among three time points (baseline, 2-months after intervention and after the completion of the intervention) in four months will be measured using the 6-item index of social engagement (ISE). Total scores on the ISE can range from 0 to 6, with a higher score indicating a higher level of social engagement.</description>
