  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is increasing interest in the effects of various food derived polyphenols on
      cardiovascular health. Several studies have demonstrated improvements in vascular function
      after intake of polyphenol rich foods. The objective of this study is to investigate the
      association between polyphenol microbiota metabolism and cardiovascular health.

      The participants (n=250) with age range between 20 to 70 years old health overweight men and
      women. The participants will consume a polyphenol rich breakfast for three days (consisting
      on milled flaxseed, raspberry powder and soy milk). The participants will provide the
      investigators with urine and blood samples for polyphenol analysis. Cardiovascular
      measurements such as PWV, AIx, Blood Pressure and FMD will be performed at baseline and after
      72h.
