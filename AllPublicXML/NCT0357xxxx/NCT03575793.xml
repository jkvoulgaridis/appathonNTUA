    <textblock>
      This is an open-label Phase I/II study, with a dose escalation part (Phase I) and a 2-arm
      randomized part (Phase II), in patients with recurrent SCLC.

      In the Phase I part, patients will receive plinabulin at escalating doses in combination with
      nivolumab and ipilimumab. Doses of study drug will be administered as intravenous (IV)
      infusions in 21 day cycles. Patients will receive all study drugs on Day 1 of each cycle.
      After 4 treatment cycles, ipilimumab is stopped and patients continue treatment with
      nivolumab and plinabulin every 2 weeks (maintenance period) or until disease progression,
      development of unacceptable toxicity or one of the protocol-defined reasons for treatment
      discontinuation occurs.

      At least 3 patients will be enrolled in each cohort, starting at 20 mg/m2 of plinabulin. The
      dose of plinabulin will be escalated in sequential patient cohorts after the safety data from
      the first cycle is reviewed. Thereafter the dose of plinabulin will be escalated to 30 mg/m2,
      provided that dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) are not observed per the specified criteria,
      until the RP2D is determined.

      In the Phase II part, approximately 40 patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive
      either nivolumab + ipilimumab (Arm NI) or the triple combination of plinabulin (at RP2D) +
      nivolumab + ipilimumab (Arm PNI). Patients will continue treatment until disease progression,
      development of unacceptable toxicity or one of the protocol-defined reasons for treatment
      discontinuation occurs.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must have signed and dated written informed consent form in accordance with regulatory

             required to meet eligibility.

          -  Patients who progressed after at least 1 platinum-based chemotherapy regimen. Patients
             with platinum resistance (defined as recurrence or progression of disease within 90
             days of completion of the platinum-based regimen) are eligible.

          -  Measurable disease according to RECIST v1.1 (Section 8) obtained by imaging within 28
             days prior to study registration.

             to initiation of study drugs.

          -  Female patients of childbearing potential have a negative pregnancy test at baseline.
             Females of childbearing potential are defined as sexually mature women without prior
             hysterectomy or who have had any evidence of menses in the past 12 months. However,
             women who have been amenorrheic for 12 or more months are still considered to be of
             childbearing potential if the amenorrhea is possibly due to prior chemotherapy, anti
             estrogens, or ovarian suppression.

               -  Women of childbearing potential (i.e., menstruating women) must have a negative
                  urine pregnancy test (positive urine tests are to be confirmed by serum test)
                  documented within 14 days of study registration and within the 24-hour period
                  prior to the first dose of study drug.

               -  Sexually active women of childbearing potential enrolled in the study must agree
                  to use 2 forms of accepted methods of contraception during the course of the
                  study and for 23 weeks after their last dose of study drug. Effective birth
                  control includes (a) intrauterine device plus 1 barrier method; (b) on stable
                  doses of hormonal contraception for at least 3 months (e.g., oral, injectable,
                  implant, transdermal) plus one barrier method; (c) 2 barrier methods. Effective
                  barrier methods are male or female condoms, diaphragms, and spermicides (creams
                  or gels that contain a chemical to kill sperm); or (d) a vasectomized partner.

               -  For male patients who are sexually active and who are partners of premenopausal
                  women: agreement to use 2 forms of contraception as in criterion 9b above during
                  the treatment period and for 31 weeks after the last dose of study drug.

             ULN if evidence of hepatic involvement by malignant disease)

          -  Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥40
             mL/min/1.73m2

          -  Lipase and Amylase ≤1.5 x ULN. Subjects with Lipase &gt;1.5 x ULN may enroll if there are
             neither clinical nor radiographic signs of a pancreatitis.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Active interstitial lung disease (ILD) or pneumonitis or a history of ILD or
             pneumonitis requiring treatment with steroids

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit

             brain metastases have been treated may participate provided they show radiographic
             stability (defined as 2 brain images obtained after treatment to the brain metastases
             at least 4 weeks apart and show no evidence of intracranial progression)

          -  Known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or active hepatitis B (by surface
             antigen expression or polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) or active hepatitis C (by PCR)

             equivalent) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days prior to
             administration of study drugs.

          -  History of psychiatric illness or social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or
             laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with
             the patient's participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best
             interest of the patient to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

          -  Prior malignancies (except non-melanoma skin cancers, and the following in situ
             cancers: bladder, gastric, colon, endometrial, cervical/dysplasia, melanoma, or

             unstable angina, myocardial infarction, or cardiac symptoms consistent with New York
             Heart Association (NYHA) Class III-IV within 6 months prior to their first dose of
             study drugs.

          -  Evidence of ongoing inadequately controlled hypertension (defined as baseline systolic
             blood pressure &gt;160 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure &gt;100 mmHg).
