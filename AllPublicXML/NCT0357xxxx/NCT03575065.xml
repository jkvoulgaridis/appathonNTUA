      This is a Phase 2, open-label, multi-center study of BGB-290 administered orally (PO) twice
      daily (BID) in adult Chinese patients with advanced HER2(-) breast cancer harboring germline
      BRCA mutation, which have progressed despite standard therapy, or for which no standard
      therapy exists.

               2. ≤ 2 prior lines of chemotherapy in advanced or metastatic setting

               3. Prior platinum therapy allowed as long as no disease progression while on
                  treatment, or if given in neoadjuvant/adjuvant setting with ≥ 6 months from last

                  on at least one endocrine therapy either in adjuvant or metastatic setting, or

             lives, if applicable, whichever is shorter) prior to Day 1 of Cycle 1

          4. Major surgical procedure, open biopsy, or significant traumatic injury ≤ 14 days prior
             to Day 1 of Cycle 1, or anticipation of need for major surgical procedure during the
