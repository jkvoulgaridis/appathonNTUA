  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients receiving intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy for primary immunodeficiency and
      neurologic conditions may experience adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The mechanism of the ADR
      is unknown. Currently, the standard practice for these patients is to change from IV to
      subcutaneous IG (SCIG) but because of the need of immunomodulation or patient preference,
      SCIG may not be an option. Data has shown that some levels of complement decrease from pre-
      to post-infusion of IVIG. This study is to determine if replacing this complement protein may
      ameliorate ADRs.

      This is a single-site, pilot study conducted in the US to determine the benefit of human
      C1-esterase inhibitor [recombinant] (C1-INH-R) therapy to ameliorate ADRs in subjects
      receiving IVIG therapy experience ADRs post-infusion. Subjects who are currently receiving
      IVIG for immunodeficiency or neurologic conditions and experience ADRs will be enrolled.

      In part 1, subjects will continue to receive IVIG for two infusions. Complement proteins will
      be measured pre- and post-infusion. Quality of life and other questionnaires will be
      administered.

      In part 2, subjects will receive C1-INH-R infusion prior to receiving IVIG infusion for three
      infusions. Complement proteins will be measured pre- and post- infusion. Quality of life and
      other questionnaires will be administered.
