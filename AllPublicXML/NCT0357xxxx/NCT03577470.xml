      The purpose of this study is to describe the effectiveness of Darunavir/ Cobicistat/
      Emtricitabine/ Tenofovir Alafenamide (D/C/F/TAF), measured as virological response at Week 48
      as per Food and Drug Administration (FDA) snapshot algorithm through collection of daily
      practice data in the Italian setting.

In the TLOVR dataset, participant responses at a specified threshold of HIV-1 RNA (&lt;50 copies/mL) are determined by using the Food and Drug Administration's TLOVR algorithm. Using the TLOVR algorithm, participants are considered to have failed on therapy if they never achieved confirmed RNA levels below the threshold, if they had confirmed rebound of RNA above the threshold, if they made a non-permitted change in background regimen, or if they permanently discontinued investigational product for any reason.</description>

    <description>The HIV-TSQ is a 10-item self-reported scale that measures overall satisfaction with treatment by specific items that includes current treatment, control, side effects, demands, convenience, flexibility, understanding, lifestyle, recommend to others, continue. The HIV-TSQ items are summed up to produce a treatment satisfaction total score (0 to 60) and an individual satisfaction rating for each item (0 to 6). The higher the score, the greater the improvement in treatment satisfaction as compared to the past few weeks. A smaller score represents a decline in treatment satisfaction compared to the past few weeks. HIV-TSQs will be recorded onto paper forms and will be considered as source data.</description>
