  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of a prostate cancer vaccine named Proscavax
      (Prostate-specific antigen(PSA) / Interleukin-2(IL-2) / Granulocyte-macrophage
      colony-stimulating factor(GM-CSF)) in patients with localized prostate cancer. The goal of
      the study is to determine if vaccine administration results in a change in the rate of
      prostate cancer progression when compared to a no-treatment control group of active
      surveillance patients.

      The researchers are interested in evaluating the proportion of participants with prostate
      cancer progression at 2 years following administration of Proscavax or active surveillance,
      the effect of the vaccine on prostate-specific antigen (PSA) doubling time and the assessment
      of adverse events in these patients.

      Eligible patients in this study will include men who are 18 years and older and who have a
      previously untreated early stage prostate cancer regardless of the date of diagnosis.

      This study will have 2 arms and patients will be randomized 2:1 into the Proscavax treatment
      arm (Arm 1) versus the active surveillance arm (Arm 2).

      In study Arm 1, 6 doses of the vaccine will be administered intradermally at weeks 1, 2, 3,
      7, 11, and 15, followed by maintenance booster injections once every month which will
      alternate between low dose IL-2 alone (at weeks 19, 27 and 35) and Proscavax vaccine (at
      weeks 23, 31, 39) for 6 months.

      In study Arm 2, patients will undergo active surveillance and will not receive any Proscavax
      vaccine treatment.
