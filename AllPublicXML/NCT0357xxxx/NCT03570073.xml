  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the space of a few decades, oocyte cryopreservation has become established in the world of
      reproductive biology with the authorization of oocyte vitrification. This ultra-fast manual
      freezing technique (authorised in France since 2011) is mainly used to preserve oocytes in
      women who have to undergo a treatment that could potentially cause sterility. A clear
      improvement in survival rates since the early stages of slow freezing has been observed with
      vitrification but with fairly heterogeneous results Indeed, manual vitrification remains an
      operator-dependent technique with a long learning curve and which does not allow an oocyte
      survival rate of more than 70-80%.

      The recent marketing of an automatic vitrification machine would make it possible to
      standardise the whole vitrification process from the contact/exchange of fluids to the
      sealing of the units, and thus potentially increase the oocyte survival rate. It seems to be
      in the best interest of women that their ability to conceive be preserved (probably for
      several years) with the technique that offers the best survival and reproducibility rates.

      However, no studies have been conducted to assess the impact of such automation on oocyte
      survival.

      For this reason the investigators wish to set up a comparative study between the routine,
      manual technique, and an automated technique (GAVI system), using immature oocytes, not
      suitable for fertilization, and usually discarded.
