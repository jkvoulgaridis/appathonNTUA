  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ability to distinguish allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT)
      recipients at risk for cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation from those who are not is central
      for optimal CMV management strategies. Measuring this cell mediated immunity has been
      proposed as a potent tool to predict those patients at highest risk of CMV reactivation and
      disease. This study will evaluate the ability of the T-SPOT.CMV test to predict
      Cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation
      (allo-HCT) pediatric recipients.

      Primary Objectives:

      To evaluate feasibility of T-SPOT.CMV spot count test in allo-HCT pediatric recipients.

      To evaluate association of T-SPOT.CMV spot count in the first sample collected after patient
      has engrafted with subsequent CMV reactivation in allo-HCT pediatric recipients.

      Secondary Objectives:

      To evaluate the correlation between T-SPOT.CMV spot count in donors with subsequent recipient
      CMV spot count.

      To explore the relationship between recipient T-SPOT.CMV spot counts and subsequent CMV
      infection related morbidity and treatment outcomes among pediatric all-HCT recipients.

      T-SPOT response will be measured using the results from the T-SPOT.CMV blood test in both HCT
      recipients and HCT donors.

      A blood sample for the T-SPOT.CMV blood test will be collected from the HCT donor prior to
      transplant.

      Blood specimens will be collected for the T-SPOT.CMV blood test from HCT recipients over the
      course of 6 months, starting weekly at Day +1, biweekly starting at Day +45, and monthly
      starting at day +120.

      HCT recipient participant demographic and clinical characteristics will be collected at
      enrollment. Additional clinical information will be abstracted from the HCT recipient
      participants medical record during the study follow-up period. This will include information
      related to transplant history and outcome, infections, antimicrobial exposure, chemotherapy,
      and laboratory values related to infectious diseases and immunosuppression.

      The feasibility of the T-SPOT.CMV spot count test will be evaluated once the first 30
      participants enrolled on study reach day +90. If 75% of patients have at least 1 evaluable
      samples after engraftment (&gt; 75,000 per microtiter wells), we will proceed with enrollment.
      If more &gt;25% of patients have all their samples deemed not evaluable due to insufficient
      mononuclear cell count (&lt;75,000 per microtiter wells) the study will be stopped and concluded
      as not feasible.

    The company that was contracted to conduct study specific testing was sold and new management

    <description>We define the primary endpoint to the T-SPOT CMV count in the first sample collected after patient has engrafted, which is the time point when one establishes his/her post-transplant immunity. If the count in this sample is less than or equal to 100, the participant will be noted as &quot;low response&quot;, while an individual with a spot count greater than 100 will be noted as &quot;high response&quot;. Odds ratio of having subsequent CMV reactivation between &quot;low response&quot; and &quot;high response&quot; groups will be estimated.</description>

    <description>The T-SPOT.CMV test (Oxford Diagnostic Laboratories) measures the strength of T cell responses to CMV specific antigens. Using whole blood samples obtained through a standard blood collection tube, white blood cells (WBC's) are separated and purified. The cells are quantified and placed into specially designed plates where they are challenged with antigens specific to the disease under study. Disease-specific cells responding to these antigens will release immune messenger molecules, called cytokines. We then use chemistry to allow us to visualize those WBCs releasing cytokines (and hence those which react to the antigen), resulting in a spot on the bottom of the plate, corresponding to the footprint of an individual reacting WBC. Finally, we use an automated image analysis system to identify and count each of these spots to give a quantitative readout. That quantitative readout gives us the frequency of responsive disease-specific cells (Oxford Immunotec, 2017).</description>
