  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The differential diagnosis of central diabetes insipidus (cDI) is difficult and the current
      test with the highest diagnostic accuracy is copeptin measurement after hypertonic saline
      infusion (HIS). Although the HIS improved diagnostic accuracy compared to the standard water
      deprivation test used for decades before, it still comprises great discomfort for patients
      due to the rise in serum sodium levels above 149mmol/l and requires the presence of medical
      staff at all times to guarantee safety of the test.

      The arginine stimulation test is routinely used to stimulate growth hormone. Own data in 52
      patients with polyuria / polydipsia syndrome showed that arginine infusion is a potent
      stimulator of the neurohypophysis and provides a new diagnostic tool in the differential
      diagnosis of cDI. Copeptin measurements upon arginine stimulation (CAS) discriminated
      patients with diabetes insipidus vs. patients with primary polydipsia with a high diagnostic
      accuracy of 94%.

      To validate these results and to compare them against the HIS a large multicenter trial is
      needed, where the diagnostic accuracy of the CAS is compared to the HIS.
