  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) infection is a necessary condition in the occurence
      and development of cervical squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL) and cervical cancer. There
      are cases that high-grade SIL (HSIL) and stage IA1 cervical squamous cancer remain or
      reoccur, or even become more severe after conization. The infection situation of HR-HPV,
      which plays an important role in the prognosis of cervical lesion, should be consulted in the
      management and follw-up after conization. It is worthwhile making further study in the
      specific practical significance of the HR-HPV in the prognosis of cervical lesion, as well as
      the high-risk factors that influence the prognosis of HR-HPV.

      Main purpose:To work out the standard management of HPV infection by following up the HPV
      infection situation of the patients with high-grade SIL (HSIL) and stage IA1 cervical
      squamous cancer after conization.

      Research design:First, to do the retrospective analysis toward the patients who received
      conization between Jan 2009 to Aug 2016.Second,to do the prospective analysis toward the
      patients who received conization between Spt 2016 to Aug 2018.

      Inclusive criteria of study population:The patients who had finished HPV genotype testing
      before conization;who had never received treatment other than conization;who were
      histologically diagnosed as HSIL or IA1 cervical squamous cancer;who had not been diagnosed
      as any cervical diseases before;who were under age 70;who did not have any severe diseases
      that influence the follow-up.

      Follow-up methods:to do the follow-up to the target patients by 3,6,9,12,18,24 months after
      conization.

      Follow-up contents:the HR-HPV genotype infection before conization;the grade of lesion;the
      age when received conization;the gravity and parity;the situation of the glands invovement
