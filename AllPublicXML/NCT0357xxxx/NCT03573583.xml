  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pilot study is to assess the feasibility of using a new method to measure muscle mass
      called Deuterated Creatine (D3Cr) method and thereby understand the role of muscle mass on
      functional outcomes in older adults.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Muscle loss with age is considered to be an important cause of disability in older adults.
      However, current tools frequently used and recommended to measure muscle mass in trials have
      limitations: For example, DEXA (Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) and BIA (Bioelectrical
      impedance analysis)- both widely used in clinical trials cannot distinguish muscle tissue
      from non-muscle elements such as subcutaneous and intramuscular fat, skin, water and
      connective tissue.

      Deuterated creatine (D3Cr) dilution is a novel promising method that provides an accurate
      measure of the functional contractile tissue, without including the non-contractile elements,
      by measuring total body creatine. Our preliminary cross-sectional results in men aged &gt;65
      years show functional muscle mass (FMM) assessed by D3-Cr to be significantly associated with
      performance outcomes and long-term outcomes, while DEXA showed no associations. However,
      these are observational data and cannot determine a causative role of muscle per se on
      functional outcomes.

      Hence, the objective of the pilot study is to assess the feasibility of our proposed future
      study to evaluate the role of muscle mass on functional outcomes. Specifically, the pilot
      study will randomize moderate to low-functioning older adults to a resistance training
      program or successful aging health education program to assess recruitment yields,
      participant adherence, retention, training program design aspects, sample size, and the cost
      of the main trial. Further, the impact of these changes in FMM on short-term performance
      outcomes, such as strength, walking speed, SPPB, self-reported measures, and balance will be
      examined.
