  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is intended to compare the efficacy of platelet-rich fibrin as a graft and a
      membrane versus hyaluronic acid(Gengigel) and amniotic membrane in the treatment of
      mandibular grade II furcation defects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Platelet-rich fibrin is a fraction of plasma that provides a rich source of growth factors
      and may enhance the stabilization and revascularization of the flaps and grafts.

      Hyaluronic acid is a naturally occurring non-sulfated high molecular weight glycosaminoglycan
      that forms a critical component of the extracellular matrix and contributes significantly to
      tissue hydrodynamics, cell migration and proliferation. Hence its administration to
      periodontal wound sites could achieve beneficial effects in periodontal tissue regeneration.

      Amniotic membrane is being used for various regenerative procedures as it is a rich source of
      various collagen and non-collagen proteins such as laminin, fibronectin and proteoglycan.

    <intervention_model_description>Patients will be equally divided into two test groups, Group A and Group B after phase I therapy. The group A patients will be treated with conventional flap surgery and the furcation would be debrided, following which platelet-rich fibrin will be placed as a graft and a membrane. The flap will then be sutured back. The group B patients will also be treated with conventional flap surgery after furcation area is debrided, and hyaluronic acid (gengigel)will be placed as a graft over which amniotic membrane will be placed. The flap would then be sutured.</intervention_model_description>
