  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Electronic or e-cigarettes are battery-powered devices that deliver vapor which may be
      inhaled in the manner tobacco is smoked. The e-liquid is usually a solution containing
      propylene glycol and/or vegetable glycerin, nicotine, and flavor concentrates, although some
      e-liquids also are sold as non-nicotine containing products. The long- and short-term public
      health consequences of e-cigarette use, including the effects of e-cigarettes on tobacco use
      behavior, are not well understood. However, the prevalence of e-cigarette use appears to be
      undergoing a rapid increase.

      In this study the investigators propose to analyze nicotine pharmacokinetic in blood and to
      compare the exhaled breath before and after e-cigarette smoking. They want to obtain a
      pharmacokinetic model of this population for nicotine. And they want to identify if molecules
      contained in vapor are absorbed, metabolized or modified by the organism.
