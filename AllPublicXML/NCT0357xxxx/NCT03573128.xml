      This project brings together the expertise of investigators at three centers to develop and
      conduct a pilot test of a new comprehensive intervention to increase the quality of
      educational services and access to inclusive settings for students with autism spectrum
      disorder (ASD) in elementary school (kindergarten through 5th grade). The intervention model,
      Students with Autism Accessing General Education (SAAGE), integrates evidence-based
      strategies to teach skills to students with ASD in schools, best practices derived from this
      literature by the project investigators, a recent guidebook written by the principal
      investigator, and research on collaboration with community providers such as school teams to
      implement interventions efficaciously and sustainably. SAAGE begins with strategies to help a
      school form a cohesive team to oversee implementation of the model in the school. For each
      student, SAAGE uses a modular approach for identifying goals for a student, selecting
      appropriate teaching strategies, and systematically monitoring progress and trouble-shooting.
      The modules center on core and associated features of ASD. Study personnel will use well
      established behavioral skills training procedures to coach educators to implement the
      modules.

    <description>The Social Skills Improvement System, Social Skills Subscale is a 30 item measure of social communication and interaction using a 4 point Likert scale to rate the frequency of behaviors and a 3 point Likert scale to the the importance of each item.</description>

    <description>The Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scales - PDD is a modified version of the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scales which is adapted for use with children with ASD. It is a semi structured clinician rated scale designed to rate the current severity of repetitive behavior. Each item is scored on a 5 point scale from 0 to 4 with 4 being most symptomatic.</description>
