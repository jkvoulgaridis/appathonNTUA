      Primary objectives:

        -  To determine the feasibility of program (80% retained with 75% overall attendance, and
           completed immediate follow-up questionnaires from 75% of participants).

        -  To determine the efficacy of program (evaluated by decreased loneliness, operationalized
           as decreased total score on the UCLA Loneliness Scale from pre to post intervention).

      Secondary objective:

        -  To determine whether program will affect depression and quality of life.

      This study involves prospective data collection from an intervention to investigate the
      impact of participation by MS patients in a 12-week guided online social support group. All
      outcomes will be compared to active control group. At the completion of a 12-week interval,
      all participants (placebo and treatment) will complete follow-up questionnaires. Three months
      after completing, participants will be sent follow-up questionnaires that will be evaluated
      as a 6-month follow-up, to assess retention of benefits.

      Social support has been linked to better health outcomes in many clinical populations.
      Multiple sclerosis (MS), a chronic neurological disease that affects over 400,000 people in
      the United States, involves physical and cognitive disability that can have negative
      consequences on social integration. This can lead to social isolation, which may be
      dynamically related to depression, fatigue, and disease progression. The aim of the present
      study is to investigate the impact of support group involvement on persons with MS. Outcomes
      of interest include mood, loneliness, and quality of life (QOL). Many people with MS feel
      isolated and are unable to participate in support groups that meet in locations that may be
      far from home, difficult to travel to (due to physical disability or lack of resources), or
      may not be convenient for their schedules. Another hindrance is the apprehension that MS
      patients sometimes experience when they encounter patients with severe physical disability,
      or worse impairment than their own. For these reasons, the study is introducing remote
      support groups to be conducted via the internet, &quot;e-Support.&quot; Attending a remote, internet
      based support group may be more appealing to patients with MS as it obviates the need to
      travel, thereby reducing cost, time, and energy.

    <measure>Change in overall Functional Assessment of Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life (FAMS QoL) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Assess efficacy of the program to improve quality of life. The Functional Assessment of Multiple Sclerosis (FAMS) quality of life (QoL) instrument is a disease-specific, self-report questionnaire. It includes 7 subscales. The total score is generated by summing scores across all subscales, and ranges from 0-232, with higher scores reflective or worse overall function. In addition to considering a significant decrease in the total score as an indication of better overall function, we will separately examine each subscale to see whether decreases in score (indicating improvements in function) are shown. This includes the following subscales: mobility, symptoms, emotional well-being, general contentment, thinking and fatigue, family/social well-being, and additional concerns scales.</description>
