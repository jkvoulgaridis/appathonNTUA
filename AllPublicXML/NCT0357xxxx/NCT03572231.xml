  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to observe and describe treatment patterns, like Overactive
      Bladder (OAB) treatment discontinuation, switching to other therapies and persistence of OAB
      therapies in routine clinical practice.

      This study will also evaluate effectiveness of OAB therapies in routine clinical practice;
      identify factors associated with effectiveness and persistence of pharmacologic therapies in
      OAB participants; evaluate the Quality of Life (QoL) and treatment satisfaction of OAB
      therapies; as well as evaluate health care resource utilization (HCRU) and understand adverse
      events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs) and adverse drug reactions (ADRs) associated with
      OAB therapies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational registry study and will not provide or recommend any treatment; all
      decisions regarding treatment are made at the sole discretion of the treating physician in
      accordance with the treating physician's usual practices and all eligible participants will
      be enrolled in a certain timeframe. OAB participants enrolled in the study will be
      categorized into one of two treatment groups, but the study does not plan to compare the two
      treatment groups.

    <description>Overactive Bladder Questionnaire-Short Form (OAB-Q-SF) is a participant-reported instrument consisting of 19 items that assess the degree to which a participant is bothered by OAB symptoms, and the degree of impact of OAB symptoms on daily life. Participants rate each item using a 6-point Likert Scale ranging from &quot;Not at all&quot; to &quot;A very great deal&quot; for the symptom bother items and &quot;none of the time&quot; to &quot;All of the time&quot; for the Health Related Quality of Life (HRQL) items.</description>

    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study patient administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a product, whether or not considered related to the product. Pre-existing conditions that worsen during a study are to be reported as AEs.</description>
