  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized control trial will provide the most reliable data to determine the role of
      prophylactic antibiotics to decrease the wound complication rate. The investigators plan to
      perform a pilot study to evaluate actual rates of wound complications and how long it takes
      to recruit 50 patients.

    <masking_description>The principal investigator along with all members of the study team involved in data analysis as well as the patients will be blinded to the randomization group. The research assistant will disclose the randomization group to the anesthesiologist who will screen the patient for allergies and then obtain the appropriate antibiotics from the pharmacy and administer the antibiotics as appropriate. These will be administered prior to the procedure and so the surgeon will remain blinded to the administration</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Vulvar wound complications compared between the two arms</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 30 days of surgery (estimated to be 30 days)</time_frame>
    <description>-a) Wound complication will be defined as a composite outcome that includes wound breakdown, sterile site infection, hematoma, seroma diagnosed within 30 days after excision.
-â€¢ Sterile Site Infection (SSI) - defined as purulent drainage, cellulitis, abscess, or a wound that requires drainage, debridement or antibiotics associated with a clinical diagnosis of infection.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical risk factors that correlate with vulvar wound complications as measured by demographic variables that predispose patients to infection</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 30 days of surgery (estimated to be 30 days)</time_frame>
    <description>-Clinical risk factors could include history of diabetes, liver disease, human immunodeficiency virus, chronic kidney disease, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, peripheral vasculature disease, dementia, connective tissues disease, leukemia, lymphoma, peptic ulcer disease, hypertension, steroid use, and use of other immunosuppressive medications.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical risk factors that correlate with vulvar wound complications as measured by vulvar hygiene</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 30 days of surgery (estimated to be 30 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will complete the Vulvar Hygiene Survey 2-3 weeks post surgery and the survey is split into two sections - prior to surgery and after surgery.
The prior to surgery survey asks 6 questions with yes/no answer choices. The questions ask the patient's doctor if he/she informed them about vulvar hygiene
The after surgery section asks 4 questions about if the patient performed specific vulvar hygienic procedures</description>

    <measure>Incidence of adverse events to antibiotic use</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 30 days of surgery (estimated to be 30 days)</time_frame>
    <description>-The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 will be utilized for all toxicity reporting.</description>
