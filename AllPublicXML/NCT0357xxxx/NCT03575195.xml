  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The clinical phenotype of Parkinson's disease (PD) is quite variable, as is the response to
      and side effects from medications. While many patients respond to carbidopa/levodopa early
      on, motor fluctuations and dyskinesias can become a problem as the condition progresses,
      causing significant impairment in function and quality of life. The gut microbiome is of
      increasing interest in PD, potentially contributing to pathophysiology and clinical
      phenotype. Furthermore, gut bacteria are capable of metabolizing levodopa, which may decrease
      its ability to reach the central nervous system and could explain the variable effect seen
      clinically. Altering the population of drug-metabolizing bacteria could improve the clinical
      symptoms of PD and the benefit seen with medications. The investigators hypothesize that the
      gut microbiome in people with PD correlates with their phenotypic characteristics, which can
      be improved with targeting the microbiome through dietary or therapeutic interventions. The
      investigators propose a two-part clinical trial. First, a cross-sectional analysis will
      correlate the microbiome profile with (a) the clinical phenotype of PD and (b) medication
      response. Second, a randomized, controlled trial, will evaluate the effect of microbiome
      manipulation on clinical phenotype and medication response. The investigators plan to reduce
      the level of bacteria through antibiotic use, resetting the potentially disadvantageous
      microbiome population. Outcomes will include changes in clinical symptoms, alterations in the
      the microbiome, and changes in serum markers of inflammation. This thorough characterization
      will broaden our understanding of the gut-brain axis significantly in PD in clinically
      relevant ways that have yet to be explored.

    <measure>MDS-UPDRS Part III</measure>
    <time_frame>Two weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Movement Disorders Society - Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) is a validated scale that quantifies many of the symptoms and signs of Parkinson's disease. Part III in particular focuses on the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease through a neurologic exam. The exam is often performed when medications are held for 8-12 hours (the &quot;OFF&quot; state) and again when medications are given and providing therapeutic benefit (the &quot;ON&quot; state), and the difference between scores is calculated. The scale goes from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 132. There is no specific cutoff, but a higher score indicates a higher severity of symptoms. The trial will examine the change in the MDS-UPDRS Part III both OFF and ON medication after the intervention.</description>

    <measure>Percent of OFF time according to home motor diaries</measure>
    <time_frame>Two weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patients with Parkinson's disease often have times where levodopa is providing therapeutic benefit and times when it is not. &quot;OFF&quot; time indicates the times of day where levodopa therapy is not providing therapeutic benefit. An outcome of the trial will be the change in medication OFF time that the participant experiences at home, according to motor diaries.</description>
