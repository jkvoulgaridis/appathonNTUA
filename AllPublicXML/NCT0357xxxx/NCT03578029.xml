  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of RGN-137 topical gel with
      that of placebo gel for treatment of junctional epidermolysis bullosa (JEB) or dystrophic
      epidermolysis bullosa (DEB).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      RGN-137 will be evaluated for efficacy and safety compared to a Placebo. A matched-pair
      design will be used to evaluate RGN-137 treatment versus placebo for treatment of 15 subjects
      with JEB or DEB. Eligible subject must have 1 set of matched-pair wound. The investigator
      will assign pair of index wounds, each wound with an area between 5cm2 and 50cm2, inclusive,
      for the eligible subject on Day 1, and for each pair, one wound will be randomized to receive
      RGN-137 gel and the other to receive Placebo gel. Subjects and independent evaluator will be
      blinded to the treatment assignments for each wound.
