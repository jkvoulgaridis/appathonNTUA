  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is Multicenter, phase 3, Open-Label trial that explored the preventive
      effectiveness, safety and immunogenicity of single dose a allantoic split inactivated
      seasonal influenza vaccine in healthy adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will include 2000 volunteers, 1,000 of whom will be vaccinated intramuscularly with
      a single dose of allantoic split inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine.

      All participants will be observed for 6 months to evaluate the effectiveness of the vaccine.

    <intervention_model_description>The main group - group 1 = 1000 volunteers will be vaccinated with the vaccine &quot;Allan-toxin split inactivated against seasonal influenza vaccine&quot;.
In the main group, a subgroup will be singled out - a group of 1a = 200 volunteers who will be examined for safety, immunogenicity and immunity.
The observation group is a group of 2 = 1000 people who, when confirming the diagnosis of influenza, will compare the incidence with the main group.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>1A group - Seroconversion rate was measured by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titer for each of the three strains (A/H1N1 strain, A/H3N2 strain, B strain), 21, 90, 180 days after vaccination. Seroconversion rate was defined as the percentage of participants achieving a minimal 4-fold increase from the Baseline HI antibody titer in participants with a Baseline titer ≥10, or achieving an HI antibody titer of ≥40 in participants with a Baseline titer &lt;10.</description>
