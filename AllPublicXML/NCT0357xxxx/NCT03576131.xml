  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the trial is to evaluate the safety of GEN1029 (HexaBody®-DR5/DR5) in a mixed
      population of patients with specified solid tumors
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial is an open-label, multi-center safety trial of GEN1029 (HexaBody®-DR5/DR5). The
      trial consists of two parts a dose escalation part (phase 1, first-in-human (FIH) and an
      expansion part (phase 2a). The expansion part of the trial will be initiated once the
      Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) has been determined.
