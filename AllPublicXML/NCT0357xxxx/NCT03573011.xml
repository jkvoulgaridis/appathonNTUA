  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is the most frequently occurring male cancer in Belgium. Patients who have
      been treated for prostate cancer, i.e. by surgery and/or radiotherapy, in a substantial
      degree suffer from a tumor recurrence, often diagnosed by an increase in serum tumor marker
      Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) within the first few years. In these patients with evidence
      of a tumor recurrence after primary treatment, it is important to most exactly define the
      location(s) of tumor, to guide appropriate therapy by surgery, radiotherapy and/or
      hormonotherapy. In so-called oligo-metastatic disease targeted therapy may still be curative
      and prevent the disease from spreading to distant locations. Therefore it is of paramount
      importance to have an accurate tool of medical imaging to localize all possible locations to
      be treated.

    <intervention_model_description>Original phase 2 (44 subjects) Concerning the dose of [18F]PSMA-11, half of the patients in the phase 2 study will be injected with 2.0 ± 0.2 MBq/kg bodyweight. The other half will be injected with 4.0 ± 0.4 MBq/kg body weight. Randomization of patients to one of these two groups will be performed using a block randomization design with block sizes of two, four, and six.
Extension phase 2 (22 subjects):
For this part of the phase 2 study, all patients will be injected with 2.0 ± 0.2 MBq/kg bodyweight [18F]PSMA-11. No Randomisation or masking is applicable for this group of 22 subjects.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Original phase 2 trial (44 subjects)
The assigned [18F]PSMA-11 dosing group will be blind to the recruiting physicians, the patient the staff member(s) while planning the [18F]PSMA-11 scanday of the patient, and the nuclear medicine physicians interpreting the images.
Next to the clinical trial coordinators, also the staff members responsible for the preparation of the individual [18F]PSMA-11 dose and the IV injection of this dose are aware of the dose group (2.0 ± 0.2 or 4.0 ± 0.4 MBq/kg body weight), which means that they are NOT blinded. However, these staff members do not carry out any further study specific handlings.
Extension phase 2 trial (22 subjects):
masking is not applicable for this part of the phase 2 trial.</masking_description>

    <description>Based on the overall image quality (7 point '1-7' scoring scale for image blurriness, higher score represents a higher quality image), the optimal dose of [18F]PSMA-11 (2.0 or 4.0 MBq/kg) will be defined</description>

    <description>Based on the degree that the radiotracer uptake in the bladder and in the ureters is disruptive for the interpretation of the scan (visual interpretation by nuclearist using a 7 point '1-7' scoring scale, higher score equals a more pronounced disturbance), the added value of furosemide, as part of the standard scanprotocol, will be defined</description>

    <description>Following the [18F]PSMA PET/CT scans in the phase 2 trial, the treating physician will continue the follow-up and treatment of the patient. Hereby, depending of the selected conventional treatment or procedure, the following data will be also collected (if available within 60 days following the day of the [18F]PSMA scan) to investigate the diagnostic specificity of [18F]PSMA-11:
In case the treating physician opts to perform a radical prostatectomy or lymphadenectomy or to take a biopt, the anatomopathological diagnosis (PSMA expression in tissue) will be used as an endpoint for correlation with the results of the [18F]PSMA scan.
In case the treating physician opts for radiotherapy or hormone therapy, the (change in) PSA levels will be used as an endpoint for correlation with the results of the [18F]PSMA scan.
In case the treating physician opts to acquire an additional MRI, suspicious lesions on the MRI will be also compared with those observed on the [18F]PSMA PET/CT scan.</description>

    <description>The treating physician must fill in a questionnaire concerning the patients 'pre [18F]PSMA-11 PET' management plan. After the scan, the physician must fill in a second part of the questionnaire concerning how the [18F]PSMA-11 scan would influence the patient's treatment plan.</description>

    <description>To define the optimal [18F]PSMA-11 scan protocol, the quality of the PET images from patients that received 2.0 ± 0.2 MBq/kg will be compared to the images from patients that received 4.0 ± 0.4 MBq/kg.
Patients in this study arm will receive 2.0 ± 0.2 MBq/kg for acquiring the [18F]PSMA-11 scan. All other study parameters and procedures are identical to those in the other study arm.
As for the use of radiopharmaceuticals, the ALARA ('as low as reasonably achievable') principle must be applied, this study arm is considered to be the reference.</description>
