  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Among critically ill patients requiring mechanical ventilation and catecholamines for shock,
      nearly 40% to 50% die, and functional recovery is often delayed in survivors. International
      guidelines include early nutritional support (≤48 h after admission), 20-25 kcal/kg/d at the
      acute phase, and 1.2-2 g/kg/d protein. These targets are rarely achieved in patients with
      severe critically illnesses. Recent data challenge the wisdom of providing standard amounts
      of calories and protein during the acute phase of critical illness. Studies designed to
      improve enteral nutrition delivery showed no outcome benefits with higher intakes. Instead,
      adding parenteral nutrition to increase intakes was associated with longer ICU stays and more
      infectious complications. Studies suggest that higher protein intakes during the acute phase
      may be associated with greater muscle wasting and ICU-acquired weakness. The optimal calorie
      and protein supply at the acute phase of severe critical illness remains unknown. NUTRIREA-3
      will be the first trial to compare standard calorie and protein feeding complying with
      guidelines to low-calorie low-protein feeding potentially associated with improved muscle
      preservation, translating into shorter mechanical ventilation and ICU-stay durations, lower
      ICU-acquired infection rates, lower mortality, and better long-term clinical outcomes. This
      multicentre, randomized, controlled, open trial will compare, in patients receiving
      mechanical ventilation and treated with vasoactive agent for shock two strategies for
      initiating nutritional support at the acute phase of ICU management (D0-D7): early
      calorie/protein restriction (6 kcal/kg/d/0.2-0.4 g/kg/d, Low group) or standard
      calorie/protein targets (25 kcal/kg/d/1.0-1.3 g/kg/d, Standard group). Patients in both
      groups will receive enteral or parenteral nutrition appropriate for their critical illness.
      Two alternative primary end-points will be evaluated: all-cause mortality by day 90 and time
      to discharge alive from the ICU. Second end-points will be calories and proteins delivered,
      nosocomial infections, gastro-intestinal complications, glucose control, liver dysfunctions,
      muscle function at the time of readiness for ICU discharge and quality of life at 3 months
      and 1 year after study inclusion.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Invasive mechanical ventilation started in the ICU within the past 24 h, or started
             before ICU admission with ICU admission within the past 24 h, for an expected duration
             of at least 48 hours after inclusion

          -  Treatment with a vasoactive agent for shock (adrenaline, dobutamine, or noradrenaline)

          -  Nutritional support expected to be started within 24 h after intubation or within 24 h
             after ICU admission when mechanical ventilation was started before ICU admission

          -  Age older than 18 years

          -  Patient and/or next-of-kin informed about the study and having consented to
             participation in the study. If the patient is unable to receive information and no
             next-of-kin can be contacted during screening for the study, trial inclusion will be
             completed as an emergency procedure by the ICU physician, in compliance with the
             French law.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Specific nutritional needs, such as pre-existing long-term home enteral or parenteral
             nutrition, for chronic bowel disease

          -  Dying patient, not-to-be-resuscitated order, or other treatment limitation decision at
             ICU admission

          -  Pregnancy, recent delivery, or lactation
