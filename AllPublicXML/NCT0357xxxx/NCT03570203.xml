  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to quantify the incidence of hyponatremia in patients of
      supratentorial/supra-sellar lesions and observe their effect on neurological morbidity and
      mortality.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Disorders of sodium and water balance are one of the commonly encountered problems while
      managing patients with neurological diseases. Managing such problems are challenging because
      the pathophysiology behind these disorders are complex and poorly understood and treatment of
      the injured brain itself can contribute to, and complicate the diagnosis of sodium disorders.
      Serum sodium disturbance can manifest as hypernatremia or hyponatremia. Hypernatremia usually
      occurs in the diabetes insipidus syndrome, whereas hyponatremia develops as a syndrome of
      inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) or cerebral salt-wasting syndrome
      (CSWS).

      Because of the cerebral effects of hyponatremia, neurosurgical patients are at increased risk
      of complications including severe cerebral edema, mental status changes, seizures, vasospasm,
      and death.

      Though the problem of hyponatremia has been addressed in patients with different brain
      pathologies, this has not been studied in patients with non-sellar/suprasellar supratentorial
      tumors. This study was envisioned to quantify the incidence and magnitude of hyponatremia in
      this patient population and their subsequent neurological morbidity and mortality.
