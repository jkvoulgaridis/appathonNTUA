  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      All patients referring to the U.O .of Digestive Endoscopy of the Humanitas Hospital to
      undergo EUS with biopsy in the pre-treatment evaluation of locally advanced pancreatic
      adenocarcinoma, satisfying all the inclusion criteria and without any of the exclusion
      criteria, will be enrolled.

      Patients will then undergo endoscopic procedures (EUS with biopsy) provided by good clinical
      practice in consideration of the suspected diagnosis for which they come to Investigator's
      attention.

      Biopsy will be performed using a histology needle (22 G, Acquire, Boston Scientific, MA,
      United States). The obtained material will be processed in the Pathological Anatomy. A small
      part of this will be sent to the NGS analysis.

      At the time of preparation for the examination, the patients will be asked for blood
      collection (10 ml of blood) in order to evaluate any circulating tumor cells that will be
      identified by SmartBioSurface technique (Tethis S.p.A) and analyzed by appropriate molecular
      markers and NGS.

      The clinical evaluation of the patient will take place at 6 months from the date of the
      procedure, through telephone contact and / or outpatient visit.
