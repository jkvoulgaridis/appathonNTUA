  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oral infections can trigger the production of pro-inflammatory mediators that may be risk
      factors for miscarriage. The investigators investigated whether oral health care patterns
      that may promote or alleviate oral inflammation were associated with the history of
      miscarriage in Turkish women.

      Power analysis was performed with the G-Power software package to determine sample size.

      To cover possible data loss, 10% of a group were added to each group. Medical and dental
      examination will be performed both of control and experimental groups. In dental examination
      decayed, missing, or filled teeth (DMFT) index will be used according to World Health
      Organization (WHO 1997) criteria. All teeth were visually using the International Caries
      Detection and Assessment System (ICDAS-II).

      To analyze the correlation between oral health status and miscarriage linear regression test
      and for comparison of both the groups (case and control), two sample t test and chi square
      test were used.

    <description>All teeth were visually using the International Caries Detection and Assessment System (ICDAS-II). The chosen sites were recorded as:
0 = sound;
= first visible sign of noncavitated lesion seen only when the tooth is dried;
= visible noncavitated lesion seen when wet and dry;
= microcavitation in enamel;
= noncavitated lesion extending into dentine seen as an undermining shadow;
= small cavitated lesion with visible dentine: less than 50% of surface;
= large cavitated lesions with visible dentine in more than 50% of the surface.</description>
