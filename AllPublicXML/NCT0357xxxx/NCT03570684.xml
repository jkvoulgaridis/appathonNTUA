      During the laparoscopic anterior resection of rectal cancer, transecting the mobilized rectum
      in the narrow pelvic was difficult and sometimes need 2-3 reloads of the endoscopic linear
      cutter. also the angles between the 2-3 staple line threaten the next anastomosis. this study
      was to explore the Cable Tie to facilitate the transection of rectum and decline the usage of
      the reloads.

    <textblock>
      In the modern laparoscopic colorectal surgery, application of endoscopic stapler was
      necessary and popular, especially in rectal cancer. In the anterior resection of rectal
      cancer, usage of stapler increase the anal preservation. However during the laparoscopic
      anterior resection, transecting the mobilized rectum in the narrow pelvic was difficult, even
      with the flexible linear cutter. 1 reloads of the stapler was unable to transect the rectum
      completely, and need 2-3 reloads, especially in some fat patients, which was uneconomic.Also
      increased reloads increase the staple line, and 2 or 3 staple line threaten the next
      anastomosis, and increasing anastomotic leak rate. this study was to explore the Cable Tie to
      facilitate the transection of rectum and decline the usage of the reloads. During the
      operation, after mobilization the rectum, the disinfected Cable Tie was introduced into the
      pelvic cavity.then the rectum was bundled by the tie which was much easier as the tie is
      auto-locked. pulling the tie and the rectum would be explored clearly, and then the
      endoscopic linear cutter was introduced to transect the rectum. the tie made the rectum
      folded not applanate, that the cutter was able to transect the rectum easily and with less
      reloader.
