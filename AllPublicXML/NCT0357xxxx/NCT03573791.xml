  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neoadjuvant therapy has been widely applied to locally advanced rectal cancer. However, about
      50% of patients receiving this therapy do not respond well as evidenced by the fact that
      their T or N stages are not effectively decreased judged by postoperative pathological
      examination. The purpose of this trail is to identify the biomarkers (from within patients'
      tumor mass before neoadjuvant therapy) to predict resistance to neoadjuvant therapy. These
      biomarkers can help stratify neoadjuvant-resistant patients towards surgery while avoiding
      unnecessary chemoradio-based neoadjuvant therapy.

      According to postoperative pathological examination results, all participants will be divided
      into two groups: complete response (ypT0N0) and poor response (&gt;ypT1-2N0). Differentially
      expressed genes between complete response and poor response will be analyzed. A scoring
      formula will be established based on the results. Tumor tissue samples are collected before
      neoadjuvant therapy and will be analyzed via RNA sequencing.

      Tumor biopsy samples are collected before neoadjuvant therapy when participants undergo
      colonoscopy or endoscopic ultrasonography. Two pieces of tumor tissue specimens will be
      extracted. These tissues will be stored at the tumor specimen bank and gene expression
      profile of these tumor samples will be analyzed using RNA sequencing.
