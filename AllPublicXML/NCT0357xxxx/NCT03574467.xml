  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to examine the functional recovery results of the Bobath (NDT)
      approach in patients with primary brain tumors and compare the results with those of stroke
      patients.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The Stroke Rehabilitation Assessment of Movement Measure (STREAM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Patients were evaluated immediately before rehabilitation, and immediately after rehabilitation service, which lasted 4-10 days on average.</time_frame>
    <description>The Stroke Rehabilitation Assessment of Movement Measure (STREAM) is a scale with scores ranging from 0 to 70, which is used to provide an understanding of the levels of movement and quality of hemiplegic patients.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Functional Independent Measurement (FIM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Patients were evaluated immediately before rehabilitation, and immediately after rehabilitation service, which lasted 4-10 days on average.</time_frame>
    <description>The Functional Independent Measurement (FIM) is 18-item scale and is scored from 18 (total assistance in all areas) to 126 (complete independence). FIM consists of 13 motor (or physical) and 5 social-cognitive items, assessing self care, sphincter control, transfer, locomotion, communication, social interaction, and cognition. The results from the first 13 items (FIM motor) are summed to develop a motor score with a range of 13 to 91, and these items were used in this study.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Patients were evaluated immediately before rehabilitation, and immediately after rehabilitation service, which lasted 4-10 days on average.</time_frame>
    <description>Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) is a scale with scores ranging from 0 to 30, which allows the cognitive levels to be determined by examining the patient's orientation, recording memory, attention and calculation, recall, and language parameters. The score of 0 indicates that the patient has no cognitive functions, and the score of 30 indicates that the patient has a high level of cognitive functions.</description>

        Department of Neurology between June 2016 and April 2017, were analyzed for the study. The
        study inclusion criteria were determined for all patients to be over 18 years of age, in
        the acute phase, Glasgow Coma Scale score 14 and above, Modifiye Rankin Score being more
        than 2 and medical stability. Furthermore, the criteria for inclusion in the study were
        unilateral stroke and having a stroke for the first time for stroke patients, and
        supratentorial location for patients with brain tumors.
