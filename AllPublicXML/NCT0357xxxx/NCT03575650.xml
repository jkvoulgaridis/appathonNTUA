  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer (BC) radiotherapy leads to incidental cardiac irradiation, resulting in an
      increased risk of various major cardiac events (MCEs). In addition, recent studies indicate
      that for the treatment of BC, the addition of chemotherapy further enhances the risk of MCEs.
      Information regarding morphological and functional early subclinical cardiac injuries (ESCIs)
      induced by chemotherapy and radiotherapy that develop into MCEs is largely lacking in
      scientific literature. This information is essential towards the development of primary and
      secondary preventive strategies. The EMIRA prospective cohort has as main objective to
      identify morphological and functional ESCIs in BC patients treated with adjuvant radiotherapy
      and chemotherapy.

      EMIRA is a single centre prospective observational cohort study performed in the UMCG. The
      study includes breast cancer patients that underwent primary surgery, either by mastectomy or
      breast conserving surgery, who are treated with adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy as
      part of routine clinical care. The patient follow up time continues for 2 years after
      radiotherapy to identify early subclinical cardiac injuries (ESCIs), using repeat
      echocardiography (cECHO), cardiac MRI (cMRI) scans and cardiac CT (cCT) scans. The images are
      acquired prior to chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy (depending on the sequence of adjuvant
      treatment), and at 6 and 24 months after radiotherapy The first primary aim of this project
      is to detect ESCIs that are considered risk factors for clinically apparent major cardiac
      events in breast cancer patients treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The second is to
      use this information to develop prediction models describing the relationship between the
      radiation dose to cardiac substructures and ESCIs.

      In detail, the investigators aim to:

        1. identify longitudinal morphological and functional ESCIs using echocardiography, cardiac
           MRI and cardiac CT before and after BC treatment;

        2. determine the relationship between 3D-dose distributions to cardiac substructures and
           ESCI;

        3. establish the effect of chemotherapy on the dose-effect relationship between radiation
           dose and ESCI.
