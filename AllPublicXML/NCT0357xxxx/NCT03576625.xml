      The effect of Buglossoides oil emulsion on the intensity of recent chronic knee and hip pain,
      on plasma and mononuclear blood cells fatty acid profiles and on whole blood Eicosapentaenoic
      acid production will be investigated.

      This study will document the impact of an emulsion of Buglossoides oil on the intensity of
      recent chronic knee and hip pain. Secondly, the impact of consuming Buglossoides oil on
      plasma and leukocyte fatty acid profiles will be investigated, thus providing clinical
      evidence on the efficacy of an emulsion of Buglossoides oil in increasing EPA content.
      Lastly, a comprehensive analysis of whole blood eicosanoid production following
      supplementation will provide data on the potential for Buglossoides oil to modulate immune
      function.
