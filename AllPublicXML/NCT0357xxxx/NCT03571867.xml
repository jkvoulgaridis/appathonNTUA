    <textblock>
      the use of sugammadex during the reversal of neuromuscular blocking after adenotonsillectomy
      surgery in pediatric patients would be advantageous in terms of patient comfort and reducing
      side effects. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the time to extubation, agitation and pain scores in
      pediatric patients who underwent adenotonsillectomy and awakened with neostigmine and
      sugammadex in our study.

      A total of 70 patients in the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) I-II risk group,
      aged 5-13 years, who will be undergoing adenotonsillectomy with recurrent / chronic
      tonsillitis or obstructive sleep apnea in the otorhinolaryngology clinic of our hospital were
      included. Investigator did not assign specific interventions to the study participants.
      Patients were selected to sugammadex + saline group (Group S) and neostigmin+atropine group
      (Group N) and 35 patients were seleceted for each group randomly. Patients receive
      interventions as part of routine medical care, and a researcher studies the effect of the
      intervention.

      Tracheal extubation time (from discontinuing anesthetics until extubation), Duration of
      anesthesia (from the injection of anesthetic until discontinuation) duration of the operation
      (from the injection of anesthetic until until the patient's discharge from the operating
      room) were recorded for each patient.

      We assessed the agitation level with the Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium (PAED),
      which provides a score from 0 to 20, at first 15 minutes (T0), 1st (T1), 4th (T4), 8th (T8)
      and 12th (T12) hours post-extubation
