  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. Multiple system
      atrophy (MSA) is a relentlessly progressing rare neurodegenerative disease of unknown
      etiology. In early stages of the disease, PD and MSA symptoms are very similar, particularly
      MSA-P where Parkinsonism predominates. The differential diagnosis between MSA-P and PD can be
      very challenging in early disease stages, while early diagnostic certitude is important for
      the patient because of the diverging prognosis. Voice disorders are a common early symptom in
      both diseases and of different origin. The ambition and the originality of this project are
      to develop a digital voice-based tool for objective discrimination between PD and MSA-P.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Given the clinical similarity between PD and MSA-P in early disease stages and the severity
      of the prognosis of MSA-P, it would be very useful to have objective tools to assist in the
      differential diagnosis between both disorders. Since dysarthria is a common early symptom in
      both diseases and of different origin, the innovative goal of this project is to use
      dysarthria, through a digital processing of voice recordings of patients, as a vehicle to
      distinguish between PD and MSA-P in early disease stages.

      The team will build a corpus of voice samples of patients with both diseases and a recent
      diagnosis (less than 4 years) and controls. This corpus will consist in sustained vowels,
      utterances of a standard text and spontaneous speech. The recordings will be performed using
      a high quality digital recorder (H4n) and the DIANA and EVA-2 workstations. DIANA is a
      state-of-the-art system dedicated to pathological voice recording and analysis.

      An electroglottograph (EGG), a non-invasive device, will be also used in conjunction with the
      recordings to provide the ground truth of glottal opening and closure instants during
      utterances. The use of an EGG can be very useful given that OGI and GCI provide valuable
      information about the voice short-time dynamics.

Vowels: mean frequency (Hz), variation coefficient (%), jitter factor (%), mean intensity (dB), shimmer factor (%), and noise to harmony ratio (dB).
Speech prosody: mean frequency (Hz), variation coefficient (%), minimal frequency (Hz), maximal frequency (Hz), dynamic (Hz), mean duration of speech between two pauses (seconds), total amount of syllables (syllables/s), total amount of pure speech (syllables/s), articulation rate (syllables/s), percentage of pauses (%), percentage of pauses within words (%), time between pauses (s), SPIR index of rhythmicity (words/min), fragmentation of vowels (%), voice onset time (s), stop-consonant spirantization (%).

    <measure>Differences between groups in Acoustic Voice Quality Index (AVQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>AVQI will be calculated with the SESANE software (http://www.sqlab.fr/) and with algorithms developed by GeoStat at Inria.
Objective measurement of overall voice quality consisted of determining the acoustic parameters for calculating AVQI: smoothed cepstral peak prominence (CPPs) with the computer program &quot;SpeechTool&quot; (James Hillenbrand, Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo, MI, USA) and harmonics-to-noise ratio (HNR), shimmer local, shimmer local dB, general slope of the spectrum (slope) and tilt of the regression line through the spectrum (tilt) with Praat. Te Acoustic Voice Quality Index (AVQI) was calculated according to the regression formula: 2.571 [3.295 − 0.111 (CPPs) − 0.073 (HNR) − 0.213 (shimmer local) + 2.789 (shimmer local dB) − 0.032 (slope) + 0.077 (tilt)].</description>
