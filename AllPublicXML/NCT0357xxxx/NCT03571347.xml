  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background The flow of asylum seekers and refugees moving to European and bordering countries
      has progressively increased in the last years. This population is exposed to physical and
      mental challenges before and during displacement, and suffer continuing hardships after
      arrival in a High-Income Country. As a consequence, asylum seekers and refugees are extremely
      vulnerable to some common mental health conditions, i.e., post-traumatic stress disorder,
      anxiety, depression and other forms of disabling psychological distress. The World Health
      Organization has developed a new 5-session self-help intervention called Self-Help Plus (SH+)
      for managing stress and coping with adversity. SH+ has been evaluated in RCTs in low- and
      middle-income countries, however, there is no rigorous evidence on its cost-effectiveness in
      preventing the onset of mental disorders in HIC.

      Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the SH+ in asylum seekers
      and refugees with psychological distress resettled in six sites of five European countries
      (Italy, Austria, Germany, Finland, and two sites in the UK), as compared with enhanced
      treatment as usual (ETAU). The primary outcome is the reduction in the incidence of any
      mental disorders. Secondary outcomes are mental health symptoms, psychological functioning,
      well-being, drop-out rates, and economic outcomes.

      Design This is a multicentre parallel-group randomized controlled trial, in which
      participants will have an equal probability (1:1) of being randomly allocated to the SH+ or
      the ETAU.

      Methodology Asylum seekers and refugees who screen positive at the General Health
      Questionnaire (â‰¥ 3) and without a formal diagnosis of any psychiatric disorders according to
      the M.I.N.I. International Neuropsychiatric Interview will enter the study. After random
      allocation they will receive the SH+ or the ETAU. Assessments will be performed by masked
      assessors immediately after intervention, at 6 months, and a 12 months after randomization.

      Time frame The recruitment phase will last 12 months. After the screening, eligible
      participants will be assessed at baseline, post-intervention, and at 6- and 12-month
      follow-up. The SH+ delivery will be conducted in around 5 weeks.

      Expected outcomes A reduction in the incidence of psychiatric diagnoses at 6-month follow-up,
      and a general improvement in mental health symptoms, psychological functioning, well-being,
      and economic outcomes at each assessment.

      Asylum seekers and refugees will be randomized to receive the SH+ intervention or Enhanced
      Treatment as Usual. The SH+ has been developed by WHO and collaborators working in the
      humanitarian field, with expertise in global mental health and psychosocial interventions.
      SH+ consists of a pre-recorded audio course, delivered by facilitators in a group setting and
      complemented with an illustrated self-help book. SH+ was designed to be relevant for large
      adversity-affected populations: it is transdiagnostic, easily adaptable to different cultures
      and languages, and both meaningful and safe for people with and without mental disorders. The
      format of SH+ is innovative in that it seeks to ensure that key intervention components are
      delivered as intended without the burden of extensive facilitator training. SH+ programme is
      based on acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), a form of cognitive-behavioral therapy,
      with distinct features. SH+ programme has two components: a pre-recorded course and an
      illustrated self-help book. Pre-recorded audio material (culturally adapted) is delivered
      across five 2-hour sessions to groups of up to 30 people. The audio material imparts key
      information about stress management and guides participants through individual exercises and
      small group discussions. To augment the audio recordings, an illustrated self-help book
      reviews all essential content and concepts 19. Written manuals help briefly-trained,
      non-specialist facilitators to conduct the course using the pre-recorded audio. The SH+
      intervention will be delivered by briefly-trained, non-specialist facilitators.

      The control intervention will receive Enhanced Treatment as Usual.

    <description>Psychological distress will be measured through the General Health Questionnaire-12. The questionnaire asks whether the respondent has experienced a particular symptom or behaviour recently. Each item is rated on a four-point Likert scale (less than usual, no more than usual, rather more than usual, or much more than usual); and gives a total score of 36 or 12 based on the GHQ version and on the selected scoring methods.</description>
