  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial aims to assess the detection rate of clinically significant
      and clinically insignificant cancer of mpMRI-targeted biopsy compared to transperineal
      standard biopsy in men with clinical suspicion of prostate cancer who had no prior prostate
      biopsy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prostate biopsy with multiple samples using a standardized template (standard biopsy, SB)
      under transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) guidance is the current standard diagnostic approach in
      suspicion of prostate cancer (PCa). However, many biopsies are unnecessary or cannot detect
      clinically significant PCa (csPCa).

      With the introduction of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) of the prostate
      and the improvement for PCa detection and localization, an alternative procedure, known as
      MRI-targeted biopsy (TB), has been shown comparable or even higher detection rates of csPCa
      compared to TRUS-biopsy (SB).

      This randomized controlled trial aims to assess the detection rate of clinically significant
      and clinically insignificant cancer of TB compared to SB (transperineal) in men referred with
      clinical suspicion of prostate cancer who have had no prior prostate biopsy.
