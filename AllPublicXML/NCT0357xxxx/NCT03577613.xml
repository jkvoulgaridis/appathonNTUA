      Prospective controlled study (Canadian Task Force II-2) : Comparison analysis regarding
      surgical outcomes, complications, overall survival (OS), disease free survival (DFS) and
      cancer specific survival between patients subjected to radical Hysterectomy either by open
      radical hysterectomy (ORH) or minimally invasive surgery (MIS): laparoscopic (LRH) or
      robotically assisted radical hysterectomy (RRH).

      Study Objective: To analyse the effect that the introduction of minimally invasive procedures
      has had on surgical and oncological outcomes when compared with conventional open radical
      hysterectomy (ORH) in a national reference cancer center Design: A prospective controlled
      study (Canadian Task Force II-2) Setting: A university teaching hospital Patients: All
      patients that underwent RH as primary treatment for cervical cancer in our institution
      between May 1999 and June 2016, with a total of 188 patients.

      Interventions: Patients underwent an open radical hysterectomy (ORH) or minimally invasive
      surgery (MIS): laparoscopic (LRH) or robotically assisted radical hysterectomy (RRH).
