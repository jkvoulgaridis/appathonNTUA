    <textblock>
      The anticoagulation therapy is needed when rhythm control strategy is applied in atrial
      fibrillation patients but adverse events such as major bleeding exist. This study aims to
      examine the prognostic inpact of the duration of anticoagulation after radiofrequency
      ablation of paroxismal atrial fibrillation in patients with low thromboembolic risk.
      Paroxismal atrial fibrillation patients with 0 or 1 CHADS2-Vasc score undergoing
      radiofrequency ablation is randomized into one month anticoagulation group and two months
      anticoagulation group after the procedure. Thromboembolic event and adverse event including
      major or minor bleeding would be compared.

    <textblock>
      Catheter based radiofrequency ablation has been used in more than a decade as a rhythm
      control therapy. Recently, superior outcome to medical therapy has been constantly reported
      and the radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) became popular globally. It is recommended to
      anticoagulate patients who received RFCA for atrial fibrillation at least two months after
      the procedure. However, a few reports suggest anticoagulation in selective patients according
      to CHADS2-Vasc score. Anticoagulants prevent thromboembolic event in atrial fibrillation but
      the risk of bleeding is increased in company. There is controversy in the duration of
      anticoagulation after RFCA of atrial fibrillation. The investigators aimed to investigate the
      association with thromboembolic and bleeding event of anticoagulation duration after RFCA of
      atrial fibrillation in patients with low thromboembolic risk. Paroxismal atrial fibrillation
      patients with 0 or 1 CHADS2-Vasc score who are undergoing RFCA are included and randomized by
      1:1 ratio to one month anticoagulation group and two months anticoagulation group after RFCA.
      Any patient with an evidence of intracardiac thrombus is excluded. The primary endpoint is
      thromboembolic event in 6 months after RFCA and the secondary endpoint is bleeding event in 6
      months after RFCA.
