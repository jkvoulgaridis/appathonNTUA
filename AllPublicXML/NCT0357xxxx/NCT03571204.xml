    <textblock>
      Background:

      Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) affects the immune system. The main function of the immune
      system is protect you from infections and other diseases such as cancer. HIV attacks and
      cripples the immune system making people more susceptible to a variety of infections and
      cancers. Currently, the standard treatment for HIV infection is a daily administration of
      anti-HIV drugs. These drugs are called combination antiretroviral therapy (ART). ART is very
      effective at suppressing HIV, but does not cure HIV infection. ART must be taken continuously
      for life to be effective. ART can stop being effective if not taken correctly and can cause
      permanent side effects. Researchers want to see if two new products can control HIV infection
      without the use of ART. The products are the antibodies 3BNC117 and 10-1074.

      Objective:

      To see if 3BNC117 and 10-1074 are safe and can control HIV levels in the blood of people who
      are not taking ART or people who stop taking their ART during the study. .

      Eligibility:

      Adults ages 18-65 with HIV who are:

        -  on ART and willing to stop treatment for at least 28 weeks

        -  OR not taking ART with low levels of HIV in the blood

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with a physical exam, medical history, and blood, heart, and
      urine tests.

      Participants will get the 2 study products or salt water (placebo). A thin tube will be
      placed in an arm vein. Each product will be given directly into the vein for about 1 hour.

      To help collect blood cells to study in the laboratory, participants may have a procedure
      known as leukapheresis in which blood will be removed through a needle in the arm. Some of
      the white blood cells will be separated from the blood and used for research studies to see
      how 3BNC117 and 10-1074 effects HIV and the immune system. The rest of the blood will be
      returned to the person through another needle in the arm.

      Participants will have 18 study visits over 28 weeks. They will repeat some screening tests.
      They may have leukapheresis again.

      At 8 study visits, participants will get the study products or placebo.

      All participants will be followed for at least 24 weeks after their last dose of the study
      infusions. Participants who are in the Group that stops ART will be monitored closely to make
      sure the levels of virus in their blood do not go to high. If at any time during this the
      study a person develops HIV-related symptoms, or if the viral levels go up to high levels for
      more than 4 weeks, ART will be restarted and no further infusions of 3BNC117 and 10-1074 will
      be given.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent advances in antibody cloning technologies have led to the discovery of a number of
      highly potent and HIV-specific broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (bNAbs) from B
      cells of HIV-infected individuals. It has been shown that certain bNAbs can prevent
      acquisition of the virus, suppress viral replication, delay and/or prevent plasma viral
      rebound following treatment interruption in Simian Immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected
      animals and block cell-to-cell transmission of laboratory-adapted HIV in vitro. In light of
      these encouraging outcomes, a number of clinical trials have been conducted in recent years
      in order to explore the feasibility of achieving sustained virologic suppression using a
      single bNAb in HIV-infected individuals following analytical treatment interruption (ATI).
      Despite the fact that repeated administration of a single bNAb was safe and well-tolerated,
      the vast majority of study subjects experienced plasma viral rebound following ATI, clearly
      demonstrating that successful passive immunotherapy will require different approach,
      including the use of a combination of 2 or more bNAbs to achieve extended periods of
      virologic suppression.

      Given a major emphasis on current HIV research lies in the possibility of achieving ART-free
      virologic remission, it is of great interest to investigate whether a combination of potent
      HIV- specific bNAbs, such as 3BNC117 and 10-1074, can prevent plasma viral rebound in
      infected individuals upon discontinuation of ART or suppress viral replication in subjects
      who are not taking ART.

The total duration of therapy is 24 weeks; the duration may be shorter if criteria listed in section 3.1 are met. The dose of both 3BNC117 and 10- 1074 for this study is 30 mg/kg in 250 ml normal saline. The two antibodies will be mixed in separate bags of saline for sequential administration. To prepare an IV infusion, the pharmacist will calculate the total milligrams of each antibody needed, thaw the minimum number of vials needed to obtain the full dose and add the calculated total milligrams needed to a final volume of 250 ml of normal saline using good pharmacy practices to maintain sterility. The infusion solution must be used within 3 hours. Any unused portion of an antibody vial will not be used for another subject.</description>

        Reproductive Risks

        Contraception: The effects of 3BNC117 and 10-1074 on the developing human fetus are
        unknown. For this reason, men and women of childbearing potential must agree to use
        adequate pregnancy prevention. This includes the use an effective method of contraception
        (i.e. condom with spermicide, diaphragm with spermicide, hormone-eluting IUD, hormone-based
        contraceptive with condom) for the study duration. Subjects should also agree to use a male
        or female condom while off ART. Pregnancy prevention must be practiced continuously for the
        duration of study participation. Females of childbearing-age must have a negative pregnancy
        test result prior to receiving each infusion of 3BNC117/10-1074. During the course of the
        study, if a female subject, or the partner of a male subject suspects or in fact becomes
        pregnant, the effected subject should inform the study staff immediately, as well as the
        woman s primary care physician.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Chronic hepatitis B, as evidenced by a positive test for hepatitis B surface antigen

             (HBsAg), or chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, as evidenced by a positive test
             for HCV RNA. Subjects with a positive test for HCV antibody and a negative test for
             HCV RNA are eligible.

          2. HIV immunotherapy or vaccine(s) received within 1 year prior to screening.

          3. Any licensed or experimental non-HIV vaccination (e.g., hepatitis B, influenza,
             pneumococcal polysaccharide) received within 2 weeks prior to study enrollment.

          4. Receipt of other investigational study agent within 28 days of enrollment.

          5. Any active malignancy that may require systemic chemotherapy or radiation therapy.

          6. Systemic immunosuppressive medications received within 3 months prior to enrollment
             (Not excluded: [1] corticosteroid nasal spray or inhaler; [2] topical corticosteroids
             for mild, uncomplicated dermatitis; or [3] oral/parenteral corticosteroids
             administered for non-chronic conditions not expected to recur [length of therapy less
             than or equal to10 days, with completion in greater than or equal to 30 days prior to
             enrollment]).

          7. History or other clinical evidence of:

               1. Significant or unstable cardiac or cerebrovascular disease (e.g., angina,
                  congestive heart failure, recent stroke or myocardial infarction).

               2. Severe illness, malignancy, immunodeficiency other than HIV, or any other
                  condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would make the subject
                  unsuitable for the study.

          8. Active drug or alcohol use or any other pattern of behavior that, in the opinion of
             the investigator, would interfere with adherence to study requirements.

          9. Pregnancy or breast-feeding at time of screening.

         10. Documented multiclass antiretroviral drug resistance that, in the judgment of the
             investigator, would pose a risk of virologic failure should additional mutations
             develop during the study (Group 1 only).

        Co-enrollment Guidelines: Co-enrollment in other trials is restricted to observational
        studies or those evaluating the use of a licensed medication and is subject to approval of
        the principal investigator (PI).
