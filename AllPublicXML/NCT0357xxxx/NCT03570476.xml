  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well olaparib works in treating participants with prostate
      cancer that has not spread to other parts of the body (localized). Olaparib may stop the
      growth of tumor cells by interfering with the activity of a substance called PARP, which is
      inside cells. Giving olaparib before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount
      of normal tissue that needs to be removed.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess the pathological complete response rate following olaparib when administered as
      neoadjuvant therapy prior to prostatectomy in patients with localized prostate cancer
      containing homozygous or complementary deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA] repair deficiency.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the rate of positive surgical margins, extracapsular extension, positive
      seminal vesicles and lymph nodes at the time of prostatectomy.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive olaparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for 90 days in the absence of
      unacceptable toxicity. Beginning 1 day after last olaparib dose, participants undergo radical
      prostatectomy.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up for 30 days.
