  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Death in overdose is the single most common cause of death in people using heroin. In Sweden,
      the number of drug-related overdose deaths has increased gradually since the early 1990s. The
      purpose of the study is to investigate the effects of a Naloxone distribution program in
      Skåne County. The primary issue is whether the project had an effect on overdose mortality
      and overdose related injuries.
