  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oxidative stress is recognized as a important factor in the pathogenesis premature birth.
      Preterm birth is defined as delivery before 37 completed weeks of gestation and it is the
      leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. The investigators conducted this analysis
      to investigate the safety of administration of Atosiban - a reversible, competitive
      antagonist of the oxytocin receptor in the treatment of preterm labor and its impact on the
      level of oxidative stress after 48 hours of tocolytic treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atosiban (1-(3-mercaptopropanoic
      acid)-2-(O-ethyl-D-tyrosine)-4-L-threonine-8-L-ornithine-oxytocin) is licensed for clinical
      use in women suffering from threatened premature birth and is widely used in clinical
      practice in Europe because of its low side effect profile. The impact of Atosiban on
      pregnancy outcomes in women has been investigated in recent years and the research has shown
      its ability to reduce intracytoplasmic calcium release and downregulate prostaglandin
      synthesis as oxytocin receptor antagonist. While a role of Atosiban in the modulation of
      myometrial contractility is well-described, its effect on many other functions is not so well
      known.

      The serum and plasma samples take for the measurement of total oxidant status (TOS), total
      antioxidant status (TAS), level of 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT), and carbonyl and thiol groups will
      be stored at -70°C in aliquots for subsequent biochemical analysis and processed within two
      months.

    <description>The initial dose of Atosiban (Tractocile, Ferring Pharmaceuticals A/S, Copenhagen, Denmark) will be give as a single intravenous bolus dose (6.75 mg in 0.9 ml isotonic sodium chloride solution). This will be follow immediately by intravenous infusion of 300 μg/min of Atosiban in 5% glucose for 3 hours, and then 100 μg/min for up to 48 hours. Venous blood samples from a forearm vein will take before and after 48 hours of continuous administration tocolytic therapy with Atosiban.</description>
