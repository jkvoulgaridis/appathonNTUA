  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HIPPON 100 is a national, multicentre, prospective, retrospective, descriptive and
      non-interventional study, in patients having a Y-STRUT® medical device implanted to prevent a
      high risk of impending pathological fracture.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of the studied medical
      device by measuring the frequency of patient with a fracture at the implantation site within
      1 year after implantation.

      A total of 100 patients from France will be enrolled (until November 2018) and followed up to
      24 months.
