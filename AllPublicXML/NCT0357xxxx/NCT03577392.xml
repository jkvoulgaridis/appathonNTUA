    <description>Endostar is a recombinat human endostatin with antiangiogenic properties that has been useful in treating a wide range of cancers and shows promise for use in combination treatment for advanced colorectal cancer. The dose of Recombinant human endostatin on day -5 was calculated according to the patients's body surface area, to provide a CIV 7 days' dose in physiological saline to 240mL volume.</description>
