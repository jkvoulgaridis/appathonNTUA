  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to compare the effectiveness of two therapeutic protocols in the
      treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection.

      The hypothesis of our research is that the two therapeutic options (hybrid and concomitant
      therapy) will be equally successful in the treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection. In
      other words, in both therapeutic groups we expect successful treatment of Helicobacter pylori
      infection in or more than 90 % of patients.

      In other studies, both therapeutic options have the same efficacy in treating H. pylori
      infection. On the other had there are no studies available in Croatia to compare the
      effectiveness of these therapeutic options so far, which is the main objective of our
      research. The secondary goals of our study will be: the existence of differences in the
      occurrence of possible side effects, as well as the compliance between patients in both
      therapeutic options. It is also our aim to compare the quality of life of patients with
      Helicobacter pylori infection before and after treatment, via a questionnaire that is common
      for this purpose.

      The study is expected to include a total of 174 patients (87 patients in each therapy group),
      and the planned duration is 6 months.

    <description>Quality of life before and after eradication (both groups combined) therapy will be reported by The Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) questionnaire. GSRS questionnaire: 15 items combined into five symptom clusters depicting Reflux, Abdominal pain, Indigestion, Diarrhoea and Constipation. The GSRS has a seven-point graded Likert-type scale where 1 represents no discomfort at all, 2 - minor discomfort, 3 -mild discomfort, 4 - moderate discomfort, 5 -moderately severe discomfort, 6 -severe discomfort, 7 - very severe discomfort</description>
