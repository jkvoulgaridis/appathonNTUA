  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eligible patients with estrogen receptor positive breast cancer will undergo a biopsy and be
      randomized to receive tamoxifen (T) versus tamoxifen with palbociclib (PT) in a 1:1 ratio.
      After 1 cycle (28 days) another biopsy will be obtained, and both arms will receive avelumab
      (A) for 3 additional cycles. Patients will then undergo breast surgery.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be treated with tamoxifen (20mg PO daily) +/- palbociclib (125mg PO daily for
      21 days, 7 days off ) for 1 cycle (1 cycle =28 days) and undergo a repeat biopsy, MRI, and
      blood draw at Cycle 2, Day 1. Afterwards avelumab will be added to both arms. Avelumab will
      be administered 10mg/kg IV every 14 days (1 cycle = 2 doses = 28 days). Patients will be
      treated for 3 cycles of avelumab with tamoxifen +/- palbociclib (thus 4 cycles total,
      including run-in without avelumab). Patients will be treated so long as there is no clinical
      evidence of progression and therapy is tolerated. Patients who experience progressive disease
      (25% increase) of their tumor will cease study treatment and undergo end-of-study assessment
      (including repeat MRI) and surgery. Otherwise, patients completing all 4 cycles of therapy
      will undergo MRI and surgery.

          -  May not be receiving immunosuppressive therapy within 2 weeks of study entry.

             participation or study treatment administration or may interfere with the
             interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make
             the patient inappropriate for entry into this study

          -  Vaccination within 4 weeks of the first dose of avelumab and while on trials is
