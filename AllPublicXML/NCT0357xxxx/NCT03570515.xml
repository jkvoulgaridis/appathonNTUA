  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see whether adults with Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) are
      willing to be in a 12-week study where they have a 50-50 chance of being placed in either a
      gentle yoga program or a film-based education program designed for people with RLS. If so, do
      they complete the program, and does their RLS, sleep, mood, or quality of life improve?

               1. symptoms that meet all five of the International RLS Study Group essential
                  diagnostic criteria for RLS (i.e., 1) an urge to move the legs, often associated
                  with discomfort or disagreeable sensations in the legs, that 2) begins or worsen
                  during periods of rest or inactivity; 3) is partially or totally relieved by
                  movement; 4) is worse or only occurs in the evening or night; and 5) is not
                  solely accounted for by another condition (e.g. leg cramps, positional
                  discomfort, habitual foot tapping));

               2. RLS symptoms at least 1x/wk for the previous 3 months;

               3. a score of at least 2 points (moderate) IRLS question 6: &quot;How severe was your RLS

               4. RLS diagnostic criteria applied as per training by the study physician, a sleep
                  medicine expert; these criteria will help ensure exclusion of mimics (e.g. leg
                  cramps, positional discomfort).

          -  willingness and ability to complete the 12-week yoga or educational film program and
             all study assessments;

          -  willingness to avoid use of any new drugs or treatments other than the assigned

          -  currently on dopaminergic agents (eg, ropinirole, pramipexole) or anti-psychotic
             medication;

          -  changed dosage if any other central nervous system agents (e.g., sedative hypnotics,
             gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) analogs, narcotic analgesics, antiadrenergic agents, or
             anticonvulsants) within the past 3 months;

          -  any orthopedic, neurologic or other condition that might prevent safe completion of a
             12-week yoga program or confound assessments (e.g., neuropathy; Parkinson's disease;
             stroke; rheumatoid arthritis; renal failure; uncontrolled sleep apnea; recent (within
             the last 6 months) myocardial infarction; heart failure; cancer (other than
             non-melanoma skin cancer);
