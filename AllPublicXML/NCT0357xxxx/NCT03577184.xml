      Galvecta Plus is a combination of Vildagliptin and Metformin hydrochloride. Combination drug
      with complementary mechanisms of action, provides efficacy and allows to reach glycemic
      targets compared to continuing metformin monotherapy and is used as an oral hypoglycemic in
      Type II diabetes mellitus that shows potential to achieve better blood glucose without
      increasing the risk of hypoglycemia, exposing to weight gain and altering common
      cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension and lipid profile). The fact that Vildagliptin with
      metformin substantially enhances the incretin effect. Vildagliptin belongs to dipeptidyl
      peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor. Inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) by Vildagliptin
      prevents degradation of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and reduces glycaemia in patients
      with type 2 diabetes mellitus, with low risk for hypoglycemia and no weight gain and
      metformin is a Biguanides with antihyperglycaemic effects, lowering both basal and
      postprandial plasma glucose. It does not stimulate insulin secretion and therefore does not
      produce hypoglycemia.
