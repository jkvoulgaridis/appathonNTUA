      To evaluate the safety and efficacy of aprepitant combined with ondansetron and dexamethasone
      to prevent nausea and vomiting induced by Intensity-modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT)
      cisplatin-chemotherapy regimen in locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the complete response rate, nause-free rate, vomiting-free rate, and the quality
      of life of aprepitant combined with ondansetron and dexamethasone for the nausea and vomiting

    <description>Intensity-modulated radiotherapy was given to the patients with regimen of 69.96 Gy-73.92 Gy to the gross target volume of nasopharynx,69.96 Gy to the gross target volume of positive nodes, 60.06 Gy the high risk clinical target volume, 50.96 Gy to the low risk clinical target volume. Concurrent chemotherapy is administrated with cisplatin 100mg/m2 at d1, d22, d43 during radiotherapy. Patients receive concurrent aprepitant 125mg, dexamethasone 12mg, and ondansetron 8mg p.o. on day1. AND then patients received aprepitant 80mg, dexamethasone 8mg on day 2-5 at every chemotherapy cycle.</description>
