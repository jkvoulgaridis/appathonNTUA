    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to describe the clinical and economic burden in adults and
      infants/children less than or equal to 5 years of age by type of respiratory pathogen
      (respiratory syncytial virus [RSV], influenza A, and human metapneumovirus [hMPV] in adults;
      RSV and hMPV in infants/children) based on medical resource utilization; rate and type of
      complications during and after hospitalization; mortality; rate and reasons of
      re-hospitalization related to index hospitalization; post-discharge care information and
      International Classification of Diseases 9th/10th revision (ICD-9/10)/Diagnostic-related
      Group (DRG) codes used (distribution).

    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 4, Day 6 and Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>The hospital recovery scale assesses a participant's clinical status.

    <time_frame>At ICU admission (up to maximum 12 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The APACHE II is a validated severity of disease classification system. It uses a point score based on initial values of 12 routine physiologic measurements (temperature, mean arterial pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygenation, arterial pH, serum sodium, potassium, and creatinine, hematocrit, white blood cell count, Glasgow coma score), age, and previous health status to provide a general measure of severity of disease. An increasing score (range 0 to 71) is closely correlated with subsequent risk of hospital death for intensive care admissions.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Simplified Acute Physiology Scores 3 (SAPS 3) in Adults at ICU Admission and the Relevance on MRU by Type of Respiratory Pathogen</measure>
    <time_frame>At ICU admission (up to maximum 12 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The SAPS 3 consists of 20 variables: age, co-morbidities, use of vasoactive drugs before ICU admission, intrahospital location before ICU admission, and length of stay in the hospital before ICU admission, reason(s) for ICU admission, planned/unplanned ICU admission, surgical status at ICU admission, anatomic site of surgery, and presence of infection at ICU admission and place acquired, lowest estimated Glasgow coma scale, highest heart rate, lowest systolic blood pressure, highest bilirubin, highest body temperature, highest creatinine, highest leukocytes, lowest platelets, lowest hydrogen ion concentration (pH), and ventilatory support and oxygenation. Score varies from a minimum of 0 points to a maximum of 217 points. Higher scores indicate higher severity.</description>

    <measure>Medical Resources Utilization by Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>MRU in adults by eGFR at baseline that is before hospitalization will be collected. The glomerular filtration rate is an indicator of renal function and is calculated based on serum creatinine.</description>

    <measure>ReSVinet score used at Time of Admission to the Hospital in Infants/Children, and Relevance on MRU by Type of Respiratory Pathogen</measure>
    <time_frame>At Admission (Day 1)</time_frame>
    <description>ReSVinet scale is based on seven parameters (feeding intolerance, medical intervention, respiratory difficulty, respiratory frequency, apnoea, general condition, fever) which are assigned different values (from 0 to 3) for a total of 20 points. Higher scores indicate higher severity.</description>
