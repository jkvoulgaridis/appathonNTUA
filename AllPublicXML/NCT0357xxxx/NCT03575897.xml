  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite evidence that both rapid weight gain and excessive body fat accrual are associated
      with overweight and obesity, usual neonatal care of preterm infants does not include
      assessment of body fat accrual. The study hypothesis is that identification of early changes
      in infant body composition (i.e. amount of fat mass and fat-free mass) reduces % body fat at
      3 months of age.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infants in the intervention group will have the information about infant body composition
      known to the clinicians caring for them (including reference data). Infants in the control
      group will also undergo serial measurements of infant body composition, but this information
      will not be available to the clinicians.

      If parent agrees, stool &quot;dirty&quot; diapers will be collected 2 times (at the time of hospital
      discharge and at 3 months of corrected age).
