      Open-label non-randomised phase Ib/II study conducted in two stages. Stage 1 will be dose
      escalation in a modified classical 6+6 design. Stage 2 will be an expansion cohort to gain
      additional information on safety and efficacy at the recommended phase II dose of
      acalabrutinib.

    <masking_description>A multicentre open-label non-randomised phase Ib/II two stage trial. Stage 1 - dose escalation will proceed until a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is defined or the maximal administered dose (MAD) is determined in order to define the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D). 6 - 24 patients. Stage 2 - expansion to gain additional information on safety and efficacy at the RP2D from a total of 15 patients recruited.
Patients will receive conventionally dosed R-CHOP chemotherapy for 6 cycles with acalabrutinib introduced on cycle 2 onwards, at a dosage according to cohort number. This will allow for both clarity in the toxicity profile of the combination and also assess the impact of acalabrutinib on ADCC.
patients who do not complete six cycles of treatment for reasons other than toxicity will be replaced.</masking_description>

          -  Men must agree to refrain from sperm donation during the study and for 12 months after
             the last treatment dose.

             compromise the ability to give informed consent.

          -  Prior malignancy (other than DLBCL), except for adequately treated basal cell or
             squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, or other cancer from which the
             subject has been disease free for ≥ 2 years or which will not limit survival to &lt; 2
             years. Note: these cases must be discussed with SCTU.

          -  Malabsorption syndrome, disease significantly affecting gastrointestinal function,
             resection of the stomach or small bowel, gastric bypass, symptomatic inflammatory
             bowel disease, or partial or complete bowel obstruction or gastric restrictions and
             bariatric surgery, such as gastric bypass.

          -  Any immunotherapy within 4 weeks of 1st dose of the study.
