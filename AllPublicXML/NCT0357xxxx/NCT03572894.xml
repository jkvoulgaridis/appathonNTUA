  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pleth Variability Index (PVI) is a non-invasive and automated measure of the respiratory
      variations of plethysmography during mechanical ventilation. PVI is extracted via an
      algorithm implemented on Masimo Radical 7 device (Masimo, Irvine, CA). PVI is commonly used
      in anesthesiology and has been validated to predict fluid responsiveness and optimize fluid
      administration in the surgical setting. However, the signal/noise ratio of PVI makes acute
      changes in PVI somewhat difficult to interpret at the bedside. Subsequently, a new algorithm
      entitled RPVI (Rainbow Pleth Variability Index), has been developed in order to improve the
      signal/noise ratio of PVI and facilitate its clinical use by practitioners. The details of
      this new proprietary built-in algorithm are unknown and no data are available to date.
      Therefore, the main objective of the study was to compare RPVI and PVI during dynamic changes
      in venous return induced by a tidal volume (Vt) challenge during mechanical ventilation in
      anesthetized patients. The hypothesis was that the agreement between both dynamic indices
      would be good.
