  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) is a common adverse effect in treatment of
      cancer, which influences the quality of life and adherence to treatment of patients and leads
      to dehydration, malnutrition and even death. Prevention and relieving the CINV is an
      important step to ensure the conduction of chemotherapy. Mechanism of CINV remains to be
      obscure, while most studies showed that it is mainly related to the following respects: ⑴
      Chemotherapeutic agents stimulate gastrointestinal tract, which induces the release of
      neurotransmitters by chromaffin cells. Neurotransmitters bind to corresponding receptors, and
      then results in vomiting by stimulating the vomiting center; ⑵ Chemotherapeutic agents and
      the metabolites of them activate chemoreceptors directly, which causes vomiting. ⑶ Feeling
      and mental factors irritate cerebral cortex pathway directly. There are studies suggested
      that 5- hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) was related to acute nausea and vomiting induced by
      chemotherapy, which means 5-HT receptor antagonist would be a effective medicine for acute
      CINV. In addition, there are researches proclaimed that neurokinin-1 (NK-1) receptor
      antagonist, aprepitant, is a potent agent to relieve CINV. Thus, correlative guidelines
      recommend regimens with 5-HT receptor antagonist, NK-1 receptor antagonist and glucocorticoid
      as the standard treatment for strongly emetic chemotherapy regimens. But the prevention of
      moderately emetic chemotherapy regimens remains to be a problem in clinical practice.
      Besides, there is no study to demonstrate differences of mechanisms between acute CINV and
      delayed CINV. Olanzapine inhibits kinds of neurotransmitters which cause CINV, it is why this
      medicine is effective in both acute and delayed CINV. It can also alleviate anxiety, improve
      sleep quality and relieve pain in patients with cancer. The most common adverse effects of
      olanzapine are lethargy, body mass increase, fatigue, dry mouth, constipation, hyperlipidemia
      and hyperglycemia. Among them, the most common one is lethargy, which can oppose insomnia and
      excitation caused by dexamethasone. In a word, olanzapine is an agent with mild adverse
      effects, it is worth to be generalized. But there are still problems to be resolved in the
      application of olanzapine in CINV: ⑴ Aprepitant is expensive and not covered in medical care
      in China, which limits the application in patients. ⑵There is no large clinical trial to
      confirm the efficacy and safety of olanzapine in Chinese populations. To explore these issues
      better, investigators intend to compare the regimen with olanzapine, dexamethasone and 5-HT
      receptor antagonists with the regimen with placebo, dexamethasone and 5-HT receptor
      antagonists about the efficacy and adverse events in treatment of CINV. Investigators aim to
      provide an available therapeutic options for CINV, improve the quality of life and prolong
      the survival of patients with lung cancer.
