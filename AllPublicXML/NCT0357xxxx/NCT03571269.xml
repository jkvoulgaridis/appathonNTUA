    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled study of whether stent implantation in STEMI patients with ≤70%
      coronary stenosis was designed. A total of 240 STEMI patients with coronary artery diameter
      stenosis ≤ 70% were randomly assigned to either an OCT-guided group or an angiography-guided
      group. OCT guidance group: Stent implantation or drug therapy is determined based on the
      stability of the culprit lesions by the OCT. Angiographic guide group: According to the
      results of coronary angiography, stent implantation or drug treatment was determined.
      Comparing two groups the implantation rate, the incidence of HF within one year, the
      incidence of MACE, and the safety end point were used to investigate the effectiveness and
      safety of endovascular imaging in STEMI emergency intervention strategies.

      This study is a prospective, randomized, controlled multicenter clinical study. Twenty
      hundred and forty AMI patients (according to all the inclusion criteria and did not meet any
      exclusion criteria) who were enrolled in the culprit who had a lesion stenosis ≤70% and who
      had TIMI blood flow grade 3 or residual stenosis ≤70% after thrombus aspiration and TIMI
      grade 3 were randomized Enter the OCT guidance group or the imaging guide group. For the OCT
      guidance group, if the OCT examination indicates that the patient's lesion features a plaque
      rupture, dissection, and severe calcification, the stent is implanted. If the lesion is
      characterized by plaque erosion, conservative treatment with drugs is used. For the contrast
      guide group, the surgeon judges the lesion according to the current treatment standard and
      decides whether to implant the stent. All subjects underwent outpatient follow-up in January
      after discharge from the hospital. Exercise stress test was needed to assess whether any
      recurrent ischemic events occurred. At 3, 6 and 9 months, telephone or outpatient visits were
      used. Follow-up visits were performed at the 12th month of follow-up and coronary angiography
      was performed. At each follow-up, general conditions, uncomfortable complaints, oral
      medications, recent related test results, and adverse events were required.

    <description>OCT examination methods and precautions are the same as above. The operator judges the lesion according to the feature of culprit lesions from OCT. If a stent is implanted, postoperative OCT examination is performed. Based on the operator's experience, it is judged whether post-dilatation is necessary. Patients undergoing stent implantation should be treated with aspirin for at least 12 months.</description>

    <description>CAG examination methods and precautions are the same as above. Patients undergoing conventional angiography and/or thrombus aspiration do not undergo OCT. The operator judges the lesion according to the current treatment standard and decides whether to implant the stent. If a stent is implanted, postoperative angiography (also required to meet the above body position requirements) is performed. Based on the operator's experience, it is judged whether post-dilatation is necessary. Patients undergoing stent implantation should be treated with aspirin for at least 12 months.</description>
