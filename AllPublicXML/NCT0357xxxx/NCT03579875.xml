    <textblock>
      This is a phase II trial of T cell receptor alpha/beta depletion (α/β TCD) hematopoietic cell
      transplantation (HCT) transplantation in patients with Fanconi anemia (FA) to eliminate the
      need for routine graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) immune suppression leading to earlier
      immune recovery and potentially a reduction in the risk of severe infections after
      transplantation.
