      This phase Ib trial studies the best dose and side effects of eribulin mesylate when given
      together with anti-PD-L1/TGFbetaRII fusion protein M7824 (M7824) in treating patients with
      triple negative breast cancer that has spread to other places in the body. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as eribulin mesylate, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor
      cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from
      spreading. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as M7824, may help the body's
      immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow
      and spread. Giving eribulin mesylate and M7824 may work better at treating triple negative
      breast cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of eribulin mesylate (eribulin) when in
      combination with the fixed dose of M7824 in patients with metastatic triple-negative breast
      cancer (TNBC).

      II. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of M7824 when in combination with eribulin in
      patients with metastatic TNBC.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the best overall response (BOR) rate according to Response Evaluation
      Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1.

      II. To determine the overall response rate (ORR).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimation of progression-free survival (PFS) in metastatic TNBC patients treated with
      M7824 in combination with eribulin.

      II. To assess immunologic/molecular responses to M7824 in combination with eribulin in
      patients with metastatic TNBC, by performing correlative studies on tissue samples to
      evaluate systemic and tumor biomarkers of response and resistance to M7824 and eribulin.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive anti-PD-L1/TGFbetaRII fusion protein M7824 intravenously (IV) over 50-80
      minutes on days 1, 15, and 29, and eribulin mesylate IV over 2-5 minutes on days 1, 8, 22,
      and 29. Treatment repeats every 42 days for up to 1 year in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 90 days.
