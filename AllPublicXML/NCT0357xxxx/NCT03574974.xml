  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of neurofeedback (NF) of
      real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rt-fMRI) data of the amygdala with regards
      to the reduction of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms.

      A secondary purpose of this study is to use fMRI as a method of investigating brain function
      in individuals with PTSD. This study approach provides a tool for probing the neurobiology of
      PTSD by (1) testing the critical role of the amygdala in this disorder, and by (2) examining
      how amygdala connectivity is related to both amygdala regulation and clinical symptoms.

      In pursuit of the overarching goals of this study, the investigators aim to:

        -  determine if an experimental feedback intervention increases control over the region of
           interest (the amygdala) more than a control feedback intervention in which participants
           receive feedback that is unassociated with their PTSD symptoms.

        -  determine if an experimental feedback intervention results in clinical improvements in
           PTSD symptoms relative to a control feedback intervention, and examine whether these
           improvements correlate with improved control over the amygdala.

        -  determine if an experimental feedback intervention results in changes in resting state
           connectivity to the amygdala, and whether these changes correlate with symptom
           improvement and an improved ability to regulate the amygdala.

    <description>Clinical improvement will be defined as the change from baseline at the post-intervention assessments (based on the past-month Clinician-Administered PTSD scale for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-V ) [CAPS-5]). A higher score is associated with higher severity of PTSD. The score is interpreted as follows: 0-19 = asymptomatic/few symptoms, 20-39 = sub-threshold/mild PTSD, 40-59 = threshold/moderate PTSD, 60-79 = severe PTSD, &gt;80 = extreme PTSD.</description>

    <description>Feedback is presented in the form of a line graph that is updated every 2 seconds throughout the scan to indicate activity in the target area. A red diamond will indicate periods of symptom provocation, during which participants are exposed to symptom-provoking auditory stimuli in the form of personalized trauma scripts and sound clips. A blue arrow will indicate periods of down-regulation, where participants will try to bring the feedback line down as much as possible (by trying to decrease their fear/anxiety). The investigators believe that this feedback may help participants learn to control their PTSD symptoms.
Participants will attend a total of 18 feedback scans over the course of 3 sessions.</description>
