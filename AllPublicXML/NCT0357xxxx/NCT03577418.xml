  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dementia is a highly disabling major neurocognitive disorder. Although cognitive symptoms
      drive the diagnosis of dementia, neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS), such as agitation,
      aggression, and psychosis, are common and associated with increased morbidity/mortality,
      increased care partner distress, and earlier institutionalization. Although these symptoms
      are debilitating and experienced by more than 90% of people with dementia, there are
      currently no FDA-approved treatments. There remains a critical need for safe and effective
      interventions for NPS that can be easily administered and monitored in typical clinical
      settings.

      One hypothesis for the etiology of NPS is that, as cognitive impairment progresses, there is
      a decline in the sense of autonomy and an increase in unmet needs that a person with dementia
      (PWD) is unable to meet on his/her own and that care partners lack the knowledge or ability
      to meet. As care partners become increasingly involved as surrogate decision-makers for a
      PWD, the quality of life for a PWD is directly impacted by the decisions made by a surrogate.
      Several studies have explored agreement between PWDs and surrogate decision-makers regarding
      various preferences. Results have indicated that discrepancy between a PWD's preferences and
      those identified by a surrogate decision-maker is common.

      According to our conceptual model, such discrepancy may give rise to NPS. Thus, the proposed
      pilot project directly addresses major gaps in the availability of safe, effective, and
      accessible strategies to reduce NPS and NPS-related care partner distress by developing and
      testing a novel educational intervention that directly targets discrepancies regarding
      everyday preferences. We will randomize 30 dyads comprising people with clinically
      significant cognitive impairment (mild cognitive impairment or dementia) and their care
      partners. The dyads will be randomized to either 1) the intervention arm in which there is a
      clinician-facilitated discussion between the dyad pair about NPS, the unmet needs hypothesis,
      and areas of discrepancy in everyday preferences and 2) the enhanced usual care arm in which
      a standardized document describing NPS and the unmet needs hypothesis will be given to the
      dyad to review. Primary efficacy will be measured by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory brief
      questionnaire form (NPI-Q), which allows for assessment of both NPS burden as well as burden
      of caregiver stress. Assessments will be made at baseline, week 4, and week 8.

    <description>Change in Neuropsychiatric Inventory brief questionnaire form (NPI-Q). The NPI-Q measures the burden of 12 neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia: delusions, hallucinations, agitation/aggression, depression/dysphoria, anxiety, elation/euphoria, apathy/indifference, disinhibition, irritability/lability, motor disturbance, nighttime behaviors, and appetite/eating. Symptom severity is rated on a 3-point scale with higher scores indicating worse symptoms. Minimum score would be 0 and maximum score would be 36.</description>

    <description>People with dementia (PWD) will complete the Preferences for Everyday Living (PELI). Care partners will complete the PELI from the perspective of the PWD (i.e., as if acting as surrogate decision-makers). Research staff will then review these assessments, highlighting areas of discrepancy in the importance of various preferences. A 30-minute preferences-based discussion will then be facilitated by the research clinician. This discussion will include review of the discrepancies identified in the assessments. The PWD and the care partners will then be encouraged to identify one area of discrepancy and to come together with a concrete action plan to resolve that area of discrepancy. A standardized document describing neuropsychiatric symptoms and reviewing the unmet needs hypothesis will be discussed with PWD and the care partners.</description>
