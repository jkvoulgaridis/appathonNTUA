  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      India's poor tribal communities have far worse health and social indicators than the general
      population. Most tribal people live in remote forested or desert areas where illiteracy,
      trying physical environments, malnutrition, inadequate access to potable water, and lack of
      personal hygiene and sanitation make them more vulnerable to disease.The aim of Chhatralaya
      initiatives taken by Arsha Vidya, Jaipur was to address the exclusion of the socially and
      economically disadvantaged children of the tribes and to provide a fair opportunity to all.
