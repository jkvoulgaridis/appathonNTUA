      The need for assisted-technology at home reflects some of the most serious health-related
      conditions faced by children with physical and developmental disabilities.
      'Technology-dependent' is often used in the literature to describe children &quot;who need both a
      medical device to compensate for the loss of a vital body function and substantial and
      ongoing nursing care to avert death or further disability&quot;. Parenting a child is stressful
      and challenging, and even under ideal circumstances the care of a child with complex needs
      requires greater than normal parenting skills. Studies have showed that parents of children
      whose illness require assisted-technology experience significant emotional stress, potential
      gaps in social support, and social isolation leading to lower quality of life, unhealthy
      family functioning, and negative psychological consequences.

      This study intends to assess the feasibility and efficacy of a tele-psychotherapy (Tele-P)
      intervention as a way to promote the emotional functioning of parents and to help increase
      the quality of life of children that are technology-dependent in the Greater Boston Area. It
      is hypothesized that parents who adhere to psychotherapy sessions via videoconferencing
      (Tele-P) will demonstrate significant reductions in symptoms of depression, anxiety and
      social isolation. Children of parents in the (Tele-P) condition will show significantly
      greater improvements in their quality of life including their physical health, mental health,
      family life, free time, and general life enjoyment.

      A randomized controlled trial is proposed in order to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy
      of a tele-psychotherapy intervention for parents of technology-dependent children at the
      Critical Care, Anesthesia and Perioperative Extension (CAPE) program in Boston Children's
      Hospital.

      This study will serve as model for social workers to perform an intervention for parent's
      raising technology-dependent children. This study proposes that tele-psychotherapy be a means
      of advocating for this underserved population.

      Efficacy and Feasibility of a tele-psychotherapy intervention to support parents caring for a
      technology-dependent child at home.

      Caring for a technology-dependent child at home is a challenging experience for parents.
      Global family functioning, lifestyles changes and vocational decisions are affected. Parents
      of children whose chronic illness require assisted-technology experience significant
      emotional stress, potential gaps in social support, and social isolation leading to lower
      quality of life, unhealthy family functioning, and negative psychological consequences.

      This study intends to evaluate a tele-psychotherapy (Tele-P) intervention as a way to promote
      the emotional functioning of parents and secondarily increase the quality of life of children
      that are home technology-dependent in the Greater Boston Area. The sample will consist of
      parents of children that are technology-dependent in the Critical Care, Anesthesia and
      Perioperative Extension (CAPE) Program at Boston Children's Hospital.

      Specific Aim 1) To assess the feasibility of delivering a cognitive behavioral Tele-P
      intervention for parents of children that are technology-dependent in the Critical Care,
      Anesthesia and Perioperative Extension (CAPE) Program at Boston Children's Hospital.

      Hypothesis 1: Parents and therapist will adhere to 8 psychotherapy sessions via
      videoconferencing.

      Hypothesis 2: Cost analysis evaluation will validate the feasibility of the intervention vs.
      usual care (UC) and standard face-to-face therapy sessions.

      Specific Aim 2) To evaluate the efficacy of a Tele-P intervention relative to UC in
      management of mental health conditions amongst parents of children with chronic respiratory
      failure.

      Hypothesis 1: Relative to parents assigned to the UC condition, those in the (Tele-P)
      condition will: a) demonstrate significant reductions in symptoms of depression, b)
      significant reductions in symptoms of anxiety and c) significantly less social isolation.

      Hypothesis 2: Improvement in mental health symptoms will be sustained for the duration of
      therapy.

      Specific Aim 3) To assess whether a Tele-P intervention increases the quality of life of
      children in the Critical Care, Anesthesia and Perioperative Extension (CAPE) Program at
      Boston Children's Hospital.

      Hypothesis 1: Children of parents participating in Tele-P will show significantly greater
      improvements in their quality of life relative to their UC counterparts on outcomes of a)
      physical health, b) mental health (happiness, wellbeing), c) family life, d) free time, and
      e) general life enjoyment.

      Background and Significance

      'Technology-dependent' is often used in the literature to describe children &quot;who need both a
      medical device to compensate for the loss of a vital body function and substantial and
      ongoing nursing care to avert death or further disability&quot;. Approximately 1.2 million
      children and adolescents in the United States require durable medical equipment to survive.
      In the early 1990's, surveys estimated that over 2,200 children in Massachusetts were
      dependent upon some degree of assisted medical technology. The number of ventilator-dependent
      children in the Boston community had since increased threefold, representing increased
      survival of low birth weight infants and those with chronic life-limiting illnesses. Recent
      studies have shown that technology-dependent children comprise 20% of all pediatric patients
      discharged from the hospital to home, yet they account for 61% of all healthcare resources
      used by children. While advances in medical care have brought children with chronic health
      conditions life-saving and sustaining advances, healthcare systems are inadequately
      structured to meet their ongoing comprehensive needs. Most of these children are cared for at
      home by parents and have substantial functional limitations including: self-care,
      self-direction, capacity for independent living and economic self-sufficiency.

      The need for assisted technology at home reflects some of the most serious health-related
      conditions faced by children with physical and developmental disabilities and their parents.
      Parenting a child is stressful and challenging, and even under ideal circumstances the care
      of a child with complex needs requires greater than normal parenting skills. Parents assume
      an altered parental role, serving as parent, care coordinator, respiratory therapist, nurse,
      and any other function that is required for 24 hour a day care. The cost of medical care,
      prescriptions, and durable medical equipment effects families independent of their employment
      and insurance states. This causes an even greater burden on these already financially,
      emotionally, and physically stressed parents. Prospects of independence, self-care,
      self-direction with growth are not viable for some of these children, contributing to an
      indeterminate need for parental effort. Cumulative toll impacts all members of the family and
      may also impact medical outcomes

      The investigators previous work showed that the parents of children whose chronic illness
      require assisted-technology experience significant emotional stress, potential gaps in social
      support, and social isolation leading to lower quality of life, unhealthy family functioning,
      and negative psychological consequences. Approximately 36-45% of mothers caring for
      technology dependent children have an escalated risk for clinical depression. Sleep
      deprivation due to anxiety about a child's condition, false monitor alarms, and the need to
      remain vigilant over the child during the night is a common theme for parents of technology
      dependent children. Data suggests sleep disruption places family caregivers at risk for poor
      health and related outcomes that may impair their daytime function and long term capacity for
      caregiving. Raising a technology-dependent child significantly impacts family functioning and
      hence the quality of life outcomes for the family. Depression and anxiety in parents
      negatively affects the quality of care a parent can provide their child. Young children
      exposed to depressed parents run a risk for delay in language, personal social gross motor,
      and fine motor development. Increase perceived parental burden and consequent family impact
      may result in negative implications on their own and their children's health related quality
      of life. Support for parents is crucial not only for the course of the disease of the child
      but also for the parents' health.

      In the Greater Boston area there are limited specialized mental health resources and it is
      increasingly difficult for parents of children that are technology-dependent to obtain
      appropriate mental health treatment. Social workers currently have few evidence-based
      inventions tested on families with chronically ill children. Immediate action is necessary to
      provide resources to parents to help them feel motivated, confident and capable of caring for
      a child. These children are extremely vulnerable and it is imperative to their quality of
      life that their parents are capable of providing appropriate care. This proposal intends to
      address this gap in parental care through Tele-P, a unique therapy via video conference, to
      help parents cope with these daily stressors. As feelings of depression, anxiety and social
      isolation decrease, parents should feel more confident and capable of caring for their child.
      Technology dependent children fully rely on their caregivers in order to not only improve
      their health but to survive. As Tele-P improves the mental health of the parent, the child's
      care and quality of life will also greatly improve.

      Tele-P can be successfully used in several therapeutic formats, has similar outcomes as face
      to face treatment, and is considered satisfactory by most patients and therapist. There are
      proven to be a number of benefits to home based tele-mental health including better adherence
      to appointments, overcoming social isolation, access to contextual information such as the
      patient's home situation, improved patient and practitioner safety and removal of fears and
      stigma attached to attending a mental health clinic. Providing therapy through
      videoconferencing relieves the parents from the stress of traveling with their technology
      dependent children, which often requires time, resources, (such as an ambulance) and money.
      For some technology-dependent children it is also dangerous for them to travel due to their
      severe diagnosis. Tele-P allows for the parents to be at home with their child, but at the
      same time be part of a social interaction. Studies have shown that &quot;facing a high burden of
      care but still being able to have sufficient social and familial contacts seems to be
      somewhat protective regarding the mental health of these parents, pointing even stronger
      towards the importance of social integration&quot;. Tele-P is a unique acceptable and sustainable
      approach to address the gap in access to services for underserved populations. Feasibility
      remains a question. The investigators experience with survey completion in this population
      suggests that time and care demands may be a limiting factor. Given the option of electronic
      paper survey in a previous study, the majority completed the latter despite computer access.
      Paper was easier to interrupt and resume if the child's care was needed.

      There is an urgent need for support of parents with technology-dependent children. Although
      researchers have identified a plethora of risks, stressors, and needs of the families with
      chronically ill child, there is a scarcity of evidence based interventions that address the
      mental health needs of parents or caregivers of children with developmental disabilities.
      Providing Tele-P is a well-suited approach for these parents and caregivers, who may be
      overwhelmed by their children's situation, anticipating future challenges and reliving past
      traumas. The results of the Tele-P sessions could also be a valuable tool to guide
      intervention with policies, resources and services that may improve family quality of life
      and outcomes for families who are raising children with developmental disabilities.
