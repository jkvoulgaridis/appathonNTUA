  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates donor site outcomes in patients receiving radial forearm free flap
      reconstruction versus ulnar forearm free flap reconstruction. Patients who meet criteria for
      forearm free flap reconstruction are randomized to receiving either radial forearm free flap
      or ulnar forearm free flap reconstruction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The radial forearm free flap and the ulnar forearm free flap are both well-described
      procedures used for free tissue transfer in reconstructive surgery. Although forearm free
      flaps are frequently performed, there is insufficient prospective data looking at the
      morbidity of the radial compared to ulnar forearm free flaps. The goal of this research study
      is to characterize the outcomes for each of these two flaps, and to determine if there is
      surgical equipoise, or if one flap is better than the other.
