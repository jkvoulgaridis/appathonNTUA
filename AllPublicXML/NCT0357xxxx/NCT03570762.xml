      Bioresorbable vascular scaffolds (BVS) are considered as a new revolution in coronary
      intervention due to their potential advantages for long term follow up. However, current
      generation BVS have also some drawbacks that restrict the use for complex lesions. Using BVS
      and drug eluting stents (DES) together -implanting DES for BVS inappropriate segments -may be
      a feasible option to avoid the disadvantages of permanent foreign body and to reduce very
      late adverse events. In this context, we investigated the clinical outcomes following
      treatment with hybrid strategy with concomitant use of BVS and DES for complex lesions. A
      single center retrospective cohort was performed enrolling 40 patients with complex lesions
      treated with hybrid approach from February 2015 up to April 2017. Lesion segments with a
      large plaque burden and/or severe calcification, aorto-ostial and bifurcation lesions that
      may be unfavorable for BVS, treated with DES. BVS and DES were implanted with minimal overlap
      of DES and BVS struts. The primary end-point was target lesion failure (TLF) which was a
      composite of cardiac death, target vessel myocardial infarction and target lesion
      revascularization (TLR). During follow-up, coronary angiography was performed when patients
      had ischemic symptoms.
