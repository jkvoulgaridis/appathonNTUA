    <textblock>
      The aim of the study was to investigate the efficacy of exercise and different size
      electrodes of neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) applications on pain, range of
      motion (ROM), muscle strength, function status and depression in knee osteoarthritis.

      60 voluntary patients were included in the study and these patients divided into three groups
      randomly. For Group 1 only exercise, for Group 2 simultaneously active contraction with NMES
      with standard size electrodes, for Group 3 simultaneously active contraction with NMES with
      large electrodes applied for 3 days per week, 18 session. Pain was measured with Visual
      analog Scale (VAS), ROM was measured with digital goniometer, muscle strength was measured
      with &quot;Hand-held&quot; dynamometer (Lafayette Instrument®, Lafayette, IN), functional status were
      measured with WOMAC (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities) Index and stair climbing
      test, balance was analysed with one leg standing test, depression was scored with Hospital
      Anxiety Depression Scale and patients satisfaction was scored with Global Rating Change
      Scales. The cases evaluated before and after treatment.

      Aim: This study investigated the effect of neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) was
      applied with different size electrodes on the functionality, pain, range of motion (ROM), and
      muscle strength in patients wtih knee osteoarthritis (OA).

      Material and Metod: Sixty patients with knee OA who received physical therapy for knee pain
      and functional disability at Istanbul University, Faculty of Health Sciences, Division of
      Physiotherapy were included. These patients divided into three groups randomly. Group 1
      applied exercise programme. Group 2 performed exercise programme with NMES with standard size
      electrodes (5×5 cm²). Group 3 performed exercise programme with NMES with large size
      electrodes (10×20 cm², 3×18 cm², 10 3×7.5 cm², 7×14 cm²) NMES was applied for 20 minutes to
      Group 2 and Group 3. The patients attended 18 treatment sessions 3 times per week in the
      physical therapy clinic and underwent assesment before treatment and after 6 weeks of
      treatment. Pain was measured with Visual Analog Scale (VAS), range of motion (ROM) was
      measured with digital goniometer, muscle strength was measured with ''Hand-held''
      dynomometer, functional status were measured with WOMAC (Western Ontario and McMaster
      Universities) Index and stair climbing test, balance was analysed with one leg standing test.
      Patients satisfaction was scored with Global Change Scales.

    <measure>WOMAC (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Index)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pain, stiffness and physical function were assessed by WOMAC before treatment versus after 6 weeks of treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) is widely used in the evaluation of Hip and Knee Osteoarthritis. It is a self-administered questionnaire consisting of 24 items divided into 3 subscales:[1]
Pain (5 items): during walking, using stairs, in bed, sitting or lying, and standing upright Stiffness (2 items): after first waking and later in the day Physical Function (17 items): using stairs, rising from sitting, standing, bending, walking, getting in / out of a car, shopping, putting on / taking off socks, rising from bed, lying in bed, getting in / out of bath, sitting, getting on / off toilet, heavy domestic duties, light domestic duties. The test questions are scored on a scale of 0-4, which correspond to: None (0), Mild (1), Moderate (2), Severe (3), and Extreme (4).
The scores for each subscale are summed up, with a possible score range of 0-20 for Pain, 0-8 for Stiffness, and 0-68 for Physical Function.</description>

    <measure>Stair Climbimg Test (SCT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Balance was assessed by SCT before treatment versus after 6 weeks of treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>The SCT assesses the ability to ascend and descend a flight of stairs, as well as lower extremity balance.Test included the number of steps, the task requirement (ascent only or ascent/decent combined), or whether the test is timed over a set number of steps or the step count is recorded for a set period of time: 9-step ascend/descend, 4-step ascend/descend (6),3-step ascent cycle duration, 30-second test (12 steps), 3-step measured on 0 - 6 scale of level of assistance., and 6-step fast and self-paced.</description>

    <measure>One Leg Standing Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Balance was assessed by One Leg Standing Test before treatment versus after 6 weeks of treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>One single-leg standing was assessed balance. Test required the subject to stand with arms by his/her side.Timing was started when the subject raised one foot off the ground. Timing was stopped if the subject displaced the weight-bearing foot, touched the suspended foot to the ground, used the suspended limb to support the weight-bearing limb, or reached the maximum balance time of 30 seconds.</description>

    <measure>Global Rating Change Scales</measure>
    <time_frame>Satisfactions was assessed using by Global Rating Change Scales before treatment versus after 6 weeks of treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>Rating levels of satisfaction is critical to a successful survey. Global Rating Scale's levels of satisfaction may vary from &quot;Not at all satisfied&quot; to &quot;Very Satisfied&quot; or &quot;Extremely Satisfied,&quot; but the scale is not balanced in the same way as Performance or Expectation.</description>
