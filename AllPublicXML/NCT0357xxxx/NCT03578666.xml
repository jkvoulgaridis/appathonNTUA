  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The optimization of recovery to alleviate the effects of fatigue in athletes can provide
      valuable performance advantage. However, despite the growing body of literature regarding
      effects of different interventions in fatigue, there is still lack of clarity regarding the
      efficacy of interventions on running economy and, particularly, fatigue-induced biomechanical
      alterations. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare the effects of massage and cold
      water immersion for enhancing recovery and alleviating fatigue after an exhausting training
      session. We hypothesized that both massage and cold water immersion would enhance
      biomechanical parameters compared with a control condition and hence would improve subsequent
      running economy.

      In this randomized controlled all the subjects (n=48) will performed the same protocol. The
      protocol will begin with a exhausting training session (20-min warm-up consisted of 15-min of
      continuous self-paced running followed by 5-min of fast-finish progression runs increasing
      speeds (from approximately 60% to 80% of maximal heart rate, participant controlled), 10 x
      500 m sprints at 90% of maximal heart rate with a 2-min rest period between bouts and a
      recovery phase consisting of 10-min of slow jogging). Twenty-four hours after this exhausting
      training, subjects will perform an incremental running test on a treadmill (Pre-intervention
      test) where subjects will start at 12 km/h for 6 min after which speed will be increased by 2
      km/h every 6 min until a 16 km/h trial is completed. At the end of each stage, participants
      will rate their perceived exertion using the 10-point Modified Borg rating of perceived
      exertion scale (RPE scale). One hour after this test, in one protocol subjects will receive
      the massage intervention, (Massage group); other group will receive a cold water immersion
      intervention (Cold water immersion group); in the other group (Control group) participants
      will rest passively in a sitting position for 30-min period. To evaluate the relevance of the
      changes induced by the interventions (massage, cold water immersion, passive rest) subjects
      will repeat the treadmill test 48 hours after the first test (72 hours after the exhaustive
      training).
