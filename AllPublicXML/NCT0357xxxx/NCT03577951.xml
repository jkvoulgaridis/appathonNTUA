      Patients in our department endoscopic thyroidectomy were randomly divided into high position
      and low position established operating space group established operating space group. The
      thyroid size, patient BMI, operation time, and intraoperative blood loss were compared
      between the two groups.

      Patients in our department endoscopic thyroidectomy were randomly divided into high position
      and low position established operating space group established operating space group.The
      sternum angle level is used as the dividing line between the two groupsã€‚The thyroid size,
      patient BMI, operation time, and intraoperative blood loss were compared between the two
