  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac Device implantation includes implantation of pacemakers, implantable defibrillators
      and Cardiac resynchronisation Therapy (CRT) devices. These are well-established treatments
      for selected with heart rhythm abnormalities and heart failure.

      In the past, trainee doctors had the opportunity to perform many procedures and learn on the
      patient. This is no longer the case due to a change in training schedules and working times
      as well as patient safety mandates. Progression based training with the use of simulators has
      been proven to be effective in training and in order to use this methodology, the procedure
      needs to be well defined.

      Despite its worldwide adoption, a standardized procedure has never been defined in detail and
      agreed upon and the cardiac device implant technique varies with the operator.

      The purpose of the research is to establish the metrics (operational definitions) necessary
      to characterize a reference Cardiac Device implant procedure.

      The purpose of the research is to establish the metrics (operational definitions) necessary
      to characterize a reference Cardiac Device implant procedure, to seek consensus from
      experienced device implanters on the appropriateness of the steps as well as errors
      identified, and to determine if such validated performance metrics are a valid assessment
      tool with the ability to discriminate between the performances of experienced and novice
      implanters.

      These validated metrics will potentially serve as an educational and training tool to improve
      and quality assure Cardiac device implant training.

      The steps involved in characterising a reference procedure are as follows:

        1. Define the implant procedure in quantifiable steps (already performed)

        2. Seek consensus and agreement by an independent panel on the steps (already done).

        3. Video record routinely performed device implants by experienced and novice physicians.

        4. Reviewing and scoring the video recorded procedures to verify that the metrics
           distinguish between a novice and an expert cardiac device performance.

        This is an observational and educational study only. Cardiac device implants routinely
        performed in clinical practice will be video-recorded.

        The procedures will be scheduled as per normal and the clinical pathway and management of
        the patient and the operator will remain unchanged.
