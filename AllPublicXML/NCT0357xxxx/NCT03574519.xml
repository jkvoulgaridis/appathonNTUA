  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the main effects of daily vs. weekly feedback and contingent vs.
      non-contingent incentives for increasing walking behavior among overweight and obese adults.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 68% of adults are overweight or obese, which is associated with increased risk
      for health conditions, including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and cancer. These
      individuals are more often sedentary than the general population, which compounds the risk
      for these same conditions. While the benefits of engaging in physical activity are
      well-established, few individuals are able to successfully increase activity to recommended
      levels. Existing intervention programs, often derived from theories such as social cognitive
      theory or related theories, have had limited success. Behavioral economics offers a promising
      alternative, suggesting that engagement in any behavior is based on the maximizing utility
      and happiness (i.e., weighing the cost and benefit of the behavior). Interventions based on
      this theory aim to increase the immediate benefit of engaging in physical activity, often
      using a financial incentive.

      This study will last for 8 weeks. All participants will have the use of a FitBit for ongoing
      self-monitoring and a personalized step-count goal designed to help increase daily steps.
      Participants will receive feedback on reaching their goals either daily or weekly.
