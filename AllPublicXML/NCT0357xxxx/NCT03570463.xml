  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The GLA:D Back project evaluates the implementation of standardised patient education and
      exercise therapy for people with persistent or recurrent low back pain (LBP) in a hybrid
      implementation-effectiveness design. This involves evaluating the process of implementation
      as well as clinician level outcomes and patient level outcomes.

      GLA:D (Good Life with OsteoArthritis in Denmark) is a non-profit initiative and registered
      trademark from the University of Southern Denmark. It educates clinicians in delivering
      evidence-based care for musculoskeletal health conditions and registers outcomes in a
      clinical registry. GLA:D Back uses only the acronym.

      The main activity of the implementation strategy is a two-days course for physiotherapists
      and chiropractors in delivering patient education and exercise therapy that is aimed at
      supporting patient self-management of LBP. This comes with ready-to-use patient education
      materials and exercise programs. The course is targeted at chiropractors and
      physiotherapists, but any health care provider authorised to treat patients with back pain in
      Denmark can participate, i.e. medical doctors, physiotherapists and chiropractors.

      The clinical intervention is a group-based program consisting of two sessions of patient
      education and 8 weeks of supervised exercises. The program uses a cognitive-behavioural
      approach and the aim of the exercise component is to restore the patient's ability and
      confidence to move freely. Clinicians decide which patients are offered the program.

      The implementation process is evaluated in a dynamic process monitoring the penetration,
      adoption and fidelity of the clinical intervention.

      The education of clinicians is evaluated via clinician-level outcomes concerning attitudes
      towards back pain and confidence in managing people with LBP.

      The clinical intervention and potential effect mechanisms are evaluated at the patient-level
      in an observational design. Patients who are participating in the GLA:D Back program are
      followed using measures of knowledge, skills, beliefs, performance, self-efficacy and success
      in self-management.

      Effects at a national level will be investigated via data from national registries of health
      care utilisation and sick-leave. Patient- and clinician reported data are collected in a
      registry.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The clinician training courses are open to all interested authorised back pain clinicians
      practicing in Denmark. The study evaluates courses conducted in 2018 which involves one or
      two courses for clinicians in each of five Danish regions.

      The adoption of GLA:D Back is investigated by measuring the extent to which clinicians who
      have participated in the GLA:D Back course conduct the program in their clinics. Reach of the
      patient target group is determined by asking clinicians about the degree to which patients
      offered the treatment accept this. Fidelity with the program is investigated quantitatively
      by asking about treatment content and recall of key messages via patient questionnaires, and
      by ensuring that patients' individual goals are registered. The quality of care in terms of
      delivering the key elements of the intervention will be further explored qualitatively.

      The profile of patients enrolled in the GLA:D Back programme will be compared between clinics
      and administrative regions.

      Clinician level effects are investigated in an observational longitudinal design with
      clinician reported data collected before the clinician training course, immediately after the
      course and 4 months later, and with patient-reported information on delivery collected at
      their three-months follow up. Indicators of implementation are registration of patients in
      the GLA:D Back registry and that patients report receiving the educational components of care
      and supervised exercises. Orientation towards treatment of LBP and confidence in managing
      patients with LBP are evaluated by clinicians' answers to standardised questionnaires.

      Patient level outcomes are aimed at investigating changes in knowledge, beliefs and skills
      related to the LBP condition which is hypothesized to lead to improved self-efficacy. The
      initial measures are related to knowledge skills, beliefs and performance, the next line of
      outcomes to self-efficacy, then daily activities and quality of life and last health care
      utilisation and work ability.

      The compliance with the program is evaluated by patient report of the number of patient
      education sessions and exercise sessions attended.

      The registry is delivered by Odense Patient data Explorative Network (OPEN) at University of
      Southern Denmark and uses REDCap (Vanderbilt University) as the platform for data collection.
      Clinicians are registered when signing up for the GLA:D Back course and agreeing to
      participate in research. Patients are registered by the clinician and have links to patient
      questionnaires sent to their email before beginning the GLA:D Back program and after 3, 6 and
      12 months if consenting to their data being used for research.

      Rather than testing effects on one primary outcome, the study evaluates the implementation
      process and a number of outcomes based on a logical model of change.

    <description>The intervention aims at improving the participant's ability to self-manage low back pain (LBP). The content is based on a cognitive behavioural approach aimed at supporting pain self-efficacy. An individual session at the beginning and the end of the group sessions involve goal-setting and physical tests. Key messages of the patient education include that pain is not a sign of danger and back pain is explained using a behavioural model of (im)balance between demands and capacity rather than emphasising tissue damage. The exercises aim at restoring natural variation in movement and provides guidance for patients in exploring movement rather than teaching exercises in only one correct manner.</description>
