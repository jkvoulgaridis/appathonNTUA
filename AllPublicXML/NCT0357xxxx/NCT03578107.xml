    <textblock>
      In order to bridge the great gaps, Chinese Stroke Association (CSA) and American Heart
      Association (AHA) sought to develop, conduct, and assess a multifaceted quality improvement
      intervention to increase the adherent rate of IV tPA and ET and improve 3-month clinical
      outcomes for these patients through our cluster-randomized stepped-wedge IMPROVE: Stroke in
      China trial.
