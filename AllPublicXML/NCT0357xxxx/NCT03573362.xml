  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The guided FNA by endobronchial ultrasound ( Endobronchial Ultrasound guided transbronchial
      Needle Aspiration or EBUS-TBNA) is a minimally invasive technique with an established role in
      the staging of lung cancer 1, and in the evaluation of intrathoracic lymph node metastases
      from extrathoracic primary cancer2 . There is also a role in cases of isolated hilar and
      mediastinal lymph nodes in which the differential diagnosis includes mostly sarcoidosis,
      lymphoma and tuberculosis. 3

      Various studies have evaluated more recently the diagnostic yield of EBUS-TBNA specifically
      for sarcoidosis 4 and thoracic lymphoma 5-6. Although there is emerging data supporting the
      usefulness of EBUS-TBNA in the investigation of these two pathologies, the efficacy results
      vary according to the target populations and certain parameters. Moreover, although a large
      randomized study demonstrated e superiority of EBUS-TBNA over conventional bronchoscopic
      sampling methods [ bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and trans-bronchial biopsies (TBB ] for the
      diagnosis of sarcoidosis , 7 the results suggest that there is still room for optimizing the
      performance of EBUS-TBNA [b] . In the field of lymphoma, obtaining large enough specimens for
      adequate subtyping also remains a concern. 8

      In order to improve the performance of EBUS -TBNA , new needles have been developed with the
      aim to provide biopsies for histological evaluation rather than purely cytological. The
      ViziShot FLEX © (Olympus) 19 gauge needle (19 gauge or 19G) is a large needle, which can
      provide both tissue and needle aspiration , and has the advantage of being more flexible.

      For this study, the investigators want to compare the diagnostic yield of EBUS-TBNA using
      needle ViziShot FLEX 19G (1.11 mm) with that of the standard 22G needle ( NA-201SX; Olympus)
      , in the investigation of hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy suspected to be sarcoidosis or
      lymphoma.
