  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dermatologic diseases, of very different etiology and variable severity, represent a major
      motivation for consultation (in private consultations and in emergency departments), thus
      leading pediatricians to frequently turn to dermatologic advice.

      The principal aim is to estimate the degree of concordance of the main diagnosis between a
      pediatrician and a pediatric dermatologist.

      The secondary aims is to estimate the degree of concordance of the treatment, advices and
      follow-up.
