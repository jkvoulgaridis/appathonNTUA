  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pembrolizumab is a potent and highly selective humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the
      IgG4/kappa isotype designed to directly block the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands,
      PD-L1 and PD-L2. KeytrudaTM (pembrolizumab) has been approved by the FDA and the EMA for the
      therapy of with chemotherapy pretreated NSCLC patients with PD-L1 expression (TPS ≥ 1%) on
      tumor cells. In addition, pembrolizumab was approved for the first line treatment of
      metastatic NSCLC patients with high PD-L1 expression (TPS ≥ 50%) on tumor cells.
      Pembrolizumab will be given in a flat dose of 200 mg i.v. every 3 weeks until disease
      progression, toxicity or patient withdrawal for a maximum of 2 years. Patients with untreated
      advanced stage lung adenocarcinoma, without an EGFR mutation or ALK translocation, will be
      included.

        Subject inclusion criteria:

          1. Have an untreated lung adenocarcinoma of advanced stage.

          2. Be willing and able to provide written informed consent/assent for the trial.

          3. Be at least 18 years of age on day of signing informed consent.

          4. Have measurable disease based on RECIST 1.1.

          5. Be willing to provide tissue from a newly obtained core or excisional biopsy of a
             tumor lesion. Newly-obtained is defined as a specimen obtained up to 6 weeks (42 days)
             prior to initiation of treatment on Day 1.

          6. Have a performance status of ≤1 on the ECOG Performance Scale

          7. Demonstrate adequate organ function

          8. Female subject of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum
             pregnancy within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If
             the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test
             will be required.

          9. Female subjects of childbearing potential must be willing to use an adequate method of
             contraception, for the course of the study through 120 days after the last dose of
             study medication.

         10. Male subjects of childbearing potential must agree to use an adequate method of
             contraception, starting with the first dose of study therapy through 120 days after
             the last dose of study therapy.

        Subject exclusion criteria:

          1. Is currently participating and receiving study therapy or has participated in a study
             of an investigational agent and received study therapy or used an investigational
             device within 4 weeks of the first dose of treatment.

          2. Has received radiotherapy within 14 days before the first dose of study treatment or
             received lung radiation therapy of &gt; 30 Gy within 6 months before the first dose of
             study treatment.

          3. Has symptomatic ascites or pleural effusion. A participant who is clinically stable
             following treatment for these conditions (including therapeutic thoraco- or
             paracentesis) is eligible.

          4. Has had an allogeneic tissue/solid organ transplant.

          5. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any
             other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of trial
             treatment.

          6. Has a known history of active TB (Bacillus Tuberculosis)

          7. Hypersensitivity to pembrolizumab or any of its excipients.

          8. Has had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy or therapy with an

         10. Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment.
             Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell carcinoma of the
             skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy or in situ cervical cancer.

         11. Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous
             meningitis. Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided
             they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least four weeks
             prior to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have returned
             to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using
             steroids for at least 7 days prior to trial treatment. This exception does not include
             carcinomatous meningitis which is excluded regardless of clinical stability.

         12. Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2
             years. Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a
             form of systemic treatment.

         13. Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or current

             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

         16. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

         17. Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit
             through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.

         18. Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2 or CTLA-4 agent.

         19. Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).
