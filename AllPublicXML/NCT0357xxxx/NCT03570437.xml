      The COPELIA trial is evaluating two new tablet medications in endometrial cancer for the
      first time. It will include 129 women aged 16 years or older with advanced endometrial cancer
      whose cancer has worsened after their initial chemotherapy treatment. Participants will be
      allocated at random to one of three groups:

        1. The first group (Arm 1) will receive a standard (routine) treatment for patients with
           endometrial cancer known as paclitaxel. This is a chemotherapy drug that is routinely
           used to treat patients with different cancers including ovarian, breast, lung and
           endometrial cancer. Paclitaxel works by stopping the growth of cancer cells.

        2. The second group (Arm 2) will receive the standard paclitaxel treatment once a week in
           addition to a new drug called cediranib. Cediranib is a tablet medication and works by
           blocking new blood vessel formation. Cediranib has been tested in women with endometrial
           cancer before but not alongside chemotherapy treatment.

        3. The third group (Arm 3) will receive two new tablet medications, cediranib and olaparib.
           Olaparib works by preventing cancer cells repairing DNA effectively. The use of olaparib
           and cediranib together has been shown to be effective in a common type of ovarian cancer
           but has not been evaluated as a treatment for endometrial cancer before.

      The main objectives of the COPELIA trial are to work out:

        1. Whether the two new treatments, cediranib-paclitaxel (Arm 2) and cediranib-olaparib (Arm
           3) are more effective at controlling endometrial cancer than standard paclitaxel
           chemotherapy (Arm 1)

        2. Whether the two new treatments cause more or fewer side-effects than standard
           chemotherapy

        3. How each of these treatments impact on the daily life of women receiving the treatment
           by asking trial participants to regularly complete quality of life questionnaires

        4. Whether we can learn how these treatments work in women with endometrial cancer by
           taking some additional blood tests for research. In women allocated to Arm 3 (and only
           at participating hospitals), we will ask permission to take a small biopsy from an area
           of cancer before they start treatment to see if we can predict which women may benefit
           from olaparib.

      COPELIA is a phase II, randomised, three-arm open-label trial which will recruit 129 women
      aged 16 years or older, with advanced endometrial cancer who require further treatment after
      their initial chemotherapy treatment. Potential participants will be recruited from the
      hospital setting.

      Participants will be allocated to one of the following three trial arms on a 1:1:1 basis
      using centralised internet randomisation, stratified for prognostic factors:

      Arm 1: (Control Arm): Paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 administered on days 1, 8 and 15 of a 28-day cycle
      for up to 6 cycles.

      Arm 2: Cediranib 20 mg once daily for 28 days given with weekly paclitaxel 80 mg/m2
      administered on days 1, 8 and 15 of a 28-day cycle for up to 6 cycles. Participants with
      stable disease, partial response or complete response at 6 months as determined by RECIST
      v1.1 will be eligible to continue treatment with single agent cediranib once daily until
      disease progression.

      Arm 3: Cediranib 20 mg once daily with olaparib 300 mg twice daily, continuously on a 28 day
      cycle for up to 6 cycles. Participants with stable disease, partial response or complete
      response at 6 months as determined by RECIST v1.1 will be eligible to continue treatment with
      both olaparib and cediranib until disease progression.

      Randomisation will be balanced for histological subtype and the number of chemotherapy
      regimens for metastatic disease.

      Recruitment to the trial is expected to take 30 months. The total duration of the trial is
      expected to be 55 months. Participants will receive initial trial treatments for up to six
      months as long as they remain progression free. As mentioned above, participants in the
      experimental arms may continue treatment with cediranib/olaparib beyond the six months, and
      beyond the end of the trial, if they remain progression free. The trial will end once all
      participants have met at least one of the criteria: completed 12 months' follow-up (including
      treatment), withdrawn from follow-up, been lost to follow-up, experienced disease
      progression, or died. Participants consent for their medical notes to be reviewed at later
      dates if required to obtain data such as overall survival.

      The trial has a multi-arm-multi-stage (MAMS) design. The appropriate sample size was
      calculated for this MAMS design, which allows one (or both) ineffective experimental arms to
      be dropped following a planned interim analysis after 60 participants have been assessed at
      three months.
