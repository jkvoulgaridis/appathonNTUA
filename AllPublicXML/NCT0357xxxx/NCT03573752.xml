  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic promontofixation is becoming increasingly common and is currently the standard
      surgical procedure for pelvic prolapse, with few complications including exposure and mesh
      infection.

      The research hypothesis is that laparoscopic promontofixation is a relatively painless
      procedure and can be performed on an outpatient basis without increasing the number of
      postoperative complications and impairing patients' quality of life.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the number of rehospitalizations after management
      of promontofixation by laparoscopy on an outpatient basis.

      To evaluate the feasibility of a postoperative H8 exit after laparoscopic promontofixation.

      Each patient will complete a questionnaire on the experience of management, both in terms of
      pain management, anxiety and overall satisfaction.

    <measure>Exit rate at postoperative H8 according to post-anesthesia discharge scoring system score according to Chung.</measure>
    <time_frame>Hour 8 after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>This score considers six criteria: vital signs, ambulation, nausea/vomiting, pain, bleeding and voiding. Each criterion is given a score ranging from 0 to 2. Only patients who achieve a score of 9 or more are considered ready for discharge.</description>

    <measure>Quality of life assessed by the Euroqol EQ-5D index (EuroQol five dimension scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0, 3, 7 and 30 after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D questionnaire is made up for two components; health state description and evaluation. In description part, health status is measured in terms of five dimensions; mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. The respondents self-rate their level of severity for each dimension using three-level (3L) scale; having no problems, having some or moderate problems, being unable to do/having extreme problems. The respondents are asked to choose the statement which best describes their health status of surveyed day.
In evaluation part, the respondents evaluate their overall health status using the visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS). The patient is asked to mark health status on the day of the interview on a 20 cm vertical scale with end points of 0 and 100. There are notes at the both ends of the scale that the bottom rate (0) corresponds to &quot;the worst health you can imagine&quot;, and the highest rate (100) corresponds to &quot;the best health you can imagine&quot;.</description>

    <description>Assess the postoperative anxiety by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) form Y-A. This form has 20 items for assessing state anxiety. All items are rated on a 4-point scale. Higher scores indicate greater anxiety.</description>

    <measure>Assess postoperative pain by the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and the consumption of analgesics.</measure>
    <time_frame>8 hours after surgery (Day 0)/ At 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. (Day 1, 2 and 3)/ At 8 a.m. (Day 4, 5, 6, 7 and 30)</time_frame>
    <description>Assess postoperative pain by the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and the consumption of analgesics. This scale consists of a straight line with the endpoints defining extreme limits such as &quot;no pain at all&quot; and &quot;pain as bad as it could be&quot;. The patient is asked to mark his pain level on the line between the two endpoints. The distance between &quot;no pain at all&quot; and the mark then defines the subject's pain.</description>
