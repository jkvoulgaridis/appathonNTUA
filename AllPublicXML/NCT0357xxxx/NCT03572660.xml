    <textblock>
      The DCM SUPPORT study is a single centre, single arm study evaluating the change in left
      ventricular ejection fraction with the combines use of bone marrow derived stem cells and
      G-CSF with a percutaneous circulatory assistance for the treatment of dilated cardiomyopathy.

      The DCM SUPPORT study is a single centre, single arm, phase II pilot study. The primary
      endpoint will be a change in LVEF from baseline measured by a CT scan of the heart at 3
      months. The secondary endpoints include change in LVEF from baseline measured by a CT scan of
      the heart at 12 months, in-hospital procedural related morbidity / mortality and assessment
      of major adverse cardiac events (MACE; death, heart attack, need for repeat heart
      revascularisation), change in exercise capacity and NYHA class at 3 months and 12 months
      respectively. The NYHA classification is a quantitative way of assessing a patient's heart
      failure symptoms. It places patients into one of four categories (I - IV).

             appropriate device therapy, as per clinical guidelines for an interval of at least 3
             months.

          -  No other treatment options available as part of current best standard care.
