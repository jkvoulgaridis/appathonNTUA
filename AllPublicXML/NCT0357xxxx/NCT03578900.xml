    <textblock>
      The aims of this study are: To compare salivary pH changes and stimulation efficacy of two
      different Gustatory Stimulants of Salivation (GSSS) in patients with Primary Sjögren Syndrome
      (PSS); To evaluate Primary Sjögren syndrome (PSS) impact and gustatory stimulants of salivary
      secretion (GSSS) on oral health related quality of life measured by a Portuguese version of
      Oral Health Impact Profile-14 (OHIP-14) and specific Xerostomia assessment questionnaires.

      The Products to be used are the Xeros® Dentaid system and a citric based mouthwash.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Time of GSSS induced pH drop below 4.5</measure>
    <time_frame>20 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>On the day that the system is attributed the subject is asked to use one of the products and saliva is collected. pH variation is determined at fixed intervals during 20 minutes. Time in which salivary pH is below 4.5 is calculated as well as the number needed to treat and the absolute risk reduction.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall and sub domains scores for each questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>15 days</time_frame>
    <description>Before and after usage of both products at home, the Summated Xerostomia Inventory-5 (range 0 to 15) to measure subjective feeling of dry mouth, Oral Health Impact Profile-14 (range 0 to 56) to measure quality of life perception related to the oral cavity. This last questionnaire is further divided into 7 subdomains: functional limitation, physical pain, psychological discomfort, physical disability, psychologic disability, social disability and handicap each ranging from 0 to 14.
In both questionnaires the total score is the result of the sum of the individual scores in each question.
In both questionnaires the higher the score the worse the outcome. The before and after scores obtained are then compared.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Salivary stimulant induced salivary flow</measure>
    <time_frame>20 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>While using one of the two products saliva is collected, weighed and salivary flow is determined at fixed times during 20 minutes.</description>
