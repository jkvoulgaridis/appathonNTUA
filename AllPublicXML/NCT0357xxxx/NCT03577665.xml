      This clinical trial is a prospective, single-organ, phase II clinical trial to evaluate the
      efficacy of curative proton therapy for liver metastasis of colorectal cancer diagnosed
      histologically as adenocarcinoma. Patients who meet the selection criteria should be
      selected, signed for consent, and treated 5 times a week for 7200 cGy / 15 fractions alone
      for 3 weeks.

    <description>The primary goal of this study is the 2-year local control rate of liver lesions treated with proton therapy. It is judged that the local control rate is improved when the liver metastases of colorectal cancer using conventional X-ray is assumed to have 2-year local control rate of 60% and the 2-year local control rate of proton therapy is set to 80% or more</description>
