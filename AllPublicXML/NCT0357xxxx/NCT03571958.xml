  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this research study is to determine if the utilization of brief
      motivational interviewing (BMI) during continuous care is superior compared to traditional
      oral hygiene instruction (OHI) to reduce patients' plaque score, bleeding on probing (BOP),
      and gingival index (GI). An additional goal is to investigate chairside time of implementing
      BMI.
