  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adalimumab is an immunosuppressive drug that belongs to the family of anti-TNF agents. It
      contains a monoclonal antibody produced by biotechnology. It is designed to bind to tumor
      necrosis factor (TNF), a substance that is involved in several auto-immune processes. By
      binding to TNF, adalimumab blocks its activity, reducing the severity of various chronic
      inflammatory diseases including Rheumatoid Arthritis, Plaque Psoriasis and others.

      Often, the high cost of biologic products may preclude access to the treatment to a big
      portion of the population worldwide. A biosimilar product that provides comparable safety and
      efficacy at more affordable cost would fulfill a broader medical need.

      Humira has been available on the market for several years. Recently, a higher concentration
      (100 mg/mL) formulation has been introduced in major markets. Alvotech is developing AVT02,
      that is a proposed biosimilar of adalimumab containing high concentration (100 mg/mL) of
      active ingredient.

      The objective of this clinical trial is to assess the similarity of AVT02 (100 mg/mL) with
      Humira (100 mg/mL), in terms of tolerability, safety (including immunogenicity) and compare
      the pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers.
