  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Periodontal diseases and dental caries are initiated by a pathogenic biofilm, in a
      susceptible host, affecting the tooth periodontium and hard tissues. Its possible association
      with many biologic systems has been studied. In this study, researchers investigated
      association between oral health and female infertility, and what is the biological rationale
      for such relationship.

      Power analysis was performed with the G-Power software package to determine sample size.

      To cover possible data loss, 10% of a group were added to each group. Medical and dental
      examination will be performed both of control and experimental groups. In dental examination
      decayed, missing, or filled teeth (DMFT) index will be used according to World Health
      Organization (WHO 1997) criteria. All teeth were visually using the International Caries
      Detection and Assessment System (ICDAS-II).

      To analyze the correlation between oral health status and female infertility linear
      regression test and for comparison of both the groups (case and control), two sample t test
      and chi square test were used.

    <description>All teeth were visually using the International Caries Detection and Assessment System (ICDAS-II). The chosen sites were recorded as:
0 = sound;
= first visible sign of noncavitated lesion seen only when the tooth is dried;
= visible noncavitated lesion seen when wet and dry;
= microcavitation in enamel;
= noncavitated lesion extending into dentine seen as an undermining shadow;
= small cavitated lesion with visible dentine: less than 50% of surface;
= large cavitated lesions with visible dentine in more than 50% of the surface. A single calibrated examiner measured probing depth-PD, clinical attachment level- CAL, plaque (Pl), and gingival indices (GI), bleeding on probing (BOP) at four sites per tooth using a manual periodontal probe (PCPUNC, Hu-Friedy, Chicago, IL, USA).</description>
