  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is a leading cause of disability around the world. The aging population
      is only further increasing its prevalence. Moreover, increasing rates of obesity, as well as
      increasing athletic participation, is leading to patients developing OA at younger ages.
      Although total joint replacement is effective for alleviating the effects of OA for many
      patients, it is less beneficial for younger patients given the resultant reduced mobility and
      the ~15 year life of a total joint replacement. Therefore, new options are needed for OA.

      One such option is bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) injection into the diseased joint.
      Several recent studies have shown significant symptomatic improvement from this therapy. Now,
      efforts are needed to better understand how to optimize this therapy, as numerous variables
      are involved, including: the volume of aspirate, adjuvant, aspiration location or locations,
      anesthetic, etc. Additionally, several FDA-approved needles are available for the aspiration
      step. Thus, the purpose of this study is to compare two different styles of FDA-approved
      needles--an open-ended trocar vs. a fenestrated blunt trocar--with respect to clinical
      outcomes, cell counts, and colony forming units.

      In addition to the comparison arms, taking these two groups together, this study will serve
      as prospective case series of 30 patients undergoing BMAC injection for knee osteoarthritis
      without a platelet-rich plasma (PRP) or any other adjuvant/carrier.
