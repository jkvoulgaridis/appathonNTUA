  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study was to investigate the feasibility of using a virtual reality- based
      dual task training of upper extremity tracking while treadmill-walking, to improve walking
      and balance performance in post stroke survivors

    <description>Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) Scale is a 16-item questionnaire/survey. Each item is rated from 0% (no confidence) to 100% (complete confidence). Elderly respondents are asked to rate their confidence that they will lose their balance or become unsteady in the course of daily activities. ABC is an 11-point scale and ratings should consist of whole numbers (0-100) for each item. Participants should indicate their level of confidence in doing an activity without losing balance or becoming unsteady by choosing one of the percentage points on the scale from 0%-100%. Total the ratings (possible range = 0 to 1600) and divide by 16 to get each subject's ABC score. Scores lower than 50 indicate a low level of functioning, scores above 50 but below 80 indicate a medium level, and those over 80 indicate a high level of functioning.</description>

    <description>14-item scale designed to measure balance of the older adult in a clinical setting. A five-point ordinal scale, ranging from 0-4. &quot;0&quot; indicates the lowest level of function and &quot;4&quot; the highest level of function.Total Score = 56. 41-56 = low fall risk, 21-40 = medium fall risk, 0 -20 = high fall risk.</description>

    <intervention_name>Dual Task Walking (DTW)</intervention_name>
    <description>Each training session began with 8 min of general warm-up and 2 min walk around the gym. Then, for safety reasons, the participants were attached to a harness. The participants began walking slowly on the treadmill for 3 min. In the following phases the participants walked at the same speed, while training with 3 VR games. Each session lasted 3 min, and 3 min of single walking was performed between VR sessions. After the final VR session, 2 min of single-task walking was performed in order to allow for recovery. The time walked in each trial from the starting point to the destination was kept constant at 20 min.</description>

    <description>this intervention, participants performed 8 min of general warm-up and 2 min walk around the gym, and then continued to walk for another 20 min on the treadmill at a speed that was equivalent to the intensity of 60%-70% of their heart rate reserve.</description>
