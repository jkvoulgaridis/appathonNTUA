      -  Objective: To evaluate the effect of an intervention based on the use of new information
           and communication technologies in a population of people over 65 years of age.

        -  Design and setting: A randomized clinical trial of two parallel groups. Population: 140
           participants over 65 years of age will be included, selected by consecutive sampling in
           primary care centers of Salamanca (Spain.

        -  Measurements and intervention: Lifestyles (physical activity, sedentarism and
           mediterranean diet), body composition, health-related quality of life, cognitive
           performance and daily life activities will be evaluated at 3 months. The advice on
           healthy diet and physical activity recommendations will be common to both groups. The
           intervention group will be added a training for 3 months in use of a Smartphone
           application, designed to promote a healthy diet, increased physical acivity and
           decreased sedentary.
