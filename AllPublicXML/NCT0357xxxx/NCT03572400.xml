    <textblock>
      &lt;Research Hypothesis&gt; The dynamics of immune cells by CCRT/Durvalumab will be uncovered. The
      combination of Durvalumab with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT/gemcitabine)) as neoaduvant
      treatment in resectable or borderline resectable pancreatic cancer is feasible and
      efficacious.

      The combination of Durvalumab with cytotoxic chemotherapy (gemcitabine) as an adjuvant
      treatment is feasible and efficacious.

      &lt;Objectives&gt; To assess the effect of Neoadjuvant CCRT with Gemcitabine/Durvalumab followed by
      adjuvant Gemcitabine/Durvalumab in resectable or borderline resectable pancreatic cancer

      Primary endpoint:

      2 year-DFSR (disease-free survival rate) Secondary endpoints

        -  Efficacy: 2 year-OSR (overall survival rate), disease-free survival, overall survival,
           overall response rate (RECIST 1.1, ir response) after neoadjuvant CCRT, disease control
           rateEORTC QLQ-C30, the number of immune cells (TIL, macrophage, etc) in resected
           pancreatic tissue

        -  Safety: toxicity (CTCAE V), irAE,

      Exploratory Objective(s):

        -  To evaluate baseline measures and changes of immune systems and regulations by
           neoadjuvant CCRT with gemcitabine/Durvalumab in peripheral blood and tumor tissues

        -  To collect and store DNA from blood (according to ethical procedures) for future
           exploratory research into genes/genetic variation that may influence response (ie,
           distribution, safety, tolerability and efficacy) to study treatments and or
           susceptibility to disease (optional).
