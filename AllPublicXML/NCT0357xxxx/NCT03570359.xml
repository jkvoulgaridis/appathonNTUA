  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to assess the safety of inhaled SNG001 and the ability of inhaled
      SNG001 to 'switch on' the cells' anti-viral defences in patients with chronic obstructive
      pulmonary disease (COPD). The study consist of two parts.

      Part 1 will assess the safety of inhaled SNG001 in ten patients with stable COPD.

      Part 2 will assess efficacy and safety of inhaled SNG001 in 120 patients with COPD with a
      cold or COPD exacerbation.

    <textblock>
      When people with COPD get a respiratory virus such as a cold or flu it often increases their
      COPD symptoms, leading them to require treatment with either antibiotics or oral steroids and
      severely affecting their quality of life. SNG001 is the study medication, and it contains
      interferon beta (interferon-Î²) which is a natural antiviral protein. In this study we will
      look to see whether inhaled SNG001 can boost anti-viral responses and minimise the worsening
      of COPD symptoms/lung function when patients have a confirmed respiratory virus.

      In Part 1 ten COPD patients without a respiratory virus will be randomised to receive three
      days of SNG001 or placebo. The aim of this part of the study is to assess safety of SNG001 in
      COPD patients.

      In Part 2 COPD patients will contact the research team when they experience cold or flu
      symptoms or a deterioration of their COPD symptoms. At this point, eligible patients will
      undergo a virus detection test and those that test positive for a virus will be randomised
      1:1 to receive SNG001 or placebo once daily for 14 days. The first dose of study medication
      will be administered within 48 hours. Other assessments will be performed during the 14 days
      of treatment to look for changes in anti-viral biomarkers, lung function and COPD symptoms.
      Patients will also be followed up 14 days post end of treatment.

    <masking_description>All patients will be randomised to one of two treatment groups (SNG001 or placebo).
In Part 1 the ratio will be 4:1 and in Part 2 the ratio will be 1:1, both according to a pre-specified randomisation schedule. In Part 2, prior to randomisation to SNG001 or placebo, patients will be stratified into two groups; those with cold symptoms without a moderate COPD exacerbation (Group A), and those who have a moderate COPD exacerbation with or without cold symptoms (Group B).
For both parts of the study, patients will be randomised according to a pre-specified randomisation schedule.</masking_description>

          5. Should have stable COPD, having no symptoms of an exacerbation and/or respiratory
             tract infection currently and/or within the past 6 weeks of screening and/or
             randomisation.

          6. Should be prescribed and taking regularly one or more long acting bronchodilators
             (e.g. long acting Î²2 agonist [LABA], long acting muscarinic antagonist [LAMA]) with or
             without an inhaled corticosteroid maintenance therapy for their COPD.

          7. Patients who produce sputum most days.

          8. Provide written informed consent.

          9. The patient produced an adequate sputum sample at the screening visit.

         10. Female patients must be 1 year post-menopausal, surgically sterile, or using an
             acceptable method of contraception. Women should have been stable on their chosen
             method of birth control for a minimum of 3 months before entering the trial and should
             continue with birth control for 1 month after the last dose. In addition to the
             acceptable birth control method (except for the practice of total sexual abstinence),
             condom (in UK with spermicides) should be used by the male partner for sexual
             intercourse from randomisation (Visit 2) and for 1 month after the last dose to
             prevent pregnancy.

             Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at screening and
             prior to randomisation.

             Women not of childbearing potential are defined as women who are either permanently
             sterilized (hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral salpingectomy), or who
             are postmenopausal. Women will be considered postmenopausal if they have been
             amenorrheic for 12 months prior to the planned date of randomisation without an
             alternative medical cause. The following age specific requirements apply:

               -  Women &lt;50 years old would be considered postmenopausal if they have been
                  amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal
                  treatment and if follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels are in the
                  postmenopausal range. If the FSH result is not available at the time of
                  randomization, the patient must have a negative pregnancy test and agree to use
                  highly effective contraception methods until the FSH result is available.

               -  Women â¥50 years old would be considered postmenopausal if they have been
                  amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal
                  treatment.

         11. Motivation (in the Investigator's opinion) to comply with protocol requirements and
             complete all study visits, including the ability to communicate well with the
             Investigator and be capable of understanding the nature of the research and its
             treatment (including its risks and potential benefits).

        PART 2 - pre-treatment Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female, between and including 40-85 years of age at the time of the consent
             visit.

          5. Post bronchodilator FEV1 â¥40% of the predicted value. Once the safety data for the
             first 16 patients have been reviewed and approved by the DSMC the criterion will be
             changed to a post bronchodilator of FEV1 â¥30% of the predicted value*.

          6. To have had 1 or more COPD exacerbations in the last 12 months requiring intervention
             with oral corticosteroids and/or antibiotics.

             worse in the past.

          8. Should be prescribed and taking regularly one or more long acting bronchodilator (e.g.
             long acting Î²2 agonist [LABA], long acting muscarinic antagonist [LAMA]) with or
             without an inhaled corticosteroid maintenance therapy for their COPD.

          9. Patients on self-management plans agree to consult a healthcare professional prior to
             taking oral corticosteroids or antibiotics for treatment of a COPD exacerbation.

             before entering the trial and should continue with birth control for 1 month after the
             last dose of inhaled IFN-Î²-1a/matching placebo. In addition to the acceptable birth
             control method (except for the practice of total sexual abstinence), condom (in UK
             with spermicides) should be used by the male partner for sexual intercourse from
             randomisation (Visit 2) and for 1 month after the last dose of inhaled
             IFN-Î²-1a/matching placebo to prevent pregnancy.

             are postmenopausal. Women will be considered postmenopausal if they have been
             amenorrheic for 12 months prior to the planned date of randomisation without an
             alternative medical cause. The following age specific requirements apply:

               -  Women &lt;50 years old would be considered postmenopausal if they have been
                  amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal

               -  Women â¥50 years old would be considered postmenopausal if they have been
                  amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal
                  treatment.

         13. Motivation (in the Investigator's opinion) to comply with protocol requirements and
             complete all study visits, including the ability to communicate well with the
             Investigator and be capable of understanding the nature of the research and its
             treatment (including its risks and potential benefits).

               -  patients will continue to be recruited using the inclusion criterion FEV1 â¥40%,
                  until the change to FEV1 â¥30% has been approved by the DSMC.

        PART 1 - Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any condition, including findings in the medical history or in the pre-randomisation
             assessments that in the opinion of the Investigator, constitutes a risk or a
