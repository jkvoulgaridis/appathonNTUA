  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some patients who have blood clots come down with a life-threatening condition known as
      Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension (CTEPH), which is high blood pressure only in
      the arteries of the lungs. This study seeks to understand more about the genetics causes of
      CTEPH by obtaining blood samples and examining family histories.

    <textblock>
      This project proposes to identify a cohort of Utah patients with CTEPH, and to perform a
      comprehensive analysis of family history and CTEPH risk factors in these patients, and in
      controls with acute pulmonary embolism (PE) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).
      Detailed family history interviews will be performed with all patients, and all enrolled
      patients will provide a blood sample for thrombophilia testing and for gene sequencing with
      the goal of identifying novel genetic variants that contribute to CTEPH risk.

        Patients with CTEPH will be recruited and enrolled at Intermountain Healthcare, also from
        outside of Intermountain Healthcare, for example at the University of Utah (following IRB
        approval there) and at national conferences.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  CTEPH cohort:

               1. Confirmed CTEPH based on having undergone PEA surgery.

               2. Strongly suspected CTEPH based on right heart catheterization data showing
                  mPAP&gt;26 and PCWP&lt;15, and imaging demonstrating chronic thromboembolic disease
                  (either ventilation/perfusion scan, CT pulmonary angiography, or conventional
                  pulmonary angiography).

          -  PE cohort:

               1. PE diagnosed by CT pulmonary angiography or ventilation/perfusion scan within the
                  preceding 24 months.

               2. No evidence of PH at the time of enrollment (based on absence of dyspnea,
                  exertional chest pain, or exertional presyncope on history, lack of physical exam
                  findings of PH or right heart failure, and lack of signs of PH on objective data
                  including echocardiography and/or right heart catheterization).

               3. No evidence of chronic thromboembolic disease at the time of enrollment (based on
                  chronic appearing thrombus on CT pulmonary angiography or conventional pulmonary
                  angiography, or based on prior high probability ventilation/perfusion scan
                  showing a similar pattern of perfusion defects).

          -  PAH cohort:

               1. Diagnosis of group 1 PAH.

               2. Prior normal or low probability ventilation/perfusion scan.

               3. No reported history of prior VTE events.

               4. If available, all prior evaluations for VTE (including CT pulmonary angiography
                  and Doppler ultrasound exams) must also be negative.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Under the age of 18
