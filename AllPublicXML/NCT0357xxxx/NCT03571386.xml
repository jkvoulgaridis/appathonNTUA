      Mindfulness-based Interventions (MBIs) are a family of standardized cognitive and behavioral
      therapies that focus on cultivating mindfulness-related skills for improving maladaptive
      cognitive, emotional, and behavioral processes. MBIs have been developed for a wide range of
      problems, disorders, and populations and are increasingly available in a variety of health
      settings. This mixed methods study proposes to investigate proposed neurobiological,
      physiological, psycho-social-behavioral, and cognitive mechanisms by which MBIs may improve
      health outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The state of mindfulness can be described as a form of meta-awareness in which attention is
      allocated to the present moment of external and internal sensory or mental experience,
      without reactivity, and without dwelling on any particular sensory or mental object with
      judgement or evaluation. Mindfulness-based Interventions (MBIs) are a family of standardized
      cognitive and behavioral therapies that focus on cultivating mindfulness-related skills for
      improving maladaptive cognitive, emotional, and behavioral processes.

      MBIs have been developed for a wide range of problems, disorders, and populations and are
      increasingly available in a variety of health settings. Empirically supported MBIs include
      acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT; Hayes, Strosahl, &amp; Wilson, 1999), dialectical
      behavior therapy (DBT; Linehan, 1993), mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT; Segal,
      Williams, &amp; Teasdale, 2002), and mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR; Kabat-Zinn, 1982,
      1990). Variations on these approaches, including integration of mindfulness training into
      individual psychotherapy from diverse perspectives, also have been described (Germer, Siegel,
      &amp; Fulton, 2005). As the empirical evidence for the efficacy of these interventions continues
      to grow, the importance of investigating the mechanisms or processes by which they lead to
      beneficial outcomes is increasingly recognized. This mixed methods study proposes to
      investigate proposed neurobiological, physiological, psycho-social-behavioral, and cognitive
      mechanisms by which MBIs may improve health outcomes. Target (mechanism) engagement is
      expected to facilitate identification of individuals who are most likely to benefit (or not)
      from MBIs and further develop targeted interventions for optimization of delivery. Although
      there are very specific aims and hypotheses to be tested, this preliminary exploratory
      investigation will provide feasibility data and allow for refining existing hypotheses for
      larger research proposals to be submitted for extramural grant support.

      Whole blood assays (WBA) will be used in conjunction with lipopolysaccharide (LPS)‐stimulated
      whole blood cell cultures for detecting reliable cytokine responsivity. Introducing LPS as an
      in vitro stimulus to study the potential variable effect on cytokines such as TNFα gene
      expression in fresh whole blood as compared to fresh PBMCs or frozen PBMCs has demonstrated
      to be successful and with less variability than peripheral markers. The WBA uses a small
      sample volume (approximately 1-2 ml).
