  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators demonstrated that in vivo THG microscopy can differentiate
      Solar lentigos (SL), Nevus zygomaticus(NZ) and normal skin based on the optical nature of
      melanin. This THG-based procedure provides a valuable tool for noninvasive determination of
      third-order nonlinear susceptibility of melanin within the skin. It can also provide
      real-time histopathology information for treatment follow-up, without performing an invasive
      skin biopsy.

      A nonrandomized, controlled, split-face comparative study was conducted to compare the
      efficacy and safety between quality-switched ruby laser (QSRL) and 532-nm picosecond Nd:YAG
      laser (532-PSNYL for SL, 1064-PSNYL for NZ) in the treatment of solar lentigo clinically and
      histologically by harmonic generation microscopy (HGM). After baseline photography and in
      vivo harmonic generation microscopy (HGM) imaging, QSRL and 532-PSNYL or 1064-PSNYL therapy
      for solar lentigos and nevus zygomaticus on the left and right side of the face,
      respectively, were performed for each subject. The subjects underwent follow-up assessment at
      weeks 3 and 6.

      Statistical analysis: All data gathered went through decoding and were analyzed by blinded
      evaluators using SPSS software (version 20.0; IBM, Armonk, NY). All tests were two-sided. A P
      value of &lt; .05 was considered to be statistically significant.
