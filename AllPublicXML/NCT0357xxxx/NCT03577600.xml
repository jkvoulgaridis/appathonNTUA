    <textblock>
      This is a prospective case-control study. This study is expected to last for approximately 12
      months, comprised of 4-8 weeks of enrollment period, 28 days of treatment and 6 months of
      follow up. The enrollment will be completed prior to the beginning of initial treatment. The
      study will be closed when 10 subjects have completed the study. The recruitment will be
      carried out with a sample at convenience.

      A case-study study. The controls will be historical and matched to the age range (preschool,
      school age, early adolescent, late adolescent) and type of tumor. This study is expected to
      last for approximately 12 months, comprised of 4-8 weeks of enrollment period, 28 days of
      treatment and 6 months of follow up. The recruitment will be carried out with a sample at
      convenience in patients with brain tumors in terminal phase that are outside conventional
      treatment. Quantum magnetic resonance therapy (QMRT) will be administrated with the Cytotron®
      device.. The CYTOTRON-RTE-6040-864GEN (Class IIA Medical Therapeutic Device; developed by
      Scalene Cybernetics Ltd, Bengaluru, India), is a patented (U.S. Patent 9162076 B2 awarded
      20/10 2015, European Patent EP 175350831, awarded 3/11/2015, Chinese Patent issued 2010,
      09/08), CE marked device. QMRT will be administered as a compassionate treatment with the
      authorization signed by the parent(s) and with the respective informed consent (depending on
      age). Study Center: Hospital Infantil de México Federico Gómez. Objectives: To determine the
      safety and efficacy of QMRT using the Cytotron in terminal brain tumors. Number of Subjects:
      10. Diagnosis and main Inclusion Criteria Subjects with clinically diagnosed terminal brain
      tumors, age: 3 to 16. Study Device, Dose,Route Device: Cytotron-generated precisely computed,
      individualized Dosimetry with Radiofrequencies (RF) in the presence of a pulsed,
      instantaneous electromagnetic resonance (MR) field, applied to a subject. Dose: 1 hour per
      day. Route: Focused, non-invasive RF and MR beams delivered to target areas identified by
      brain MRI scan and individual proton density (PD) measurements of the target lesions.
      Duration of administration: Once a day for 28 consecutive days. Reference therapy: None

    <description>Cytotron® utilizes a combination of instantaneous magnetic field and RF at the safe, lowerend of the EM spectrum. Radiofrequency waves are computed based on individualized PD measurements of the target lesion(s) for therapeutic purpose. Its working principle is based on the underlying theory of magnetic resonance.</description>
