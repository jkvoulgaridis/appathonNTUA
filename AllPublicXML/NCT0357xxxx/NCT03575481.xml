  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators compared the activity and fatigue of upper extremity muscles, pain levels,
      subject satisfaction levels, perceived exertion, and number of repetitions in Task-Specific
      Training (TST) compared with Robot-Assisted Training (RAT) in individuals post-stroke.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twenty sub-acute post stroke subjects received one TST and one RAT. They marked the pain
      level in their paretic extremity before and after each session. Muscle activity levels and
      fatigue and number of repetitions were monitored during each session. The subjective
      assessment questionnaire of treatment and the Borg scale were administered post-session.
