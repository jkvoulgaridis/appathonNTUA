    <textblock>
      This phase III trial studies how well chemotherapy before and after surgery works in treating
      participants with gallbladder cancer that can be removed by surgery. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, gemcitabine, and capecitabine, work in different ways to
      stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing,
      or by stopping them from spreading. Giving chemotherapy before and after surgery may kill
      more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the difference in overall survival (OS) at 3 years for patients with
      incidental gallbladder cancer (IGBC) who receive neoadjuvant gemcitabine hydrochloride
      (gemcitabine) and cisplatin (gem/cis) prior to reoperation followed by adjuvant capecitabine
      compared to patients who receive only adjuvant capecitabine after reoperation.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the difference in recurrence-free survival (RFS) at 1 year for patients with
      IGBC who receive perioperative chemotherapy prior to and after re-operation compared to
      patients who receive only adjuvant chemotherapy after reoperation.

      II. To assess the clinical effect of perioperative chemotherapy compared to only adjuvant
      chemotherapy after reoperation on resectability among 3 cohorts: all enrolled patients, all
      patients who undergo staging laparoscopy, and all patients who undergo laparotomy.

      III. To compare the incidence of residual disease at the time of re-resection between
      patients who receive perioperative chemotherapy and those who receive only adjuvant
      chemotherapy.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Participants undergo re-resection (including partial liver resection and portal lymph
      node dissection) after incidental diagnosis of gallbladder cancer. Participants then receive
      capecitabine orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 21 days for
      8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Participants receive cisplatin intravenously (IV) over 1 hour and gemcitabine IV over
      30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Within 10 weeks of chemotherapy, participants
      undergo re-resection (including partial liver resection and portal lymph node dissection).
      Participants then receive capecitabine PO BID on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 21 days
      for 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up periodically for up to 3
      years.

    <description>Recurrence-free survival (RFS) at one year, defined as time from surgery to first observed disease recurrence or death from any cause, among only patients who undergo complete, curative-intent re-resection.

Patients who do not undergo reoperation or re-resection, have incomplete resections (R2), or who have gross evidence of distant metastases and/or T4 disease will be excluded from the RFS analysis</description>
