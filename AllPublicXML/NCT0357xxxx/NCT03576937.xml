  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current guidelines in non-small cell lung cancer recommend genomic assessment for mutations
      in EGFR and BRAF, gene rearrangements in ALK and ROS1, and resistance mutations such as T790M
      upon progression during EGFR inhibitor therapy. However, obtaining sufficient tumour tissue
      to test for these molecular alterations, as well as those with emerging targeted therapies,
      is challenging in lung cancer. A promising method to improve molecular diagnostic testing in
      lung and other cancers is the use of circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) obtained from blood
      samples or liquid biopsies. This multi-centre prospective study will compare blood-based
      profiling (using the GUARDANT360 assay) to standard of care tissue-based profiling within the
      Canadian system.

          5. Patients who have previously received curative therapy are eligible if primary
             treatment was completed at least 6 months prior to the development of advanced
             disease; for patients who received adjuvant systemic therapy, the last dose of
             treatment must have been given at least 6 weeks prior to enrollment;
