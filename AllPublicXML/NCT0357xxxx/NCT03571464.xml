  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of GGRO reducing OCD related
      maladaptive beliefs and OCD symptoms. Specifically, a randomized controlled trial with
      crossover design was carried out in non-clinical population to assess pre-post changes in
      levels of OCD-related maladaptive beliefs and OCD symptoms, including relationship OCD (ROCD)
      symptoms, self-esteem, and depressive symptoms following 15 days of using GGRO.

    <textblock>
      The implementation of Information and Communication Technologies in the treatment or
      prevention of OCD symptoms has been significantly lower compared to with its application in
      other anxiety disorders.

      Recently, an exploratory study evaluated a brief, game-like, training exercise for
      challenging OCD-beliefs delivered via a mobile application platform named GGRO. However, more
      studies are needed to test the efficacy.

    <intervention_model_description>All participants were requested to complete web-based assessment, with questionnaires relating to maladaptive beliefs, mood and OC symptoms at baseline (T1), 15 days following baseline (T2) and 30 days following baseline (T3). Participants in Immediate use GGRO group started using the app at baseline and continued using the app for 15 consecutive days. They were then requested to stop using the app until T3. Participants in the Delayed use GGRO group were requested to wait for 15 days and only then start using the app (cross-over) for 15 consecutive days.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>15 days</time_frame>
    <description>Score change in obsessive compulsive maladaptive beliefs measured by the short form of the Obsessive Beliefs Questionnaire (OBQ-20). Total score is computed as a mean of the 20 items, ranging from 1 &quot;disagree very much&quot; to 7 &quot;agree very much&quot;. Higher scores indicate the person has more obsessive beliefs.</description>

    <time_frame>15 days</time_frame>
    <description>Score change in obsessive-compulsive symptoms measured by the Obsessive Compulsive Inventory- Revised version (OCI-R). Total score is computed as a mean of the 18 items, ranging from 0 &quot;not at all&quot; to 4 &quot;Extremely&quot;. Higher scores indicate a greater presence of obsessive-compulsive symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in depression symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>15 days</time_frame>
    <description>Score change in depression symptoms measured by Depression, Anxiety and Stres Scale (DASS). The depression scale is composed by the mean of 7 items, ranging from 0 &quot;did not apply to me at all&quot; to 3 &quot;applied to me very much, or most of the time&quot;. Higher scores indicate a greater presence of obsessive -compulsive symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Change in Self-Esteem</measure>
    <time_frame>15 days</time_frame>
    <description>Change in score of Single Ítem Self Esteem Scale (SISE). Self-Esteem is measured with this single item ranging from 1 &quot;not very true for me&quot; to 9 &quot;very true for me&quot;. Higher scores indicates a higher Self-Esteem.</description>

    <description>GGRO was designed to challenge maladaptive beliefs that underlie common OCD symptoms (e.g., contamination, repugnant thoughts) as well as relationships obsessions. Users are presented with 'blocks' featuring statements such as &quot;I take things as they come&quot; or &quot;Everything can end in a catastrophe&quot;. Users then have to respond to these statements by either pulling 'blocks' towards themselves (i.e., downwards) or throwing the blocks away from themselves (i.e., rejecting them upwards).</description>
