  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oral mucositis is one of the most spread side effects of anticancer therapy. It is associated
      with both chemo- and radiotherapy, decreases QoL, relative dose intensity and leads to
      nutritive deficiency. Oral mucositis causes secondary infections, increased hospital stay,
      whereas pain syndrome results in an emotional distress, anorexia and disables natural
      feeding.

      Primary:

      To evaluate the efficacy of ONCOXIN on oral mucositis symptoms in patients who receive
      chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy.

      Secondary:

      To evaluate the effects of ONCOXIN on nutritional status in patients who receive chemotherapy
      and/or radiotherapy.

    <description>Efficacy of OCOXIN on oral mucositis symptoms in patients who receive chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy with WHO oral toxicity scale grades. The WHO scale is dependent on both objective and subjective variables, and measures anatomical, symptomatic as well as functional components of oral mucositis.
WHO Oral Mucositis Grading Scale:
0 (none): None
I (mild): Oral soreness, erythema
II (moderate): Oral erythema, ulcers, solid diet tolerated
III (severe): Oral ulcers, liquid diet only
IV (life-threatening): Oral alimentation impossible</description>
