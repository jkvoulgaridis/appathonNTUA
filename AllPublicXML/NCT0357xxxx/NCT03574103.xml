  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to determine if time-restricted feeding (TRF) is an effective dietary
      strategy to weight loss after 8 weeks intervention. TRF will be compared with an intervention
      without restriction in time for feeding. Both strategies will be with caloric restriction.

      The participants of the study will be divided in two groups: (1) a group with caloric
      restriction and without restriction in time for feeding and (2) a group with caloric
      restriction and restriction in time for feeding. This second group will be subdivided
      according to the participant's preference: (2.1) first meal at 8 a.m. and last meal at 4 p.m.
      or (2.2) first meal at 12 p.m. and last meal at 8 p.m. The caloric restriction for all
      participants will be 513 to 770 kcal from estimated energy requirement.
