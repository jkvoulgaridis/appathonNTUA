  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria has increased the use of meropenem in
      spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). Additionally, recent studies suggested female gender
      as an independent risk factor for mortality in SBP. Studies regarding possible sex dependent
      differences in meropenem pharmacokinetics in SBP are scarce. The aim of this study is to
      determine the pharmacokinetics of meropenem during SBP in female and male patients with liver
      cirrhosis to investigate whether pharmacodynamics therapy goals are met.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Spontaneous bacterial Peritonitis (SBP) in liver cirrhosis is a severe and increasingly
      common disease, which is associated with high morbidity, mortality and high costs for the
      investigator's health care system. In addition to age and severity of comorbidities, female
      sex is associated with detrimental outcome. Delayed diagnosis and therapy of SBP may lead to
      a higher mortality in this patient population. Therefore, an early diagnosis and adequate
      anti-infective therapy is essential. Due to the accumulation of antimicrobial-resistant (AMR)
      pathogens, especially in nosocomial SBP, empirical application of broad-spectrum antibiotics
      is recommended in the therapy of SBP.During the use of antibiotic drugs in general,
      pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) targets, as the achieved time period over the minimal
      inhibitory concentration (MIC), should be evaluated to increase drug efficacy and reduce AMR
      development. Pharmacokinetic studies of meropenem concentrations at the infection site in
      this particular group of patients are rare in the literature. Recent studies in critically
      ill patients showed highly variable meropenem concentrations in peritoneal fluid after iv
      administration. The aim of this study is to determine the pharmacokinetics of meropenem
      during SBP in female and male patients with liver cirrhosis to investigate whether
      pharmacodynamics therapy goals are met.
