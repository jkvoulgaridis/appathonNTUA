             requiring frequent medical management or pharmacologic or surgical treatment that in
             the opinion of the Investigator or the Sponsor makes the subject unsuitable for the
             study

          -  Previous treatment with an investigational agent for HBV other than ABI-H0731 in the
             last 6 months before screening
