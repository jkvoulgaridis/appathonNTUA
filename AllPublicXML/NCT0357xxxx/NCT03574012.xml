    <textblock>
      This pilot trial studies how well education and mobile health applications work in reducing
      the effects of cancer treatment on the heart in participants with blood cancers that are in
      remission. Education and mobile health applications may be effective ways to manage heart
      health and to reduce future heart disease risk in participants with blood cancers.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the feasibility of recruiting and retaining hematologic malignancy and
      hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) survivors in a randomized cardiovascular (CV) risk
      reduction mobile health (mHealth) counseling intervention.

      II. Develop and refine a protocol to engage participants using an existing social medial
      platform and commercially available mHealth tools to reinforce lifestyle goals.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      INTERVENTION GROUP: Participants receive individualized goal-setting and coaching in relation
      to physical activity and diet, supplemented with peer support through the study's social
      media platform, over 4 months. They also have access to mHealth apps including Fitbit and
      Healthwatch that provide feedback on physical activity and diet.

      CONTROL GROUP: Participants receive general information about physical activity and diet, and
      access to Fitbit and Healthwatch.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 2 months and at 1 year.
