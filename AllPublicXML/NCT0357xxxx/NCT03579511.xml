    <description>The original techniques of fetal head extraction entail the introduction of the obstetricians' hands or other instruments into the LUS. This puts the LUS at risk of damage and incision extensions with its consequences of increased blood loss, increased operative time,infection adhesions and blood transfusion.To the available, the generated good quality evidence bases practice in CS is anticipated to decrease such morbidities</description>
