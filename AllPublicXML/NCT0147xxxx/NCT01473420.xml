    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate therapeutic equivalence of subcutaneous (SC)
      Epoetin Hospira compared to SC Epogen (Amgen), based on maintenance of hemoglobin (Hb) levels
      and study drug dose requirements in patients treated for anemia associated with chronic renal
      failure and on hemodialysis.

        <description>In this outcome measure number of participants with change (increase and decrease) in mean dose of Epoetin Hospira and Epogen were categorized and reported according to their mean hemoglobin levels. Hemoglobin levels were divided in following classes: &gt;11.0 g/dL, from 9.0 to 11.0 g/dL and &lt;9.0 g/dL</description>

        <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. A treatment emergent AE was defined as an event that emerged during the treatment period that was absent before treatment, or worsened during the treatment period relative to the pretreatment state. An AE was assessed according to severity; mild (AE was transient and easily tolerated by the participant), moderate (caused problem that did not interfere significantly with usual activities) and severe (caused problem that interferes significantly with usual activities and might be incapacitating or life-threatening).</description>

Participants who were on Epogen SC regimen prior to this study were continued to receive same as a part of routine clinical practice and did not receive any study treatment during titration period. Dose of study treatment was adjusted to maintain Hb level from 9 to 11 g/dL. Drug was administered 1 to 3 times per week in titration period (Week 1 to Week 18).</description>
