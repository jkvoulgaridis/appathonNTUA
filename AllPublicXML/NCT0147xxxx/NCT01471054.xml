      To evaluate the safety and efficacy of dexamethasone intravitreal implant (Ozurdex) and
      compare it with safety and efficacy of intravitreal bevacizumab in eyes with macular edema
      after plaque radiotherapy of uveal melanoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Plaque radiotherapy is a commonly used method for treatment of small and medium-sized uveal
      melanomas. Macular edema is one of the most common causes of visual loss after plaque
      radiotherapy and has been reported in up to 70% of patients with posterior uveal melanoma.
      Different methods have been proposed for treatment of post-radiation macular edema and
      include periocular steroid, intravitreal steroid, intravitreal vascular endothelial growth
      factor (VEGF) inhibitors, photodynamic therapy, and macular laser photocoagulation.

      Injection of intravitreal triamcinolone (a form of steroid) has been found to be useful for
      treatment of different forms of macular edema but is associated with considerable rates of
      increased intraocular pressure (glaucoma). Dexamethasone is more potent than triamcinolone
      and can be safely injected directly into the vitreous cavity (intravitreal injection) but
      unfortunately its use in the form of intravitreal injection is not practical due to the short
      half-life of intraocular dexamethasone (about 3 hours).

      Within the past several years, tiny drug delivery systems have been developed that allow
      sustained release of minute amounts of steroid into the back part (vitreous cavity) of the
      eye, when they are implanted into the vitreous cavity. Ozurdex is a biodegradable
      dexamethasone intravitreal implant that has been shown to be well-tolerated and effective for
      up to 6 months in reducing vision loss and improving visual outcome in eyes with different
      types of macular edema including those secondary to diabetic retinopathy and retinal vein
      occlusion.

      In this study the investigators would like to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of
      Ozurdex (dexamethasone intravitreal implant) for treatment of macular edema developing after
      plaque radiotherapy of uveal melanoma.

          <description>Patients will be followed at 1 week after Ozurdex insertion (0.7 mg) and then at 1,2, 3,4, 5, and 6 months. Afterwards, patients will be seen every 2 months. At each visit patients will undergo measurement of BCVA, complete eye examination, fundus photography, and optical coherence tomography. Fluorescein angiography will be repeated at 6 and 12 months. Each eye in the Ozurdex group can have a maximum total of three Ozurdex insertions at minimum of 4-month intervals in the first year of study.
The criteria for retreatment with Ozurdex are:
i.The study eye must have shown initial favorable response to prior Ozurdex implant (&gt;10% decrease in central macular thickness with maintenance [change in BCVA of &lt;=1 line] or improvement of visual acuity [increase of BCVA of &gt;1 line]) ii. Interval since last Ozurdex implant should be &gt; 4 and &lt; 12 months. iii. The study eye must show definite evidence of recurrence of macular edema.</description>

At each visit patients will be checked for side effects of treatment, measurement of BCVA, complete eye examination, fundus photography, and optical coherence tomography. Fluorescein angiography will be repeated at 6 and 12 months. Eyes in the Bevacizumab group can have a maximum total of twelve (12) bevacizumab injections at minimum of 4-week intervals in the first year after enrolling into the study.
All patients will receive 6 monthly injections after entering the study. After the sixth injection (at month 5) the interval between injections will be extended to 6 weeks if the study eye has shown initial favorable response to prior intravitreal bevacizumab.</description>

          <description>Patients will be followed at 1 week after Ozurdex insertion (0.7 mg) and then at 1,2, 3,4, 5, and 6 months. Afterwards, patients will be seen every 2 months. At each visit patients will undergo measurement of BCVA, complete eye examination, fundus photography, and optical coherence tomography. Fluorescein angiography will be repeated at 6 and 12 months. Each eye in the Ozurdex group can have a maximum total of three Ozurdex insertions at minimum of 4-month intervals in the first year of study.
The criteria for retreatment with Ozurdex are:
i.The study eye must have shown initial favorable response to prior Ozurdex implant (&gt;10% decrease in central macular thickness with maintenance [change in BCVA of &lt;=1 line] or improvement of visual acuity [increase of BCVA of &gt;1 line]) ii. Interval since last Ozurdex implant should be &gt; 4 and &lt; 12 months. iii. The study eye must show definite evidence of recurrence of macular edema.</description>

At each visit patients will be checked for side effects of treatment, measurement of BCVA, complete eye examination, fundus photography, and optical coherence tomography. Fluorescein angiography will be repeated at 6 and 12 months. Eyes in the Bevacizumab group can have a maximum total of twelve (12) bevacizumab injections at minimum of 4-week intervals in the first year after enrolling into the study.
All patients will receive 6 monthly injections after entering the study. After the sixth injection (at month 5) the interval between injections will be extended to 6 weeks if the study eye has shown initial favorable response to prior intravitreal bevacizumab.</description>
