  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well giving hypofractionated radiation therapy together with
      temozolomide and bevacizumab works in treating patients with high-grade glioblastoma
      multiforme or anaplastic glioma. Specialized radiation therapy, such as hypofractionated
      radiation therapy, that delivers a high dose of radiation directly to the tumor may kill more
      tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the
      cells or by stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can
      block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor to grow and spread.
      Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Giving
      hypofractionated radiation therapy together with temozolomide and bevacizumab may kill more
      tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the overall survival (OS) for patients with recurrent high grade malignant
      gliomas treated with concurrent radiation, temozolomide, and bevacizumab followed by adjuvant
      temozolomide and bevacizumab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the impact of this regimen on neurologic symptoms via Functional Assessment of
      Cancer Therapy-Brain (FACT-Br) and FACT-Fatigue scales and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
      (ECOG) performance status.

      II. Determine the safety profile of this regimen. III. Determine the progression free
      survival (PFS) at 6 and 12 months (all patients) as well as at 3 months (bevacizumab-exposed
      patients only).

      OUTLINE:

      CONCURRENT THERAPY: Patients undergo hypofractionated radiation therapy 5 days a week
      beginning on day 0. Patients also receive temozolomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) and
      bevacizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes once every 2 weeks beginning on days -3 to
      0. Treatment continues for 5 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      ADJUVANT THERAPY: Beginning 2 weeks after completion of radiation therapy, patients receive
      temozolomide PO QD for 6 weeks and bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes once every 2 weeks.
      Courses repeat every 8 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2-3 months.

    <description>Questionnaires were completed before treatment (baseline) at the end of treatment (EOT) and after Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 of treatment (Initial phase of treatment =5 weeks + approximately 2 weeks recovery then adjuvant therapy where 1 cycle = 8 weeks). The following questionnaires were completed by patients to evaluate quality of life (QOL) at these timepoints:
FACT-Fatigue - scores from 1 to 4 with 1=not at all and 4=very much, the higher the score the more fatigue reported by the patient.
FACT-Brain (FACT Br) which included - Physcial Well-being (PWB), Social/Family Well-being (SWB), Emotional Well-being (EWB), and Functional Well-being (FWB).
Patients gave scores from 0 to 4 with 0=not at all and 4=very much, the higher the score the better the QOL reported by the patient.</description>

    <description>Toxicity will be assessed using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 4.0 criteria on Day 1 of every treatment cycle and by patient report while on study treatment and up to 30 days after the last treatment. Grade 1 - 4 adverse events (AE) where the relationship between the AE and at least one of the study drugs were considered to be definite, probable or possible, were collected and graded as:
Grade 1 Mild AE Grade 2 Moderate AE Grade 3 Severe AE Grade 4 Life-threatening or disabling AE Grade 5 Death related to AE</description>

    <description>Progression Free Survival is defined as the time from the first study treatment to the first occurrence of disease progression or death. Data will be analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curves. Tumor measurements and assessments will be based on Updated Response Assessment Criteria of High Grade Gliomas- Neuro-Oncology Working Group (RANO criteria). Tumor assessments may include either a CT or MRI scan of the brain, however the same method should be used throughout the treatment period for each patient. In general, progressive disease is defined as any of the following: ≥ 25% increase in T1 gadolinium enhancing disease, increase in T2/Flair, new lesions present or decrease in clinical status</description>

        <description>Questionnaires were completed before treatment (baseline) at the end of treatment (EOT) and after Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 of treatment (Initial phase of treatment =5 weeks + approximately 2 weeks recovery then adjuvant therapy where 1 cycle = 8 weeks). The following questionnaires were completed by patients to evaluate quality of life (QOL) at these timepoints:
FACT-Fatigue - scores from 1 to 4 with 1=not at all and 4=very much, the higher the score the more fatigue reported by the patient.
FACT-Brain (FACT Br) which included - Physcial Well-being (PWB), Social/Family Well-being (SWB), Emotional Well-being (EWB), and Functional Well-being (FWB).
Patients gave scores from 0 to 4 with 0=not at all and 4=very much, the higher the score the better the QOL reported by the patient.</description>

          <title>Safety Profile for Patients With Recurrent High Grade Malignant Gliomas Treated With Concurrent Radiation, Temozolomide, and Bevacizumab Followed by Adjuvant Temozolomide and Bevacizumab</title>
          <description>Toxicity will be assessed using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 4.0 criteria on Day 1 of every treatment cycle and by patient report while on study treatment and up to 30 days after the last treatment. Grade 1 - 4 adverse events (AE) where the relationship between the AE and at least one of the study drugs were considered to be definite, probable or possible, were collected and graded as:
Grade 1 Mild AE Grade 2 Moderate AE Grade 3 Severe AE Grade 4 Life-threatening or disabling AE Grade 5 Death related to AE</description>
          <population>All patients that received at least one dose of treatment on study were eligible for this outcome measure</population>

        <title>Percentage of Patients With Progression Free Survival (PFS) at 6 Months and 12 Months</title>
        <description>Progression Free Survival is defined as the time from the first study treatment to the first occurrence of disease progression or death. Data will be analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curves. Tumor measurements and assessments will be based on Updated Response Assessment Criteria of High Grade Gliomas- Neuro-Oncology Working Group (RANO criteria). Tumor assessments may include either a CT or MRI scan of the brain, however the same method should be used throughout the treatment period for each patient. In general, progressive disease is defined as any of the following: ≥ 25% increase in T1 gadolinium enhancing disease, increase in T2/Flair, new lesions present or decrease in clinical status</description>

      <time_frame>Adverse events were collected from the first day of treatment until 30 days after the last treatment on study for up to approximately 67 weeks for any patient. Concurrent therapy was 5 weeks in length followed by 2 weeks recovery and then adjuvant therapy where 1 cycle = 8 weeks and range of cycles completed 0-7.</time_frame>

          <description>CONCURRENT THERAPY: Patients undergo hypofractionated radiation therapy 5 days a week beginning on Day 0. Patients also receive temozolomide PO QD and bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes once every 2 weeks beginning on Days -3 to 0. Treatment continues for 5 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
ADJUVANT THERAPY: Beginning 2 weeks after completion of radiation therapy, patients receive temozolomide PO QD for 6 weeks and bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes once every 2 weeks. Courses repeat every 8 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
Temozolomide: Given PO
Hypofractionated Radiation Therapy: Undergo hypofractionated radiation therapy
Bevacizumab: Given IV
