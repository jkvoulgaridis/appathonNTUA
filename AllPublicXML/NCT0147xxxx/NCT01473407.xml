      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate therapeutic equivalence of IV Epoetin Hospira
      compared to IV Epogen (Amgen), based on maintenance of Hb levels and study drug dose
      requirements in patients treated for anemia associated with chronic renal failure and on
      hemodialysis.

        <title>Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</title>
        <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An SAE is an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; Initial or prolonged in-patient hospitalization; life threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent were events from first dose of study drug to the end of study (up to Week 28) that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pre-treatment state. AEs included both serious and non-serious adverse events.</description>
