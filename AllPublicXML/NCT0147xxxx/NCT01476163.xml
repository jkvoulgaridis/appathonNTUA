      This Physician Initiated Request program allows physicians to request permission from Amicus
      to receive migalastat HCl for specific patients with Fabry disease who have a mutation
      amenable to this treatment, who do not have access to available treatment alternatives, or do
      not meet requirements for participation in an existing migalastat clinical study. Up to 20
      patients worldwide may be treated. Patients must meet specific criteria to receive Amicus
      permission for participation. Key criteria for participation include: 16-74 years old;
      Confirmed GLA gene mutation shown to be responsive to migalastat; Have no treatment option
      because either unsuitable for enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) or unable to access ERT.
      Requirements for sufficient kidney function. If permission is granted, initial approval is
      for a 6 month supply of migalastat HCl with renewal every 6 months available upon meeting
      continued eligibility.
