  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the safety of the addition of sitagliptin, and its
      effect on hemoglobin A1c (A1C), fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and the proportion of patients
      requiring glycemic rescue therapy in pediatric patients 10-17 years of age (inclusive) with
      type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with inadequate glycemic control on metformin therapy (alone
      or in combination with insulin). The primary hypothesis is that the addition of sitagliptin
      reduces A1C more than the addition of placebo after 20 weeks of treatment. Participants who
      complete the 20-week base period of the study may choose to participate in the extension
      period of the study and continue on or off treatment assigned during the base period for an
      additional 34 weeks.
