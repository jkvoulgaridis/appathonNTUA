  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (PARDS) is a severe and diffuse lung injury
      that is a common cause of admission and mortality in the pediatric intensive care unit
      (PICU). PARDS can be secondary to many different causes, and there are few therapies that
      have been shown beneficial in PARDS. This study seeks to identify important PARDS subtypes
      using gene expression profiling of bronchial epithelial cells from control and PARDS
      subjects.

      Enrolled subjects will have nasal brushings collected at days 1, 3, 7, and 14 of intubation
      with collection of serum at these same time points. Brushing RNA will be processed by
      mRNA-Seq for gene expression analysis and compared to previously published serum biomarkers
      (interleukin-8, advanced glycosylation end-product specific receptor, and angiopoietin-2) to
      assess correlation and ability to discriminate PARDS endotypes. Changes in gene expression
      over time will be assessed to define a PARDS recovery gene expression signature, and
      correlation between bronchial and nasal gene expression will be determined.
