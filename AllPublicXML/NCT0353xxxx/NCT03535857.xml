  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate whether bilateral Posterior Tibial Nerve Stimulation is
      more effective than unilateral Posterior Tibial Nerve Stimulation at treating overactive
      bladder and urge urinary incontinence
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) is an accepted treatment for overactive bladder
      that can be accomplished in the office with minimal side effects. It is currently carried out
      by stimulating one of the posterior tibial nerves unilaterally. The aim of this study is to
      determine whether bilateral percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation is more effective than
      unilateral stimulation. Patients with a diagnosis of overactive bladder who have previously
      failed lifestyle changes and/or pharmacologic therapy will be offered percutaneous tibial
      nerve stimulation. Enrolled patients will be randomized into two groups. The control group
      will receive the traditional unilateral treatment of PTNS. The intervention group will
      receive bilateral PTNS treatment. Intervention success will be measured by improvement in
      overactive bladder symptoms assessed by improvement in the scores on the overactive bladder
      questionnaire symptoms bother and decrease in number of voids, nocturia episodes and
      incontinence episodes as reported in the voiding diary

    <measure>Change in OAB symptom severity score</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Overactive Bladder questionnaire short form symptom severity will be administered at baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks then 12 weeks. The questionnaire score ranges from 0 to 100. Those with more bothersome symptoms will have higher scores. The investigators expect more improvement in symptoms from participants receiving bilateral stimulation compared to those with unilateral stimulation.</description>

    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in nocturia episodes</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A bladder diary will be used to determine how many episodes of voiding occurs at night (nocturia). Baseline nocturia will be compared to nocturia at 12 weeks</description>

    <measure>Evaluate impact of treatment on quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The incontinence impact questionnaire will be used to measure impact on qualify of life. The questionnaire score range from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating worse quality of life.</description>
