  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This purpose of this study is to assess the impact of consuming wolfberry on cardiovascular
      risk in Singapore's middle-aged and older adults. The investigators hypothesize that
      consuming wolfberry with a healthy eating pattern diet will contribute to improvements in
      cardiovascular health when compared to a similar diet without wolfberry.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 16-week parallel, single-blind (investigator), prospective randomized controlled
      trial. The study was designed based on previous research which showed that consuming 15 g/day
      of wolfberry for 4 weeks and 14 g/day of wolfberry with meal for 6 weeks increased plasma
      zeaxanthin concentrations and antioxidant status. Also, other studies reported observable
      changes in the endothelial progenitor cells and flow mediated dilation after just two weeks
      of fruit and vegetables or healthy diet interventions. Thus collectively, 16-weeks may be a
      sufficient period to detect the changes in endothelial function, whole body carotenoids, and
      anti-oxidant status, which are the outcomes of interest in this research project.

    <description>A subjective visual analogue scale consisting of a 100 mm line for each term (1) hunger; (2) fullness; (3) desire to eat; (4) prospective food consumption. Subjects respond by placing a mark on the line that is anchored with an extreme answer at either end (e.g. &quot;not felt at all&quot; and &quot;felt the greatest&quot;)
A composite appetite score is computed by: (hunger + desire to eat + (100 - fullness) + prospective food consumption) divided by 4. With a maximum score of 400 for the greatest possible appetite (represented by hunger = 100; desire to eat = 100; fullness = 0 and prospective food consumption = 100) and a minimum score of 0 (represented by hunger = 0; desire to eat = 0; fullness = 100 and prospective food consumption = 0)</description>
