    <textblock>
      Retrospective study to collect data from Patients with advanced/metastatic renal cell
      carcinoma previously treated with Axitinib under standard clinical practice, to describe the
      clinical profile of the patients with a long response to Axitinib and to try to identify
      clinical factors which could be related with the long response to Axitinib, through the
      comparison between long responder patients and a group of refractory patients

    <textblock>
      To describe the clinical profile of patients with a long response to Axitinib and to identify
      clinical factors which could be related with the long response to Axitinib, through the
      comparison between long responder patients and a group of refractory patients.

      For this study are defined as &quot;long responder&quot;, those patients who has a Progression Free
      Survival (PFS) of at least 9 months since the initiation of Axitinib treatment, and
      &quot;refractory patients&quot; those who have Progression Disease (PD) in the first response
      assessment since the initiation of Axitinib treatment (estimated PFS ≤3 months]

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To describe the efficacy of Axitinib treatment in the long responders group, and in
           relation with the treatment received before Axitinib, in terms of PFS, ORR, CB, OS, TTP
           ...

        -  To describe the tolerability and drug management of Axitinib in this population.

        -  To describe treatment received after Axitinib in this population.

      Study procedures:

      For the recruitment, the Investigator should review the inclusion / exclusion criteria. In
      case of patients alive at the moment of the inclusion, the investigator will require them to
      sign the IC.

      With the data available in the medical records, the information requested will be recorded in
      the electronic data collection tool.

    <description>Best response is CR and PR, SD or PD. As per RECIST1.1 criteria: CR = disappearance of all target lesions; PR = &gt;= 30% decrease in sum of target lesions taking as reference baseline sum diameters; PD: &gt;= 20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as a reference smallest sum on treatment, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm, or the appearance of &gt;=1 new lesions; SD =neither shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference smallest sum of diameters while on treatment.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status on Axitinib Discontinuation: Long Responders Versus Refractory Participants</title>
        <description>ECOG: participant's performance status was measured on a 6-point scale: 0= fully active/able to carry on all pre-disease activities without restriction; 1= restricted in physically strenuous activity but ambulatory and able to carry out work of a light and sedentary nature; 2= ambulatory and capable of all self-care, but unable to carry out any work activities, up and about more than 50 percent (%) of waking hours; 3= capable of only limited self-care, confined to bed/chair &gt;50% of waking hours; 4= completely disabled, cannot carry on any self-care, totally confined to bed/chair: 5= dead. In this outcome measure, data for ECOG status (0, 1, &gt;=2: on axitinib discontinuation), was compared between long responders and refractory participants.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) Risk Group at Initiation of Axitinib Treatment: Long Responders Versus Refractory Participants</title>
        <description>MSKCC risk system stratifies participants with mRCC into poor, intermediate and favorable risk groups based on number of adverse clinical and laboratory parameters present. Favorable-risk group: participants had no poor prognostic factors. Intermediate-risk group: participants had 1 or 2 adverse prognostic factors. Poor-risk group: participants had more than 2 poor prognostic factors. Poor prognostic factors included a KPS of &lt;80 (KPS score quantify participant's general well-being and activities of daily life, based on their functional impairment. KPS score ranges between 0= death to 100= no evidence of disease; higher score means higher ability to perform daily tasks), time from diagnosis to treatment for more than 12 months, serum LDH &gt;1.5*ULN, corrected serum calcium level &gt;10.0 mg/dL and hemoglobin &lt; LLN.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With International Metastatic Database Consortium (IMDC) Risk Group on Discontinuation of Axitinib Treatment: Long Responders Versus Refractory Participants</title>
          <description>IMDC risk group stratifies participants with mRCC into poor, intermediate and favorable risk groups based on number of adverse clinical and laboratory parameters present. Favorable-risk group: participants had no poor prognostic factors. Intermediate-risk group: participants had 1 or 2 poor prognostic factors. Poor-risk group: participants had 3 to 6 poor prognostic factors. Poor prognostic factors included KPS score of &lt;80 at the initiation of treatment, time from diagnosis to metastasis treatment of &lt;12 months, anemia, hypercalcemia (corrected calcium &gt;10 mg/dL), neutrophilia and thrombocythemia. In this outcome measure, IMDC risk group (favorable, intermediate, poor: on discontinuation of axitinib) was compared between long responders and refractory participants.</description>
          <population>FAS included all evaluable participants, i.e. all participants who met all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria and have received at least 1 dose of axitinib prior to inclusion in the study.

PR = greater than equal to (&gt;=) 30% decrease in sum of target lesions taking as reference baseline sum diameters. PD: &gt;= 20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as a reference smallest sum on treatment, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 millimeter (mm), or the appearance of &gt;=1 new lesions. SD =neither shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum of diameters during treatment.</description>
          <population>FAS included all evaluable participants, i.e. all participants who met all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria and have received at least 1 dose of axitinib prior to inclusion in the study.

During this study, data for these participants was collected and observed retrospectively, for approximately 1 year.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With First Best Response to Subsequent Treatments Post Axitinib Treatment</title>
          <description>Best response is CR and PR, SD or PD. As per RECIST1.1 criteria: CR = disappearance of all target lesions; PR = &gt;= 30% decrease in sum of target lesions taking as reference baseline sum diameters; PD: &gt;= 20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as a reference smallest sum on treatment, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm, or the appearance of &gt;=1 new lesions; SD =neither shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference smallest sum of diameters while on treatment.</description>
          <population>FAS population was analyzed. Here, “Overall Number of Participants” signifies participants evaluable for this outcome measure. As per protocol, no comparison was planned between long responders and refractory participants.</population>
