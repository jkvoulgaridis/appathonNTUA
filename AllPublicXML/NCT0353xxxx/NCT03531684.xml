  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of MMFS for improving cognition
      and global function in patients with probable Early Alzheimer's disease.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2 study in patients with probable Early Alzheimer's disease (AD). Early AD
      includes Stage 3 AD patients (MCI due to AD) and Stage 4 AD patients (mild AD). The study is
      a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel group design, in which participants
      (up to 6 per arm; 12 total) will receive oral placebo or MMFS twice daily for 24 weeks.
      Randomized patients and their informants (required) will complete 3 assessments total: at
      baseline (prior to taking any study tablets), week 12, and week 24 visits. At each of the
      three visits, participants will complete cognitive and behavioral measures and clinical
      interviews, a blood sample will be collected for safety and biomarkers related to Alzheimer's
      disease, and the informant will complete an interview concerning the patient's cognition,
      mood, and function. A range of safety and tolerability assessments will also be performed
      (including vital signs, laboratory tests, and ECGs). Participants will be contacted by phone
      between clinical assessments for monitoring.

                  Screening may be allowed if in the opinion of the investigator, will not affect
                  or influence study results.

               2. If a change in medication dosage occurs during the study, this will lead to
                  discontinuation from study participation unless it relates to a medication that,
                  in the view of the study investigator, does not affect participation in the
                  trial.

               3. Allowed Sleep, Neuropsychiatric and Cognitive drugs must be stable for 90 days

                  not affect or influence study results.
