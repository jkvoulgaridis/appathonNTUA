    <textblock>
      Cystinuria is a disease of autosomal recessive inheritance. This disease belongs to the
      so-called orphan diseases although its prevalence may change depending on the country.

      It is known that urinary pH is a risk factor for the formation of cystine crystals because
      their solubility is pH-dependent. In different studies it has been shown that the solubility
      of cystine in urine increases when alkalinizing urinary pH, thus reducing the likelihood of
      crystal formation. Therefore, the control of urinary pH along with hygienic-dietetic measures
      that alkalize the urine or decrease the urinary concentration of cystine (abundant intake of
      water, food, etc.) are highly recommended as a preventive method to prevent the formation of
      cystine crystals whose retention and growth results in the formation of stones.

      The Lit-control®pH Meter is a pH meter that allows a patient to self-monitor its urinary pH
      in a comfortable and simple way. With this tool the patient is able to know if his urinary pH
      is within the recommended limits. In other medical fields it has been observed that home
      monitoring of clinically relevant physiological parameters is a way of empowering the patient
      that can positively affect their attitudes and behaviors (adherence to received treatment,
      quality of life) and potentially improve their medical condition. Specifically, in patients
      with chronic diseases, the self-monitoring has been associated with a significant reduction
      in hospitalizations and hospital readmissions.
