             (including investigational) within 4 weeks before first dose of study treatment.

          -  Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent or other

             weeks before first dose of study treatment. Systemic treatment with radionuclides
             within 6 weeks before the first dose of study treatment. Subjects with clinically

          -  Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous
             meningitis. Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided
             they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least 4 weeks prior
             to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have returned to
             baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using
             steroids for at least 7 days prior to trial treatment. This exception does not include
             carcinomatous meningitis which is excluded regardless of clinical stability.

          -  Concomitant anticoagulation with oral anticoagulants (eg, warfarin, direct thrombin
             and Factor Xa inhibitors) or platelet inhibitors (eg, clopidogrel).

        Allowed anticoagulants are the following:

             from the anticoagulation regimen or the tumor.

               -  The subject has prothrombin time (PT)/INR or partial thromboplastin time (PTT)
                  test ≥ 1.3 × ULN within 14 days before the first dose of study treatment.

               -  The subject has uncontrolled, significant intercurrent or recent illness
                  including, but not limited to, the following conditions:

          -  Cardiovascular disorders:

               -  Ongoing congestive heart failure exacerbation or New York Heart Association Class
                  4, unstable angina pectoris, serious cardiac arrhythmias.

                  systolic or &gt; 100 mm Hg diastolic despite optimal antihypertensive treatment.
                  Uncontrolled hypertension needs to be determined based on persistently high blood
                  pressure readings over more than 24 hours and should NOT be based on the blood
                  pressure readings from one clinic visit. Blood pressure readings done at home or
                  by primary care providers are acceptable. If a blood pressure reading on the day
                  of screening is high, but there are documented acceptable ( ≤150 mm Hg systolic
                  and ≤100 mm Hg diastolic) blood pressure readings prior to or after the screening
                  visit (with or without the use of anti-hypertensive medications), patient will
                  not be considered to have uncontrolled hypertension.

               -  Stroke (including transient ischemic attack [TIA]), myocardial infarction (MI),
                  or other ischemic event, or thromboembolic event (eg, deep venous thrombosis,

               -  Class 3 congestive heart failure

          -  Gastrointestinal (GI) disorders including those associated with a high risk of
             perforation or fistula formation:

                  disease, inflammatory bowel disease (eg, Crohn's disease), diverticulitis,
                  cholecystitis, symptomatic cholangitis or appendicitis, acute pancreatitis, acute
                  obstruction of the pancreatic duct or common bile duct, or gastric outlet
                  obstruction.

               -  Abdominal fistula, GI perforation, bowel obstruction, or intra-abdominal abscess
                  within 6 months before first dose.

             ml) of red blood, or other history of significant bleeding (eg, pulmonary hemorrhage)

               -  Uncompensated/symptomatic hypothyroidism.

               -  Moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B or C).

                    -  Other severe acute or chronic medical conditions including immune colitis,
                       inflammatory bowel disease, immune pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis or
                       psychiatric conditions including recent (within the past year) or active
                       suicidal ideation or behavior; or laboratory abnormalities that may increase
                       the risk associated with study participation or study treatment
                       administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results
                       and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient
                       inappropriate for entry into this study.

                    -  Major surgery (eg, GI surgery, removal or biopsy of brain metastasis) within
                       8 weeks before first dose of study treatment. Complete wound healing from
                       major surgery must have occurred 1 month before first dose and from minor
                       surgery (eg, simple excision, tooth extraction) at least 10 days before
                       first dose. Subjects with clinically relevant ongoing complications from
                       prior surgery are not eligible.

                    -  Corrected QT interval calculated by the Fridericia formula (QTcF) &gt; 500 ms

                       treatment.

        Note: If a single ECG shows a QTcF with an absolute value &gt; 500 ms, two additional ECGs at
        intervals of approximately 3 min must be performed after the initial ECG, and the average
        of these three consecutive results for QTcF will be used to determine eligibility.

          -  Diagnosis of another malignancy within 2 years before first dose of study treatment,
             with the exception of those determined by the treating investigator to have a

             of the cervix, basal or squamous cell skin cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ treated
             surgically with curative intent, localized prostate cancer treated with curative
             intent and/or no intent for further treatment, or incidental prostate cancer)

             or equivalent; c. Steroids as premedication for hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., CT
             scan premedication).

          -  Has active autoimmune disease currently requiring systemic treatment with high dose
             corticosteroids (dose more than physiologic replacement doses equivalent to prednisone
             10 mg daily) or (disease modifying immunosuppressive agents). Replacement therapy
             (e.g. thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for
             adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, intranasal, inhaled, topical steroids, or local
             steroid injection) is not considered an exclusion.

          -  Active autoimmune disease that might deteriorate significantly when receiving an
             immuno-stimulatory agent per treating physician's clinical judgment. Subjects with
             diabetes type I, vitiligo, psoriasis, or hypo- or hyperthyroid diseases not requiring

             its formulations, including known severe hypersensitivity reactions to monoclonal
             antibodies (NCI CTCAE v4.03 Grade ≥ 3).

          -  Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit
             through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.

          -  Subjects taking prohibited medications as described in Section 6.8. A washout period
             of prohibited medications for a period of at least two weeks or as clinically
