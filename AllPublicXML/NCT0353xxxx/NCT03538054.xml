      The objective of this protocol is to evaluate if Dextromethorphan (DXM) reduces Fibromyalgia
      (FM) pain. DXM is a drug found in several over-the-counter products, including cough
      suppressants. The drug may reduce FM pain by suppressing inflammation in the central nervous
      system. The investigators will be observing the effects of DXM on daily self-reported pain
      measures in people with FM. If DXM reduces FM pain, it will provide important information
      about the nature of FM pathophysiology.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic, widespread pain syndrome. Individuals with FM frequently
      report body pain, fatigue, sleep issues, cognitive impairment, headaches, and other symptoms.
      The disease affects approximately 5% of women in the United States. Many of those patients
      suffer with decreased quality of life and loss of employment.

      The precise pathological mechanism of FM is not yet understood, and there is no targeted
      treatment for the condition. One hypothesis of FM with prior scientific support is that pain
      is caused by abnormal inflammation of the brain. When microglia cells in the brain adopt an
      inflammatory state, they release chemicals that can cause neurons to increase the
      transmission of pain signals.

      DXM has been used in previous research and demonstrated to suppress pain symptoms. When given
      at higher dosages (above 200mg), the medication acts as a dissociative agent. This dosage can
      reduce pain, but produces side-effects that can limit daily functioning. At lower dosages,
      however, DXM may reduce inflammatory aspects of chronic pain while not causing dissociative
      side effects.

      In animal models, central inflammation can be reduced with intraperitoneal dosages of DXM of
      0.1mg/kg. In an average U.S. woman, this dosage would translate to approximately 8mg. Because
      an oral versus intraperitoneal dosing route will be used, the dose will be raised to 10mg,
      administered twice a day (once in the morning and once at night). The investigator will
      examine the impact of 20mg total daily DXM on self-reported FM pain.
