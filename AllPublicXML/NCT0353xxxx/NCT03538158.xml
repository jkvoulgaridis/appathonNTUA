  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to examine the usability and efficacy, for diverse older
      adults, of a new tablet-based dynamic system: the Fittle Senior System (FSS) that will
      provide: (1) personalized behavior-change programs for improved diet and increased physical
      activity and (2) online social interaction and support from small teams pursuing similar
      goals.

      The proposed study involves a two group randomized trial where participants will be
      randomized to the Fittle Senior System or to a paper-based psycho-educational control
      condition following a baseline assessment. The duration of the intervention phase will
      involve an active 12-week intervention phase followed by a 12-week maintenance phase. We will
      recruit and randomize 180 community dwelling adults aged 65+ years, who live alone and are at
      risk for social isolation. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 3 months post active
      intervention and 3 months post maintenance (6 months following active intervention) on
      measures of health and health behaviors, and indices of social support.

  <detailed_description>

      The proposed study will evaluate a new tablet-based dynamic system: the Fittle Senior System
      (FSS) that will provide: (1) personalized, goal-directed behavior-change programs for
      improved diet and increased physical activity and (2) online social interaction and support
      from small teams pursuing similar goals. The system builds on two technology-based systems
      developed by the investigative team: (1) the computer-based PRISM system (Czaja et al.,
      2015), designed for older populations to support social connectivity and well-being, and (2)
      the Fittle mobile platform (PARC) designed to support positive health behavior change through
      integrated online social support and personalized coaching based on artificial intelligence
      (AI). The Fittle program is based on Self-efficacy and Social Cognitive Theory (Bandura,
      1998, 2001), Goal Setting (Locke &amp; Latham, 2002) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (Ajzen,
      1991). Fittle provides support for individuals and teams to progress through lifestyle
      challenges (e.g., poor eating habits, sedentary behavior), helping individuals master one
      health improving habit after another in a way that builds on previous achievements.
      Individuals choose from a variety of challenges to accomplish goals via an intelligent
      coaching agent and personalized, engaging user experiences. The objective is to maintain and
      reinforce perceived self-efficacy with daily goals that are perceived as being achievable,
      and to improve motivation and ability with goals that are perceived as not too easy. The
      program provides encouragement and social support through a team component. Thus, Fittle is
      designed to reinforce and build self-efficacy and positive attitudes.
