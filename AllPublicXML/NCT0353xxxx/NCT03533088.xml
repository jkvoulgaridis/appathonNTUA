  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rotator cuff (RC) repair is one of the most common treatment approch to relief the pain and
      improve the shoulder function on patients with rotator cuff rupture. Despite the improved
      surgical techniques and decreased failure rate, there are still complications after the
      surgey like shoulder persistant shoulder pain, stiffness even re-tear. Therefore,
      rehabilitation after the RC repair procedure is crucial for the success of the treatment.
      However, there is no concencus between the post-operative rehabilitation protochol. The aim
      of this study is to compare two different rehabilitation protochols on patients with RC
      repair.

      range of motion, self-reported shoulder function and pain on patients with RC repair.
