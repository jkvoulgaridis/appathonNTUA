      This study will be a prospective, open-label trial designed to objectively assess the safety
      and bioactivity of AAV2/8-LSPhGAA in subjects diagnosed with Pompe disease, which is caused
      by a defect in acid Î±-glucosidase (GAA) gene. AAV2/8-LSPhGAA is intended to enable expression
      of a functional copy of the GAA gene in subject's hepatocytes.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of Pompe disease by blood or skin fibroblast GAA assay and two pathogenic
             variants in the GAA gene,

          -  Age: Greater than or equal to 18 years at enrollment.

          -  Subjects are capable of giving written informed consent.

          -  Able to walk at least 100 meters on the 6MWT (with assistive devices permitted).

          -  FVC within the range of 30% to less 90% (inclusive) of predicted in the upright
             position.

          -  Receiving ERT for at least 104 weeks (inclusive) immediately preceding screening and
             receiving a stable dose of ERT for the 52-week period immediately preceding dosing.

        Females of childbearing potential must use at least one of the following acceptable birth
        control methods throughout the study and for 6 months after dosing with ACTUS-101.

          1. Surgically sterile (bilateral tubal ligation, hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy) 6
             months minimum prior to receiving ACTUS-101.

          2. Intrauterine device in place for at least 90 days prior to receiving ACTUS-101.

          3. Barrier methods (diaphragm plus spermicide or condom) starting at least 30 days prior
             to receiving ACTUS-101.

          4. Abstinence (the subject must be willing to remain abstinent from screening to 6 months
             after receiving ACTUS-101). Females are allowed to claim abstinence as their method of
             contraception only when it is the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject.

          6. Hormonal contraceptives starting &gt; 90 days prior to receiving ACTUS-101. If hormonal
             contraceptives are started less than 90 days prior to receiving ACTUS-101, subjects
             must agree to use a barrier method (diaphragm plus spermicide or condom) from
             screening through 90 days after initiation of hormonal contraceptives

          3. Documented evidence of vasectomy in males for 180 days minimum prior to receiving
             ACTUS-101 is an acceptable form of contraception.

          4. Males who claim abstinence as their method of contraception are allowed provided they
             agree to use barrier methods should they become sexually active from screening through
             6 months after receiving ACTUS-101. Males are allowed to claim abstinence as their
             method of contraception only when it is the preferred and usual lifestyle of the
             subject

             A, B or C infection. Any active liver disease.

          -  GGT &gt; 1.2x ULN adjusted for age and gender.

             period preceding study day 1, or having started respiratory strength training greater
             than 6 months prior to study day 1 and unwilling to continue for the first year of
             study participation.

          -  Received an investigational drug or participated in another interventional study
             within 90 days of Study Day 1.
