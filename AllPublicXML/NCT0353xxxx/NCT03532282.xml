  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to compare the effectiveness and implementation potential of two primary
      care friendly approaches to delivering an effective non-pharmacological intervention -
      cognitive behavioral therapy - for insomnia to middle aged and older adults.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All participants will receive cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, either through an
      online program or through visit with a therapist specializing in behavioral sleep medicine,
      and is some cases both. Participants will be randomized with equal probability to an ONLINE
      ONLY treatment arm or to a STEPPED CARE arm, whereby they will be assigned to on line or
      therapist-led treatment, based on their clinical presentation; but those assigned to this arm
      who start treatment with an online program and do not have sufficient response after 2 months
      will be switched over to a therapist-led treatment.
