  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The administration of intravenous fluids is ubiquitous in the care of the critically ill.
      Commonly available isotonic crystalloid solutions contain a broad spectrum electrolyte
      compositions including a range chloride concentrations. Recent prospective, randomized trials
      have shown improved patient outcomes with the use of balanced crystalloids compared to
      saline. There have not been large randomized studies comparing acetate buffered balanced
      crystalloids to non-acetate buffered balanced crystalloids in the critically ill. BASE will
      be a pilot study for a large, cluster-randomized, multiple-crossover trial enrolling
      critically ill patients from the Medical ICU at Vanderbilt University from June 2018 until
      January 2019. The primary endpoint will be plasma bicarbonate concentration between Intensive
      Care Unit admission and hospital discharge.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BASE is a pilot, cluster-randomized, multiple-crossover trial of lactated Ringer's versus
      Normosol-R pH 7.4 with regard to plasma bicarbonate concentration between intensive care unit
      admission and hospital discharge among all patients admitted to the medical intensive care
      unit. Between June 2018 and January 2019, all patients admitted to the medical intensive care
      unit at Vanderbilt University Medical Center who are 18 years or older will be enrolled. The
      study will occur in one-month blocks. The medical intensive care unit (MICU) will be
      randomized to an initial fluid group (lactated Ringer's or Normosol). The assigned fluid will
      be used exclusively for all patients receiving isotonic crystalloid for the duration of the
      month-long block (except in the presence of pre-specified contraindications). The assigned
      study fluid will switch at the end of each month-long block such that half of hte months are
      assigned to lactated Ringer's and half of the months are assigned to Normosol-R pH 7.4. It is
      anticipated that around 2,000 patients will be enrolled from the medical ICU during the study
      period. The primary outcome analysis will be an intention-to-treat comparison of the primary
      outcome of bicarbonate concentration (mmol/L) between enrollment and 7 days after enrollment
      between the lactated Ringer's and Normosol-R groups using generalized estimating equations
      with a random effect for study period and accounting for repeated measures.
