  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cigarette smoking is a patient-related factor that can affect healing of periodontal tissues
      and the success rate of root-coverage procedures. Neither the nature nor the mechanisms of
      action of cigarette smoking on root coverage are fully understood. Therefore, the hypothesis
      that cigarette smoking has negative impacts on the outcomes of root coverage after CAF
      surgery in systemically healthy individuals with an initial gingival thickness of at least
      0.8 mm and who practice optimal oral hygiene was tested. It was also hypothesized that
      baseline analysis of disease-related biomarkers would shed light on the underlying mechanisms
      of a possible effect.

    <description>Gingival thickness was measured with an ultrasonic device that uses the pulse echo principle. Ultrasonic pulses are transmitted at intervals of 1 millisecond through the sound-permeable mucosa and reflected, in part, at the surface of the alveolar bone or tooth attributable to different acoustic impedance. When an acoustic signal is transmitted within 2 to 3 seconds, gingival thickness is digitally displayed with a sensitivity of 0.01 mm.</description>

    <description>The visual analog scale (VAS) was used to evaluate pain during the postoperative follow-up period. It consists of a straight line with the endpoints defining extreme limits such as 'no pain at all' and 'pain as bad as it could be'. The patient selects a whole number (0-10 integers) that best reflects the intensity of their pain, with 0 being the no pain and 10 being the worst pain.</description>

    <description>The coronally advanced flap (CAF) is a procedure frequently used in periodontal plastic surgery. The main objective of this surgical technique is to mobilize the gingival margin and reposition it at a level more coronal (incisal direction) than its original location. CAF is mainly used for the treatment of gingival recessions.</description>
