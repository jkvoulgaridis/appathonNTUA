    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single arm, multicenter, dose finding, Phase Ib study in order to
      assess the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) for this
      combination treatment and to evaluate the general safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK),
      pharmacodynamic, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of this combination treatment in adult
      patients.
