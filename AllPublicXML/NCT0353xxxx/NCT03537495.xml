  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tuberculosis meningitis (TBM) is the most severe manifestation of TB, resulting in death or
      neurological disability in up to 50% of affected patients, despite antibacterial treatment.
      This TBM treatment follows the model for pulmonary TB by using the same first-line TB drugs
      (a combination of rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethambutol) and the same dosing
      guidelines, although it is known that penetration of two of these drugs (rifampicin and
      ethambutol) into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is limited. Improvement of treatment of TBM is
      urgently needed.

      To do so, a combination of two interventions will be investigated in this study. A series of
      phase II clinical trials on higher doses of the pivotal TB drug rifampicin in Indonesian
      patients with TBM have shown that the dose of rifampicin can be increased from 10 mg/kg
      orally (standard dose) up to 30 mg/kg orally, resulting in a strong increase in exposure to
      this drug in plasma and CSF, no increase in grade III or IV adverse effects, and a reduction
      in mortality. Similarly, higher doses of rifampicin up to 35 mg/kg resulted in strong
      increases in plasma concentrations; the doses were well tolerated and reduced time to sputum
      conversion in African pulmonary TB patients.

      Next to a higher dose of rifampicin, the approved antibacterial drug linezolid seems a good
      candidate for a new TBM regimen. The drug penetrates well into the CSF and is applied
      successfully against other central nervous system (CNS) infections (e.g. caused by
      penicillin-nonsusceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococci and
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus). In a study in China, linezolid in a dose of 600
      mg BID orally strongly increased recovery of patients with TBM response. Linezolid is also
      being investigated as a new drug for (drug-resistant) pulmonary TB in numerous studies, in a
      dose of 1200 mg once daily. More severe adverse effects to this drug typically occur only
      after prolonged treatment during several months, not during short-term treatment.

      Overall, linezolid is expected to be a promising and tolerable candidate for a new
      intensified TBM treatment regimen consisting of a backbone of high dose rifampicin plus
      linezolid.

      Overall aim is to determine the most appropriate dose of linezolid in the treatment of TB
      meningitis, when combined with high-dose rifampicin (35 mg/kg orally), to be tested in larger
      clinical follow-up studies.

    <description>Linezolid exposure in blood (full plasma concentration-versus-time profiles (0-24h)) will be measured in 2 days, i.e. day 2 (+/- 1) and at day 11 (+/- 1) of TB treatment. In each sampling day, there will be 6 sampling points i.e. at 0 (pre-dose), 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 h after study medication intake
One CSF sample per patient will be taken at the same day as PK sampling i.e. at 2, 4 or 8 hours post dose.</description>

    <description>Overall, there is an urgent need for improvement of TBM treatment. LInezolid is known to be well-penetrated to blood brain barrier. A combination of high-dose rifampicin and linezolid as an intensified add-on therapy in the management of TB meningitis has never been studied.
The goal is to assess the most appropriate dose of linezolid for larger follow-up studies and to evaluate the feasibility of a linezolid-containing TBM regimen.</description>
