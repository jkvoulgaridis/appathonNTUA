  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand the effects of using a Artificial Intelligence
      algorithm for skeletal age estimation as a computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) system. In this
      prospective real-time study, the investigators will send de-identified hand radiographs to
      the Artificial Intelligence algorithm and surface the output of this algorithm to the
      radiologist, who will incorporate this information with their normal workflows to make a
      diagnosis of the patient's bone age. All radiologists involved in the study will be trained
      to recognize the surfaced prediction to be the output of the Artificial Intelligence
      algorithm. The radiologists' diagnosis will be final and considered independent to the output
      of the algorithm.

      The investigators are targeting to study the effect of their Artificial Intelligence
      algorithm on the radiologists' estimation of skeletal age. Currently, radiologists make the
      estimation using only the patients' radiographic images and health records. As part of this
      study, the radiologists will make diagnoses about their patients using the patients'
      radiographic images, health records, and the output of the CADx algorithm. The investigators
      wish to understand how radiologists using the Artificial Intelligence algorithm compare to
      radiologists who do not for the specific task of estimating skeletal age.

      This study is organized as a multi-institutional randomized control trial with two arms -
      experiment (receiving the Artificial Intelligence algorithm's output) and control (no
      intervention). Both of these arms will be compared to a clinical reference standard (&quot;gold
      standard&quot;) composed of a panel of radiologists. The metric of comparison will be Mean
      Absolute Distance (MAD). The investigators plan to use statistical tests such as the t-test
      to determine any statistically-significant difference in skeletal age estimation between the
      two groups.

      The investigators hope to recruit and analyze data from a sample size of 1500 patients.The
      patients will not undergo any research procedures that deviate from the current standard
      practices.

    <intervention_model_description>A hand radiograph will be randomly assigned to one of two groups - control and experiment. In the control group, participating radiologists will diagnose the case using the current standard of care (no intervention). In the experiment group, the radiologists will factor in the output of the Artificial Intelligence algorithm in their diagnosis. In all cases, the decision of the radiologist will be considered final.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The skeletal age estimates from radiologists in the experiment arm will compared to that from the radiologists in the control group. The metric used for comparison will be Mean Absolute Difference (MAD) which will be computed against a clinical reference standard composed of expert radiologists. Intuitively, this outcome compares the &quot;accuracy&quot; of the radiologists when they are using the BoneAgeModel to when they are not.</description>

    <description>BoneAgeModel is an Artificial Intelligence tool that takes in a pediatric patient's hand radiograph and gender, and outputs their skeletal (bone) age. The intervention involves using this tool as a factor in the clinical decision making process of the participating radiologists. The radiologist's decision will be considered final.</description>
