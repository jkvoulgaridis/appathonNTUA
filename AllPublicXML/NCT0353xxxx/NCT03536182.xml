      patients with locally advanced, unresectable pancreatic cancer

      To compare the efficacy of carbon ion-based chemo radiotherapy with x-ray-based chemo
      radiotherapy for the treatment of locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma by comparison of
      overall survival at 2 years following treatment.

      Patient has 2 in 3 chance of receiving Arm A and 1 in 3 chance of receiving Arm B.

      Arm A (chemoradiation takes place in Japan):

      CIRT in 12 fractions/treatments plus concurrent gemcitabine, followed by 4 cycles of
      gemcitabine + nab-Paclitaxel, or until progression or intolerance of therapy

      Arm B:

      IMRT in 28 fractions plus concurrent gemcitabine or capecitabine, followed by 4 cycles of
      gemcitabine + nab-Paclitaxel, or until progression or intolerance of therapy

      Per investigator discretion, patients may receive either:

        1. Definitive treatment :

        2. Neoadjuvant treatment:

      Adjuvant chemotherapy 4 cycles of gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel or FOLFIRNOX, Gemcitabine alone
      if these regimens are unavailable

    <description>The dose calculation algorithms used in Japan and Europe (local effect model, LEM) are different, so the total dose must be modified to ensure consistency
Japan : 55.2 GyE in 4.6 GyE per fraction in 12 fractions delivered 4 days a week. At least 90% of each CTV receives at least 95% of the prescribed dose, and 100% of the GTV V95 must receive at least 95% of the prescribed dose.
European: . Patients treated in Europe should receive 57.6 GyE in 4.8 GyE per fraction in 12 fractions delivered 4 days a week. At least 90% of CTV receives at least 95% of the prescribed dose, and 100% of the GTV V95 must receive at least 95% of the prescribed dose. This evaluation will occur in the LEM system</description>
