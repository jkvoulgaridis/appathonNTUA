  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial aims to develop an electronic learning (eLearning) program and mobile tool for
      Spanish and Portuguese speaking cancer care providers to use in tobacco counseling of their
      patients. This study may provide information for the design and implementation of tobacco
      cessation training programs directed to this group of professionals in low- and middle-income
      countries for the Latin American region.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To develop and test the feasibility of an eLearning program on brief tobacco counseling
      specifically designed for Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking cancer care providers.

      II. To linguistically/culturally tailor and test a mobile tool designed to assist in
      providing effective tobacco counseling and treatment.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants complete an online course focusing on different aspects of tobacco prevention
      and cessation over 1 hour each per week for 4 weeks. They also engage in 6 virtual meetings
      over 1 hour about tobacco use once per month.

      After completion of study, participants are followed up at 3 and 6 months.

    <description>Will be used as key parameters for assessing the feasibility of the eLearning program. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test will be used to compare scores obtained in the pre- and post-tests of the eLearning program. Effect sizes will be computed as the absolute value of the difference between the post-test (T2, T3, and T4) and pre-test (T1) scores divided by the mean of the standard deviations for each.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Computing the System Usability Scale (SUS) scores in the final assessment will allow our research team to analyze cancer care provider's (CCPs) experience of using the tool. A descriptive analysis to compute the SUS score will be performed and later converted to percentile ranks. A percentile rank of 75% will indicate that the tool has high perceived usability. All statistical analyses will be performed using SPSS Statistics version 23 (International Business Machines Corporation).</description>

    <measure>Gains in participants' competencies in providing smoking cessation assistance to cancer patients</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Will be assessed by comparing pre- and post-test responses to the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer survey. Item distributions, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and skewness will be explored. Skewness values between âˆ’1 and 1 will be considered acceptable. To examine reliability and internal consistency of each of the items assessing cancer care providers CCPs' competency for providing brief tobacco counseling, Cronbach's alphas will be calculated.</description>
