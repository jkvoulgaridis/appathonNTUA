      The investigators propose an 4-week cross-over design breakfast study in children enrolled in
      6-8th grade within the Center School District in the Kansas City, Missouri. This school will
      begin their 'Breakfast in the Classroom' program on March 26, 2018. Prior to the start of
      'Breakfast in the Classroom', baseline data will be collected on the students who wish to
      participate in the study. Baseline data includes anthropometric assessments; demographics;
      current eating habits; cognitive performance; appetite; and mood. Following baseline, the
      students will be provided a breakfast that meets all the requirements for a reimbursable
      school breakfast with the addition of two eggs for 3-weeks: At 4 weeks (3 weeks after
      initiation of the program), the study participants will complete a similar outcomes to those
      completed at baseline.
