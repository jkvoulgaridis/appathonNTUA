  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized phase III trial is to evaluate the clinical benefit of
      combining entinostat with exemestane in Chinese patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative,
      locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, who have disease progression on endocrine
      therapy. Additionally，the safety, tolerability, and PK profile of the treatment combination
      are evaluated.

    <textblock>
      This randomized phase III trial studies entinostat combination with exemestane to see how
      well they work compared to exemestane alone in treating Chinese patients with hormone
      receptor-positive, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancers.

      Estrogen can drive the growth of breast cancer cells. Exemestane may fight breast cancer by
      lowering the amount of estrogen the body makes from tissue aromatase. Entinostat may enhance
      the anti-tumor effect of exemestane in breast cancer by helping to overcome tumor resistance
      via epigenetic modifications. Previous Phase II trial in US breast cancer patients have
      demonstrated significant effects of combined therapy in slowing disease progression and on
      patient survival when compared to exemestane alone. It is not yet known whether exemestane is
      more effective when combined with entinostat in Chinese patients with advanced breast cancer.
      In this parallel, randomized, double blind, active controlled study, we will study the effect
      of entinostat/placebo in combination with exemestane in Chinese patients with hormone
      receptor-positive, HER2 receptor-negative, locally advance or metastatic breast cancer, who
      have experienced disease progression with prior endocrine therapies.

          6. The patient must have measurable or non-measurable but can only be bone metastasis
             Stage III /locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (in accordance with the
             general evaluation criteria, RECIST Version 1.1). Bone metastasis includes osteolytic
             or mixed type (osteolytic and osteogenic).

             For Part 2 the Randomized, double-blind study: the ratio of patients with
             non-measurable lesion (only bone metastasis) should be ≤ 20%; not required for Part
             1-the Open-label study.

             Notes:

                  tomography, the lower limit of abdominal scan must reach anterior superior iliac
                  spine). MRI is optional in patients who are allergic to the contrast substance.
                  It needs to ensure that the lesions should be scanned and evaluated in accordance
                  with the requirement in the general evaluation criteria RECIST version 1.1.

                  effusion, pelvic effusion, inflammatory breast cancer, carcinomatous lymphangitis
                  of skin or lung, abdominal mass that can't be diagnosed or followed up by
                  radiology, and cystic lesion).

          7. At least one previous treatment of endocrine therapy other than Exemestane.

          8. As previous adjuvant therapy,Exemestane is allowed to be used, if the disease-free
             interval is &gt;12 months after discontinuation of Exemestane.

          9. For the patients with metastatic breast cancer who have already received at most one
             chemotherapeutic regimen，the end of chemotherapy should be at least 4 weeks before the
             randomization.

         10. The end of previous radiotherapy should be at least 2 weeks before the randomization,
             and the patient must have recovered from the toxicity of radiotherapy (grade 1 or
             below).

         11. The patient is allowed to receive the medications to regulatebone metabolism, for
             example, bisphosphonates and RANK-L (nuclear factor κB ligand receptor activator,
             e.g., denosumab); the bone metabolism-regulating therapy needs to be initiated 1 week
             prior to the first administration of treatment in the clinical trial, the same drug
             must be used throughout the clinical trial, except that actual clinical situation that
             requires amendment to the therapeutic regimen;

         12. Patients must have adequate hematological, hepatic and renal function one week (7
             days) prior to the Run-in period in open-label study and prior to randomization in
             randomized, double-blind study, which are defined as below:

               1. Haemoglobin (Hgb) ≥ 90 g/L;

         13. Open-label study only enroll the patients with natural menopause or surgical
             ovariectomy. Postmenopausal, premenopausal/perimenopausal and menopausal female
             patients can be enrolled in the randomized, double-blind study; patients with
             childbearing potential must agree to use recognized effective methods for
             contraception (including condom containing sperm inactivation, vaginal septum, oral or
             injectable contraceptives, etc.) or abstain from sex life during participation in the
             study and within three months after discontinuation of the treatment.

        Postmenopause is defined as:

          1. Underwent irreversible surgical sterilization such as amputation of uterus, bilateral
             oophorectomy, but not tubal ligation;

          1. It will be considered as the premenopausal or perimenopausal state if the above
             criteria on menopause are not met;

          2. The premenopausal/perimenopausal female patients can be enrolled only when they agree

             agonist at least 4 weeks prior to randomization;

          3. If the patient has received other LHRH agonist prior to entry in the study, he/she
             must switch to Goserelin during the study.
