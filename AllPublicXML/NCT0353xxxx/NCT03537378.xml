      1.1 Aims：This cohort study aims to investigate the clinical value of Hybrid APC for treatment
      of early central lung neoplasms.

      1.2 methods：A total of 30 patients with early central lung neoplasms will be included in this
      open, multicenter, prospective study. Primary observation endpoint is recorded at 3 months
      follow-up, and after 3 months patients could be continued to follow up. The data are
      expressed in terms of mean and percentage. The categorical variables are analyzed by
      chi-square test, and the four table data is analyzed using the exact probability method. The
      continuous variable analysis is used by t test. Statistical analysis is performed with SPSS
      20.0 software. P &lt; 0.05 is considered statistically significant.

      This is a prospective, multicenter, and cohort study. Study subjects: patients with early
      central lung neoplasms meet inclusion/exclusion criteria and could receive interventional
      therapy.

      There are 3 study site in this study and a total of 30 patients with early central lung
      cancer will be included.

      HybridAPC is integrated with traditional APC and water-jet technique, which has been
      successfully applied for endoscopic treatment of mucosal lesions in GI, such as Barrett
      esophageal and lesions in colon. Submucosal injection of water jet can elevate superficial
      lesion, and then APC can be more effective in ablation of superficial tumor with a protection
      for muscular layer. The application of HybridAPC in respiratory intervention could
      theoretically protect cartilage, adventitia, reduce damage and formation of scare, and
      increase ablation energy to reach radical treatment.
