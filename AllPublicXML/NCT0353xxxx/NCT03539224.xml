    <textblock>
      Proof of concept trial evaluating safety and efficacy of treatment with Dolutegravir (DTG) +
      lamivudine (3TC) once daily in suppressed participants with history of previous treatment
      with 3TC or emtricitabine (FTC). Half of the participants will have history of failure with
      3TC or FTC and M184V/I or K65R/E/N mutations in previous plasma genotypes, although to be
      eligible these mutations cannot be detectable at study entry in proviral DNA.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. HIV-1 infected patients.

          2. Age&gt; 18 years.

          3. Receiving stable antiretroviral treatment for at least 3 months.

          4. Current or historical treatment with 3TC or FTC.

          5. Willing to change antiretroviral treatment due to intolerance or interest in
             simplification.

          6. Undetectable viral load (&lt;50 cop/mL) for at least 1 year prior to the inclusion. A
             single viral load &gt;50cop/ml (≤500 copies/ml) is allowed before the three months prior
             to inclusion in the study, preceded and followed by an undetectable determination.

          7. Current level of CD4&gt; 350 cells/μL.

          8. Naïve to integrase inhibitors.

          9. Patient able to understand and give written informed consent.

         10. For those included in group 1 (20 patients): No previous history of virological
             failure with ART regimen that included 3TC or FTC or previous virological failure had
             a population genotype without M184V/I or K65R/E/N mutations.

         11. For those included in group 2 (20 patients): previous history of virological failure
             with ART regimen that included 3TC or FTC and historical genotype with M184V/I or
             K65R/E/N mutations.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Detection of any of the following mutations in proviral DNA in peripheral blood by
             conventional sequencing: M184V/I or K65R/E/N.

          2. Pregnant, lactating or child-bearing women who do not commit to using an adequate
             contraceptive method.
