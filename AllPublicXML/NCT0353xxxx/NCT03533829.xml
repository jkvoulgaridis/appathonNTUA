  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled open-label trial. During the study, adolescents scheduled to
      receive at least one intramuscular (IM) vaccine will receive either Buzzy®, Music, or Buzzy®
      and Music intervention(s) in addition to standard care to evaluate the feasibility and
      acceptability of these interventions prior to being used in a larger study to assess the
      effectiveness of the interventions in preventing post-vaccination presyncope and syncope.
      Feasibility will be assessed according to study staff ability to successfully administer the
      protocol specified clinic-based interventions and per both study staff and healthcare
      provider responses to written feasibility assessments. Acceptability will be assessed
      according to the participant's self-report. In addition, baseline needle phobia and anxiety,
      post-vaccination pain and presyncope symptoms, and pre- and post- vaccination state anxiety
      will be assessed per participant written self-report to standardized survey questions.
