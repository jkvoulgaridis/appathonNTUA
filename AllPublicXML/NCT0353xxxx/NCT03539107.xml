  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare voiding assessment based on a minimum spontaneous voided volume of
      150 cc with the standard retrograde fill approach in women after pelvic floor procedures.

    <time_frame>Up to 2 days post-surgery.</time_frame>
    <description>This question asks &quot;How satisfied were you with the method we used to evaluate how well you could urinate after our surgery?&quot; It is measured on a continuum from 0 (very dissatisfied) to 100 (very satisfied).</description>

    <measure>Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire for Voiding Assessment-convenience of method</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 days post-surgery.</time_frame>
    <description>This question asks &quot;How convenient was the method we used to evaluate your urination after our surgery (e.g. time, ease etc.)? It is measured on a continuum from 0 (very inconvenient) to 100 (very convenient).</description>
