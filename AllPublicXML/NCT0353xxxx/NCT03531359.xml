  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children develop anxiety during the induction of anaesthesia and video-games might reduce or
      alleviate it. The investigators intend to conduct a clinical trial to study the effect of
      tablet-based interctive games on alleviating preoperative anxiety.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is estimated that 50% of children may suffer preoperative anxiety. They have a higher risk
      of generating postanesthetic delirium and behavioral changes in the postoperative period up
      to 67% of cases.

      For the management of preoperative anxiety there are pharmacological and non-pharmacological
      treatments. Within the first group there's the use of benzodiazepines of short half life like
      midazolam, however, the use of this medication is not exempt of risks such as paradox
      reactions, respiratory depression, among others. This is why the non pharmacological mesures
      have taken force and every day there is more evidence regarding its effectiveness.

      There are no reports in Chile or latin america regarding the use of this tools, this is why
      the investigators designed this study to prove the effectiveness of audiovisual distraction
      measures in reducing preparatory anxiety compared to premeditation with midazolam.

    <intervention_model_description>Tablet Group: They'll receive a tablet with content adapted to every group. It will be divided into 4 groups (2-4 years, 4-6 years, 6-8 years and 9-10 years). The first one will receive cartoons, the second will also have games; for the other two groups will be assigned appropriate video games depending on the age.
Midazolam group: They'll receive 0,5mg/kg oral or it's equivalent in rectal administration 30 minutes to one hour prior to transfer to the theater. This patients will not be able to have contact with audiovisual devices.</intervention_model_description>
