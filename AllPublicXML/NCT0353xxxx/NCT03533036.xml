  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Virtual reality (VR) has been used in health care settings to decrease anxiety and pain. This
      project is a feasibility study to evaluate whether virtual reality can be used in the setting
      of a first trimester pregnancy termination by D&amp;C and whether the use of virtual reality (VR)
      headsets can help decrease anxiety for patients during this procedure.

      The investigators will assess the practicality and qualitative experience of women using VR
      during first trimester surgical abortion under local anesthesia. Semi-structured interviews
      will be conducted to understand the patient's experience of using VR. Surveys evaluating
      anxiety will be administered to women before and after surgical abortion. Investigators plan
      to enroll 30 patients in order to obtain an effect size for future studies. A group of
      control patients will be enrolled; these patients will receive standard care and will be
      compared to the anxiety scores of the group receiving VR. The mean and standard deviation of
      anxiety scores for each group will be used to calculate power for future studies.

    <description>Mean change in procedure related anxiety score as assessed by the Visual Analog Scale (VAS).
The Visual Analog Scale is a 11 point scale ranging from 0 to 10. 0 indicates the least amount of discomfort or anxiety whereas 10 represents the most amount of discomfort or anxiety.
Participants were surveyed on their level of discomfort prior to and after the procedure. The difference of these scores was taken and the average of each group is presented in as a result.</description>

    <description>VR headsets consist of a Samsung phone dedicated to playing programs designed by the AppliedVR company. The phone is inserted in the front of the headset and can play videos that can be then viewed by the participant while wearing the headset. Participants in the experimental arm will be fitted with VR headsets prior to first trimester abortion and will wear the headset during the procedure. Participants will be able to choose a program of their preference (ex. guided meditation, beautiful scenery). The patient may remove the VR device at any time during the procedure. After the procedure, investigators will carry out a qualitative interview with the participant and ask about the experience of using the VR headset during first trimester abortion. Patients will also complete surveys evaluating procedure-related anxiety. These will be administered before and after the procedure.</description>

    <description>Virtual reality (VR) is a three-dimensional experience created by a headset fitted with a video display. The device, designed to be worn on the face, immerses the viewer in a virtual world and can create a visual distraction from the patient's present situation. We will use a commercially available VR device, comprised of a phone and headset. The phone is inserted into the headset to act as the visual display that can create three dimensional environments. The patient will then choose the virtual reality experience she prefers from the two relaxation programs available. The VR device will be introduced to the participant and fitted to her head prior to the procedure. The device is intended to be worn during the full length of the procedure until the conclusion of the D&amp;C, however the participant may decide to stop wearing the device and choose to end the VR experience at any time.</description>

        <description>Mean change in procedure related anxiety score as assessed by the Visual Analog Scale (VAS).
The Visual Analog Scale is a 11 point scale ranging from 0 to 10. 0 indicates the least amount of discomfort or anxiety whereas 10 represents the most amount of discomfort or anxiety.
Participants were surveyed on their level of discomfort prior to and after the procedure. The difference of these scores was taken and the average of each group is presented in as a result.</description>
