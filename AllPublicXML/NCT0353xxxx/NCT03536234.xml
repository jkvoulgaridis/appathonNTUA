  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An open, randomised, parallel arm phase IIa study. 52 HIV-1 infected patients will be
      randomised (in a 1:1 ratio) to either an active group or a control group. The active group
      will receive the GnRH analogue triptorelin depot monthly at baseline, week 4 and week 8.
      Patients in the active group and in the control group will continue their triple combination
      antiretroviral therapy (ART) during the study without changes; unless there is rationale for
      change on medical ground. In order to prevent the negative effects of a low testosterone
      level, patients in the active group will be offered to receive a single intramuscular depot
      injection of testosterone approximately 7 days after triptorelin treatment. This depot
      administration will keep the serum testosterone on a normal level until the next triptorelin
      dose. This will be repeated when triptorelin is administered at week 4 and week 8. Total
      study period is 24 weeks.

          3. Ability and willingness to give a written or orally witnessed informed consent

          4. HIV-1 infection as documented by HIV antibody test

          5. CD4+ cell count &gt;300 cells/μL at screening

          6. Total HIV-1 DNA level between 100 to 5000 copies/million PBMC as measured by real-time
             PCR within 4 months prior to screening

          7. Plasma HIV-1 RNA level &lt;50 copies/mL for the last year (one blip allowed; blip defined
             as HIV RNA between 50-150 copies/mL) including a plasma HIV-1 RNA level &lt;50 copies/mL
