  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      EndexoTM is an additive that is blended into the fiber solution during manufacturing of the
      hemodialyzer hollow fibers. The intended purpose of the additive is to increase blood
      compatibility in the finished dialyzer, which is referred to as the &quot;dialyzer with Endexo.&quot;

      This is a prospective, sequential, multi-center, open-label study with subjects on
      thrice-weekly (in-center) hemodialysis (HD). After a Screening Period, there will be 12
      hemodialysis treatments on the Optiflux dialyzer (Optiflux Period), followed by 38 HD
      treatments on the dialyzer with Endexo (Endexo Period), and then a Follow-up Visit. The study
      population will consist of End-Stage Renal Disease ESRD subjects who are a minimum of 22
      years of age. The primary objective of the study is to collect data on the performance of the
      dialyzer with Endexo when used to perform hemodialysis (HD) in End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD)
      subjects.
