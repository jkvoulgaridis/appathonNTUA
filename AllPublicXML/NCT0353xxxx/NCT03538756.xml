  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the long-term effects of Walkasins® use on
      clinical and subject-reported outcomes of balance and gait function, quality of life,
      physical activity/participation, pain, and medication use in persons with peripheral
      neuropathy who experience balance problems.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the current study is to show a long-term (10 weeks) sustained
      improvement in FGA score &gt;4 following Walkasins use as compared to initial baseline
      assessment and to examine a potential relationship between initial baseline assessment data
      and long-term outcome. The finding of a short-term FGA change &gt;4 during Walkasins use
      justifies a pre-post study design to investigate the long-term effects of walkasins use.

      The investigators also intend to extend their observations of the short-term effects of
      walkasins by replicating the randomized cross-over design of a previous short-term study.
      (The replication will occur during the baseline visit.) This study will help to further
      refine the prescription criteria for Walkasins and determine whether the presence of a
      short-term response is indicative of long-term improvements or not.

      A subset of 10 participants at the Harvard Medical School site will be enrolled in a pilot
      study to investigate possible structural and functional changes in cortical areas of the
      brain related to somatosensory connectivity using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
      Structural as well as functional MRI scans will be acquired at baseline and after 26 weeks of
      daily Walkasins use. An exploratory analysis of MRI data will be performed and related to
      functional clinical outcomes associated with Walkasins use over the same time period.

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Falls</measure>
    <time_frame>10 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will be asked about the number of times they have fallen in the past 6 and 12 months and whether they incurred an injury from falling. These data will be compared to falls during their participation in the trial as tracked with a calendar and reported as adverse events.

    <description>Walkasins® consist of two parts for each leg: the leg unit and the foot pad. The leg unit wraps around the lower leg of the user and contains electronics for reading foot pad pressure signals, a microprocessor, and four vibrating motors that provide gentle tactile sensory cues to the front, back, medial, and lateral surfaces of the user's leg. These cues reflect real-time foot pressure information at a location above the ankle where skin sensation is still present.</description>
