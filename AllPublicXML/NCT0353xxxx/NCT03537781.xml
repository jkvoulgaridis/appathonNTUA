    <textblock>
      Previous research has shown that nutritional knowledge is a key indicator in healthy eating
      choices, but real-life examinations of the associations between both nutritional knowledge
      and state of hunger and satiety on individuals' food choice of healthy vs unhealthy snacks is
      limited.

      The present study aims to investigate whether the presence of nutritional information on food
      labels will affect participants' food choice when hungry and when satiated.

      Previous research has shown that nutritional knowledge is a key indicator in healthy eating
      choices, but real-life examinations of the associations between both nutritional knowledge
      and state of hunger and satiety on individuals' food choice of healthy vs unhealthy snacks is
      limited.

      As there is currently little research combining these facets, it would be interesting to
      investigate whether individuals who are provided with food labelling information would choose
      unhealthy snacks when hungry as than when satiated and whether this would differ for those
      who are not provided with food labelling information.

      Based on this, the present study aims to investigate whether the presence of nutritional
      information in the form of food labels will affect participants' food choice when hungry and
      when satiated. The General Nutrition Knowledge Questionnaire will be used to assess
      participants baseline nutritional knowledge and will be used as a covariate in the research
      project.
