  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer is a lethal disease. The 1-year and 5-year survival rate is approximately
      20% and &lt;5% respectively. The treatment options available are limited. Only around 10-20% of
      patients present early enough to undergo surgical resection. Furthermore, chemotherapy for
      more advanced pancreatic cancer leads to limited survival benefit and can cause significant
      side effects. One of the main obstacles to developing new treatments for pancreatic cancer is
      the limited understanding of how pancreatic cancer cells change/evolve/adapt following
      treatment.

      This study is a pilot study to assess whether the investigators can track gene expression
      (using a technique called RNA sequencing) in pancreatic cancer cells between two separate
      time points. Investigators intend to take a tissue sample (biopsy) of the cancer using
      endoscopy ultrasound (EUS) and compare it with samples taken either at the time of surgery in
      those patients with resectable disease or follow-up EUS derived biopsies in irresectable
      cancers.

      The interval between endoscopy and follow-up EUS or surgery will be approximately 2 to 3
      weeks and reflects the standard period of time that patients wait from the time point at
      which the cancer is deemed to be operable (in the multi-disciplinary team meeting) to the
      actual operation.

      If the investigators find that the samples (biopsies) taken at EUS and at surgery or
      follow-up EUS are comparable they plan to develop future clinical trials of similar design
      but with the addition of drug therapy. The investigators will use RNA sequencing to
      interrogate the effects of novel cancer drugs on gene expression within the tumour. This will
      give them information on how to select patients for therapy, how resistance develops to these
      treatments, and allow the investigators to better understand what treatments can be combined
      on a rational basis. However, prior to undertaking such studies it is important to understand
      how much variability there is in gene expression between sampling at 2 different time points
      at which two different techniques are used.

        Inclusion criteria:

          1. Male or female, aged 18 years or above

          2. Patients with pancreatic cancer planned for surgical resection, or patients with
             locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer

          3. For patients planned for resection the tumour must be within the head of the pancreas
             such that the EUS biopsy sites and needle track can be resected surgically

          4. Adequate blood clotting parameters in order to undergo an EUS with biopsies, evidenced
             by the following:

               1. Platelet count ≥ 75 x 109L

               2. International normalised ratio (INR) ≤ 1.5

          5. Patients have given written informed consent and are willing and able to comply with
             the scheduled visits, laboratory tests and study procedures including endoscopy (e.g.
             patients able to lie flat without being breathless and have no evidence of oesophageal
             stricture)

        Exclusion criteria:

          1. Previous histologically or cytologically confirmed pancreatic tumour that is not
             adenocarcinoma

          2. Other psychological, social or medical condition, physical examination finding(s) or a
             laboratory abnormality that the investigator(s) considers would make the patient a
             poor study candidate or could interfere with protocol compliance or the interpretation
             of study results

          3. Positive screening pregnancy test if woman of child bearing potential
