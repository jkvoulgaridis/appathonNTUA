  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are currently no treatments to specifically target asthma in obese adults. This pilot
      study is being conducted to investigate how effective roflumilast is in treating asthma in
      participants that have a higher BMI. Roflumilast can induce weight loss, which may lead to
      improved asthma control.

      The primary objective of TRIM is to perform a pilot placebo-controlled trial of roflumilast
      for the treatment of poorly controlled obese asthmatics.

      TRIM is a 24 week, randomized, double-masked, placebo controlled trial that will enroll 38
      participants.

      This study will be take place in seven centers of the American Lung Association- Airways
      Clinical Research Centers (ALA-ACRC). The centers include: Northwestern University Feinberg
      School of Medicine, Mount Sinai Icahn School of Medicine, Duke University, University of
      Arizona, the University of Vermont, The University of Alabama Lung Health Center, and
      University of Illinois Breathe Chicago Center. Johns Hopkins University will be the Data
      Coordinating Center (DCC) for the trial.

    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Asthma Control Test was designed to help participants describe their asthma and how it affects how they feel and what they are able to do. They choose a response based on their asthma within the last 4 weeks. Participants select how many times per week they experience different asthma symptoms and how often they had to use a rescue inhaler or nebulizer. There are 5 questions with 5 responses; 1 meaning their asthma is not well controlled or they had symptoms more frequently, through 5 meaning they feel their asthma is well controlled or they do not experience any symptoms.
The primary outcome is an unadjusted comparison of 24 week change in Asthma Control Test scores between the treatment groups.</description>
