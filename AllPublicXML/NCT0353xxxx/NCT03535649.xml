  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the clinical effectiveness by the clinical response at
      6 weeks and the safety of vedolizumab intravenous in UC Korean participants.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a post-marketing, non-interventional study of participants with moderate to severe
      UC. The study will review medical records of participants who have initiated medical
      treatment with vedolizumab intravenous during the defined eligibility period under routine
      clinical practice to provide the real world data on the effectiveness and safety of
      vedolizumab intravenous.

      The study will enroll approximately 100 participants. All participants will be enrolled in
      one observational group: Vedolizumab

      Both retrospective and prospective data will be collected in the index period, with
      prospective data collected for treatment baseline visit and follow up visits.

      The multi-center trial will be conducted in Republic of Korea. The overall duration of study
      will be approximately 15 months.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Clinical Response at Week 6 Based on Partial Mayo Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical response based on partial Mayo score was defined as a reduction of at least 3 points and a decrease of at least 30 percent (%) from the baseline Mayo score, with a decrease of at least 1 point on the rectal bleeding subscale, or an absolute rectal bleeding score of 0 or 1. Mayo score was an instrument designed to measure disease activity of UC. Partial Mayo score consisted of 3 sub-scores: stool frequency, most severe rectal bleeding of the day, and global assessment by physician, each graded from 0 to 3 with higher scores indicating more severe disease. These scores were summed to give a total score range of 0 to 9; where higher score indicated more severe disease.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Clinical Response at Week 14 Based on Partial Mayo Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 14</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical response was defined as a reduction of at least 3 points and a decrease of at least 30% from the baseline mayo score, with a decrease of at least 1 point on the rectal bleeding subscale, or an absolute rectal bleeding score of 0 or 1. Mayo score was an instrument designed to measure disease activity of UC. Partial Mayo score consisted of 3 sub-scores: stool frequency, most severe rectal bleeding of the day, endoscopic findings and global assessment by physician, each graded from 0 to 3 with higher scores indicating more severe disease. These scores are summed to give a total score range of 0 to 9. Here, higher scores indicated more severe disease.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Clinical Remission at Week 6 and Week 14 Based on Partial Mayo Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 6 and 14</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical remission was defined as a total mayo score of less than or equal to (&lt;=) 2 with no sub-score greater than (&gt;) 1. Mayo score was an instrument designed to measure disease activity of UC. Partial Mayo score consisted of 3 sub-scores: stool frequency, most severe rectal bleeding of the day, and global assessment by physician, each graded from 0 to 3 with higher scores indicating more severe disease. These scores were summed to give a total score range of 0 to 9; where higher score indicated more severe disease.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Mucosal Healing at Weeks 6 and 14</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 6 and 14</time_frame>
    <description>Mucosal healing was defined as Mayo endoscopic sub-score of 0 or 1 compared to baseline. Mayo score was an instrument designed to measure disease activity of UC. Endoscopic findings was a sub-score of complete Mayo score, which ranges from 0 to 3 (0= Normal or inactive disease; 1= Mild disease; 2= Moderate disease; 3= Severe disease), with higher scores indicating more severe disease.</description>

    <ipd_description>Takeda makes patient-level, de-identified data sets and associated documents available for all interventional studies after applicable marketing approvals and commercial availability have been received (or program is completely terminated), an opportunity for the primary publication of the research and final report development has been allowed, and other criteria have been met as set forth in Takeda's Data Sharing Policy (see www.TakedaClinicalTrials.com for details). To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias. Once approved, qualified researchers who sign a data sharing agreement are provided access to these data in a secure research environment.</ipd_description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Clinical Response at Week 6 Based on Partial Mayo Score</title>
        <description>Clinical response based on partial Mayo score was defined as a reduction of at least 3 points and a decrease of at least 30 percent (%) from the baseline Mayo score, with a decrease of at least 1 point on the rectal bleeding subscale, or an absolute rectal bleeding score of 0 or 1. Mayo score was an instrument designed to measure disease activity of UC. Partial Mayo score consisted of 3 sub-scores: stool frequency, most severe rectal bleeding of the day, and global assessment by physician, each graded from 0 to 3 with higher scores indicating more severe disease. These scores were summed to give a total score range of 0 to 9; where higher score indicated more severe disease.</description>

Mayo score was an instrument designed to measure disease activity of UC. Partial Mayo score consisted of 3 sub-scores: stool frequency, most severe rectal bleeding of the day, endoscopic findings and global assessment by physician, each graded from 0 to 3 with higher scores indicating more severe disease. These scores are summed to give a total score range of 0 to 9. Here, higher scores indicated more severe disease.</description>
