  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective observational study which aim to evaluate the feasibility of a
      total and systematic home respiratory rehabilitation training program in patients who will
      undergo thoracic surgery, and otherwise tend to define failure reasons.

    <textblock>
      The aim of this clinical trial is to identify the determining factors which impact a
      preoperative home respiratory rehabilitation training program success. This success is
      determined by complete achievement of the program (100%) by the patient.

      This rehabilitation program is composed by 4 items:

        -  Adapted physical activity : 3 averaging cyclo ergometer or physical activity seances per
           week (25%)

        -  Physiotherapy sessions : 8 seances with a physical therapist (25%)

        -  Smokers : Set up of a program to help give up smoking if active smoker (25%)

        -  Dietetics : If unintentionally weight loss (&gt;5% total weight in 1 month or &gt;10% in 6
           months) or BMI&lt;21 , nutritional assessment is conducted and dietetic program is
           initiated(25%)

      Secondary objectives are :

        -  Assessment of postoperative event onset (30 days) (atelectasis, fibro-aspiration, time
           spent in resuscitation unit, intubation, revision surgery).

        -  Link assessment of 100% program success and at least one complication onset.

        -  Cost assessment of preoperative rehabilitation program

        -  Evaluation of mean hospitalisation duration post surgery (30 days)

        -  Average cost assessment of hospitalisation stay per patient.

      This study will include 50 patients over 18 years old, addressed to the home heath care
      provider AGIR à Dom, for rehabilitation before pulmonary parenchyma exeresis.

      Patients must perform at least 2 items of rehabilitation program previously described.

      This program is an initiative of a pulmonologist or a thoracic surgeon, who include the
      patient when the date of surgery is scheduled.
