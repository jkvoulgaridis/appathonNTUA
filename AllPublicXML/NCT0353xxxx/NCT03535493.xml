  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 1982, Steven Hayes, a clinical psychologist, developed Acceptance and Commitment Therapy
      (ACT), a unique empirically based psychological intervention that uses acceptance and
      mindfulness strategies, together with commitment and behavior change strategies, to increase
      psychological flexibility. In 1954, John Lilly, a cognitive neuroscientist, developed the
      sensory deprivation tank (known today as Floatation Restricted Environmental Stimulation
      Therapy - Float REST), to access a wide range of healing, higher brain functions, and
      meditation through an unparalleled deep relaxation state. In this study, the investigators
      aim to examine whether participants in the ACT + Float REST condition will have larger
      decreases of the burnout phenomenon than those who receive either only ACT or Float REST.

    <description>The combined intervention will combine ACT and Float REST. An ACT session entails a mindfulness-based training to foster and nurture effective behavioral and emotional responding to distress.
