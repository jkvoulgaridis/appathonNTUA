  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the project is to investigate the effect of wound healing of a combined pre-
      and postoperative oral supplement, consisting of zinc, vitamin C, arginine and multivitamin,
      as a supplement for adequate nutrition in patients operated for head and neck cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The project will be conducted as an open, randomized intervention study, and includes
      patients with head and neck cancer that are planned for operation. 40 participants are
      allocated to the intervention or control group, respectively. For both groups, the experiment
      will last for five to six weeks, depending on when the trial participants are planned for
      surgery. The intervention group must take a dietary supplement and a protein drink for 35
      days (7 days preoperatively and 28 days postoperatively), which is delivered 7 days
      preoperatively. The same applies to the control group that only receives protein drinks. The
      length of the intervention period is based on the design of previous studies. During the
      project, compliance will be evaluated by counting the amount of remaining dietary supplements
      and protein drinks that the participants return on a regular basis. The control group
      receives standard treatment as well as protein drinks. For all participants included in the
      experiment blood tests and an ultrasound scanning will be performed.
