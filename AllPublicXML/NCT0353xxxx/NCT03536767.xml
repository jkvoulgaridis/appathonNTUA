      An Open-Label Extension and Safety Monitoring Study of Patients with Symptomatic
      Transthyretin Cardiomyopathy Who Have Completed the Phase II Study AG10-201

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of
      AG10 administered to adult patients with symptomatic transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy
      (ATTR-CM) in patients who have completed the study AG10-201.

      This study will be an Open-Label Extension and Safety Monitoring Study of up to 55 male
      and/or female patients with symptomatic ATTR-CM aged 18 through 90 years, who have completed
      the Phase II Study AG10-201. Enrollment into the study will be followed by visits at Day 14,
      Day 45, 3 Months and every 3 months thereafter. There will be one 7 to 14-day follow-up visit
      after last dose.

      If all doses are well tolerated, the duration of each patient's participation in the study
      will continue based on periodic recommendations of the AG10 Data Monitoring Committee (DMC)
      and/or registration of the product for the treatment of symptomatic ATTR-CM.

      The secondary objectives of this study are to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of AG10
      administered orally twice daily in patients with symptomatic ATTR-CM, and to describe the
      long-term pharmacodynamic (PD) properties of AG10 as assessed by established assays of
      transthyretin (TTR) stabilization, including Fluorescent Probe Exclusion (FPE) assay and
      Western blot, and to describe the PK-PD relationship of AG10 in adult patients with
      symptomatic ATTR-CM.
