    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, open label study with an active standard-of-care
      comparator.

      Stable patients who are already considered to be stable on their standard-of-care
      penicillamine chelation therapy for at least 1 year will enroll in the study and enter a
      12-week Penicillamine Baseline Period comprising of 1 month (4 weeks) run-in period followed
      by a 2 month (8 weeks) evaluation period. During this time all patients will continue to take
      their current penicillamine under study conditions. At the end of the Penicillamine Baseline
      Period, patients who fulfill the protocol definition of being adequately controlled and
      tolerating penicillamine will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either TETA 4HCl or to
      continue to receive penicillamine. There is then a 24-week Post-randomization Phase
      comprising of a 1 month (4 weeks) run-in period for both treatment arms and a 5 month (20
      weeks) evaluation period.

      Patients who successfully complete the 24-week Post-randomization Phase of the study will
      have the opportunity to enter an 18 month (72 weeks) Extension Phase. Initially they continue
      to receive their allocated TETA 4HCl or penicillamine for a further 24 weeks (i.e., up to
      Week 60 of the study). Thereafter all patients will receive TETA 4HCl for 48 weeks (i.e.,
      between Week 60 and Week 108). Study clinic visits occur every 6 months (24 weeks) for all
      patients (i.e., at Weeks 60, 84 and 108).

             * Based on results from screening/enrolment visit samples for which can be taken
             within ± 7 days of visit. Result should be within the assay limits of quantification
             for the sample. The ranges in μmol of copper are 0.40 to 2.38 μmol/L for NCC and 1.59

                       visit as routinely not performed at Week 8 visit, however can also be based
                       on value at Week 8 visit if a repeat (unscheduled) urinary copper excretion
                       was performed at this visit. Result should be within the assay limits of
                       quantification for the sample. The ranges in μmol of copper are 0.40 to 2.38
                       μmol/L for NCC and 1.59 to 14.29 for 24-hour urinary copper excretion (using

                       repeated. The repeat value(s) must be available prior to randomization at
                       Week 12 and, if within specified range, the patient can continue to
                       randomization. If a patient fails this additional criterion at the end of
                       the Penicillamine Baseline Period, the patient can return to the start of
                       the run-in period i.e. Day 1 (but only once). A negative urinary pregnancy
                       test is also required prior to randomization for females of childbearing
                       potential.
