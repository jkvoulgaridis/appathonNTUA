  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the optimal biological dose
      (OBD) as well as the optimal schedule for intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SC)
      administrations of RO7172508 as monotherapy, with or without obinutuzumab pre-treatment, in
      participants with locally advanced and/or metastatic carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)-positive
      solid tumors who have progressed on standard of care (SOC) treatment, are intolerant to SOC,
      and/or are non-amenable to SOC. This study will be conducted in two parts. Part I of the
      study will consist of an IV single participant cohort/multiple-ascending dose-escalation to
      evaluate the safety of RO7172508. Part II is a multiple participant cohort/multiple-ascending
      dose-escalation to define the MTD and/or OBD of RO7172508 administered as single agent, IV
      and/or SC, in participants with tumors that are expressing high as well as moderate/low-CEA.
      The study will switch from Part I to Part II when the maximum planned dose for Part I is
      reached or the occurrence of a RO7172508-related Grade &gt;= 2 adverse event (AE) or
      dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is observed, whichever comes first. The Sponsor may decide to
      switch from Part I to Part II in the absence of an observed RO7172508-related Grade &gt;= 2
      toxicity or prior to maximum planned dose for Part I.

    <description>Part I is a multiple-ascending dose-escalation in single participant cohorts. RO7172508 will be administered IV once every 3 weeks (Q3W). The starting dose of RO7172508 will be 65 microgram (mcg) and the maximum dose explored will be 1.6 milligram (mg).</description>

    <description>Multiple ascending dose-escalation of IV-administered RO7172508 in multiple participant cohorts: The starting-dose for the initiation of the IV dose-escalation will be determined by Part I and RO7172508 will be initially given Q3W. Dose-escalation will be undertaken based on safety until determination of the MTD or the highest safe dose if MTD is not reached. If on-target toxicity is reported in the first cycle of treatment, fractionated dosing may be implemented for the first cycle to improve tolerability.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Part II: Multiple Participant Cohorts SC/MAD-Escalation (QW)</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Multiple ascending dose-escalation of SC-administered RO7172508 in multiple participant cohorts. These will be initiated once the IV schedule has shown RO7172508 preliminary clinical activity or the MTD has been established and is equal to or above 2 mg. The starting-dose and regimen once a week or once every 3 weeks (QW or Q3W) for SC administration will be proposed based on the evaluation of the safety and PK data observed following IV administration but will not exceed the highest safe dose tested in the IV Q3W dose escalation; a minimum dose of 2 mg is defined for a single SC administration. In addition, the QW SC starting-dose will not exceed one third of the IV MTD or of the highest safe IV dose tested. Dose escalation will continue based on safety until determination of the MTD or the planned maximum dose of 400 mg. If on-target toxicity is reported in the first cycle of treatment, fractionated dosing may be implemented for the first cycle to improve tolerability.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  For Part I: participants with locally advanced and/or metastatic solid tumor with
             confirmed cytoplasmic and/or membranous high CEA expression in tumor tissue is
             required. Participants must have progressed on a SOC therapy, be intolerant to SOC,
             and/or are non-amenable to SOC.

          -  For &lt;12 mg dose cohorts, serum CEA levels below a certain threshold is required as
             follows:

               -  For dose cohorts 65-159 microgram, a sCEA level of &lt; 22 ng/mL

               -  For dose cohorts 160-399 microgram, a sCEA level of &lt; 28 ng/mL

               -  For dose cohorts 400-799 microgram, a sCEA level of &lt; 44 ng/mL

               -  For dose cohorts 800-1599 microgram, a sCEA level of &lt; 70 ng/mL

               -  For the dose cohort of 1.6-3.1 milligram, a sCEA level of &lt; 123 ng/mL

               -  For the dose cohort of 3.2-6.3 milligram, an sCEA level of &lt; 229 ng/mL.

               -  For the dose cohort of 6.4-11.9 milligram, an sCEA level of &lt; 440 ng/mL. If dose
                  fractionation is implemented, the sCEA threshold for inclusion should correspond
                  to the dose range of the first dose administered.
