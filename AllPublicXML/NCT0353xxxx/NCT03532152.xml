  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study assess the effect of the VR technology (Pure Purr technology) on the recovery of
      the autonomic nervous system in healthy volunteers affected by moderate stress. Study subject
      randomized into two groups: in Group 1 volunteers first be tested with the VR headset A, and
      during the next visit- headset B. Group 2 volunteers first be tested with the VR headset B,
      and during the next visit- headset A. Before, after and during VR session was conducted
      stress modulation and ECG recording.

      The Pure Purr technology combines several audio and visual stimuli aimed at activation of the
      parasympathetic nervous system. Therefore, this study will investigate the effect of this
      technology on the recovery of autonomic nervous system performance after moderate stress.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pure Purr technology is based on discoveries in neurophysiology, medicine, acoustics, and
      computer engineering, which are used to initiate the physiological process of recreation,
      i.e. allostasis. Literally this term means &quot;achieving stability through change&quot;. This is an
      active mechanism playing a part in normalization of the tone of the autonomic nervous system
      and maintaining stability of the body internal environment. The condition in which all our
      functions are implemented fully and sparingly in response to the load, and the level of
      adaptation remains high for a long time. Pure Purr is a software and hardware complex for
      relaxation and recreation based on a virtual reality headset with a display with sufficient
      resolution, built-in processor, memory, and extended-range stereo speakers. Positive effect
      on the cognitive function of the brain and the system of neurohumoral regulation is achieved
      due to the synchronous actuation of a number of stimuli, such as: visual sequence enhanced by
      the effect of virtual reality, harmonious music with the binaural rhythm technology, and
      modified cat purrs. Currently, the use of each technology is a scientifically proven trigger
      for the activation of individual parts of the human nervous system. And combining them in one
      software complex enhances the overall effect.
