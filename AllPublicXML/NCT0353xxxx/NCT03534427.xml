  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of a 12-week jump rope exercise program
      on blood pressure, arterial stiffness, vasodilating and vasoconstricting factors,
      inflammatory markers, and body composition in prehypertensive adolescent girls. Forty
      prehypertensive adolescent girls participated in this study. The girls were randomly divided
      into the jump rope exercise intervention group (EX, n=20) and control group (CON, n=20). The
      EX group performed a jump rope training program at 40-70% of their heart rate reserve (HRR) 5
      days/week for 12 weeks (sessions 50 minutes in duration). The CON group did not participate
      in any structured or unstructured exercise protocol. Blood pressure, arterial stiffness,
      plasma nitrate/nitrite levels, endothelin-1, C-reactive protein, and body composition were
      measured before and after the 12-weeks study.

    <description>The jump rope exercise program was performed for 50 minutes with 5 minutes of warm-up and cool-down per day, 5 times a week for 12 weeks. The program consisted of various main jump rope exercises (1 line 2 jump, jumping feet together, running jumping, open side jump, open back and forth jump, rock paper scissor jump). The warm-up and cool down consisted of static stretching, walking, and jogging. Intensity of exercise was gradually increased from 40-50% heart rate reserve (HRR) in weeks 1-4 and to 60-70% HRR in weeks 9-12. Each training session was supervised by the researchers. Every subject wore a heart rate monitor during the whole training session in order to maintain the designated training intensity.</description>

            <description>The jump rope exercise program was performed for 50 minutes with 5 minutes of warm-up and cool-down per day, 5 times a week for 12 weeks. The program consisted of various main jump rope exercises (1 line 2 jump, jumping feet together, running jumping, open side jump, open back and forth jump, rock paper scissor jump). The warm-up and cool down consisted of static stretching, walking, and jogging. Intensity of exercise was gradually increased from 40-50% heart rate reserve (HRR) in weeks 1-4 and to 60-70% HRR in weeks 9-12. Each training session was supervised by the researchers. Every subject wore a heart rate monitor during the whole training session in order to maintain the designated training intensity.

Intensity of exercise was gradually increased from 40-50% heart rate reserve (HRR) in weeks 1-4 and to 60-70% HRR in weeks 9-12. Each training session was supervised by the researchers. Every subject wore a heart rate monitor during the whole training session in order to maintain the designated training intensity.

            <title>Jump Rope Exercise Intervention</title>
            <description>The jump rope exercise program was performed for 50 minutes with 5 minutes of warm-up and cool-down per day, 5 times a week for 12 weeks. The program consisted of various main jump rope exercises (1 line 2 jump, jumping feet together, running jumping, open side jump, open back and forth jump, rock paper scissor jump). The warm-up and cool down consisted of static stretching, walking, and jogging. Intensity of exercise was gradually increased from 40-50% heart rate reserve (HRR) in weeks 1-4 and to 60-70% HRR in weeks 9-12. Each training session was supervised by the researchers. Every subject wore a heart rate monitor during the whole training session in order to maintain the designated training intensity.
