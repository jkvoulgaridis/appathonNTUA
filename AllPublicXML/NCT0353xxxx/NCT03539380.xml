      This is an expanded access program (EAP) for eligible participants. This program is designed
      to provide continued access to TRx0237 to individual patients with early and mild-moderate
      Alzheimer's disease who do not qualify for participation in an ongoing clinical trial.
      Eligible participants must have previously completed participation in a clinical trial of
      TRx0237 conducted by TauRx, among other criteria.

             risk

          -  Ability to travel to the named clinic for regularly scheduled visits.

          -  The patient and/or his/her legal representative have been informed of the potential

             consistent with local requirements.

          -  Not participating in a clinical trial of another investigational drug.

          -  Has one (or more) identified adult study partner who either lives with the subject or
             has sufficient contact to provide assessment of changes in subject behavior and
             function over time and information on safety and tolerability; is willing to provide
             written informed consent for his/her own participation; is able to read, understand,
             and speak the designated language at the study site; agrees to accompany the subject
             to each study visit

          -  A female patient of child-bearing potential must use adequate birth control (as
             defined by the protocol) for at least 90 days before beginning treatment and agree to

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Swallowing difficulties which prevent taking the medication whole as instructed.

          -  Unable to comply with this study protocol or has health concerns that may increase
             risk, in the opinion of the treating physician

          -  Enrolled in a previous TRx0237 clinical trial and either did not complete the clinical
             trial, had a significant treatment-related adverse event that could cause an undue
             risk, or progressed to severe Alzheimer's disease

          -  Current use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and/or memantine

          -  Use of drugs for which there is a warning or precaution in the labeling about
             methemoglobinemia at approved doses (e.g., dapsone, local anesthetics such as
             benzocaine used chronically, primaquine and related antimalarials)

          -  Use of clozapine

          -  Clinically significant respiratory failure

          -  History of clinically significant hematological abnormality or hemoglobin value

          -  Creatinine clearance &lt;30 mL/min

          -  Clinically significant alanine transaminase (3×the upper limit of normal [ULN]) and/or
