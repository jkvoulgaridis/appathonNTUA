  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study study aims to elucidate the immune responses to a shared antigen vaccine
      (PROSTVAC) and tumor specific antigens generated DNA vaccine in combination with checkpoint
      blockade using nivolumab (anti-PD-1), and ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4). Additionally, the
      investigators will study the impact of the combination immunotherapy on peripheral T cell
      activation, as well as immune response in the tumor microenvironment. Finally, the
      investigators will evaluate the safety and tolerability to this novel personalized
      immunotherapy in combination with checkpoint blockade.

If the node progresses to ≥ 1.5 cm in the short axis, it is pathologic and measurable. Nodes that have progressed to between 1.0 and less than 1.5 cm are pathologic subject to clinical discretion and are nonmeasurable

    <description>Within 60 days after the last chemo, patients will start a priming dose of PROSTVAC-V, and subsequent doses of PROSTVAC- F (weeks 0, 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, and 17). During &quot;Treatment A&quot; phase, subjects should receive nivolumab intravenously on Day 1 of each cycle every 3 weeks for 6 doses. Ipilimumab on Day 1 of each cycle every 3 weeks for 2 doses.
Patients will then receive a neoantigen DNA vaccine with continuous nivolumab treatment. The vaccine will be administered starting approximately week 21 by intramuscular injection for a total of 6 treatments every 28 days +/-7 days. Each DNA vaccination will be 4 mg vaccine administered intramuscularly using a TriGrid electroporation device. Patients will receive nivolumab at 480 mg every 28 days concurrently with neoantigen DNA vaccine. This is Treatment B. In the event the DNA vaccine production is delayed, patients will receive single agent nivolumab every 4 weeks beginning week 21 until the vaccine is ready</description>

             for eligible injection sites (left and right medial deltoid region) exceeds 40 mm.
