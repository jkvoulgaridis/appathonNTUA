  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      The experimental product in this study, N6LS, is a human monoclonal antibody. Antibodies are
      one way that the human body fights infection. Monoclonal means that all the antibodies in the
      product are the same. N6LS is directed against the HIV virus. There is no HIV in the N6LS
      study product and you cannot get HIV from this product. This study will be the first time
      N6LS is tested in humans. It will be given into a vein in your arm (intravenously, IV) or as
      an injection underneath your skin (subcutaneously, SC). The study will also test N6LS mixed
      with an enzyme, rHuPH20 (recombinant human hyaluronidase). rHuPH20 increases the spread of
      fluids injected underneath your skin (subcutaneously, SC) and allows for the rapid delivery
      of large volume injections that can be given with a single needle. It will be given as a SC
      infusion using a small needle attached to an infusion pump. Study products will only be given
      to healthy adults who are not infected with HIV.

      Objective:

      The main purpose of the study is to see if N6LS alone and N6LS mixed with rHuPH20 is safe in
      healthy adults. Another goal is to learn how amounts of N6LS in the body change over time.

      You may be eligible to participate if you are:

        -  18 to 50 years old

        -  Willing to get N6LS or N6LS with rHuPH20

        -  Available for clinical follow-up for 6-11 months after enrollment

        -  Willing to donate blood to be stored indefinitely for research use

        -  In general good health

      You will not be eligible to participate if you:

        -  Have received a licensed or investigational monoclonal antibody in the past

        -  Have a known sensitivity any ingredient in EDP

        -  Weigh more than 253 pounds (115 kg)

        -  Have HIV infection

      Women must not be pregnant and must agree to use an effective method to prevent pregnancy
      during the entire study.

      Study Plan:

      32 to 40 healthy volunteers will be enrolled into 8 groups. Assigned study groups will depend
      on the dose of product, the numbers of times the product is given (once or three times at 12-
      week intervals), and how the product is given (IV or SC). Blood samples for research will be
      collected at most of the visits. There are about 14 clinic visits over 6 months for all
      groups getting one dose of product, and about 26 clinic visits over 12 months for the groups
      getting three doses of product. Participants will be compensated for their time and
      inconvenience.

      Study Design:

      This is the first study in healthy adults of the N6LS monoclonal antibody (MAb). It is a
      dose-escalation study to examine safety, tolerability, dose, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      N6LS administered intravenously (IV) and subcutaneously (SC) to healthy adults. For SC
      administration, N6LS will be administered alone or coadministered with the permeation
      enhancer rHuPH20 enzyme. Primary hypotheses are that N6LS administration to healthy adults
      will be safe by the IV and SC routes, alone and with rHuPH20 coadministration. A secondary
      hypothesis is that all N6LS administrations will be detectable in human sera with a definable
      half-life

      Product Description:

      N6LS (VRC-HIVMAB091-00-AB ) is a human MAb targeted to the HIV-1 CD4 binding site. It was
      developed by the VRC/NIAID/NIH and manufactured under current Good Manufacturing Practice
      (cGMP) regulations at the VRC Vaccine Pilot Plant operated under contract by the Vaccine
      Clinical Materials Program (VCMP), Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc., Frederick, MD. The
      product is provided as a sterile aqueous buffered solution in 10 mL glass vials at a
      concentration of 100 mg/mL and volume of 6.25 mL.

      Each vial of ENHANZE(TM) Drug Product (EDP) contains 0.5 mL of rHuPH20 formulated at a
      concentration of 1 mg/mL (approximately 110,000 U/mg rHuPH20). rHuPH20 is a tissue
      permeability modifier that depolymerizes hyaluronan (HA), increasing the dispersion of a
      substance into the subcutaneous space, which enables SC delivery of co-administered antibody
      (-ies) at higher dose volumes (e.g., &gt;10 mL) that cannot be administered quickly without
      rHuPH20. EDP is manufactured by Ajinomoto Althea, Inc, (San Diego, CA) for Halozyme
      Therapeutics, Inc. (San Diego, CA) and is supplied in 2 mL glass vials as a sterile,
      single-dose, injectable liquid.

      Subjects:

      Healthy adults, 18-50 years of age.

      Study Plan:

      This open-label study includes 8 dose groups to assess N6LS alone given as a single IV
      infusion at the 5, 20, or 40 mg/kg dose level (Groups 1, 3,4); a single SC injection at the 5
      mg/kg dose level (Group 2); or in 3 administrations, spaced 12 weeks apart by SC injection at
      the 5 mg/kg dose level (Group 5), or by IV infusion at the 20 mg/kg dose level (Group 6). Two
      additional groups will assess N6LS given as a single SC injection mixed with rHuPH20 (2000
      U/mL) at 5 mg/kg (Group 7) or 20 mg/kg (Group 8) doses. Enrollment opened with Groups 1, 2
      and 5; and was followed by the sequential activation of Groups 3, 4, and 6. With
      implementation of the two SC N6LS+ rHuPH20 arms as a protocol amendment, Group 7 will open
      first to accrual, followed by Group 8.

      Study Duration:

      Study participation will be approximately 24 weeks for subjects in Groups 1 to 4, 7 and 8;
      and 48 weeks for subjects in Groups 5 and 6.
