  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II clinical trial studies how well thermal ablation and spine stereotactic
      radiosurgery work in treating patients with cancer that has spread to the spine (spine
      metastases) and is at risk for compressing the spinal cord. Thermal ablation uses a laser to
      heat tumor tissue and helps to shrink the tumor by destroying tumor cells. Stereotactic
      radiosurgery delivers a large dose of radiation in a short time precisely to the tumor,
      sparing healthy surrounding tissue. Combining thermal ablation with stereotactic radiosurgery
      may be a better way to control cancer that has spread to the spine and is at risk for
      compressing the spinal cord.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To document the rate of local control at 6 months in patients who receive a combination of
      thermal ablation and stereotactic spine radiosurgery (SSRS) for spine metastases with
      moderate to severe epidural involvement.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine local control at 1, 3, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months, and to compare to a
      historical control where patients received only SSRS at these time points and at 12 months.

      II. To document the extent of epidural tumor regression at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months.

      IIa. Calculate decrease in epidural tumor volume (by volumetric measurements). IIb. Calculate
      increase in thecal sac patency (by volumetric measurements and according to Bilsky method).

      III. To determine overall survival at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. IV. To assess changes in
      muscle strength, location and severity of spinal-related pain, sensory function, ability to
      ambulate, and neurological grading at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months compared with
      pretreatment baselines.

      V. To assess the effect of treatment on quality of life (QOL), measured at 1 month and every
      3 months after with validated outcome measure tools.

      VI. To describe adverse side effects after treatment and to descriptively correlate those
      effects with radiographic findings, pain control, and quality of life.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo thermal ablation and computed tomography (CT)-guided SSRS via
      intensity-modulated radiation therapy on different dates within a 1-14 day window. The order
      of treatment is at the doctor's discretion.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months
      and then every 6 months.

Combined with the neurotically examination results, changes at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months will be compared with pretreatment baselines.

    <measure>Changes in quality of life (QOL) assessed by SF-12 healthy survey (v2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants are asked to twelve questions that measure eight health domains to assess physical and mental health. Physical health-related domains include General Health (GH), Physical Functioning (PF), Role Physical (RP), and Body Pain (BP). Mental health-related scales include Vitality (VT), Social Functioning (SF), Role Emotional (RE), and Mental Health (MH). 3 and 5 point Likert scale is used in the survey. Two summary scores of the SF-12v2—physical and mental health—using the weighted means of the eight domains. Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize pain relief and quality of life at each follow-up visit, which will be the changes in scores from baseline to each assessment visit. Time to maximum pain relief will be the time from the day of thermal ablation until the lowest pain score for average pain after radiotherapy.</description>

          -  No more than 3 contiguous or discontiguous vertebral levels involved with metastasis
             in the spine to be irradiated in a single session or 3 sessions.

          -  Motor strength &gt;/=4 out of 5 in extremity or extremities affected by the level of the
             spinal cord compression (see section 4 for grading method).

          -  ECOG performance status &lt;/=2 or Karnofsky performance status (KPS) &gt;/=50

          -  Life expectancy &gt;3 months.

          -  Inoperable disease because of patient refusal, neurosurgical evaluation, or any other
             medical reasons.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) before study entry and for
             the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is
             pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform
             her treating physician immediately.

          -  Prior conventional radiation to the same site is allowed as long as there is a greater
             than 3 months interval.

          -  All patients must sign informed consent forms verifying that they are aware of the
             investigational nature of this study in keeping with the rules and policies of MD
             Anderson Cancer Center. The only acceptable consent form is one approved by the MD
             Anderson institutional review board.

          -  Patients who do not have other options of treatment, based on consensus recommendation
             of the multidisciplinary spine SRS (SSRS) tumor board. Patients will have an

        Exclusion:

          -  Primary tumors of radiosensitive histology (lymphoma, multiple myeloma, small cell
             carcinoma, germ cell tumors), as conventional radiation is likely to be effective in
             such cases.

          -  Prior conventional irradiation of the spine site and level to be treated with an
             interval shorter than 3 months.

          -  Prior surgery to the same levels of spine.

          -  Inability to lie flat on a treatment table for &gt;60 minutes.

          -  Unable to undergo MRI of the spine

          -  Pregnancy (because radiation has the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient
             effects).

          -  Frank cord compression or cord compression from bone components or configuration and
             acute neurological deficits (defined as motor strength &lt;4/5 in extremity or
