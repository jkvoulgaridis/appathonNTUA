      A Phase 1b/2 Study to Assess the Safety and Efficacy of HBI-8000 in Combination with
      Nivolumab in Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors Including Melanoma, Renal Cell Carcinoma
      (RCC), and Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC).

      The primary objective of this study is:

      -To evaluate the safety and tolerability of HBI-8000 when combined with a standard dose and
      regimen of nivolumab, and to evaluate frequency and severity of toxicities of this
      combination treatment

      The secondary objectives of this study include:

        -  To explore the efficacy of study treatment as measured by Objective Response Rate (ORR),
           Disease Control Rate (DCR), Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), Duration of Response (DoR),
           Progression-Free Survival (PFS) in all subjects treated at RP2D

        -  To obtain pharmacokinetics of twice weekly HBI-8000 when administered in combination
           with nivolumab administered once every two weeks (Phase 1b all sites)

        -  To obtain pharmacokinetics of twice weekly HBI-8000 when administered in combination
           with nivolumab administered per package insert dose and administration (Phase 2 selected
           sites)

        -  To characterize the effect of HBI-8000 on the electrocardiogram QT corrected (QTc)
           interval (Phase 1b only)

      Exploratory:

        -  To investigate the kinetics and extent of histone acetylation in peripheral blood
           mononuclear cells (PBMC) at the RP2D of HBI-8000 (Phase 2 only)

        -  To explore potential biomarkers for disease response through sequential sampling of
           blood and/or tumor tissue in subjects consenting to correlative sub-studies at
           participating sites (Phase 2 only)

      Dose Escalation (Phase 1b) will include up to 18 subjects, followed by Cohort Expansion
      (Phase 2) including up to 100 subjects (melanoma up to 60 subjects and NSCLC up to 40
      subjects at MTD and/or RP2D.

      A Phase 1b/2 Study to Assess the Safety and Efficacy of HBI-8000 in Combination with
      Nivolumab in Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors Including Melanoma, Renal Cell Carcinoma
      (RCC), and Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC).

      The primary objective of this study is:

      -To evaluate the safety and tolerability of HBI-8000 when combined with a standard dose and
      regimen of nivolumab, to determine Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and/or Recommended Phase 2
      Dose (RP2D) and to evaluate frequency and severity of toxicities of this combination
      treatment

      The secondary objectives of this study include:

        -  To explore the efficacy of study treatment as measured by Objective Response Rate (ORR),
           Disease Control Rate (DCR), Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), Duration of Response (DoR),
           Progression-Free Survival (PFS) in all subjects treated at RP2D

        -  To obtain pharmacokinetics of twice weekly HBI-8000 when administered in combination
           with nivolumab administered once every two weeks (Phase 1b all sites; Phase 2 selected
           sites)

        -  To characterize the effect of HBI-8000 on the electrocardiogram QT corrected (QTc)
           interval (Phase 1b only)

      Exploratory:

      -To investigate the kinetics and extent of histone acetylation in peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells (PBMC) at the RP2D of HBI-8000 (Phase 2 only)

      Dose Escalation (Phase 1b) will include up to 18 subjects, followed by Cohort Expansion
      (Phase 2) including up to 100 subjects (melanoma up to 60 subjects and NSCLC up to 40
      subjects) at MTD and/or RP2D.

      HBI-8000 tablets will be administered at 20, 30, 40 mg/dose, orally twice a week until MTD or
      40 mg in Phase 2, if MTD is not reached.

      Nivolumab: 240 mg intravenous infusions every 2 weeks for Phase 1b and in accordance with the
      manufacturer package insert and institution's prescribing practice for Phase 2.

      A treatment cycle consists of 28 days. Treatment continues until disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.
