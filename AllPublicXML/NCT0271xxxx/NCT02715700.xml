  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effects of multiple doses of doravirine (MK-1439) on the
      pharmacokinetics of methadone in participants requiring methadone maintenance therapy. The
      primary hypothesis is that area under the plasma concentration-time curve to 24 hours
      postdose (AUC0-24) of (R)-methadone is similar when a maintenance regimen of methadone is
      administered with or without multiple daily doses of doravirine.

    <description>The AUC0-24 of the R- methadone enantiomer was determined on Day 1 (methadone alone) and on Day 6 (methadone + doravirine). Plasma samples collected for methadone assay were analyzed for R- and S-methadone concentrations by Pharma Medica Research Inc. (Ontario, Canada). The analytical method used liquid-liquid extraction for analyte isolation followed by liquid chromatographic-tandem mass spectrometric (LC-MS/MS) detection. The lower limit of quantification (LLoQ) was 0.0250 ng/mL for each enantiomer. The analytical range was 0.0250 - 15.0 ng/mL.</description>

        <title>Area Under the Concentration-Time Curve From Zero to 24 Hours After Dosing (AUC0-24) of R-Methadone</title>
        <description>The AUC0-24 of the R- methadone enantiomer was determined on Day 1 (methadone alone) and on Day 6 (methadone + doravirine). Plasma samples collected for methadone assay were analyzed for R- and S-methadone concentrations by Pharma Medica Research Inc. (Ontario, Canada). The analytical method used liquid-liquid extraction for analyte isolation followed by liquid chromatographic-tandem mass spectrometric (LC-MS/MS) detection. The lower limit of quantification (LLoQ) was 0.0250 ng/mL for each enantiomer. The analytical range was 0.0250 - 15.0 ng/mL.</description>

        <title>C24 of S-Methadone</title>
        <description>The C24 of the S- methadone enantiomer was determined on Day 1 (methadone alone) and on Day 6 (methadone + doravirine). Plasma samples collected for methadone assay were analyzed for R- and S-methadone concentrations by Pharma Medica Research Inc. (Ontario, Canada). The analytical method used liquid-liquid extraction for analyte isolation followed by LC-MS/MS detection. The LLoQ was 0.0250 ng/mL for each enantiomer. The analytical range was 0.0250 - 15.0 ng/mL.</description>

        <title>Cmax of Total Methadone</title>
        <description>The Cmax of total methadone was determined on Day 1 (methadone alone) and on Day 6 (methadone + doravirine). Plasma samples collected for methadone assay were analyzed for R- and S-methadone concentrations by Pharma Medica Research Inc. (Ontario, Canada). The analytical method used liquid-liquid extraction for analyte isolation followed by LC-MS/MS detection. The LLoQ was 0.0250 ng/mL for each enantiomer. The analytical range was 0.0250 - 15.0 ng/mL.</description>
