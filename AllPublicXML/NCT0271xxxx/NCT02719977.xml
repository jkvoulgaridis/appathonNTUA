    <textblock>
      CX5461 is a new type of drug for many types of cancer, particularly cancers that cannot
      easily repair damage to their cells. This may help to slow down the growth of cancer or may
      cause cancer cells to die. CX5461 has been shown to shrink tumours in animals and has been
      studied in a few people and seems promising but it is not clear if it can offer better
      results than standard treatment.

      The purpose of this study is to find the dose of a new therapy, CX5461, that can be tolerated
      without causing very severe side effects and to see what effects the study drug has this
      cancer. Participants are given CX5461 and are watched very closely to see what side effects
      they have and to make sure the side effects are not severe. If serious side effects are seen
      in patients at the first dose level, doses of CX5461 may be lowered in subsequent patients.
      If the side effects are not serious, then more participants are asked to join this study and
      are given higher doses. This will continue until a dose is found that causes severe but
      temporary side effects. Doses higher than that will not be given.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        - Tumour Type Phase I Escalation: Patients must have histologically/and or cytologically
        confirmed solid malignancy that is advanced/metastatic/recurrent or unresectable and for
        which no curative therapy exists.

        Phase I Expansion: Patients must have metastatic/recurrent/locally advanced/unresectable
        breast cancer with known BRCA1/2 or HRD germline aberrations.

          -  All patients must have a formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue block (from primary
             or metastatic tumour) available and must have provided informed consent for the
             release of the block. All patients must also have provided informed consent for a
             whole blood sample (after implementation of amendment 3).

          -  All patients enrolled after the implementation of Amendment 2 must also have provided
             informed consent for, and be willing to undergo, a skin biopsy (of an area including
             hair follicles, that is not sun-exposed) prior to treatment (after registration) and
             after cycle 1 day 15 (C1D16). Paired tumour biopsies will also be required for 6-8
             patients enrolled to the RP2D expansion. Note: During accrual to this portion of the
             study, it may be necessary to restrict accrual to patients who are suitable for, and
             have consented to, tumour and skin biopsies. Paired tumour biopsies are strongly
             recommended for all patients

          -  Patients must be ≥ 18 years of age.

          -  Patients must have an ECOG performance status of 0, 1, or 2.

          -  Presence of clinically and/or radiologically documented disease. All radiology studies
             must be performed within 28 days prior to registration (within 35 days if negative).

               -  Phase I: patients do not need to have measurable disease

               -  Phase I Expansion: patients must have measurable disease

             regimens for advanced disease (Note: adjuvant anthracycline/taxane containing
             chemotherapy is considered an advanced regimen) Note: initially, there is no
             limitation to the use of prior platinumor PARPi containing regimens. During the
             expansion accrual may be limited to patients considered to be platinum naive, or
             platinum sensitive (no evidence of disease progression on or within 3 months of the
             last dose) or PARPi naïve or exposed. Sites will be informed at the time of the
             opening of the cohorts

        Other Systemic Therapy:

        • There is no limit to the number of prior therapies.

        Patients must have recovered (to baseline or ≤ grade 1) from all reversible toxicity
        related to prior chemotherapy or systemic therapy and have adequate washout as follows:

        Longest of one of the following:

          -  Two weeks,

          -  5 half-lives for investigational agents,

          -  Standard cycle length of standard therapies.

        Radiation:

        elapsed between the last dose of radiation and date of registration. Exceptions may be made
        for low-dose, non-myelosuppressive radiotherapy after consultation with CCTG. Concurrent
        radiotherapy is not permitted.

        Surgery:

        Previous surgery is permitted provided that a minimum of 28 days (4 weeks) have elapsed
        between any major surgery and date of registration, and that wound healing has occurred.
