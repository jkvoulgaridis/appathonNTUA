        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of MPS IIIA confirmed by the following methods:

          -  No detectable or significantly reduced SGSH enzyme activity by leukocyte assay, and

          -  Genomic DNA analysis demonstrating homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in
             the SGSH gene

          -  Age 6 months to 2 years or children older than 2 years with a minimum cognitive
             Developmental Quotient (DO) of 60 or above (calculated by Bayley Scales of lnfant and
             Toddler Development - Third Edition)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inability to participate in the clinical evaluation as determined by PI

          -  Identification of two nonsense or null variants on genetic testing of the SGSH gene

          -  At least one S298P mutation in the SGSH gene

          -  Has evidence of an attenuated phenotype of MPS IIIA

             anesthetics

          -  Active viral infection based on clinical observations

          -  Concomitant illness or requirement for chronic drug treatment that in the opinion of

             participating in the protocol assessments and follow up

          -  Subjects with total anti-AAV9 antibody titers ≥ 1:100 as determined by ELISA binding
             immunoassay

          -  Subjects with a positive response for the ELISPOT for T-cell responses to AAV9

             B or C infection

          -  Bleeding disorder or any other medical condition or circumstance in which a lumbar
             puncture (for collection of CSF) is contraindicated according to local institutional
             policy

          -  Visual or hearing impairment sufficient to preclude cooperation with
             neurodevelopmental testing

          -  Uncontrolled seizure disorder

          -  Any item (braces, etc.) which would exclude the subject from being able to undergo MRI

          -  Any other situation that precludes the subject from undergoing procedures required in
             this study

          -  Subjects with cardiomyopathy or significant congenital heart abnormalities

          -  The presence of significant non-MPS IlIA related CNS impairment or behavioral
             disturbances that would confound the scientific rigor or interpretation of results of
             the study

          -  Abnormal laboratory values Grade 2 or higher as defined in CTCAE v4.03 for GGT, total
             bilirubin, creatinine, hemoglobin, WBC count, platelet count, PT and aPTT

          -  Female participant who is pregnant or demonstrates a positive urine or bhCG result at
             screening assessment (if applicable)

          -  Any vaccination with viral attenuated vaccines less than 30 days prior to the
             scheduled date of treatment (and use of prednisolone)

          -  Previous treatment by Haematopoietic Stem Cell transplantation

          -  Previous participation in a gene/cell therapy or ERT clinical trial
