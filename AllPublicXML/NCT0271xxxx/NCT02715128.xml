    <textblock>
      Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common, recurrent, and frequent chronic disorder. Among
      others, deficient cognitive control over emotional distraction is a central characteristic of
      MDD (Ochsner &amp; Gross 2005; Disner et al. 2011; Beck 2008). Hypoactivation of the dorsolateral
      prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) has been linked with this deficit (Dolcos &amp; McCarthy 2006).
      Moreover, aberrant functional connectivity patterns have been found in MDD patients (Kaiser
      et al. 2015). Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive brain
      stimulation method that has been largely investigated in experimental neurosciences and tDCS
      of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) has been proposed as novel treatment in MDD. In addition, it
      is increasingly investigated as treatment for negative symptoms in schizophrenia (SCZ)
      (Brunelin et al. 2012). So far, prefrontal tDCS has been shown to enhance cognitive control
      over emotional distraction in MDD patients (Wokenstein &amp; Plewnia 2013). Also, tDCS-induced
      connectivity changes found in fMRI studies comparing resting-state networks configurations
      before and after prefrontal tDCS may reflect a state of enhanced alertness (Keeser, Meindl,
      et al., 2011; Park et al., 2013).

      The aim of this study is to investigate the neurophysiological correlates of tDCS effects in
      patients with different psychiatric disorders for which tDCS is a possible intervention, in
      particular MDD and SCZ, as compared to healthy individuals. For this purpose, we determine
      the most promising protocol in from investigations in healthy volunteers and apply this
      protocol in the patient sample including age- and gender-matched controls. First, functional
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data is collected during the execution of a cognitive
      control task as well as during a resting-state condition together with application of real or
      sham tDCS inside the scanner. It is hypothesized that prefrontal tDCS as compared to sham a)
      reduces distractibility by compensating for deficient DLPFC activity and b) enhances
      functional connectivity in networks associated with externally directed attention or
      cognitive engagement. Second, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is performed to measure
      concentrations of GABA and glutamate in target regions of tDCS. It is hypothesized that tDCS
      effects are mediated via modulation of the inhibitory/excitatory systems and GABA and
      glutamate are used as markers of these systems.

      In this placebo-controlled study healthy volunteers and patients with a diagnosis of MDD or
      SCZ receive a single treatment with prefrontal tDCS (anode over electrode position F3,
      cathode over F4, 20 min, 2mA intensity) or sham tDCS (frequency and duration correspondent
      active tDCS, ramp in and ramp out periods only without intermittent stimulation). We conduct
      resting-state and MRS measurements combined with application of tDCS in the fMRI scanner.
      Subsequently, participants perform the cognitive control task (in dependence of Plewnia, C.,
      Schroeder, P. A., &amp; Wolkenstein, L. (2015)) in the scanner. The participants are assigned to
      either the real or sham tDCS condition according to a randomised, double-blind parallel
      design.
