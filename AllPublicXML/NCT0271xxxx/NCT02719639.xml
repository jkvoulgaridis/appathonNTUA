      Real-world data on the effects of a fixed-dose combination Long-acting beta agonists +
      long-acting antimuscarinic agent (LABA+LAMA) therapy with tiotropium and olodaterol
      administered in a single device, in COPD patients who need treatment with two long-acting
      bronchodilators, is not available. This is a self-controlled study design enrolling consented
      COPD patients who will be treated with Spiolto Respimat according to the approved Summary of
      Product Characteristics (SmPC).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Patients With Therapeutic Success After Approximately 6 Weeks.</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The therapeutic success was defined as a minimum of 10- point increase in the Physical Functioning (PF-10) score between visit 1 (baseline visit at the start of the study) and visit 2 (final visit approximately 6 weeks after visit 1), having approximately time period of 6 weeks between the evaluated questionnaires. PF-10 score measures changes in physical functioning - serving as a surrogate for physical activity and exercise capacity - in COPD patients.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Physical Functioning (PF-10) Score From Baseline (visit1) to Approximately 6 Weeks (visit2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 6</time_frame>
    <description>Change in PF-10 score was determined by taking into account the individual change of each patient between visit 1 and visit 2. The PF-10 used for assessing the primary outcome is a sub-domain of the validated Short Form (SF)-36 quality of life questionnaire and consists of 10 questions evaluating the experienced restrictions while conducting usual activities. Each question of the PF-10 may be answered with &quot;yes, limited a lot&quot;, &quot;yes, limited a little&quot;, or &quot;No, not limited at all&quot;, with a score of 1, 2, or 3, respectively. The scores will be summed up between 10 and 30. The final sum of the individual scores was standardized to a range of 0 to 100 using the formula: 100*(sum-10)/20. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability. If less than half of the scale items were missing, missing values were replaced with the mean of the other values. If half or more than half was missing, no score was calculated.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and week 6</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome measures general condition of the patient evaluated by the physician (PGE score) at visit 1 (baseline visit at the start of the study) and visit 2 (final visit approximately 6 weeks after visit 1) evaluated on an 8-point scale with the scores &quot;Poor (1,2)&quot;, &quot;Satisfactory (3, 4)&quot;, &quot;Good (5, 6)&quot; and &quot;Excellent (7, 8)&quot;. More the score, the better is the general condition of patient.</description>

        <title>Change in the Physical Functioning (PF-10) Score From Baseline (visit1) to Approximately 6 Weeks (visit2)</title>
        <description>Change in PF-10 score was determined by taking into account the individual change of each patient between visit 1 and visit 2. The PF-10 used for assessing the primary outcome is a sub-domain of the validated Short Form (SF)-36 quality of life questionnaire and consists of 10 questions evaluating the experienced restrictions while conducting usual activities. Each question of the PF-10 may be answered with &quot;yes, limited a lot&quot;, &quot;yes, limited a little&quot;, or &quot;No, not limited at all&quot;, with a score of 1, 2, or 3, respectively. The scores will be summed up between 10 and 30. The final sum of the individual scores was standardized to a range of 0 to 100 using the formula: 100*(sum-10)/20. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability. If less than half of the scale items were missing, missing values were replaced with the mean of the other values. If half or more than half was missing, no score was calculated.</description>
