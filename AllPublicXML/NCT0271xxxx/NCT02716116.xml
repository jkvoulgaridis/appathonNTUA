    <textblock>
      The purpose of this phase 1/2 study is to evaluate the safety, recommended phase 2 dose
      (RP2D), dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), maximum tolerated dose (MTD), pharmacokinetics of
      oral TAK-788, anti-tumor activity of TAK-788 in participants with NSCLC with epidermal growth
      factor receptor (EGFR) or human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) and anti-tumor activity of
      TAK-788 in participants with solid tumors other than NSCLC with EGFR or HER2 mutations, and
      to explore relationship between tumor and/or plasma biomarkers, and TAK-788 efficacy, safety,
      and/or cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) induction. The study will also determine the efficacy of
      TAK-788 in participants with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC harboring EGFR in-frame
      exon 20 insertion mutations who have received at least 1 prior line of therapy for locally
      advanced or metastatic NSCLC.

      This phase 1/2 study will evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and anti-tumor activity of
      oral EGFR/HER2 Inhibitor TAK-788 in participants with NSCLC and anti-tumor activity of
      TAK-788 in participants with solid tumors other than NSCLC with EGFR or HER2 mutations. The
      trial will be conducted in three parts: a dose escalation and expansion phase, followed by an
      extension phase.

      The objectives of the dose escalation phase are to determine the safety profile of orally
      administered TAK-788, including the MTD, DLTs, RP2D and pharmacokinetic profile. The primary
      goal of the expansion component of the trial is to evaluate the anti-tumor activity of
      TAK-788 in seven histologically and molecularly defined cohorts at the RP2D (determined based
      on dose escalation phase of the trial).

      The seven expansion cohorts will be:

        1. NSCLC participants with EGFR exon 20 activating insertions, who have either not received
           or not shown an objective response to an EGFR TKI, and who have no active, measurable
           CNS metastases;

        2. NSCLC participants with HER2 exon 20 activating insertions or point mutations and no
           active, measurable CNS metastases;

        3. NSCLC participants with EGFR exon 20 activating insertions or HER2 exon 20 activating
           insertions or point mutations and active, measurable CNS metastases;

        4. NSCLC participants with other targets against which TAK-788 is active (examples include
           EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 substitutions [with or without T790M mutations] and
           other uncommon EGFR activating mutations), without active CNS metastases;

        5. NSCLC participants with EGFR exon 20 activating insertions, who have previously shown an
           objective response to an EGFR TKI and subsequently progressed, without active CNS
           metastases;

        6. NSCLC participants with EGFR exon 20 activating insertions, who have not received prior
           systemic anticancer treatment for locally advanced or metastatic disease, without active
           CNS metastases; and

        7. Participants with solid tumors other than NSCLC with EGFR/HER2 mutations against which
           TAK-788 is active, without active CNS metastases.

      The extension phase will evaluate efficacy of TAK-788 in participants with locally advanced
      or metastatic NSCLC whose tumors harbor EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations and who have been
      previously treated. The study will enroll approximately 341 participants.

               -  Prior treatment with an EGFR TKI is allowed unless the participant had an
                  objective response and subsequent progression as assessed by the investigator or

             investigational agents, &lt;=14 days prior to first dose of TAK-788 (except for
             reversible EGFR TKIs [that is, erlotinib or gefitinib], which are allowed in the dose
             escalation and expansion cohorts up to 7 days prior to the first dose of TAK-788).

          3. Received antineoplastic monoclonal antibodies including immunotherapy within 28 days
             of the first dose of TAK-788.

          4. Have been diagnosed with another primary malignancy other than NSCLC except for
             adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer or cervical cancer in situ; definitively
             treated non-metastatic prostate cancer; or participants with another primary
             malignancy who are definitively relapse-free with at least 3 years elapsed since the
             diagnosis of the other primary malignancy.

             Note: This exclusion criteria does not apply to Expansion Cohort 7.

             radiotherapy are allowed up to 7 days prior to the first dose

          6. Received a moderate or strong CYP4503A inhibitor or moderate or strong CYP3A inducer
             within 10 days prior to first dose of TAK-788.

             allowed.

          8. Part 1 (dose escalation) and Expansion Cohorts 1 to 3 of Part 2 (expansion phase)
             only:

             Have symptomatic CNS metastases at screening or asymptomatic disease requiring
             corticosteroids to control symptoms within 7 days prior to the first dose of TAK-788.

             only:

             Have known active brain metastases (have either previously untreated intracranial CNS
             metastases or previously treated intracranial CNS metastases with radiologically
             documented new or progressing CNS lesions). Brain metastases are allowed if they have
             been treated with surgery and/or radiation and have been stable without requiring
             corticosteroids to control symptoms within 7 days before the first dose of TAK-788,
             and have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases.

          9. Have current spinal cord compression (symptomatic or asymptomatic and detected by

             intravenous (IV) antibiotics, or a known history of human immunodeficiency virus
             (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), or hepatitis C virus (HCV). Testing is not required in
             the absence of history.

         14. Currently have or have a history of interstitial lung disease, radiation pneumonitis

             serum pregnancy test during the screening period.

             breastfeeding.

         16. Have gastrointestinal illness or disorder that could affect oral absorption of

    <ipd_description>Takeda makes patient-level, de-identified data sets and associated documents available for all interventional studies after applicable marketing approvals and commercial availability have been received (or program is completely terminated), an opportunity for the primary publication of the research and final report development has been allowed, and other criteria have been met as set forth in Takeda's Data Sharing Policy (see www.TakedaClinicalTrials.com for details). To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias. Once approved, qualified researchers who sign a data sharing agreement are provided access to these data in a secure research environment.</ipd_description>
