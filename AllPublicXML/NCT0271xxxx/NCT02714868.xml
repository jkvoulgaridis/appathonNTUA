      The purpose of this study is to determine the extent to which Project TEAM (Teens making
      Environment and Activity Modifications) is an effective, socially valid, and feasible
      intervention that prepares youth with developmental disabilities ages 14-21 to respond to
      environmental barriers and increases participation in school, work, and the community.
      Project TEAM is a manualized intervention co- facilitated by a disability advocate and a
      licensed professional. The intervention includes eight group sessions and two experiential
      learning field trips. In addition, young adults with disabilities serve as peer mentors on
      field trips and contact youth weekly to support attainment of goals. Project TEAM outcomes
      are to: increase youths' knowledge of environmental factors and modification strategies;
      reduce the impact of environmental barriers on participation; increase self-efficacy and
      self-determination; and increase participation in a personal activity goal in the area of
      education, employment, or community life. This project builds on a participatory action
      research partnership with disability community stakeholders to address the following research
      questions: (1) To what extent do youth with disabilities participating in Project TEAM
      achieve intervention outcomes? (2) What are the characteristics of youth with disabilities
      who most benefit from Project TEAM? (3) To what extent are goals, procedures, and outcomes of
      Project TEAM important and acceptable (socially valid) to youth with disabilities?.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Disparities in school, work, and community participation impact the 15% of youth in the
      United States estimated to have a developmental disability. A growing body of literature
      suggests disparities in participation are due to barriers in the physical and social
      environment. Practitioners and advocates have developed skill and advocacy interventions in
      an attempt to increase the participation of youth with disabilities. Yet none of these
      interventions focus specifically on acquiring the problem-solving skills needed to identify
      environmental barriers and generate modification strategies to resolve barriers to
      participation. Research indicates that there is a vital need to develop manualized,
      theory-based interventions that empower youth with developmental disabilities to identify and
      advocate for environments that support their participation in school, work, and the
      community.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the extent to which Project TEAM is an effective,
      socially valid, and feasible intervention that prepares youth with developmental disabilities
      ages 14-21 to respond to environmental barriers and increases participation in school, work
      and the community. Project TEAM is a manualized intervention co- facilitated by a disability
      advocate and a licensed professional. The intervention includes eight group sessions and two
      experiential learning field trips. In addition, young adults with disabilities serve as peer
      mentors on field trips and contact youth weekly to support attainment of goals. Project TEAM
      outcomes are to: increase youths' knowledge of environmental factors and modification
      strategies; reduce the impact of environmental barriers on participation; increase
      self-efficacy and self-determination; and increase participation in a personal activity goal
      in the area of education, employment, or community life. Pilot research showed that Project
      TEAM participants (N=20) had a significant increase in knowledge of environmental barriers
      and modification strategies (t(19) = -6.37, p=.00), and 57% increased their participation in
      one activity.

      This project builds on a Participatory Action Research (PAR) partnership with disability
      community stakeholders to address the following research questions: 1) To what extent do
      youth with disabilities participating in Project TEAM achieve intervention outcomes? 2) What
      are the characteristics of youth with disabilities who most benefit from Project TEAM? 3) To
      what extent are goals, procedures, and outcomes of Project TEAM important and acceptable
      (socially valid) to youth with disabilities? This project uses a multi-site,
      quasi-experimental repeated measures design with matched controls to evaluate Project TEAM.
      Sixty-four youth ages 14-21 with developmental disabilities will participate in Project TEAM
      and complete outcome measures at three time points: 2 weeks pre-intervention, 2 weeks post-
      intervention, and follow-up 6 weeks post-intervention. A control group of 64 youth, matched
      to intervention participant characteristics using a three tiered approach, will complete
      outcome measures at time points that correspond with the intervention group. Outcome measures
      assess goal attainment (Goal Attainment Scaling), knowledge and application of skills
      acquired during intervention (Project TEAM Knowledge Test), changes in participation and
      impact of barriers on participation (Participation and Environment Measure- Child &amp;Youth),
      self-efficacy (Generalized Self Efficacy Scale), and self-determination (AIR
      Self-Determination Scale). Characteristics that may influence the extent to which youth
      benefit from Project TEAM will be assessed using a battery of descriptive measures. Outcomes
      will be analyzed within and across groups to evaluate the effectiveness of Project TEAM.
      Feasibility and adherence to the proposed design will be evaluated using a process
      evaluation.

      To evaluate social validity, a Youth Research Panel (YRP) of 6 youth with disabilities ages
      14-21 and a Consumer Research Specialist will administer a satisfaction survey and focus
      group interview to Project TEAM participants. Parents (n= 64) will also participate in
      on-line focus groups to evaluate the feasibility and usefulness of Project TEAM. The YRP and
      other members of the research team will use an action/reflection process to interpret data
      and revise Project TEAM to maximize outcomes for future implementation. The YRP will
      disseminate information about Project TEAM to local and national capacity- building
      organizations targeted to youth with disabilities. The PI will also disseminate findings to
      professionals and the disability community via a website, presentations, and peer- reviewed
      journals.

    <time_frame>12 weeks following intake (outcome)</time_frame>
    <description>All youth had four goals in the following areas: 1) a participation goal, 2) their ability to identify environmental barriers to their goal, 3) their ability to generate solutions to barriers, and 4) their ability to advocate for needed changes to achieve their goal. Each goal used a five-point goal attainment scale with baseline at -1. Goals levels were created at intake (initial assessment). For the knowledge application goals (goal 2-4), we created standardized goal levels to ensure content validity and reliability within and across youth. Goal attainment for all four goals was rated 12 weeks following intake (outcome) and transformed into a t-score. A t-score of 50 indicates all goals were achieved at the expected level; t-scores greater than 50 indicate individuals exceeded the expected level of goal attainment. Scores range from 0-100 (100 indicates greater than expected goal attainment).</description>

    <description>Part I: Knowledge of parts of the environment, modification strategies, and the &quot;Game Plan.&quot; Higher scores indicate more correct responses.
Part I responses were independently coded as correct/incorrect by the study facilitator and a trained graduate student; discrepancies were resolved by a third scorer (the PI). To establish unidimensionality, we applied a dichotomous Rasch model and removed 24% of the items with Outfit Mean Square &gt;2; values higher than 2 can indicate guessing. The resulting interval sum scores, in logits, were used for analysis; higher logit scores indicate more knowledge (Minimum: -4.05 to maximum 6.69). Higher scores indicate greater problem solving.</description>

    <description>The AIR measured the capacity and opportunity to act in a self-determined manner at home and school. Parallel youth and parent forms used a 5-point frequency scale (never-always), with higher scores reflecting more self-determination. Reported here are parent self-reported sum scores at outcome. Sum scores range from minimum 18- to maximum 90 (90/higher scores = more self determination)</description>

    <description>We revised a disability self-efficacy scale for this study and created additional questions to assess self-efficacy for addressing environmental barriers. We used a modified three point response scale (Not like me, Sort of like me, Really like me) that incorporated visuals to support comprehension. Higher scores indicated higher self-efficacy. Sum scores range from minimum 11 to maximum 33.</description>

We examined change in scores between baseline and outcome only for the context in which the individuals' goal occurred (e.g., for GAS goals regarding going to a concert, the parent only completed &quot;community&quot; at outcome. Higher scores indicate higher frequency of participation. Below, we only report outcomes for the youth with community data at outcome, as it was the most frequently occurring goal context . 0 is do not ever participate, and 7 is participate daily.

        <description>All youth had four goals in the following areas: 1) a participation goal, 2) their ability to identify environmental barriers to their goal, 3) their ability to generate solutions to barriers, and 4) their ability to advocate for needed changes to achieve their goal. Each goal used a five-point goal attainment scale with baseline at -1. Goals levels were created at intake (initial assessment). For the knowledge application goals (goal 2-4), we created standardized goal levels to ensure content validity and reliability within and across youth. Goal attainment for all four goals was rated 12 weeks following intake (outcome) and transformed into a t-score. A t-score of 50 indicates all goals were achieved at the expected level; t-scores greater than 50 indicate individuals exceeded the expected level of goal attainment. Scores range from 0-100 (100 indicates greater than expected goal attainment).</description>

Part I responses were independently coded as correct/incorrect by the study facilitator and a trained graduate student; discrepancies were resolved by a third scorer (the PI). To establish unidimensionality, we applied a dichotomous Rasch model and removed 24% of the items with Outfit Mean Square &gt;2; values higher than 2 can indicate guessing. The resulting interval sum scores, in logits, were used for analysis; higher logit scores indicate more knowledge (Minimum: -4.05 to maximum 6.69).

To establish unidimensionality, we applied a dichotomous Rasch model and removed 24% of the items with Outfit Mean Square &gt;2; values higher than 2 can indicate guessing. The resulting interval sum scores, in logits, were used for analysis; higher logit scores indicate more knowledge (Minimum: -4.05 to maximum 6.69). Higher scores indicate greater problem solving.</description>
          <population>We did not analyze 5 youth on this measure in the intervention group: 2 were withdrawn by PI, and 3 withdrew from study. An additional participant had all missing data for this measure at all time points</population>
