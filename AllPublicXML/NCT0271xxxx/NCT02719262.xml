  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators recent study has found that ambient melamine exposure can cause the
      increase of biomarkers of renal tubular injury in melamine manufacturing workers. Thus, in
      this year, the investigators will examine whether the intervention by installing ventilation
      in the workplace and providing personal protective equipment and education can decrease
      ambient melamine exposure and further decrease urinary biomarkers of renal tubular injury
      such as N-acetyl β-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) and β2-microglobulin (β2-MG).

      The investigators through intervention trial design to examine whether the use of ventilation
      in the workplace can decrease ambient melamine exposure, oxidative stress markers (such as
      8-hydoxy-2-deoxyguanosine, malondialdehyde)and indicators of early renal damage (such as
      N-acetyl β-D-glucosaminidase, microalbumin and β2-microglobulin). The one week before
      intervention and the second week after intervention, the volunteers were asked to collect
      their urine samples for one consecutive week during mornings and afternoons. Blood samples
      were taken on Fridays morning, workplace air was sampled for 5 consecutive days. Then the
      investigators continued to trace the melamine concentration change of volunteers and
      workplace every three-month intervals after intervention, and blood samples were taken on
      12th and 24th month.
