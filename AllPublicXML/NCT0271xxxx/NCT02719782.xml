  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence rate is high among liver transplant patients, while
      treatment measures are limited. This study plans to recruit 10 patients with Hepatitis B
      virus (HBV) related HCC who underwent liver transplantation and are confirmed to have
      recurrent HCC. The objective of the study is to assess the safety, tolerability and
      effectiveness of the HBV specific T cell receptor (HBV/TCR) redirected T cell in the target
      population.

    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, single armed and open labelled trial in patients with recurrent HBV
      related HCC after liver transplantation. Subjects who meet eligibility criteria will receive
      escalating doses of HBV specific T cell receptor (TCR-T) on Day 1, Day 8, Day 15 and Day 22
      of the first 28-day treatment cycle, followed by every 2-week dosing on Day 1, Day 15, Day 29
      and Day 43 of repeated cycle. A 21-day treatment break will be given between each cycle.
      Treatment will be continued until disease progression unless otherwise specified per
      investigator's discretion. Subjects will be followed up post treatment for safety monitoring,
      including monthly follow up for the first three month and every 2-monthly follow up up to 24
      months post treatment.

    <description>This is a single-arm study.
Patients will receive a total of 2 cycles, in which first 28-day treatment cycle consists of escalating doses of TCR-T on Day 1, Day 8, Day 15 and Day 22, followed by every 2-week dosing on Day 1, Day 15, Day 29 and Day 43 of second (final) cycle. A one month treatment break will be given between the cycles.</description>
