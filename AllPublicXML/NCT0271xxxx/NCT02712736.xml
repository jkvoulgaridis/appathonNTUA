  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the healthcare-related quality of life (HRQOL), the
      impact of risk of liver transplant and risk of malignancy on HRQOL, and the complementary and
      alternative medicine use in patients with PSC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A cohort of adult (age ≥ 18) patients with a diagnosis of PSC will be identified. The
      patients will be approached about participating in the study while at their appointment,
      either by the investigators or someone else known to the patient. If the patient agrees, the
      investigators or other key personnel will then provide information about the study and obtain
      their informed consent to participate.

      The patients who consent to participate will be sent home from the clinic with a survey to
      complete and return via mail in a provided addressed, stamped envelope. The survey consists
      of the Short Form-36 (SF-36), the Chronic Liver Disease Questionnaire (CLDQ), questions from
      the PROMIS SexFs v2.0, questions regarding perceived risk for liver transplant,
      cholangiocarcinoma, and colorectal carcinoma, as well as perceived overall life expectancy,
      and questions regarding complementary and alternative medicine use.

      Demographic information and clinical data will also be obtained from the patient's electronic
      medical record. The study will be cross-sectional in nature, and there will be no follow-up
      with the subjects after the survey is completed.
