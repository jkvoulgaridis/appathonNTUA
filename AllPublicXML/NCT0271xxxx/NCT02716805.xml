  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a Phase 1, open-label, multicenter, study of checkpoint inhibitor therapy
      (tremelimumab ± durvalumab) prior to and following autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) and
      high-dose melphalan in subjects with multiple myeloma who were at a high risk for relapse,
      were eligible for ASCT, and had available cryopreserved stem cells. Primary study objectives
      were to determine the safety and tolerability of study treatment. Further objectives were to
      evaluate the clinical efficacy and biologic activity of the regimen.

    <textblock>
      Eligible subjects were to be enrolled sequentially into one of 4 treatment cohorts (beginning
      with Cohort 1) to receive pretreatment with Prevnar-13 on Day -33 ± 2 days, followed by a
      single dose of tremelimumab (75 mg) administered either alone (Cohorts 1 and 2) or in
      combination with a single dose of durvalumab (1500 mg; Cohorts 3 and 4) on Day -31
      (approximately 21 days prior to steady-state leukopheresis for the collection of autologous
      peripheral blood lymphocytes [PBLs]). Leukopheresis was performed on Days -10 to -3, followed
      by high dose therapy (HDT) comprising melphalan (200 mg/m^2) administered intravenously (IV)
      on Day -2, and ASCT using previously banked hematopoietic stem cells on Day 0. Autologous
      PBLs were re-infused into subjects on Day +3 following ASCT, with a single dose of
      tremelimumab (75 mg) administered on the same day. Following HDT/ASCT, treatment was to
      resume with tremelimumab (75 mg) administered either alone (Cohorts 1 and 2) or in
      combination with durvalumab (1500 mg; Cohorts 3 and 4) for the first 2 cycles following
      HDT/ASCT according to the following schedule.

      Late post-ASCT treatment:

        -  Cohort 1: tremelimumab (75 mg) administered alone on Day 100 (±10) and 4 weeks later
           (Cycles 1 and 2)

        -  Cohort 3: tremelimumab (75 mg) + durvalumab (1500 mg) administered on Day 100 (±10) and
           4 weeks later (Cycles 1 and 2)

      Early post-ASCT treatment:

        -  Cohort 2: tremelimumab (75 mg) administered alone on Days 30 through 40 and Day 100
           (±10) (Cycles 1 and 2)

        -  Cohort 4: tremelimumab (75 mg) + durvalumab (1500 mg) administered on Days 30 through 40
           and Day 100 (±10) (Cycles 1 and 2)

      For Cycles 3 through 8, durvalumab alone (1500 mg every 4 weeks) was to be administered in
      all cohorts.

      Within each cohort, the second subject did not start treatment until the first subject had
      completed early engraftment (approximately Day 12 to 18 post-ASCT); therefore, the first
      subject in each cohort received the first dose of tremelimumab ± durvalumab and was observed
      for toxicity for approximately 7 weeks prior to enrollment of the second subject.

      Protocol-specified dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were assessed from the first dose of study
      treatment up to and including Cycle 2 dosing (Day 128 for Cohorts 1 and 3 or Day 100 for
      Cohorts 2 and 4). Subjects were not to be treated in a new cohort until all subjects in the
      previous cohort had completed the DLT evaluation period and ≤ 1 of 6 subjects had experienced
      DLT.

      After enrollment of 6 subjects in Cohort 1, the study was placed on partial clinical hold by
      the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) due to safety signals observed in other studies
      investigating pembrolizumab, an anti-programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) antibody, in combination
      with immunomodulatory agents in subjects with multiple myeloma. As a result, the single
      subject who was receiving durvalumab during Cycles 3 to 8 discontinued study treatment after
      Cycle 5; durvalumab was not initiated in the 4 subjects who remained in the study; and no
      further subjects were enrolled. Upon recommendations from the two Principal Investigators and
      the study chair, the 4 ongoing subjects, who were in the transplant phase of the study, were
      permitted to continue post-ASCT tremelimumab treatment after being re-consented under an
      intermediate expanded access protocol.

    <description>Toxicity was graded in accordance with the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.03. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported based on clinical laboratory tests, physical examinations, and vital signs from the time of enrollment through the end of the study period. DLTs were assessed from the first dose of study drug through the Cycle 2 administration of tremelimumab ± durvalumab post ASCT. DLTs were defined per protocol as lack of neutrophil/platelet engraftment by Day 30 post ASCT; Grade 5 toxicity (treatment-related death); Grade 4 non-hematological toxicity; Grade 3 non-hematological toxicity (with exclusions); isolated Grade 3 electrolyte abnormalities; or immune-related AEs resulting in discontinuation of treatment.</description>

             [HCG]).

         17. Female subjects of childbearing potential who were sexually active with a
             nonsterilized male partner must have used at least one highly effective method of
             contraception from the time of screening, and must have agreed to continue using such
             precautions for 90 days after the last dose of durvalumab or for 6 months after the
             last dose of tremelimumab (whichever was longer). Non-sterilized male partners of a
             female subject must have used male condoms plus spermicide throughout this period.
             Cessation of birth control after this point should have been discussed with a
             responsible physician. Not engaging in sexual activity for the total duration of the
             trial and the drug washout period was an acceptable practice; however, periodic
             abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method were not acceptable methods
             of birth control.

             Female subjects should have refrained from breastfeeding throughout the period
             described above.

             Females of childbearing potential were defined as those who were not surgically
             sterile (i.e., bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or complete
             hysterectomy) or postmenopausal.

             Females were considered post-menopausal if they had been amenorrheic for 12 months
             without an alternative medical cause. The following age-specific requirements applied:

               -  Females &lt; 50 years of age were considered post-menopausal if they had been
                  amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal
                  treatments and if they had luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone
                  levels in the post-menopausal range for the institution or underwent surgical
                  sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy).

               -  Females ≥ 50 years of age were considered post-menopausal if they had been
                  amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal
                  treatments, had radiation-induced menopause with last menses &gt;1 year ago, had
                  chemotherapy-induced menopause with last menses &gt;1 year ago, or underwent
                  surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy or
                  hysterectomy).

             Women of childbearing potential must have had a negative serum β-HCG pregnancy test
             (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) conducted during screening
             and a negative urine β-HCG pregnancy test conducted prior to study drug administration
             on Day -31. Ongoing serum pregnancy tests were conducted according to the study
             protocol.

             Nonsterilized male subjects who were sexually active with a female partner of
             childbearing potential must have used male condoms plus spermicide from screening
             through 90 days after last dose of durvalumab or through 6 months after the last dose
             of tremelimumab (whichever was longer). Female partners (of childbearing potential) of
             a male subject must have used a highly effective method of contraception throughout
             the period described above. Cessation of birth control after this point should have
             been discussed with a responsible physician. Not engaging in sexual activity for the
             total duration of the trial and the drug washout period was an acceptable practice;
             however, periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method were not
             acceptable methods of contraception.

             Male subjects should have refrained from sperm donation throughout this period. A
             highly effective method of contraception was defined as one that resulted in a low
             failure rate (i.e., less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly. Note
             that some contraception methods were not considered highly effective (e.g., male or
             female condom with or without spermicide; female cap, diaphragm, or sponge with or
             without spermicide; non-copper containing intrauterine device; progestogen-only oral
             hormonal contraceptive pills where inhibition of ovulation is not the primary mode of
             action [excluding Cerazette/desogestrel which was considered highly effective]; and
             triphasic combined oral contraceptive pills).

         18. Any condition that, in the clinical judgment of the treating physician, was likely to
             prevent the subject from complying with any aspect of the protocol or that may have
             put the subject at unacceptable risk.

         19. Subjects must not have donated blood while on study and for at least 90 days following
             the last durvalumab treatment or for 6 months following the last tremelimumab
             treatment, whichever was longer.

Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported based on clinical laboratory tests, physical examinations, and vital signs from the time of enrollment through the end of the study period. DLTs were assessed from the first dose of study drug through the Cycle 2 administration of tremelimumab ± durvalumab post ASCT. DLTs were defined per protocol as lack of neutrophil/platelet engraftment by Day 30 post ASCT; Grade 5 toxicity (treatment-related death); Grade 4 non-hematological toxicity; Grade 3 non-hematological toxicity (with exclusions); isolated Grade 3 electrolyte abnormalities; or immune-related AEs resulting in discontinuation of treatment.</description>
