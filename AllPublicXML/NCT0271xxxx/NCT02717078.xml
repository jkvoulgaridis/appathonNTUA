  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a randomized controlled, pilot effectiveness trial comparing the LoBAG
      diet to a control diet in 38 participants with DM2 over 12 weeks. Participants will have DM2
      that is not under ideal glycemic control (HgbA1c 7.0-9.5%) and must be taking no glycemic
      medications or metformin. Participants will be free-living (given diet instruction and
      dietitian support, but asked to prepare meals in their own homes). The primary endpoint will
      be HgbA1c, measured at baseline and at the end of the 12-week diet intervention. Additional
      outcome measures will include: weight, fasting plasma glucose, fasting serum insulin,
      postprandial plasma glucose and serum insulin following a test meal consistent with the
      assigned diet, serum fructosamine, fasting serum lipids, stool samples for gut microbiome
      analysis, and surveys to assess quality of life, including the Diabetes Treatment
      Satisfaction Questionnaire. Compliance outcomes will include: urine nitrogen to creatinine
      ratio, survey data, three-day food diaries, and unannounced 24-hour diet recalls.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thirty-eight adult men and women with DM2 will be recruited from the University of Minnesota
      and surrounding communities, and will be randomized to treatment with the LoBAG diet or a
      control diet. Following a consent and screening visit, there will be 5 additional study
      visits over a 12-week diet intervention period. Instruction in the assigned diet will be
      provided by a research dietitian at the beginning of the 12-week period, and reinforced at
      subsequent visits throughout the study. Participants will be asked to purchase food, prepare
      food, and consume the assigned diet in their own homes. They will be asked to keep activity
      level constant and to continue medications for diabetes (metformin or no medication) without
      change during the intervention. The primary outcome, HgbA1c, and secondary outcome measures
      will be assessed at baseline and following diet intervention. Study visits will occur at
      baseline (visits 1 and 2), week 1 (visit 3), week 6 (visit 4), week 9 (visit 5) and week 12
      (final study visit). In addition to scheduled study visits the research team will contact
      participants every other week by telephone to address any issues that arise, with the purpose
      of increasing compliance and retention. Participants will be contacted once in weeks 9-12 for
      a 24-hour diet recall collected by the Nutrition Coordinating Center at the University of
      Minnesota. Study procedures will conclude after the 12-week diet intervention period and
      collection of all outcome measures.
