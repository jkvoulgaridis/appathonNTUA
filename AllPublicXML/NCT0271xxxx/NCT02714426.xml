  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Attentional control, or individuals' ability to choose which stimuli in the environment they
      attend to and which they ignore, declines with older age. Studies from the past two decades
      suggest that mindfulness meditative practice, such as a standardized mindfulness based stress
      reduction programs, may increase the efficiency of attention networks.To date, the majority
      of studies that have related mindfulness meditation practice to attentional control have been
      based on retrospective self-reported mindfulness or cross-sectional measurement in
      experienced meditators. More recent experimental studies using pre-post training designs have
      shown that meditation-naïve individuals can experience attentional improvement with
      mindfulness intervention. This study seeks to elucidate the time course and process by which
      such attentional improvements might be achieved.

      This research study investigates change in attentional control as participants progress
      through an 8-week mindfulness-inspired training (MIT) intervention, and has two specific
      aims: 1) to determine the time course of change in attentional components such as cognitive
      control and sustained attention as a consequence of MIT; attention will be measured weekly
      for 3 weeks before, 3 weeks after, and during 8 weeks of MIT. 2) To investigate the extent to
      which change in attentional performance is coupled/correlated with markers of emotion
      regulation, perceived mindfulness, and perceived mind wandering.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a 14-week research study exploring week to week changes in attentional control
      and selected time-varying covariates. The study will involve comparison of two groups of
      adults aged 65 and older. Half the participants (n=20) will be randomized to received eight
      weeks of mindfulness-inspired training, while the other half (n=20) are not.

      Groups will be compared in the amount of change experienced in measures of attentional
      control. In addition, the association between changes in emotion regulation, perceived
      mindfulness, and perceived mind wandering with changes in attentional control will be
      examined, as well as whether this association differs between persons who did and did not
      receive mindfulness-inspired training. Measurement will include both paper-and-pencil and
      computer-administered tests.

    <description>The Attention Network Task is a computerized test that measures three different components of attention (alerting, orienting, and conflict monitoring). Score is the computed as the difference between reaction time on correct trials in cued and uncued conditions. Scores have been normalized via Blom transformation and computed to T-score metric (mean=50, standard deviation = 10, minimum = 0, maximum = 100, higher = worse)</description>

    <description>The useful field of view task is a computer-administered selective visual attention test that determines the minimum presentation time needed (between 16-500 msec) to correctly make two visual judgments: (a) is a centrally presented line drawing of a car or truck? and (b) where on the screen is a peripheral car located? Score is the fastest presentation time at which participants achieve at least 75% accuracy. Scores have been normalized via Blom transformation and computed to T-score metric (mean=50, standard deviation = 10, minimum = 0, maximum = 100, higher = worse)</description>

    <description>This task set is computerized presents participants with a word (red or green or blue) that may be presented in (a) congruent (same) color as the word itself (e.g., red word is printed in red), or (b) incongruent (word red printed in green or blue). Participants are cued to either select the word or the color, this varies from trial to trial. Score is the reaction time difference between correct responses to congruent and incongruent stimuli. Scores have been normalized via Blom transformation and computed to T-score metric (mean=50, standard deviation = 10, minimum = 0, maximum = 100, higher = worse)</description>

    <description>Participants in both arms are asked, at the end of each of their eight intervention sessions, to focus on breathing. They are interrupted five times during this breathing exercise and asked what proportion of their attention (0-100) was wandering off the breathing task. Score is the average proportion of self-rated mind-wandering over five probes. Scores have been normalized via Blom transformation and computed to T-score metric (mean=50, standard deviation = 10, minimum = 0, maximum = 100, higher = worse)</description>

    <description>Participants will answer computer 7 administered questions about anxiety in the past week. Score is a Likert-type scale response from the following scale: 0=not at all, 1=several days, 2=more than half the days, 3=nearly every day. Scores have been normalized via Blom transformation and computed to T-score metric (mean=50, standard deviation = 10, minimum = 0, maximum = 100, higher = worse)</description>

        <title>Performance in Attention Network Task Conflict Monitoring Over 14 Weekly Measurements</title>
        <description>The Attention Network Task is a computerized test that measures three different components of attention (alerting, orienting, and conflict monitoring). Score is the computed as the difference between reaction time on correct trials in cued and uncued conditions. Scores have been normalized via Blom transformation and computed to T-score metric (mean=50, standard deviation = 10, minimum = 0, maximum = 100, higher = worse)</description>

            <description>Eight weekly group brain health sessions lasting 90-120 minutes. The intervention is psychoeducational, and each week presents information from NIH regarding factors that may promote cognitive health in late life (e.g., sleep, physical activity, social engagement and leisure, cognitive training). Weekly sessions are supplemented with educational videos and group discussion. Weekly homework consists of readings about brain health.
Participants in both interventions receive all study measures equivalently at all occasions</description>

            <description>Eight weekly group mindfulness sessions lasting 90-120 minutes, along with a ½ day Mindfulness Retreat at the end of the training period, will include 1) psychoeducation, 2) formal exercises in the form of guided practice mentioned above, and 3) thoughtful exploration of ideas and questions. Formal mindfulness training will follow 21 guided pre-recorded meditative Moving Picture Experts Group Layer-3 Audio (MP3) tracks from the authors for use in class and at home, promoting both fidelity to the model and uniformity in intervention across training groups. Mindfulness activities in the protocol include mindful breathing, eating, walking, and various other practices well documented in the literature to promote mindfulness. Participants will be asked to practice mindfulness on their own time, and to log this.
Participants receive all of the same measures as the active comparator &quot;Brain Health&quot; condition in Weeks 1-14. In weeks 4-11, participants receive Mindfulness Inspired Treatment</description>

        <title>Performance in Useful Field of View Over 14 Weekly Measurements</title>
        <description>The useful field of view task is a computer-administered selective visual attention test that determines the minimum presentation time needed (between 16-500 msec) to correctly make two visual judgments: (a) is a centrally presented line drawing of a car or truck? and (b) where on the screen is a peripheral car located? Score is the fastest presentation time at which participants achieve at least 75% accuracy. Scores have been normalized via Blom transformation and computed to T-score metric (mean=50, standard deviation = 10, minimum = 0, maximum = 100, higher = worse)</description>

            <description>Eight weekly group brain health sessions lasting 90-120 minutes. The intervention is psychoeducational, and each week presents information from NIH regarding factors that may promote cognitive health in late life (e.g., sleep, physical activity, social engagement and leisure, cognitive training). Weekly sessions are supplemented with educational videos and group discussion. Weekly homework consists of readings about brain health.
Participants in both interventions receive all study measures equivalently at all occasions</description>

            <title>Mindfulness-inspired Treatment/Testing</title>
            <description>Eight weekly group mindfulness sessions lasting 90-120 minutes, along with a ½ day Mindfulness Retreat at the end of the training period, will include 1) psychoeducation, 2) formal exercises in the form of guided practice mentioned above, and 3) thoughtful exploration of ideas and questions. Formal mindfulness training will follow 21 guided pre-recorded meditative Moving Picture Experts Group Layer-3 Audio (MP3) tracks from the authors for use in class and at home, promoting both fidelity to the model and uniformity in intervention across training groups. Mindfulness activities in the protocol include mindful breathing, eating, walking, and various other practices well documented in the literature to promote mindfulness. Participants will be asked to practice mindfulness on their own time, and to log this.
Participants receive all of the same measures as the active comparator &quot;Brain Health&quot; condition in Weeks 1-14. In weeks 4-11, participants receive Mindfulness Inspired Treatment</description>

        <description>This task set is computerized presents participants with a word (red or green or blue) that may be presented in (a) congruent (same) color as the word itself (e.g., red word is printed in red), or (b) incongruent (word red printed in green or blue). Participants are cued to either select the word or the color, this varies from trial to trial. Score is the reaction time difference between correct responses to congruent and incongruent stimuli. Scores have been normalized via Blom transformation and computed to T-score metric (mean=50, standard deviation = 10, minimum = 0, maximum = 100, higher = worse)</description>

            <description>Eight weekly group brain health sessions lasting 90-120 minutes. The intervention is psychoeducational, and each week presents information from NIH regarding factors that may promote cognitive health in late life (e.g., sleep, physical activity, social engagement and leisure, cognitive training). Weekly sessions are supplemented with educational videos and group discussion. Weekly homework consists of readings about brain health.
Participants in both interventions receive all study measures equivalently at all occasions</description>

            <description>Eight weekly group mindfulness sessions lasting 90-120 minutes, along with a ½ day Mindfulness Retreat at the end of the training period, will include 1) psychoeducation, 2) formal exercises in the form of guided practice mentioned above, and 3) thoughtful exploration of ideas and questions. Formal mindfulness training will follow 21 guided pre-recorded meditative Moving Picture Experts Group Layer-3 Audio (MP3) tracks from the authors for use in class and at home, promoting both fidelity to the model and uniformity in intervention across training groups. Mindfulness activities in the protocol include mindful breathing, eating, walking, and various other practices well documented in the literature to promote mindfulness. Participants will be asked to practice mindfulness on their own time, and to log this.
Participants receive all of the same measures as the active comparator &quot;Brain Health&quot; condition in Weeks 1-14. In weeks 4-11, participants receive Mindfulness Inspired Treatment</description>

        <title>Self-ratings of Perceived Mind Wandering Over 8 Weekly Measurements</title>
        <description>Participants in both arms are asked, at the end of each of their eight intervention sessions, to focus on breathing. They are interrupted five times during this breathing exercise and asked what proportion of their attention (0-100) was wandering off the breathing task. Score is the average proportion of self-rated mind-wandering over five probes. Scores have been normalized via Blom transformation and computed to T-score metric (mean=50, standard deviation = 10, minimum = 0, maximum = 100, higher = worse)</description>

            <description>Eight weekly group brain health sessions lasting 90-120 minutes. The intervention is psychoeducational, and each week presents information from NIH regarding factors that may promote cognitive health in late life (e.g., sleep, physical activity, social engagement and leisure, cognitive training). Weekly sessions are supplemented with educational videos and group discussion. Weekly homework consists of readings about brain health.

            <description>Eight weekly group mindfulness sessions lasting 90-120 minutes, along with a ½ day Mindfulness Retreat at the end of the training period, will include 1) psychoeducation, 2) formal exercises in the form of guided practice mentioned above, and 3) thoughtful exploration of ideas and questions. Formal mindfulness training will follow 21 guided pre-recorded meditative Moving Picture Experts Group Layer-3 Audio (MP3) tracks from the authors for use in class and at home, promoting both fidelity to the model and uniformity in intervention across training groups. Mindfulness activities in the protocol include mindful breathing, eating, walking, and various other practices well documented in the literature to promote mindfulness. Participants will be asked to practice mindfulness on their own time, and to log this.
Participants receive all of the same measures as the active comparator &quot;Brain Health&quot; condition in Weeks 1-14. In weeks 4-11, participants receive Mindfulness Inspired Treatment</description>

        <title>Self-ratings in Anxiety (GAD-7) Questionnaire Over 14 Weekly Measurements</title>
        <description>Participants will answer computer 7 administered questions about anxiety in the past week. Score is a Likert-type scale response from the following scale: 0=not at all, 1=several days, 2=more than half the days, 3=nearly every day. Scores have been normalized via Blom transformation and computed to T-score metric (mean=50, standard deviation = 10, minimum = 0, maximum = 100, higher = worse)</description>

            <description>Eight weekly group brain health sessions lasting 90-120 minutes. The intervention is psychoeducational, and each week presents information from NIH regarding factors that may promote cognitive health in late life (e.g., sleep, physical activity, social engagement and leisure, cognitive training). Weekly sessions are supplemented with educational videos and group discussion. Weekly homework consists of readings about brain health.
Participants in both interventions receive all study measures equivalently at all occasions</description>

            <title>Mindfulness-inspired Treatment/Testing</title>
            <description>Eight weekly group mindfulness sessions lasting 90-120 minutes, along with a ½ day Mindfulness Retreat at the end of the training period, will include 1) psychoeducation, 2) formal exercises in the form of guided practice mentioned above, and 3) thoughtful exploration of ideas and questions. Formal mindfulness training will follow 21 guided pre-recorded meditative Moving Picture Experts Group Layer-3 Audio (MP3) tracks from the authors for use in class and at home, promoting both fidelity to the model and uniformity in intervention across training groups. Mindfulness activities in the protocol include mindful breathing, eating, walking, and various other practices well documented in the literature to promote mindfulness. Participants will be asked to practice mindfulness on their own time, and to log this.
Participants receive all of the same measures as the active comparator &quot;Brain Health&quot; condition in Weeks 1-14. In weeks 4-11, participants receive Mindfulness Inspired Treatment</description>

        <title>Self-ratings on Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale (CAMSr) Over 14 Weekly Measurements</title>
        <description>Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale (CAMSr) will be computer administered. It is a psychological measurement to explore mindfulness. Each week ten items are rated on a 4-point Likert-type scale (1=rarely/never, 2=sometimes, 3=often, 4=almost always). Higher scores indicate greater cognitive and emotional focus. Scores are the average of the ten items, normalized and converted to T-score (mean=50, standard deviation = 10, minimum = 0, maximum = 100, higher = better) metric.</description>

            <description>Eight weekly group brain health sessions lasting 90-120 minutes. The intervention is psychoeducational, and each week presents information from NIH regarding factors that may promote cognitive health in late life (e.g., sleep, physical activity, social engagement and leisure, cognitive training). Weekly sessions are supplemented with educational videos and group discussion. Weekly homework consists of readings about brain health.
Participants in both interventions receive all study measures equivalently at all occasions</description>

            <title>Mindfulness-inspired Treatment/Testing</title>
            <description>Eight weekly group mindfulness sessions lasting 90-120 minutes, along with a ½ day Mindfulness Retreat at the end of the training period, will include 1) psychoeducation, 2) formal exercises in the form of guided practice mentioned above, and 3) thoughtful exploration of ideas and questions. Formal mindfulness training will follow 21 guided pre-recorded meditative Moving Picture Experts Group Layer-3 Audio (MP3) tracks from the authors for use in class and at home, promoting both fidelity to the model and uniformity in intervention across training groups. Mindfulness activities in the protocol include mindful breathing, eating, walking, and various other practices well documented in the literature to promote mindfulness. Participants will be asked to practice mindfulness on their own time, and to log this.
Participants receive all of the same measures as the active comparator &quot;Brain Health&quot; condition in Weeks 1-14. In weeks 4-11, participants receive Mindfulness Inspired Treatment</description>

          <title>Brain Health</title>
          <description>Eight weekly group brain health sessions lasting 90-120 minutes. The intervention is psychoeducational, and each week presents information from NIH regarding factors that may promote cognitive health in late life (e.g., sleep, physical activity, social engagement and leisure, cognitive training). Weekly sessions are supplemented with educational videos and group discussion. Weekly homework consists of readings about brain health.
Participants in both interventions receive all study measures equivalently at all occasions</description>

          <title>Mindfulness-inspired Treatment/Testing</title>
          <description>Eight weekly group mindfulness sessions lasting 90-120 minutes, along with a ½ day Mindfulness Retreat at the end of the training period, will include 1) psychoeducation, 2) formal exercises in the form of guided practice mentioned above, and 3) thoughtful exploration of ideas and questions. Formal mindfulness training will follow 21 guided pre-recorded meditative Moving Picture Experts Group Layer-3 Audio (MP3) tracks from the authors for use in class and at home, promoting both fidelity to the model and uniformity in intervention across training groups. Mindfulness activities in the protocol include mindful breathing, eating, walking, and various other practices well documented in the literature to promote mindfulness. Participants will be asked to practice mindfulness on their own time, and to log this.
Participants receive all of the same measures as the active comparator &quot;Brain Health&quot; condition in Weeks 1-14. In weeks 4-11, participants receive Mindfulness Inspired Treatment</description>
