  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently the standard treatment of muscle invasive bladder cancer is the complete removal of
      bladder and adjacent organs, such as prostate or ovaries. Radical cystectomy is fraught with
      complications and risk of death. The researchers hope to learn if chemoradiation (i.e. using
      chemotherapy and radiation), also an acceptable treatment for muscle invasive bladder cancer,
      can be used a good alternative therapy option.

      Currently the standard treatment of muscle invasive bladder cancer is the complete removal of
      bladder and adjacent organs, such as prostate or ovaries. Such procedure is highly invasive
      and undesirable for some patients.

      The researchers hope to learn if chemoradiation, using chemotherapy and radiation, can be a
      good alternative therapy option. Chemoradiation therapy is also currently considered an
      acceptable clinical approach but is typically used for treatment in patients with muscle
      invasive bladder cancer who have other medical issues that might cause complications during
      or after undergoing surgery. Disease free survival at 5 years is better for those who had
      their bladder removed, but overall survival rates for chemoradiation therapy patients are
      comparable between the two approaches.

    <description>In brief, radical cystectomy is the removal of the entire bladder, nearby lymph nodes (lymphadenectomy), part of the urethra, and nearby organs that may contain cancer cells. In men the prostate, the seminal vesicles, and part of the vas deferens are also removed. In women the cervix, the uterus, the ovaries, the fallopian tubes, and part of the vagina are also removed. Participants in this group may also undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to the surgery. The decision for specific chemotherapy regimen is based on numerous variables such as participant's comorbidities, Glomerular Filtration rate (GFR), participant's preference, and availability of chemotherapeutic regimen.</description>

    <description>Those randomized to this group will undergo systematic chemotherapy and radiation. In brief, participants will receive 33-36 daily fractions of radiation therapy 5 days a week.

             (transitional cell cancer) within 8 weeks of registration. Operable patients whose
             tumors are primary carcinomas of the bladder and exhibit histologic evidence of
             muscularis propria invasion and are AJCC clinical stages T2-T4a, Nx or N0, M0

          -  If radiologic evaluation of a lymph node is interpreted as &quot;positive&quot;, this must be

             tumor as is judged safely possible.

          -  Patients must be considered able to tolerate systemic chemotherapy combined with
             pelvic radiation therapy, and a radical cystectomy by the joint agreement of the
             participating Urologist, Radiation Oncologist, and Medical Oncologist.

             clearance of 60 ml/min or greater no more than 4 weeks prior to registration; Note:
             Calculated creatinine clearance is permissible. If the creatinine clearance is &gt; 60
             ml/min, then a serum creatinine of up to 1.8 mg% is allowable at the discretion of the
             principle investigator;

          -  Serum pregnancy test for female patients of childbearing potential, â‰¤ 72 hours prior

          -  Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) based upon current CDC definition;
             note,however, that HIV testing is not required for entry into this protocol. The need
             to exclude patients with AIDS from this protocol is necessary because the treatments
             involved in this protocol may be significantly immunosuppressive. Protocol-specific
             requirements may also exclude immuno-compromised patients.

          -  Pregnancy or women of childbearing potential and men who are sexually active and not
             willing/able to use medically acceptable forms of contraception; this exclusion is

             teratogenic.

          -  Is pregnant; women of childbearing potential and male participants unwilling to
             practice adequate contraception.

            <description>In brief, radical cystectomy is the removal of the entire bladder, nearby lymph nodes (lymphadenectomy), part of the urethra, and nearby organs that may contain cancer cells. In men the prostate, the seminal vesicles, and part of the vas deferens are also removed. In women the cervix, the uterus, the ovaries, the fallopian tubes, and part of the vagina are also removed. Participants in this group may also undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to the surgery. The decision for specific chemotherapy regimen is based on numerous variables such as participant's comorbidities, GFR, participant's preference, and availability of chemotherapeutic regimen.

Concurrently, radiosensitizing chemotherapy involves either cisplatin plus 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or mitomycin C (MMC) plus 5-FU. Other concurrent chemotherapy regimens utilized include paclitaxel and gemcitabine.

Concurrently, radiosensitizing chemotherapy involves either cisplatin plus 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or mitomycin C (MMC) plus 5-FU. Other concurrent chemotherapy regimens utilized include paclitaxel and gemcitabine. The decision for specific chemotherapy regimen is based on numerous variables such as participant's comorbidities, GFR, participant's preference, availability of chemotherapeutic regimen.

            <title>Surgery (Radical Cystectomy)</title>
            <description>In brief, radical cystectomy is the removal of the entire bladder, nearby lymph nodes (lymphadenectomy), part of the urethra, and nearby organs that may contain cancer cells. In men the prostate, the seminal vesicles, and part of the vas deferens are also removed. In women the cervix, the uterus, the ovaries, the fallopian tubes, and part of the vagina are also removed. Participants in this group may also undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to the surgery. The decision for specific chemotherapy regimen is based on numerous variables such as participant's comorbidities, GFR, participant's preference, and availability of chemotherapeutic regimen.
