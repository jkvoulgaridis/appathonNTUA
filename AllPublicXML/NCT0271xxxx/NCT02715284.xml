  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label, first-in-human Phase 1 study evaluating the
      anti-programmed death receptor 1 (anti-PD-1) antibody dostarlimab (also known as TSR-042) n
      participants with advanced solid tumors who have limited available treatment options. The
      study will be conducted in 2 parts with Part 1 consisting of safety evaluation,
      pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PDy) of escalating doses of dostarlimab. Dose
      escalation will be based on ascending weight-based dose levels (DLs) of dostarlimab and will
      continue until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is reached or may be stopped at any dose
      level up to the highest dose of 20 milligrams per kilograms (mg/kg) based on emerging safety
      and PK/PDy data. Part 2 will be conducted in two subparts, Part 2A (fixed-dose safety
      evaluation cohorts) and Part 2B (expansion cohorts). Part 2A of the study will evaluate the
      safety and tolerability of dostarlimab at fixed doses of 500 mg administered every 3 weeks
      (Q3W) and 1000 mg administered every 6 weeks (Q6W). Part 2B of the study will examine the
      safety and clinical activity of dostarlimab in cohorts of participants with specific types of
      advanced solid tumors.

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence that occurs in a participant or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product, and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational product, whether or not considered related to the product. TEAEs defined as any AE either reported for the first time or worsening of a pre-existing event after first dose of study treatment.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant is at least 18 years of age.

          -  Participant has proven recurrent or advanced solid tumor and has disease progression
             after treatment with available anti cancer therapies, or is intolerant to treatment
             that meets the following requirements for the part of the study they will participate
             in:

          -  a. Part 1: Any histologically or cytologically proven recurrent advanced solid tumor

          -  b. Part 2A: : Any histologically or cytologically proven recurrent advanced solid
             tumor

          -  c. Part 2B: Histologically of cytologically proven recurrent or advanced solid tumor
             with measurable lesion(s) per RECIST version 1.1 and meets one of the following
             disease types:

          -  The criteria below should be met for participant participating in:

          -  Cohort A1 (dMMR/MSI-H endometrial cancer) and

          -  Cohort A2 (MMR-proficient/MSS endometrial cancer)

          -  Participants who have progressed on or after platinum doublet therapy

          -  Participants have received no more than 2 lines of anti-cancer therapy for recurrent
             or advanced (&gt;=Stage IIIB) disease. Prior treatment with hormone therapies is
             acceptable and does not count towards the number of anti-cancer therapies noted in the
             criterion above for this cohort.

          -  All endometrial cancer histologies are allowed except endometrial sarcoma (including
             carcinosarcoma).

          -  Participants must submit 2 scans demonstrating increase in tumor measurement that meet
             criteria for PD on or after the latest systemic anti-cancer therapy based on RECIST
             1.1 to Central Radiology prior to the first dose of dostarlimab.

          -  Presence of at least 1 measurable lesion on Baseline scan will be confirmed by central
             radiology review.

          -  Status of tumor MMR/MSI: Participants can be screened based on local MMR/MSI testing
             results using immunohistochemistry (IHC), polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or next
             generation sequencing (NGS) performed in a certified local laboratory, but participant
             eligibility needs to be determined by MMR IHC results. For participant with available
             local MMR IHC results for the respective cohort(s), tumor samples have to be submitted
             to a central IHC laboratory and its quality has to be checked and cleared prior to
             Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1). For participants without available local MMR IHC test results
             (participants with local PCR or NGS test results), central IHC results have to confirm
             eligibility prior to proceeding with other screening procedures. After the central IHC
             test is completed, remaining tumor tissue may be tested for further exploratory
             biomarkers or may be sent to a central NGS laboratory for further testing.

          -  Cohort E - Participants with NSCLC who progressed after at least 1 prior
             platinum-based systemic chemotherapy regimen for recurrent or advanced disease.

          -  Chemotherapy regimen in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant setting following surgery and/or
             radiation is acceptable if recurrent or advanced disease develops within 6 months from
             completion of therapy.

          -  Participants with a known epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation must have
             received a chemotherapy regimen and an EGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI) (e.g.,
             erlotinib, gefitinib, afatinib, or experimental)

          -  Participants with a known anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) translocation must have
             received a chemotherapy regimen and an ALK inhibitor (e.g., crizotinib, ceritinib or
             experimental)

          -  Cohort F - Participants with recurrent or advanced dMMR/MSI-H solid tumors or POLE-mut
             solid tumors, except endometrial cancers, that have progressed following up to 2 prior
             lines of systemic therapy for recurrent or advanced (&gt;=Stage IIIB) disease and who
             have no alternative treatment options. Prior treatment with hormone therapies alone
             given for recurrent or advanced disease is acceptable and does not count towards the
             number of anti-cancer therapies.

          -  dMMR/MSI-H colorectal cancer (CRC) participants must have progressed after or been
             intolerant to treatment with fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan.
             Progression following up to 3 prior lines of therapy is allowed.

          -  Ovarian cancer participants with platinum-resistant disease (i.e., progression
             occurred &lt;6 months on or after platinum doublet chemotherapy): receipt of up to 1 line
             of systemic therapy after becoming platinum-resistant is allowed.

          -  Participants must submit 2 scans demonstrating increase in tumor measurement that meet
             criteria for PD based on RECIST 1.1 to Central Radiology prior to the first dose of
             dostarlimab.

          -  Tumor MMR/MSI or POLE status: Participants can be screened based on local MMR/MSI
             testing results using immunohistochemistry (IHC), polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or
             next generation sequencing (NGS) performed in a certified local laboratory, but
             participant eligibility needs to be determined by MMR IHC results. For participants
             with available local MMR IHC results for the respective cohort(s), tumor samples have
             to be submitted to a central IHC laboratory and its quality has to be checked and
             cleared prior to C1D1. For participants without available local MMR IHC test results
             (participants with local PCR or NGS test results), central IHC results have to confirm
             eligibility prior to proceeding with other screening procedures. After the central IHC
             test is completed, remaining tumor tissue may be tested for further exploratory
             biomarkers or may be sent to a central NGS laboratory for further testing.

          -  Participants who are considered for the study based on POLE mutation must have the
             local results available showing tumor mutation(s) in the exonuclease domain of the
             POLE gene (amino acid residues 268-471) to begin screening. Participants must have the
             quality of submitted tumor samples checked and cleared by a central IHC laboratory
             prior to receiving study treatment.

          -  Cohort G: Participants must have recurrent high-grade serous, endometrioid, or clear
             cell ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.

          -  Participants must have presence of at least 1 measurable lesion on Baseline scan that
             will be confirmed by central radiology review.

          -  Participants must be considered resistant to the last administered platinum therapy,
             that is, the time from the last administered platinum dose until the initial
             documented progression (as evidenced by radiographic progression per RECIST) must be
             less than 6 months.

          -  Participants must have completed at least 1 but no more than 3 prior lines of therapy
             for advanced or metastatic ovarian cancer. Neoadjuvant, adjuvant, and the combination
             of both will be considered as 1 line of therapy. Treatment with single-agent
             bevacizumab given as maintenance is not counted as a separate line of therapy. If a
             therapeutic regimen is modified or changed for a reason other than lack of response or
             PD (such as allergic reaction, toxicity, or drug availability), this is not counted as
             a separate line of therapy. The use of single-agent hormonal therapy given for reasons
             other than PD per RECIST v1.1 (i.e., hormonal therapy given for increasing Cancer
             antigen [CA]-125 levels) is not counted as a separate line of therapy.

          -  Participants must have been previously treated with platinum-based regimen, taxane
             agent(s), and bevacizumab (bevacizumab could be used as a single agent or in
             combination with another agent, in frontline therapy, as maintenance, or for treatment
             of recurrent disease).

          -  Part 2B: Participants must have archival tumor tissue available that is formalin-fixed
             and paraffin-embedded.

          -  For participants who do not have archival tissue, a new biopsy must be performed to
             obtain a tissue sample prior to study treatment initiation. For participants without
             available archival tissue, the biopsy should be taken from the tumor lesions (either
             primary or metastatic) that have easy accessibility and low biopsy-associated risks
             and will exclude biopsies of the liver, brain, lung/mediastinum, pancreas, or
             endoscopic procedures extending beyond the esophagus, stomach or bowel.

          -  For Cohort G, participant must provide formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumor
             tissue block(s) with sufficient tumor content (as confirmed by the Sponsor's
             designated central laboratory) during screening to enable, for example, measures of
             homologous recombination pathway defects and PD-L1 status. The use of slides created
             from paraffin-embedded tissue as opposed to FFPE blocks must be approved by the
             Sponsor.

          -  Female participants must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to
             the date of the first dose of study medication: unless they are of non-child bearing
             potential.

          -  Non child bearing potential is defined as: &gt;= 45 years of age and has not had menses
             for &gt; 1 year; Amenorrheic for &lt; 2 years without a hysterectomy and oophorectomy and
             have a follicle- stimulating hormone (FSH) value in the postmenopausal range upon
             pre-study (screening) evaluation. Post-hysterectomy, post-bilateral oophorectomy, or
             post-tubal ligation. Documented hysterectomy or oophorectomy must be confirmed with
             medical records of the actual procedure or confirmed by an ultrasound, magnetic
             resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scan. Tubal ligation must be
             confirmed with medical records of the actual procedure.

          -  Female participants of childbearing potential must agree to use 1 highly effective
             form of contraception with their partner starting with the screening visit through 150
             days after the last dose of study therapy.

          -  Participant has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of &lt;=
             2 for Part 1 and &lt;= 1 for Part 2.

          -  Participant has an adequate organ function.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Participant has received prior therapy with an anti- programmed death receptor 1

             agent.

          -  Participant has a known uncontrolled central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or
             carcinomatous meningitis.

          -  Participant has a known additional malignancy that progressed or required active
             treatment within the last 2 years. Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the
             skin, squamous cell cancer (SqCC) of the skin that has undergone potentially curative
             therapy, or in situ cervical cancer.

          -  Participant is considered a poor medical risk due to a serious, uncontrolled medical
             disorder, nonmalignant systemic disease or active infection requiring systemic
             therapy. Specific examples include, but are not limited to, active, non-infectious
             pneumonitis; uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia; recent (within 90 days) myocardial
             infarction; uncontrolled major seizure disorder; unstable spinal cord compression;
             superior vena cava syndrome; or any psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that
             would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the study (including
             obtaining informed consent).

          -  Participant is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive children within the
             projected duration of the study, starting with the Screening Visit through 150 days
