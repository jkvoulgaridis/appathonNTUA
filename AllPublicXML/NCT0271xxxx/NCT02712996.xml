  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate whether Vyvanse, a psychostimulant, can
      help children ages 6-16 with attention deficits due to traumatic brain injury (TBI). Vyvanse
      is currently approved for the treatment of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity (ADHD). The exact
      effects this drug may have on adults with attention deficits caused by TBI have been
      investigated prior. The exact effects this drug may have on children with attention deficits
      caused by TBI are not known, but the investigators expect that Vyvanse will be of some help
      in treating this population as well.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Symptoms of inattentiveness, impulsivity, and poor persistence have been observed in children
      following traumatic brain injury (TBI). These often are among the most prominent symptoms
      manifested and may contribute to interference in a variety of other functional domains.
      Although there has been some use of psychostimulant medication to treat TBI-acquired
      attention deficits, it remains a relatively uncommon clinical practice. This study, by
      highlighting mechanisms of action, could serve to promote the appropriate use of this type of
      treatment for the patients.

    <measure>Assessing Severity of Symptoms Associated With Attention-deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in Children When Using Vyvanse Versus Placebo by Administering the Conners-3 Parent Form</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Conners-3 Parent Form is used to obtain the parent's observations about behavior in their child aged 6 to 18 years old. Parents rate the child's behavior on 45 items as not true at all (0) to very much true (3). The lowest scale score is 0 (better behavior) and the highest is 135 (worse behavior). The Conners 3-P includes content Scales of Inattention, Hyperactivity/Impulsivity, Learning Problems, Executive Functioning, Aggression, and Peer/Family Relations. Inattention scale was reported as the Primary Outcome. All scores were converted to z-scores (M=0, SD=+/-1).</description>

    <measure>Assessing Executive Functioning in Children When Using Vyvanse Versus Placebo by Administering the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) - PARENT</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The BRIEF Parent Questionnaire is a validated 86-item questionnaire composed of 8 clinical scales that measure different aspects of executive functioning (Initiate, Working Memory, Plan/Organize, Organization of Materials, Monitor, Inhibit, Shift, Emotional Control). For each item, parents rate whether the child engages in the behavior &quot;never&quot; (=1), &quot;sometimes&quot; (=2), or &quot;often&quot; (=3). The lowest scale score is 86 (better performance) and the highest is 258 (worse performance). The clinical scales form two broader Indexes (Behavioral Regulation and Metacognition) and an overall score, the Global Executive Composite (GEC). GEC was reported as the Primary Outcome. Raw scores were converted to z-scores (M=0, SD=+/-1).</description>

    <measure>Assessing Inattentiveness in Children Using Vyvanse Versus Placebo by Measuring Omissions on the Conners Continuous Performance Task (CPT-II).</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Conner's Continuous Performance Task (CPT-II) measures sustained attention and response inhibition. During the CPT-II, letters were presented serially on a screen in a random order. All letters were considered target stimuli, except for the letter 'X' which is a non-target stimulus. Participants responded to target stimuli by pressing the space bar of a computer keyboard (90% of the stimuli) while withholding responses to non-target stimuli (10% of the test). Omission errors represented the number of times a participant fails to respond to target letters (all other than 'X'). Raw scores were converted to z-scores (M=0, SD=+/-1). Higher scores indicate greater inattentiveness.</description>

    <measure>Assessing Physical Symptoms in Children Using Vyvanse Versus Placebo by Measuring Anxiety on the Revised Child Manifest Anxiety Scale (RCMAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>RCMAS is a self-report, 37-item questionnaire in which children agree (yes = 1) or disagree (no =0) to statements about themselves. A Total Anxiety score is computed based on 28 items, which are divided into 3 anxiety subscales: physiological anxiety (10 items), worry/oversensitivity (11 items), and social concerns/concentration (7 items). The remaining nine items on the RCMAS constitute the Lie (social desirability) subscale. The lowest scale score is 0 and the highest is 37. Raw scores were converted to z-scores (M=0, SD=+/-1). Because scores are derived from affirmative responses, a high score indicates a high level of anxiety or lie on that subscale.</description>

    <description>Conner's Continuous Performance Task (CPT-II) measure sustained attention and response inhibition. During the CPT-II, letters were presented serially on a screen in a random order. All letters were considered target stimuli, except for the letter 'X' which is a non-target stimulus. Participants responded to target stimuli by pressing the space bar of a computer keyboard (90% of the stimuli) while withholding responses to non-target stimuli (10% of the test). Raw scores were converted to z-scores (M=0, SD=+/-1). Hit Reaction Time (RT) Standard Error (SE) measures response speed consistency. The higher the Overall Standard Error, the greater the inconsistency in the response speed, indicating a greater amount of inattention.</description>

All letters were considered target stimuli, except for the letter 'X' which is a non-target stimulus. Participants responded to target stimuli by pressing the space bar of a computer keyboard (90% of the stimuli) while withholding responses to non-target stimuli (10% of the test). CPT-II Hit Reaction Time (RT) Inter-Stimulus Interval (ISI) Change assesses the ability to adapt to changing inter-stimulus intervals. Inter-stimulus intervals refers to the amount of time between presentation of stimuli. High t-scores indicate that RT increased as the ISI increased; negative values indicate that RT decreased as the ISI increased.
Less Hit RT ISI Change indicates less variability in RT depending on the speed of presentation.</description>

Participants responded to target stimuli by pressing the space bar of a computer keyboard (90% of the stimuli) while withholding responses to non-target stimuli (10% of the test). CPT-II Perseverations represent responses in which reaction time was less than 100 ms; these responses are assumed to be anticipatory, random, or slow/inattentive (i.e., carried over from the previous response) because it is physiologically impossible to respond accurately in so short a time. Raw scores were converted to z-scores (M=0, SD=+/-1) to have them on a uniform metric. Higher scores indicate greater inattentiveness.</description>

        <title>Assessing Severity of Symptoms Associated With Attention-deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in Children When Using Vyvanse Versus Placebo by Administering the Conners-3 Parent Form</title>
        <description>The Conners-3 Parent Form is used to obtain the parent's observations about behavior in their child aged 6 to 18 years old. Parents rate the child's behavior on 45 items as not true at all (0) to very much true (3). The lowest scale score is 0 (better behavior) and the highest is 135 (worse behavior). The Conners 3-P includes content Scales of Inattention, Hyperactivity/Impulsivity, Learning Problems, Executive Functioning, Aggression, and Peer/Family Relations. Inattention scale was reported as the Primary Outcome. All scores were converted to z-scores (M=0, SD=+/-1).</description>

        <title>Assessing Executive Functioning in Children When Using Vyvanse Versus Placebo by Administering the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) - PARENT</title>
        <description>The BRIEF Parent Questionnaire is a validated 86-item questionnaire composed of 8 clinical scales that measure different aspects of executive functioning (Initiate, Working Memory, Plan/Organize, Organization of Materials, Monitor, Inhibit, Shift, Emotional Control). For each item, parents rate whether the child engages in the behavior &quot;never&quot; (=1), &quot;sometimes&quot; (=2), or &quot;often&quot; (=3). The lowest scale score is 86 (better performance) and the highest is 258 (worse performance). The clinical scales form two broader Indexes (Behavioral Regulation and Metacognition) and an overall score, the Global Executive Composite (GEC). GEC was reported as the Primary Outcome.

        <description>Conner's Continuous Performance Task (CPT-II) measures sustained attention and response inhibition. During the CPT-II, letters were presented serially on a screen in a random order. All letters were considered target stimuli, except for the letter 'X' which is a non-target stimulus. Participants responded to target stimuli by pressing the space bar of a computer keyboard (90% of the stimuli) while withholding responses to non-target stimuli (10% of the test). Omission errors represented the number of times a participant fails to respond to target letters (all other than 'X'). Raw scores were converted to z-scores (M=0, SD=+/-1). Higher scores indicate greater inattentiveness.</description>

        <title>Assessing Physical Symptoms in Children Using Vyvanse Versus Placebo by Measuring Anxiety on the Revised Child Manifest Anxiety Scale (RCMAS)</title>
        <description>RCMAS is a self-report, 37-item questionnaire in which children agree (yes = 1) or disagree (no =0) to statements about themselves. A Total Anxiety score is computed based on 28 items, which are divided into 3 anxiety subscales: physiological anxiety (10 items), worry/oversensitivity (11 items), and social concerns/concentration (7 items). The remaining nine items on the RCMAS constitute the Lie (social desirability) subscale. The lowest scale score is 0 and the highest is 37. Raw scores were converted to z-scores (M=0, SD=+/-1). Because scores are derived from affirmative responses, a high score indicates a high level of anxiety or lie on that subscale.</description>

        <description>The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) is a widely used caregiver report form identifying problem behavior in children. The patient is rated on 113 items scored on a 3-point Likert scale (0=not true; 1=somewhat/sometimes true; 2=very true/often true). CBCL consists of eight empirically-based syndrome subscales. The range of subscale scores (summed) are: Aggressive Behavior (0-36), Anxious/Depressed (0-26), Attention Problems (0-20), Rule-Breaking Behavior (0-34), Somatic Complaints (0-22), Social Problems (0-22), Thought Problems (0-30), and Withdrawn/Depressed (0-16). Raw scores were converted to z-scores (M=0, SD=+/-1). Higher scores indicate more severe symptoms.</description>

        <description>The BRIEF Parent Questionnaire is a validated 86-item questionnaire composed of 8 clinical scales that measure different aspects of executive functioning (Initiate, Working Memory, Plan/Organize, Organization of Materials, Monitor, Inhibit, Shift, Emotional Control). For each item, parents rate whether the child engages in the behavior &quot;never&quot; (=1), &quot;sometimes&quot; (=2), or &quot;often&quot; (=3). The lowest scale score is 86 (better performance) and the highest is 258 (worse performance). The clinical scales form two broader Indexes (Behavioral Regulation and Metacognition) and an overall score, the Global Executive Composite (GEC). Inhibit was reported as the Primary Outcome.

For each item, parents rate whether the child engages in the behavior &quot;never&quot; (=1), &quot;sometimes&quot; (=2), or &quot;often&quot; (=3). The lowest scale score is 86 (better performance) and the highest is 258 (worse performance). The clinical scales form two broader Indexes (Behavioral Regulation and Metacognition) and an overall score, the Global Executive Composite (GEC). Monitor was reported as the Primary Outcome. Raw scores were converted to z-scores (M=0, SD=+/-1).</description>

        <title>Assessing Executive Functioning in Children When Using Vyvanse Versus Placebo by Administering the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) - CHILD SELF REPORT</title>
        <description>The BRIEF Self-Report Version assesses an adolescent's (ages 11-18) view of his or her cognitive, emotional, and behavioral functions. It is a validated 55-item questionnaire composed of 8 clinical scales that measure different aspects of executive functioning (Inhibit, Shift, Emotional Control, Monitor, Working Memory, Plan/Organize, Organization of Materials, and Task Completion). For each item, the child rates whether they engage in the behavior &quot;never&quot; (=1), &quot;sometimes&quot; (=2), or &quot;often&quot; (=3). The lowest scale score is 55 (better performance) and the highest is 165 (worse performance). The clinical scales form two broader Indexes (Behavioral Regulation and Metacognition) and an overall score, the Global Executive Composite (GEC). GEC was reported as the Primary Outcome. Raw scores were converted to z-scores (M=0, SD=+/-1).</description>

        <description>Digit Span repeats strings of digits of increasing length said by the examiner. Participants were asked to repeat the digits in the same sequence, either forwards or backwards. Every item on Digit Span consists of two trials. One point was awarded if the participant passed only 1 trial of a sequence length. Zero points were given if the participant failed both trials. It measures working memory and concentration with a range of scaled scores from 0-19. Raw scores were converted to z-scores (M=0, SD=+/-1). Higher scores indicate better recall and attention.</description>

        <description>Conner's Continuous Performance Task (CPT-II) measure sustained attention and response inhibition. During the CPT-II, letters were presented serially on a screen in a random order. All letters were considered target stimuli, except for the letter 'X' which is a non-target stimulus. Participants responded to target stimuli by pressing the space bar of a computer keyboard (90% of the stimuli) while withholding responses to non-target stimuli (10% of the test). Raw scores were converted to z-scores (M=0, SD=+/-1). Hit Reaction Time (RT) Standard Error (SE) measures response speed consistency. The higher the Overall Standard Error, the greater the inconsistency in the response speed, indicating a greater amount of inattention.</description>

        <title>Assessing Sustained Attention and Response Inhibition in Children Using Vyvanse Versus Placebo by Measuring RT Inter-Stimulus Interval (ISI) on the Conners Continuous Performance Task (CPT-II).</title>

Participants responded to target stimuli by pressing the space bar of a computer keyboard (90% of the stimuli) while withholding responses to non-target stimuli (10% of the test). CPT-II Hit Reaction Time (RT) Inter-Stimulus Interval (ISI) Change assesses the ability to adapt to changing inter-stimulus intervals. Inter-stimulus intervals refers to the amount of time between presentation of stimuli. High t-scores indicate that RT increased as the ISI increased; negative values indicate that RT decreased as the ISI increased.
Less Hit RT ISI Change indicates less variability in RT depending on the speed of presentation.</description>

Participants responded to target stimuli by pressing the space bar of a computer keyboard (90% of the stimuli) while withholding responses to non-target stimuli (10% of the test). CPT-II Perseverations represent responses in which reaction time was less than 100 ms; these responses are assumed to be anticipatory, random, or slow/inattentive (i.e., carried over from the previous response) because it is physiologically impossible to respond accurately in so short a time. Raw scores were converted to z-scores (M=0, SD=+/-1) to have them on a uniform metric. Higher scores indicate greater inattentiveness.</description>
