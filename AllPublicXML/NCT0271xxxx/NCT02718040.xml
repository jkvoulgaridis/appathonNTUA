    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Seeking correction of bilateral NLFs: severe (i.e., bilateral WSRS = 3-4) or moderate
             (i.e., bilateral WSRS = 2-3) AND bilateral MLs: severe (i.e., WAS = 3-4) or moderate
             (i.e., WAS = 2-3).

          2. Subjects of childbearing potential who agree to use medically accepted methods of
             contraception during the study and for 30 days following study completion.

          3. Intent to undergo optimal correction of bilateral NLFs and MLs. Optimal correction is
             defined as the best possible aesthetic outcome as agreed to by the treating
             investigator and subject.

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject who presents with a severity of wrinkles or folds that require other
             treatments, e.g. laser treatment, chemical peeling, to achieve optimal correction.

          2. Previous facial surgery, including aesthetic facial surgical therapy, liposuction or
             tattoo, in the treatment area.

          3. Previous tissue augmenting therapy or contouring with permanent or non-permanent
             filler or fat-injection in the facial area.

          4. Previous tissue revitalization treatment with neurotoxin in the facial area within 6
             months before treatment.

          5. Known/previous allergy or hypersensitivity to any injectable hyaluronic acid (HA) gel.

          6. Known/previous allergy or hypersensitivity to local anaesthetics, e.g. lidocaine or
             other amide-type anaesthetics.

          7. Known/previous allergy or hypersensitivity to gram-positive bacterial proteins.

          8. Any medical condition that, in the opinion of the treating investigator, would make
             the subject unsuitable for inclusion (e.g. a chronic, relapsing or hereditary disease
             that may interfere with the outcome of the study).

          9. Other condition preventing the subject from entering the study in the treating
             investigator's opinion, e.g. subjects not likely to avoid other facial cosmetic
             treatments, subjects anticipated to be unreliable, unavailable or incapable of
             understanding the study assessments or having unrealistic expectations of the
             treatment result.

          <description>Wrinkle severity assessed by treating investigator at Day 15/Touch and Day 42 using the Wrinkle Assessment Scale (WAS). Assessments of both MLs were graded according the following responses: 0-no wrinkles, 1-just perceptible wrinkle, 2-shallow wrinkle, 3, moderately deep wrinkle, 4-deep wrinkle, well defined edges, 5-very deep wrinkle, redundant fold. WAS improvement from baseline included 1-grade improvement (reduction in WAS) from baseline.</description>
