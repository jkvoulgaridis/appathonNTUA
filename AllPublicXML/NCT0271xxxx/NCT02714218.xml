    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Drug-related Grade 3 - 5 Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>After first dose of study treatment and within 30 days of the last dose of study treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The drug-related Grade 3 - 5 AE rate was defined as number of participants who experienced at least 1 AE of Grade 3 or higher, judged to be related to study drug by the investigator, and with onset on or after the first dose of study treatment and within 30 days of the last dose of study treatment, divided by number of treated participants. AE grade was defined using National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 4.0 criteria</description>

    <measure>Objective Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>From date of randomization to date of objectively documented progression per RECIST 1.1 or the date of subsequent anti-cancer therapy, whichever occurs first (assessed up to April 2018, approximately 20 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The ORR was defined as the number of participants with a best overall response (BOR) of a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) divided by the number of treated participants for each arm. The BOR was defined as the best response designation, as determined by the Investigator, recorded between the date of randomization and the date of progression, as assessed by the Investigator per RECIST 1.1 or the date of subsequent anticancer therapy (including tumor-directed radiotherapy and tumor-directed surgery), whichever occurred first. For participants without evidence of RECIST 1.1 progression or subsequent anticancer therapy, all available response designations contributed to the BOR assessment. Tumor assessments are scheduled to be performed at Week 12 following randomization, every 8 weeks for the first 12 months and then every 12 weeks until disease progression</description>

    <measure>Overall Survival (OS) Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to October 2018, approximately 28 months</time_frame>
    <description>OS is defined as the time between the date of randomization and the date of death due to any cause. A participant who has not died will be censored at the last known alive date. OS will be followed continuously while participants are on the study drug and every 3 months via in-person or phone contact after participants discontinue the study drug</description>

    <description>OS is defined as the time between the date of randomization and the date of death due to any cause. The results here do not account for any censoring of the data. OS will be followed continuously while participants are on the study drug and every 3 months via in-person or phone contact after participants discontinue the study drug</description>

    <measure>Rate of Progression Free Survival (PFS) at 6 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time between the date of randomization and the first date of documented progression, as determined by the investigator, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Participants who die without a reported progression will be considered to have progressed on the date of their death. Particpants who did not progress or die will be censored on the date of their last evaluable tumor assessment. Participants who did not have any on study tumor assessments and did not die will be censored on their date of randomization. Participants who started anti-cancer therapy without a prior reported progression will be censored on the date of their last evaluable tumor assessment prior to the initiation of subsequent anti-cancer therapy</description>

    <time_frame>Weeks 7, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40</time_frame>
    <description>Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) was assessed using the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire. The EORTC QLQ-C30 comprises 6 functional scales (role function, physical functioning, cognitive functioning, emotional functioning, social functioning and global quality of life) as well as nine symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea/vomiting, dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties). With the exception of 2 items included in the global health/quality of life scale, for which responses range from 1 (Very poor) to 7 (Excellent), item responses range from 1 (Not at all) to 4 (Very much). Raw scores for the EORTC QLQ-C30 are transformed to a 0-100 metric such that higher scores for all functional scales and Global Health Status indicate better HRQoL; an increase from baseline indicates improvement in HRQoL compared to baseline.</description>

        <description>The ORR was defined as the number of participants with a best overall response (BOR) of a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) divided by the number of treated participants for each arm. The BOR was defined as the best response designation, as determined by the Investigator, recorded between the date of randomization and the date of progression, as assessed by the Investigator per RECIST 1.1 or the date of subsequent anticancer therapy (including tumor-directed radiotherapy and tumor-directed surgery), whichever occurred first. For participants without evidence of RECIST 1.1 progression or subsequent anticancer therapy, all available response designations contributed to the BOR assessment. Tumor assessments are scheduled to be performed at Week 12 following randomization, every 8 weeks for the first 12 months and then every 12 weeks until disease progression</description>

          <description>PFS is defined as the time between the date of randomization and the first date of documented progression, as determined by the investigator, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Participants who die without a reported progression will be considered to have progressed on the date of their death. Participants who did not progress or die will be censored on the date of their last evaluable tumor assessment. Participants who did not have any on study tumor assessments and did not die will be censored on their date of randomization. Participants who started anti-cancer therapy without a prior reported progression will be censored on the date of their last evaluable tumor assessment prior to the initiation of subsequent anti-cancer therapy</description>

        <title>Mean Changes From Baseline in the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC-QLQ-30) Physical Functioning Scale</title>
        <description>Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) was assessed using the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire. The EORTC QLQ-C30 comprises 6 functional scales (role function, physical functioning, cognitive functioning, emotional functioning, social functioning and global quality of life) as well as nine symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea/vomiting, dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties). With the exception of 2 items included in the global health/quality of life scale, for which responses range from 1 (Very poor) to 7 (Excellent), item responses range from 1 (Not at all) to 4 (Very much). Raw scores for the EORTC QLQ-C30 are transformed to a 0-100 metric such that higher scores for all functional scales and Global Health Status indicate better HRQoL; an increase from baseline indicates improvement in HRQoL compared to baseline.</description>

        <title>Mean Changes From Baseline in the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC-QLQ-30) Emotional Functioning Scale</title>
        <description>Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) was assessed using the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire. The EORTC QLQ-C30 comprises 6 functional scales (role function, physical functioning, cognitive functioning, emotional functioning, social functioning and global quality of life) as well as nine symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea/vomiting, dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties). With the exception of 2 items included in the global health/quality of life scale, for which responses range from 1 (Very poor) to 7 (Excellent), item responses range from 1 (Not at all) to 4 (Very much). Raw scores for the EORTC QLQ-C30 are transformed to a 0-100 metric such that higher scores for all functional scales and Global Health Status indicate better HRQoL; an increase from baseline indicates improvement in HRQoL compared to baseline.</description>

        <title>Mean Changes From Baseline in the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC-QLQ-30) Cognitive Functioning Scale</title>
        <description>Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) was assessed using the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire. The EORTC QLQ-C30 comprises 6 functional scales (role function, physical functioning, cognitive functioning, emotional functioning, social functioning and global quality of life) as well as nine symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea/vomiting, dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties). With the exception of 2 items included in the global health/quality of life scale, for which responses range from 1 (Very poor) to 7 (Excellent), item responses range from 1 (Not at all) to 4 (Very much). Raw scores for the EORTC QLQ-C30 are transformed to a 0-100 metric such that higher scores for all functional scales and Global Health Status indicate better HRQoL; an increase from baseline indicates improvement in HRQoL compared to baseline.</description>

        <title>Mean Changes From Baseline in the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC-QLQ-30) Global Health Status</title>
        <description>Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) was assessed using the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire. The EORTC QLQ-C30 comprises 6 functional scales (role function, physical functioning, cognitive functioning, emotional functioning, social functioning and global quality of life) as well as nine symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea/vomiting, dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties). With the exception of 2 items included in the global health/quality of life scale, for which responses range from 1 (Very poor) to 7 (Excellent), item responses range from 1 (Not at all) to 4 (Very much). Raw scores for the EORTC QLQ-C30 are transformed to a 0-100 metric such that higher scores for all functional scales and Global Health Status indicate better HRQoL; an increase from baseline indicates improvement in HRQoL compared to baseline.</description>

        <description>Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) was assessed using the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire. The Dyspnea sub-scale item responses range from 1 (Not at all) to 4 (Very much). Raw scores for the EORTC QLQ-C30 are transformed to a 0-100 metric such that higher scores indicate a higher level of symptoms;lower scores indicating lesser burden and improved symptoms or quality of life. A clinically meaningful change in score may be regarded as 10 points.</description>

        <title>Mean Changes From Baseline in the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC-QLQ-30) Appetite Loss</title>
        <description>Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) was assessed using the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire. The Appetite loss sub-scale item responses range from 1 (Not at all) to 4 (Very much). Raw scores for the EORTC QLQ-C30 are transformed to a 0-100 metric such that higher scores indicate a higher level of symptoms;lower scores indicating lesser burden and improved symptoms or quality of life. A clinically meaningful change in score may be regarded as 10 points.</description>

        <description>Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) was assessed using the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire. The Constipation sub-scale item responses range from 1 (Not at all) to 4 (Very much). Raw scores for the EORTC QLQ-C30 are transformed to a 0-100 metric such that higher scores indicate a higher level of symptoms;lower scores indicating lesser burden and improved symptoms or quality of life. A clinically meaningful change in score may be regarded as 10 points</description>

        <title>Mean Changes From Baseline in the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC-QLQ-30) Financial Difficulties</title>
        <description>Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) was assessed using the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire. The Financial difficulties sub-scale item responses range from 1 (Not at all) to 4 (Very much). Raw scores for the EORTC QLQ-C30 are transformed to a 0-100 metric such that higher scores indicate a higher level of symptoms;lower scores indicating lesser burden and improved symptoms or quality of life. A clinically meaningful change in score may be regarded as 10 points</description>

        <title>Mean Changes From Baseline in the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC-QLQ-30) Pain</title>
        <description>Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) was assessed using the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire. The Pain sub-scale item responses range from 1 (Not at all) to 4 (Very much). Raw scores for the EORTC QLQ-C30 are transformed to a 0-100 metric such that higher scores indicate a higher level of symptoms;lower scores indicating lesser burden and improved symptoms or quality of life. A clinically meaningful change in score may be regarded as 10 points</description>
