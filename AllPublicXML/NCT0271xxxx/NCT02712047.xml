  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For asthmatic subjects, a combination of inhaled corticosteroid (FF) and long-acting beta2
      receptor agonist (VI) is recommended for use (once daily) and fraction of exhaled nitric
      oxide (FeNO) is a non-invasive airway inflammation marker.

      In this randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled, two-period, crossover repeat dose
      study, the duration of action of fluticasone furoate (FF) will be determined by monitoring
      the return of FeNO levels to baseline, following the treatment with FF/vilanetrol (VI) in
      asthmatic subjects.

      Subjects who meet the eligibility criteria will participate in the following two treatment
      periods: FF/VI 100/25 mcg once-daily and placebo once-daily. Approximately 28 subjects will
      be enrolled in order to achieve 24 evaluable subjects. A 2-week treatment period will be
      followed by a 21-day monitoring/washout period before crossing over to the next treatment
      period. Total duration of each subject will be a maximum of 21 weeks. FeNO will be monitored
      up to 21 days after treatment with FF/VI together with FEV1 (up to 7 days).

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Fraction of Exhaled Nitric Oxide (FeNO) Over Time Following the Cessation of Repeat Dose Treatment With FF/VI</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to Day 29 in each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>FeNO is non-invasive marker of airway inflammation in asthma participants. It was measured by the participants, using Niox Vero device at AM (pre-dose) and PM on Day -7 and all way through Day 29 of each TP. The FeNO measurements were done over time following stop of repeat dose treatment with FF/VI. Change from Baseline was measured as ratio of post-dose visit value to Baseline value. Baseline was defined as Day 1(Pre-dose). Subject level Baseline defined as the mean of Baseline across periods for each participant. Period level Baseline defined as the difference between the Baseline and subject level Baseline for each period and each participant. Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X in the category titles). Summary of ratio from Baseline for exhaled nitric oxide reported as Geometric mean and Geometric coefficient of Variation. NA indicates data was not available.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in FeNO Over the FF/VI Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to Day 29 in each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>In participants with asthma the FeNO is a non-invasive marker of airway inflammation. The FeNO was measured by the participants AM (pre-dose) and PM on Day -7 and all the way through Day 29 of each treatment period. The measurements were recorded using Niox Vero device provided at the site. These FeNO measurements were done throughout the treatment period. Change from Baseline was measured by the value at post-dose visit minus the Baseline value. Baseline was defined as Day 1(Pre-dose). Subject level Baseline is defined as the mean of Baseline across periods for each participant. Period level Baseline is defined as the difference between the Baseline and subject level Baseline for each period and each participant. Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X in the category titles). NA indicates data was not available.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF) During Treatment and Following Cessation of Repeat Dose Treatment With FF/VI</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to Day 29 in TP1; Baseline and up to follow up (Day 29) in TP2</time_frame>
    <description>The PEF is a lung function evaluation assessed using a PEF meter. It was defined as the maximum amount of air exhaled during forced exhalation with lungs fully inflated. For PEF measurements the best of the 3 recordings were recorded AM and PM (i.e every 12 hours), from Day-7 through to Day 29 of TP1, and then from Day 1 of TP2 through to the (29). Change from Baseline was measured by the value at post-dose visit minus the Baseline value. Baseline was defined as Day 1(Pre-dose). Subject level Baseline is defined as the mean of Baseline across periods for each participant. Period level Baseline is defined as the difference between the Baseline and subject level Baseline for each period and each participant. Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X in the category titles). NA indicates data was not available.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1) Pre-treatment and for up to 7 Days After Cessation of Repeat Dose Treatment With FF/VI</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline every morning and evening until Day 21 of each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 is defined as the maximal amount of air which can be exhaled forcefully in one second. Three technically acceptable FEV1 measurements were made using a spirometer, and were measured on pre-dose on Day 1, taken pre-dose on Day 14 and every morning and evening until Day 19, and in the morning on Day 21. Change from Baseline was measured by the value at post-dose visit minus the Baseline value. Baseline was defined as Day 1(Pre-dose). Subject level Baseline is defined as the mean of Baseline across periods for each participant. Period level Baseline is defined as the difference between the Baseline and subject level Baseline for each period and each participant.</description>

          <description>In this two-period crossover study, participants received FF/VI 100/25 mcg or matching placebo through DPI once daily in each morning for 14 days either in TP 1 or TP 2 as per randomization schedule. There was a 21-days monitoring/washout period between two treatments during which participants were allowed to take rescue medication if required. Participants with any upper respiratory disorders including allergic rhinitis (both seasonal and perennial) and chronic rhinosinusitis (with or without nasal polyps), any participant who was on chronic maintenance therapies for these conditions were continued on their current standard of care medications (intranasal corticosteroids, antihistamines, cromones) throughout the entire duration of the study.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Fraction of Exhaled Nitric Oxide (FeNO) Over Time Following the Cessation of Repeat Dose Treatment With FF/VI</title>
        <description>FeNO is non-invasive marker of airway inflammation in asthma participants. It was measured by the participants, using Niox Vero device at AM (pre-dose) and PM on Day -7 and all way through Day 29 of each TP. The FeNO measurements were done over time following stop of repeat dose treatment with FF/VI. Change from Baseline was measured as ratio of post-dose visit value to Baseline value. Baseline was defined as Day 1(Pre-dose). Subject level Baseline defined as the mean of Baseline across periods for each participant. Period level Baseline defined as the difference between the Baseline and subject level Baseline for each period and each participant. Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X in the category titles). Summary of ratio from Baseline for exhaled nitric oxide reported as Geometric mean and Geometric coefficient of Variation. NA indicates data was not available.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in FeNO Over the FF/VI Treatment Period</title>
        <description>In participants with asthma the FeNO is a non-invasive marker of airway inflammation. The FeNO was measured by the participants AM (pre-dose) and PM on Day -7 and all the way through Day 29 of each treatment period. The measurements were recorded using Niox Vero device provided at the site. These FeNO measurements were done throughout the treatment period. Change from Baseline was measured by the value at post-dose visit minus the Baseline value. Baseline was defined as Day 1(Pre-dose). Subject level Baseline is defined as the mean of Baseline across periods for each participant. Period level Baseline is defined as the difference between the Baseline and subject level Baseline for each period and each participant. Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X in the category titles). NA indicates data was not available.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF) During Treatment and Following Cessation of Repeat Dose Treatment With FF/VI</title>
        <description>The PEF is a lung function evaluation assessed using a PEF meter. It was defined as the maximum amount of air exhaled during forced exhalation with lungs fully inflated. For PEF measurements the best of the 3 recordings were recorded AM and PM (i.e every 12 hours), from Day-7 through to Day 29 of TP1, and then from Day 1 of TP2 through to the (29). Change from Baseline was measured by the value at post-dose visit minus the Baseline value. Baseline was defined as Day 1(Pre-dose). Subject level Baseline is defined as the mean of Baseline across periods for each participant. Period level Baseline is defined as the difference between the Baseline and subject level Baseline for each period and each participant. Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X in the category titles). NA indicates data was not available.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1) Pre-treatment and for up to 7 Days After Cessation of Repeat Dose Treatment With FF/VI</title>
        <description>FEV1 is defined as the maximal amount of air which can be exhaled forcefully in one second. Three technically acceptable FEV1 measurements were made using a spirometer, and were measured on pre-dose on Day 1, taken pre-dose on Day 14 and every morning and evening until Day 19, and in the morning on Day 21. Change from Baseline was measured by the value at post-dose visit minus the Baseline value. Baseline was defined as Day 1(Pre-dose). Subject level Baseline is defined as the mean of Baseline across periods for each participant. Period level Baseline is defined as the difference between the Baseline and subject level Baseline for each period and each participant.</description>
