  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction will undergo 12 weeks of
      cardiac rehabilitation for exercise training (ET) and be randomized to either oral sodium
      nitrite capsules or oral placebo capsules through the training period. Study drug is
      administered 3 times daily during daytime hours with one of these doses being 30 minutes
      prior to onset of ET sessions throughout the12 week trial. The objective is to determine if
      the oral sodium nitrite improves the clinical responses and tolerability of ET.
