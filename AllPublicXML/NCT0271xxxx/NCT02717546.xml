    <textblock>
      The objective of this observational prospective study is to systematically document the
      clinical outcomes of Zimmer MotionLoc Screws for Periarticular Locking Plate System applied
      to distal tibia fracture treatment and confirm safety and performance of the screws.

      Primary Endpoint:

        -  Radiographic &amp; clinical fracture healing at 3 months post-surgery.

      Secondary Endpoints:

        -  Complications

        -  Radiologic &amp; clinical fracture healing at 6 weeks, 3, 6, and 12 months post-surgery.

        -  Callus size &amp; distribution at 6 weeks, 3, 6, and 12 months post-surgery.

      Radiologic fracture healing is defined as bridging of three of the four cortices as seen on
      x-ray/CT. Clinical healing will be assessed using the Function Index for Trauma (FIX-IT). The
      FIX-IT instrument quantifies clinical healing by assessing weight-bearing and fracture site
      pain on an ordinal scale. It has been initially validated in patients with tibia and femur
      fractures.

      Callus size of the anterior, posterior, and medial aspect will be assessed for each time
      point using a validated and published computational method.
