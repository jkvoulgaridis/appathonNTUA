  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if exercise is helpful for improving memory,
      concentration thinking abilities, physical function, and quality of life for adults aged 50
      to 89 years living with HIV and who have two or more cardiovascular disease risk factors. The
      study will test two kinds of intervention exercises: one group will walk for exercise and the
      second group will stretch for exercise. Members of both interventions will be asked to
      participate in one-on-one interviews/assessments, measures of physical functioning, and some
      sessions with others who are also enrolled in the study.

      This is a two arm, randomized controlled trial to test the longitudinal effects of the Let's
      Move Program (walking for exercise) compared to effects of the attention control Let's Flex
      Program (stretching for exercise) in participants aged 50 to 89 years living with HIV and who
      have two or more cardiovascular disease risk factors. Participants in both interventions will
      be asked to participate in one-on-one interviews/assessments, measures of physical
      functioning, and some sessions with others who are also enrolled in the study. Participants
      will participate in an in home exercise program for twelve weeks in which the study team will
      help identify maximum duration and intensity followed by a maintenance period for weeks
      13-58.
