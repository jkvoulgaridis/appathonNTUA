        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients older than 18.

          -  Pseudophakia patients with silicone oil in the vitreous cavity.

          -  Silicone oil density of 1500 centistoke or 5500 CS.

          -  Good corrected visual acuity (&gt; 6/10) in the second eye.

          -  Lack of additional ocular pathology that would reduce the quality of vision during
             surgery (corneal scar, Posterior Capsular Opacity, low transmission in the implantable
             lens, non-expanded pupil).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Additional ocular pathology that would reduce the quality of vision during surgery
             (corneal scar, Posterior Capsular Opacity, low transmission in the implantable lens,
             non-expanded pupil).

          -  The presence of heavy silicone oil (OXANE) in the vitreous cavity.

          -  Posterior segment pathology in the second eye.

          -  Special populations (children under the age of 18, pregnant women)
