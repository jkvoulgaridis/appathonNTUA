    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.
26 adverse events are reported splitting into at least 19 occurrences of individual pre-treatment emergent adverse events and 7 treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs).</description>

                  receiving LCM and will receive intravenous (iv) LCM as adjunctive treatment in
                  EP0060. Initiation of LCM monotherapy is not permitted in IIL subjects.

          -  Subject is an OLL or RxL subject and meets both of the following criteria:

                  weeks prior to Screening; AND

               2. Subject has been administered (OLL) or prescribed (RxL) oral LCM at a dose of 2
                  mg/kg/day to 12 mg/kg/day (for subjects &lt;50 kg) or 100 mg/day to 600 mg/day (for
                  subjects &gt;=50 kg). Open-label study drug LCM (OLL) or prescribed oral LCM dose
                  (RxL) must be stable for at least 3 days prior to first LCM infusion; OR,

          -  Subject is an ILL subject and is on a stable dosage regimen of at least 1
             antiepileptic drug (AED). The daily dosage regimen of concomitant AED therapy must be
             kept constant for a period of at least 2 weeks prior to Screening.

          -  Subject is an acceptable candidate for venipuncture and iv infusion

After completion of the first 20 participants in Cohort 1, a DMC reviewed the safety and tolerability data for this Cohort and made the following recommendations: the progression of the current Cohort, including iv infusion durations to be evaluated, and progression to initiate enrollment in the next Cohort (Cohort 2).</description>
