    <textblock>
      This research is being done to look at the body's response to cockroach extract, an allergen,
      when sprayed into the nose. The spraying of the cockroach extract into the participant's nose
      is called Nasal Allergen Challenge (NAC). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety
      and tolerability of a intranasal cockroach extract given to participants with asthma.

      This is a multi‐center, open label pilot study to assess the safety and determine the
      feasibility of cockroach nasal allergen challenge in children with asthma. This pilot study
      will occur in two phases:

        -  Phase 1 will enroll 10 cockroach sensitive adults with asthma who will undergo a nasal
           allergen challenge with increasing doses of cockroach allergen. Phase 1 will consist of
           two parts, Phase 1a and Phase 1b. In Phase 1a, participants will undergo a nasal
           allergen challenge. In Phase 1b, participants will undergo a repeat nasal allergen
           challenge to assess reproducibility of the NAC with cockroach allergen in a population
           with asthma. The data from Phase 1a will be used to identify a range of doses that is
           safe and elicits a threshold of nasal symptoms (TNSS ≥8).

        -  Phase 2 will enroll 25 cockroach sensitive children with asthma ages 8‐14 years who will
           undergo a nasal allergen challenge using the dose range identified in Phase 1a.

      Study mandated procedures include: blood draws (venipuncture); pulmonary function testing
      (PFTs); nasal allergen challenge (NAC); allergen skin testing; and peak expiratory flow.

    <measure>Cumulative Proportion of Participants Meeting Either a Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) Threshold or Sneezing Score Threshold During the Cockroach Allergen (CA) Nasal Allergen Challenge (NAC)</measure>
    <time_frame>NAC Baseline through last dose of German cockroach allergen administered during the NAC</time_frame>
    <description>Result is the proportion of participants (Pss) responding at each of 9 CA doses during the NAC.To illustrate the variability of the outcome at each dose,the protocol specifies computation of 95% CIs for the proportion responding at each dose.A proportion is to record for each Ps a 0 for non-responder and 1 for responder &amp;compute the mean of the 0 &amp;1 values.Summary statistic for this method: a mean.
After each dose,TNSS &amp;TNSS Sneezing scores were recorded.TNSS (0-12) is a self-rated score computed as the sum of 4 subscale scores (0-3) measuring sneezing, runny nose, stuffy nose, &amp; itchy nose symptoms (sxs).Pss provide a score on each subscale of 0, 1, 2, or 3(none, mild, moderate, or severe sxs, respectively).Pss cont'd receiving doses until either a TNSS (≥8 in adults,≥6 in children) or sneezing score threshold [TLV] of 3 was met.Assumption: Pss met TLV criteria for doses not recv'd beyond dose at which TLV criteria were initially met.</description>

    <description>Nine increasing doses of German cockroach allergen (0, 0.00381, 0.01204, 0.0380, 0.120, 0.379, 1.20, 3.78, and 11.9 mcg/mL) were administered during the Nasal Allergen Challenge (NAC). After administration of each dose, the number of times the participant sneezed was recorded. Participants continued receiving doses of German cockroach allergen until threshold criteria described in the primary endpoint were met. Number of sneezes was carried forward for doses not received beyond the dose at which the threshold criteria were initially met. Number of sneezes is summarized at each dose.</description>

    <measure>Highest Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>NAC Baseline through last dose of German cockroach allergen administered during the NAC</time_frame>
    <description>TNSS (0-12) is a participant rated score computed as the sum of four subscale scores (0-3) measuring sneezing, runny nose, stuffy nose, and itchy nose symptoms. Participants provide a score on each subscale of 0, 1, 2, or 3, indicating none, mild, moderate, or severe symptoms, respectively. The highest TNSS observed after administration of any of the German cockroach allergen doses received during the Nasal Allergen Challenge (NAC) is summarized.</description>

    <measure>Change in Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>NAC Baseline through last dose of German cockroach allergen administered during the NAC</time_frame>
    <description>TNSS (0-12) is a participant rated score computed as the sum of four subscale scores (0-3) measuring sneezing, runny nose, stuffy nose, and itchy nose symptoms. Participants indicate a score on each subscale of 0, 1, 2, or 3, indicating none, mild, moderate, or severe symptoms, respectively. Change is computed by subtracting the TNSS score obtained after the nasal rinse administered prior to the Nasal Allergen Challenge from the TNSS score obtained at the last tolerated dose of German cockroach allergen received during the Nasal Allergen Challenge (NAC). A positive change score indicates that nasal symptoms increased over the course of the NAC.</description>

    <measure>Change in Peak Nasal Inspiratory Flow (PNIF) L/Min</measure>
    <time_frame>NAC Baseline through last dose of German cockroach allergen administered during the NAC</time_frame>
    <description>PNIF is defined as the speed of inspiration of air in Liters per minute when breathing into the lungs. Change is computed by subtracting the PNIF score obtained after the nasal rinse administered prior to the Nasal Allergen Challenge (NAC) from the PNIF score obtained at the last tolerated dose of German cockroach allergen received during the NAC. A negative change score indicates that speed of inspiration decreased over the course of the NAC.</description>

    <measure>Change in Visual Analogue Score</measure>
    <time_frame>NAC Baseline through last dose of German cockroach allergen administered during the NAC</time_frame>
    <description>Participants self-reported their score, reflecting the severity of their nasal symptoms-sneezing, runny nose, stuffy nose, itchy nose- on a Visual Analogue Scale (0 to 10 centimeters). The left-hand side of the scale (0) represents &quot;No Symptoms,&quot; and the right hand side of the scale (10) represents &quot;As Bad as I Can Imagine.&quot;
Change is computed by subtracting the VAS score obtained after the nasal rinse administered prior to the Nasal Allergen Challenge (NAC) from the VAS score obtained at the last tolerated dose of German cockroach allergen received during the NAC. A positive change score indicates that nasal symptoms increased over the course of the NAC.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Of the 182 participants recruited, 80 participants consented to be screened for study eligibility. Among the five participating clinical research sites, all located in the United States, 35 participants enrolled to participate in the study. Enrollment was active from February 2016 to March 2017.</recruitment_details>

          <title>Cockroach Sensitive Adults With Asthma</title>
          <description>In Phase 1a, adult participants ages 18-55 underwent a nasal allergen challenge (NAC) with increasing doses of German cockroach allergen. At each allergen dose, the Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS; 0-12) was determined. This score is the sum of subscale scores measuring sneezing (0-3), runny nose (0-3), stuffy nose (0-3), and itchy nose (0-3) symptoms. Results were used to identify a range of doses that are safe and elicit nasal symptoms of TNSS ≥8 or a sneezing score=3. Participants who completed the NAC in Phase 1a were invited to assess additional screening criteria and return for a second nasal allergen challenge in Phase 1b to evaluate the reproducibility of the NAC in determining nasal symptoms in response to German cockroach allergen.</description>

        <title>Cumulative Proportion of Participants Meeting Either a Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) Threshold or Sneezing Score Threshold During the Cockroach Allergen (CA) Nasal Allergen Challenge (NAC)</title>
        <description>Result is the proportion of participants (Pss) responding at each of 9 CA doses during the NAC.To illustrate the variability of the outcome at each dose,the protocol specifies computation of 95% CIs for the proportion responding at each dose.A proportion is to record for each Ps a 0 for non-responder and 1 for responder &amp;compute the mean of the 0 &amp;1 values.Summary statistic for this method: a mean.
After each dose,TNSS &amp;TNSS Sneezing scores were recorded.TNSS (0-12) is a self-rated score computed as the sum of 4 subscale scores (0-3) measuring sneezing, runny nose, stuffy nose, &amp; itchy nose symptoms (sxs).Pss provide a score on each subscale of 0, 1, 2, or 3(none, mild, moderate, or severe sxs, respectively).Pss cont'd receiving doses until either a TNSS (≥8 in adults,≥6 in children) or sneezing score threshold [TLV] of 3 was met.Assumption: Pss met TLV criteria for doses not recv'd beyond dose at which TLV criteria were initially met.</description>

            <description>In Phase 1a, adult participants ages 18-55 underwent a nasal allergen challenge (NAC) with increasing doses of German cockroach allergen. At each allergen dose, the Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS; 0-12) was determined. This score is the sum of subscale scores measuring sneezing (0-3), runny nose (0-3), stuffy nose (0-3), and itchy nose (0-3) symptoms. Results were used to identify a range of doses that are safe and elicit nasal symptoms of TNSS ≥8 or a sneezing score=3. Participants who completed the NAC in Phase 1a were invited to assess additional screening criteria and return for a second nasal allergen challenge in Phase 1b to evaluate the reproducibility of the NAC in determining nasal symptoms in response to German cockroach allergen.</description>

            <description>In Phase 2, pediatric participants ages 8-14 underwent a nasal allergen challenge with increasing doses of German cockroach allergen. At each allergen dose, the Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS; 0-12) was determined. This score is the sum of subscale scores measuring sneezing (0-3), runny nose (0-3), stuffy nose (0-3), and itchy nose (0-3) symptoms.

          <title>Cumulative Proportion of Participants Meeting Either a Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) Threshold or Sneezing Score Threshold During the Cockroach Allergen (CA) Nasal Allergen Challenge (NAC)</title>
          <description>Result is the proportion of participants (Pss) responding at each of 9 CA doses during the NAC.To illustrate the variability of the outcome at each dose,the protocol specifies computation of 95% CIs for the proportion responding at each dose.A proportion is to record for each Ps a 0 for non-responder and 1 for responder &amp;compute the mean of the 0 &amp;1 values.Summary statistic for this method: a mean.
After each dose,TNSS &amp;TNSS Sneezing scores were recorded.TNSS (0-12) is a self-rated score computed as the sum of 4 subscale scores (0-3) measuring sneezing, runny nose, stuffy nose, &amp; itchy nose symptoms (sxs).Pss provide a score on each subscale of 0, 1, 2, or 3(none, mild, moderate, or severe sxs, respectively).Pss cont'd receiving doses until either a TNSS (≥8 in adults,≥6 in children) or sneezing score threshold [TLV] of 3 was met.Assumption: Pss met TLV criteria for doses not recv'd beyond dose at which TLV criteria were initially met.</description>

          <description>TNSS (0-12) is a participant rated score computed as the sum of four subscale scores (0-3) measuring sneezing, runny nose, stuffy nose, and itchy nose symptoms. Participants provide a score on each subscale of 0, 1, 2, or 3, indicating none, mild, moderate, or severe symptoms, respectively. The highest TNSS observed after administration of any of the German cockroach allergen doses received during the Nasal Allergen Challenge (NAC) is summarized.</description>

        <title>Change in Log Base 10 Albumin in Nasal Secretions</title>
        <description>Albumin is a protein in the human body. Levels are hypothesized to be related to the extent of allergic response. Change is computed by subtracting the albumin level prior to the Nasal Allergen Challenge (NAC) from the albumin level after the last dose received during the NAC. A log base 10 transformation is applied to both baseline and post-baseline measures. A positive change score indicates that albumin levels increased over the course of the NAC.</description>

            <description>In Phase 1a, adult participants ages 18-55 underwent a nasal allergen challenge (NAC) with increasing doses of German cockroach allergen. At each allergen dose, the Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS; 0-12) was determined. This score is the sum of subscale scores measuring sneezing (0-3), runny nose (0-3), stuffy nose (0-3), and itchy nose (0-3) symptoms. Results were used to identify a range of doses that are safe and elicit nasal symptoms of TNSS ≥8 or a sneezing score=3. Participants who completed the NAC in Phase 1a were invited to assess additional screening criteria and return for a second nasal allergen challenge in Phase 1b to evaluate the reproducibility of the NAC in determining nasal symptoms in response to German cockroach allergen.</description>
