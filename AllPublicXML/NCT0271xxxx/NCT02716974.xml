  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the safety of treating men with oligometastatic prostate cancer with the following
      therapy: (1st) Systemic chemo-hormonal therapy with up to 6-months (~24 weeks) of neoadjuvant
      androgen deprivation and up to 6 cycles of chemotherapy, (2nd) definitive local tumor control
      with prostatectomy +/- adjuvant radiation therapy, and (3rd) consolidative stereotactic
      radiation to oligometastatic lesions. The men will receive a total of 1 year of androgen
      deprivation. Androgen blockade will be the same throughout the course of treatment.

      Neoadjuvant treatment (month 1 through ~6): All patients will be treated with up to 6 months
      of androgen deprivation, plus up to 6 cycles of docetaxel chemotherapy. Following docetaxel
      therapy, patients with a prostate-specific antigen response of at least a 50% decrease from
      baseline, will proceed to maximum consolidative therapy.

      Surgery and Radiation (month 7 though ~11): After completion of neoadjuvant therapy, the men
      will be treated with definitive local therapy with radical prostatectomy (RP) +/- adjuvant
      radiation therapy (RT). After definitive local therapy, patients will be treated with
      consolidative stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) to the metastatic sites.

      Follow up: Patients will continue on androgen deprivation for a total of 1 year. They will be
      followed clinically and monitored with serum testosterone and prostate-specific antigen until
      2-years after completion of ADT (Androgen deprivation therapy) treatment. Androgen blockade
      will be the same throughout the course of treatment.

                  therapy was initiated prior to study enrollment, the clock for 1 year of androgen
                  deprivation would begin at the time of therapy initiation, rather than at study
                  enrollment.
