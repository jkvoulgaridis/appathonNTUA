      This NIS aims to assess the patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in enrolled subjects
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The design of the study is observational: both prospective and retrospective, national,
      multicenter, non- interventional. During this observational study, subjects diagnosed with
      severe or moderately severe (with severe phenotype) hemophilia A receiving routine
      prophylaxis treatment with ReFacto AF as per local standard clinical care, and in line with
      local labeling, are to be observed for 12 months.

      The primary objective is to assess the health-related quality of life in subjects treated
      with ReFacto AF routine prophylaxis at baseline and after 6 and 12 months.

      The secondary objectives are:

        -  To assess the subjective physical functioning of subjects treated with ReFacto AF
           routine prophylaxis at baseline and after 6 and 12 months;

        -  To assess the treatment satisfaction of caregivers of children and subjects above 18
           years treated with ReFacto AF routine prophylaxis at baseline and after 6 and 12 months;

        -  To determine in routine clinical practice the mean annualized bleeding rate (ABR) in
           subjects treated with ReFacto AF routine prophylaxis;

        -  To describe the status of joint health measured by HJHS before and after starting
           routine prophylaxis for subjects above 18 years.

    <description>HRQoL will be assessed by applying the self-reported hemophilia-specific quality of life Haemo-QoL questionnaire.
The endpoint will include the domains and total scores of the questionnaire. The results of this study will be presented using descriptive statistics and there will be no hypothesis testing. The domain scores and total scores will be summarized by: N, mean (sd), median, min-max and the 95% confidence interval at baseline, end of study, and the change from baseline.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and after 6 and 12 months;</time_frame>
    <description>Caregivers will evaluate their satisfaction with the treatment of their child and the above 18 years subjects will evaluate their own satisfaction with the treatment using the Hemo-Satp questionnaire.
The endpoint will include the domains and total scores of the questionnaire. The results of this study will be presented using descriptive statistics and there will be no hypothesis testing. The domain scores and total scores will be summarized by: N, mean (sd), median, min-max and the 95% confidence interval at baseline, end of study, and the change from baseline.</description>

    <time_frame>After 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>ABR will be calculated at the end of the study based on the number of bleeds recorded during the 12-months observation period. The ABR will be presented as N, mean (sd), median, min-max and the 95% confidence interval.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Joint health for subjects above 18 years</measure>
    <time_frame>After 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Status of joint health will be described for subjects above 18 years using the HJHS (Hemophilia Joint Health Score) before and after starting routine prophylaxis. HJHS for one particular joint (elbow, knee or ankle) represents the sum between the joint totals and the global gait score.The minimum score is 0 and the maximum is 24.
The joint totals is the sum between the scores for swelling, duration of swelling, muscle atrophy, crepitus on motion, flexion loss, extension loss, joint pain and strength; the maximum score is 20.
The global gait score evaluates walking, stairs, running and hopping in one leg; the maximum score is 4.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Severe (FVIII: C &lt;1%) or moderately severe (FVIII: C ≥1 - ≤2% with severe phenotype
             [at least 4 spontaneous bleeds clinically documented during a 6 months period] and
             without inhibitors) male subjects with hemophilia A receiving routine prophylaxis
             treatment.

          5. Subjects who are scheduled by their treating physician to initiate prophylaxis with
             ReFacto AF or to continue previously initiated prophylaxis with ReFacto AF, and
             subjects who are switching from prophylaxis with another FVIII product to ReFacto AF.

          6. Evidence of a personally signed and dated informed consent and assent (for children
             6-17 years of age) document indicating that the subject (or a legally acceptable
             representative) has been informed of all pertinent aspects of the study.

        Main Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has known hypersensitivity to the active substance or any of the excipients.

          2. Subject has known allergic reaction to hamster proteins.

          3. Presence of any bleeding disorder in addition to hemophilia A.

          4. Treatment with any investigational agent or device within the past 30 days.

          5. Any other contraindications according to Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC).

          6. Unsuitable to participate in study for any other reason as assessed by the
             investigator.

          7. Subjects (or a legally acceptable representative) not able to understand study
