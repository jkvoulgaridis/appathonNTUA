    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to generate preliminary data for a large multi-site randomized
      clinical trial of a model of palliative care consultation for patients with advanced
      dementia, and for their family caregivers.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease and related dementias affect 5 million Americans at an annual cost of
      $215 billion. Dementia is a contributing cause for 1 in 3 deaths, and is the only major cause
      of death with no effective prevention or treatment. Dementia-specific palliative care is
      needed to address the unique symptoms and treatment decisions relevant to this disease.

      Investigators therefore propose to develop and pilot test a model of palliative care
      consultation for advanced dementia patients, triggered by hospitalization for a serious acute
      illness. After systematic refinement of operational protocols and tools with stakeholders,
      they will enroll persons with advanced dementia plus an acute illness associated with high
      risk of death in the coming year. Patients will be enrolled with their family decision-makers
      (N=60 dyads) in a randomized feasibility trial. Intervention dyads will receive specialty
      palliative care consultation during hospital admission, plus post-discharge collaborative
      care by their outpatient primary care provider and a palliative care nurse practitioner.
      Control dyads will receive usual care.

      The research objective is to generate preliminary data for a large multi-site randomized
      controlled trial of a model of palliative care consultation for advanced dementia.

      Specific aims are:

      Aim 1: To develop a best-practice model of palliative care consultation for advanced dementia
      triggered by hospital admission for serious acute illness.

      Aim 2: To conduct a pilot randomized trial of triggered palliative care consultation for
      advanced dementia (versus usual care) to demonstrate the feasibility of conducting a larger
      randomized trial.

    <description>Number of palliative care domains addressed in treatment plan, using the Palliative Care Domain score which is scored 0 (not addressed) or 1 (addressed) for each of 10 possible domains of a palliative care treatment plan -- prognosis, overall goals of care, physical symptoms, psychiatric symptoms, spiritual needs, and 5 treatment preferences: resuscitation, artificial feeding, intravenous fluids, antibiotics, and hospitalization. Scores are summed for a total possible score of 0-10, with higher scores indicating greater attention to palliative care needs in the treatment plan.</description>
