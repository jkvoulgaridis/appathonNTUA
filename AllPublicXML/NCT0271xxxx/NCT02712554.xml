    <description>High VAS measures the positive effects experienced by the participant on a 100 mm unipolar VAS, where responses are unidirectional and range from a response of 'none' (0 mm = 'definitely not') to 'extremely' (100 mm = 'definitely so'). For VAS assessment, pre-dose (baseline) value was subtracted from each post-dose value prior to calculation of the pharmacodynamic (PD) parameter. Emax is the largest effect score and Emin is the smallest effect score between 0 to 24 hours post-dose.</description>

    <description>Drug liking VAS is the measure of balance of effects that assesses the degree that a participant likes a drug effect at the time the question is being asked (that is, at the moment). It is scored using a 100 millimeter (mm) bipolar (VAS) anchored in the center with a neutral anchor of 'neither like nor dislike' (score of 50 mm), on the left with 'strong disliking' (score of 0 mm) and on the right with 'strong liking' (score of 100 mm).

    <description>Overall drug liking VAS is the measure of balance of effects that assesses the participant's global perception of drug liking (that is, effects over the whole course of the drug experience including any carryover effects). A 100 mm bipolar VAS is used to assess response based on a score ranging from 0 mm to 100 mm (0 mm = 'strong disliking', 50 mm = 'neither like nor dislike', and 100 mm = 'strong liking'). Emax is the largest effect score and Emin is the smallest effect score between 0 to 8 hours post-dose.</description>

    <description>Take drug again VAS is the measure of balance of effects. It is a subjective assessment of the degree to which a participant would desire to take the drug again if given the opportunity. It is presented on a 100 mm bipolar VAS with score ranging from 0 mm to 100 mm (0 mm = 'definitely not', 50 mm = 'do not care', and 100 mm = 'definitely so').

    <time_frame>0 (Baseline, pre-dose), 1, 2, 4, 8 and 24 hours (post-dose)</time_frame>
    <description>CRT is a computerized 5-choice reaction time test in which the subject must press and hold down a touchscreen button at the bottom of the screen. A yellow spot appeared inside one of 5 yellow circles at the top of the screen. Subjects were to respond to the spot as quickly as they could by letting go of the button and touching the circle where the yellow spot appeared. This was repeated for 30 trials. Lower scores indicate better performance.</description>

    <description>Pupillometry assessments measured change in pupil size (miosis) as an indicator of opioid pharmacological properties. Pupil diameter was measured using electronic pupillometer.

MPC is calculated as smallest observed pupil diameter - baseline pupil diameter.</description>

        <title>Subjective Effects: Maximum Effect (Emax) and Minimum Effect (Emin) of High Visual Analog Scale (VAS) in Dose Selection Phase</title>
        <description>High VAS measures the positive effects experienced by the participant on a 100 mm unipolar VAS, where responses are unidirectional and range from a response of 'none' (0 mm = 'definitely not') to 'extremely' (100 mm = 'definitely so'). For VAS assessment, pre-dose (baseline) value was subtracted from each post-dose value prior to calculation of the pharmacodynamic (PD) parameter. Emax is the largest effect score and Emin is the smallest effect score between 0 to 24 hours post-dose.</description>

Parameters were not calculated for subjects who experienced emesis within the first 3 hours post-dose.</population>

          <title>Subjective Effects: Maximum Effect (Emax) and Minimum Effect (Emin) of High Visual Analog Scale (VAS) in Dose Selection Phase</title>
          <description>High VAS measures the positive effects experienced by the participant on a 100 mm unipolar VAS, where responses are unidirectional and range from a response of 'none' (0 mm = 'definitely not') to 'extremely' (100 mm = 'definitely so'). For VAS assessment, pre-dose (baseline) value was subtracted from each post-dose value prior to calculation of the pharmacodynamic (PD) parameter. Emax is the largest effect score and Emin is the smallest effect score between 0 to 24 hours post-dose.</description>

        <title>Emax of Drug Liking VAS in Treatment Phase</title>
        <description>Drug liking VAS is the measure of balance of effects that assesses the degree that a participant likes a drug effect at the time the question is being asked (that is, at the moment). It is scored using a 100 millimeter (mm) bipolar (VAS) anchored in the center with a neutral anchor of 'neither like nor dislike' (score of 50 mm), on the left with 'strong disliking' (score of 0 mm) and on the right with 'strong liking' (score of 100 mm). Emax is the largest effect score between 0.5 to 24 hours post-dose.</description>

        <title>Balance of Effects: Emin of Drug Liking VAS in Treatment Phase</title>
        <description>Drug liking VAS is the measure of balance of effects that assesses the degree that a participant likes a drug effect at the time the question is being asked (that is, at the moment). It is scored using a 100 millimeter (mm) bipolar (VAS) anchored in the center with a neutral anchor of 'neither like nor dislike' (score of 50 mm), on the left with 'strong disliking' (score of 0 mm) and on the right with 'strong liking' (score of 100 mm). Emin is the smallest effect score between 0.5 to 8 hours post-dose.</description>

        <title>Balance of Effects: Emax and Emin of Overall Drug Liking VAS in Treatment Phase</title>
        <description>Overall drug liking VAS is the measure of balance of effects that assesses the participant's global perception of drug liking (that is, effects over the whole course of the drug experience including any carryover effects). A 100 mm bipolar VAS is used to assess response based on a score ranging from 0 mm to 100 mm (0 mm = 'strong disliking', 50 mm = 'neither like nor dislike', and 100 mm = 'strong liking'). Emax is the largest effect score and Emin is the smallest effect score between 0 to 8 hours post-dose.</description>

        <title>Balance of Effects: Emax and Emin of Take Drug Again VAS in Treatment Phase</title>
        <description>Take drug again VAS is the measure of balance of effects. It is a subjective assessment of the degree to which a participant would desire to take the drug again if given the opportunity. It is presented on a 100 mm bipolar VAS with score ranging from 0 mm to 100 mm (0 mm = 'definitely not', 50 mm = 'do not care', and 100 mm = 'definitely so'). Emax is the largest effect score and Emin is the smallest effect score between 0 to 8 hours post-dose.</description>

        <title>Sedative and Other Effects: Emin of Alertness/Drowsiness VAS in Treatment Phase</title>
        <description>Alertness/Drowsiness VAS measures the sedative effects. It is scored using a 100 mm bipolar VAS anchored in the center with a neutral anchor of 'neither drowsy nor alert' (score of 50 mm), on the left with 'very drowsy' (score of 0 mm) and on the right with 'very alert' (score of 100 mm). Alertness/Drowsiness VAS was calculated by subtracting pre-dose (baseline) value from each post-dose value. Emin is the smallest effect score between 0 to 8 hours post-dose.</description>

        <description>Any drug effects VAS measures other subjective effects experienced by the participant on a 100 mm unipolar VAS, where responses are unidirectional and range from a response of 'none' (0 mm = 'definitely not') to 'extremely' (100 mm = 'definitely so'). Emax is the largest effect score between 0.5 to 8 hours post-dose.</description>

        <description>CRT is a computerized 5-choice reaction time test in which the subject must press and hold down a touchscreen button at the bottom of the screen. A yellow spot appeared inside one of 5 yellow circles at the top of the screen. Subjects were to respond to the spot as quickly as they could by letting go of the button and touching the circle where the yellow spot appeared. This was repeated for 30 trials. Lower scores indicate better performance.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Number of Errors (Any Errors) in CRT Test in Treatment Phase</title>
        <description>CRT is a computerized 5-choice reaction time test in which the subject must press and hold down a touchscreen button at the bottom of the screen. A yellow spot appeared inside one of 5 yellow circles at the top of the screen. Subjects were to respond to the spot as quickly as they could by letting go of the button and touching the circle where the yellow spot appeared. This was repeated for 30 trials. Lower scores indicate better performance. CRT also measures error scores and response accuracy. Any Errors is a combination of incorrect location errors, inaccurate response errors, no response errors, and premature errors.</description>
