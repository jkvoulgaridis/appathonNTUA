  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A multi-center Phase 1b/2 study testing the combination of AMG 820 and pembrolizumab in
      subjects with select advanced solid tumors.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phase 1b is AMG 820 dose determining and aimed at assessing the safety and tolerability of
      the selected starting dose of AMG 820 in combination with pembrolizumab. Phase 2 of the study
      will further evaluate safety and tolerability and additionally test whether AMG 820 can
      enhance the anti-tumor activity observed historically with pembrolizumab alone and/or
      overcome lack of response to pembrolizumab monotherapy in subjects with select solid tumors.

    <measure>Participants With Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT)</measure>
    <time_frame>The DLT evaluation period was Day 1 to Day 21</time_frame>
    <description>DLTs were evaluated by the Dose Level Review Team (DLRT). A DLT was defined as any grade &gt;=3 adverse event occurring during a DLT time window (21 day period from the initial administration of AMG 820 and pembrolizumab in combination), and if judged by the investigator to be related to the administration of AMG 820 and/or pembrolizumab.</description>

    <measure>Participants With Treatment -Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 up to 207 days for Part 1 and Day 1 up to 572 days for Part 2</time_frame>
    <description>TEAEs include any adverse event starting on or after the first dose of AMG 820 or pembrolizumab. Relation to study drugs was determined by the investigator. Adverse events (AEs) were graded by the investigator according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0, where Grade 1 = mild AE, Grade 2 = moderate AE, Grade 3 = severe AE, Grade 4 = life-threatening AE, and Grade 5 = death due to AE. Errors in the case report form design resulted in investigators misunderstanding the CTCAE definition for severity grade 5. Therefore data are not reported for severity grade 5. Readers are referred to the 'Fatal TEAE' line in the table below for counts of participants who died during the TEAE timeframe.</description>

    <measure>Objective Response Rate (ORR) Per Immune-Related Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (irRECIST)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline: Day -28; Treatment: up to Month 13.7</time_frame>
    <description>ORR was defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall response of complete response or partial response assessed by the investigator using immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (irRECIST). Response was based on the size of tumors assessed by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). During treatment radiographic imaging was performed at Week 10 and repeated at least every 10 weeks until disease progression.
Complete response (iCR): Disappearance of all lesions (whether measurable or not and whether baseline or new) and confirmation by a repeat, consecutive assessment no less than 4 weeks from the date first documented was required. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm.
Partial response (iPR): Decrease in tumor burden ≥ 30% relative to baseline. Confirmation by a consecutive assessment at least 4 weeks after first documentation required.</description>

        <title>Participants With Treatment -Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</title>
        <description>TEAEs include any adverse event starting on or after the first dose of AMG 820 or pembrolizumab. Relation to study drugs was determined by the investigator. Adverse events (AEs) were graded by the investigator according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0, where Grade 1 = mild AE, Grade 2 = moderate AE, Grade 3 = severe AE, Grade 4 = life-threatening AE, and Grade 5 = death due to AE. Errors in the case report form design resulted in investigators misunderstanding the CTCAE definition for severity grade 5. Therefore data are not reported for severity grade 5. Readers are referred to the 'Fatal TEAE' line in the table below for counts of participants who died during the TEAE timeframe.</description>

        <title>Participants With Treatment -Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) Related to AMG 820 Treatment</title>
        <description>TEAEs include any adverse event starting on or after the first dose of AMG 820 or pembrolizumab. Relation to study drugs was determined by the investigator. Adverse events (AEs) were graded by the investigator according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0, where Grade 1 = mild AE, Grade 2 = moderate AE, Grade 3 = severe AE, Grade 4 = life-threatening AE, and Grade 5 = death due to AE. Errors in the case report form design resulted in investigators misunderstanding the CTCAE definition for severity grade 5. Therefore data are not reported for severity grade 5. Readers are referred to the 'Fatal TEAE' line in the table below for counts of participants who died during the TEAE timeframe.</description>

        <title>Participants With Treatment -Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) Related to Pembrolizumab Treatment</title>
        <description>TEAEs include any adverse event starting on or after the first dose of AMG 820 or pembrolizumab. Relation to study drugs was determined by the investigator. Adverse events (AEs) were graded by the investigator according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0, where Grade 1 = mild AE, Grade 2 = moderate AE, Grade 3 = severe AE, Grade 4 = life-threatening AE, and Grade 5 = death due to AE. Errors in the case report form design resulted in investigators misunderstanding the CTCAE definition for severity grade 5. Therefore data are not reported for severity grade 5. Readers are referred to the 'Fatal TEAE' line in the table below for counts of participants who died during the TEAE timeframe.</description>

        <title>Objective Response Rate (ORR) Per Immune-Related Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (irRECIST)</title>
        <description>ORR was defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall response of complete response or partial response assessed by the investigator using immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (irRECIST). Response was based on the size of tumors assessed by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). During treatment radiographic imaging was performed at Week 10 and repeated at least every 10 weeks until disease progression.
Complete response (iCR): Disappearance of all lesions (whether measurable or not and whether baseline or new) and confirmation by a repeat, consecutive assessment no less than 4 weeks from the date first documented was required. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm.
Partial response (iPR): Decrease in tumor burden ≥ 30% relative to baseline. Confirmation by a consecutive assessment at least 4 weeks after first documentation required.</description>

      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>The Clinical Trial Agreement generally does not restrict an investigator's discussion of trial results after completion. The Agreement permits Amgen a limited period of time to review material discussing trial results (typically up to 45 days and possible extension). Amgen may remove confidential information, but authors have final control and approval of publication content. For multicenter studies, the investigator agrees not to publish any results before the first multi-center publication.</restrictive_agreement>
