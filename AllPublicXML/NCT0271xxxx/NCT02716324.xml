  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to explore whether using an online patient portal plus a Care
      Manager is more effective than using an online portal alone in managing care for children
      with ADHD. Doctors at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia currently use the online
      patient portal to help gather information from parents and teachers on ADHD symptoms,
      treatment, and medication side effects. The Care Manager is a person who meets with
      participants during the study to discuss their child's ADHD care. The Care Manager
      communicates with the child's doctor and teacher to communicate a parent's goals and
      preferences for their child's ADHD care.

    <textblock>
      Fragmentation in health care and poor communication across systems adversely impact
      engagement and adherence to treatment by children with ADHD and their families. Fragmentation
      of services for ADHD impairs communication and collaboration between families and primary
      care providers, mental health providers, and educators, and leads to suboptimal outcomes for
      children. Prior studies have documented that little communication and coordination exist
      among providers across different systems despite calls for better system integration.

      Fragmentation in communication between providers has the potential to impair shared
      decision-making. To promote shared decision-making, we developed an electronic health record
      (EHR)-linked portal to collect information from parents, teachers and clinicians on
      children's ADHD symptoms and treatment-related preferences and goals. This has become
      standard of care at our institution. We also developed and pilot tested a ADHD Care Manager
      intervention which will be employed in this comparative effectiveness study.

      303 participants were recruited from 11 primary care pediatric practices. Participants were
      randomly assigned to either the EHR portal alone, or the EHR portal plus a Care Manager. For
      those assigned to the EHR portal plus Care Manager, the Care Manager met with families at the
      beginning of the study to confirm their treatment preferences and goals, provide additional
      education on ADHD treatment, and distribute handouts on common concerns among ADHD patients
      and families. The Care Manager contacted families every 3 months or more frequently if needed
      by phone, email, or in-person to assess treatment use, identify new concerns, and assist
      families with problem-solving. The Care Manager also communicated with primary care
      clinicians, mental health providers, and teachers to clarify family treatment preferences and
      goals and address emerging treatment issues. Participants completed surveys that assessed
      ADHD symptoms, goal attainment, patient-reported outcomes, patient and family engagement, and
      treatment initiation and adherence.

    <time_frame>Baseline (Visit 1), 3 months (Visit 2), 6 months (Visit 3), and 9-12 months (Visit 4)</time_frame>
    <description>The VPRS is a public domain tool that consists of forms completed by the child's parent and includes 18 items corresponding to the DSM-5 ADHD symptom criteria, 8 performance items, and 12 items assessing side effects. The VPRS items are scaled on a 4-point Likert rating (&quot;never&quot; to &quot;very often&quot;), and the scales used in this study were restricted to the 18 ADHD symptom items. Total scores were used to measure ADHD Symptoms. Higher scores indicated worse outcome. VPRS were measured at baseline (Visit 1), 3 months (Visit 2), 6 months (Visit 3), and 9-12 months (Visit 4). The time range given for Visit 4 reflects the time range counted as a single value. The VPRS measures ADHD symptoms and is scaled on a 4-point Likert rating (&quot;never&quot; to &quot;very often&quot;). The scale includes 18 ADHD symptom items with total scores ranges from 0-54.</description>

    <description>Using responses from the Services Assessment for Children and Adolescents (SACA), a well-validated client-reported tool and provides information on any mental health services use, ambulatory services use, and inpatient service use, we determined (yes/no) whether participants ever received educational services, mental health services, or medications for ADHD. Parents reported whether their children used services ever or within the last nine months. Treatment initiation was measured by use of services ever. Categorizations include any service use, ambulatory service use (any community mental health or outpatient clinic, private professional, or in-home provider), and overnight stay (psychiatric or medical unit, residential treatment center, group home, or foster home). The time range of 9-12 given for Visit 4 reflects the time range counted as a single value.</description>

        <description>The GAS is a 5-point likert scale that assesses the degree to which parents' goals (obtained from the ADHD Preferences and Goals Instrument) are attained from none to completely. The GAS response categories are ordered from 0 (&quot;no change&quot;) to 6 (&quot;goal completely met&quot;). Higher scores indicate greater goal attainment. The GAS was measured at baseline (Visit 1), 3 months (Visit 2), 6 months (Visit 3), and 9-12 months (Visit 4). The time range given for Visit 4 reflects the time range counted as a single value.</description>

            <description>In this arm, the ADHD Portal will be used alone as an electronic communication tool.The ADHD portal is considered standard of care at our institution for communicating information between clinicians, teachers, and parents.
ADHD Portal: The ADHD portal is a web-based platform that permits access to parts of the hospital's electronic health record. The portal permits (1) capture and sharing of patient and family treatment preferences and goals, (2) monitoring of ADHD symptoms, treatment receipt, and side effects, and (3) assessing goal attainment. The system prompts for completion of periodic check-in surveys (bi-weekly to 3 months) with parents and teachers. Within the portal, preferences and goals for ADHD treatment are measured using the ADHD Preference Goal Instrument (PGI) (Fiks et al., 2012). Parents are encouraged to consult with their children when completing the tool.</description>

Clinicians, teachers, parents, and any external mental health providers will interact with a Care Manager, who will have access to information contained in the ADHD Portal.
Care Manager: The CM is responsible for communicating and coordinating ADHD care. The CM communicates with families weekly-every 3 months to assess treatment use and concerns, and problem-solve. The CM communicates with their ADHD care team (pediatrician, teacher, mental health provider) to clarify goals, communicate information, and coordinate treatment.

        <description>Using responses from the Services Assessment for Children and Adolescents (SACA), a well-validated client-reported tool and provides information on any mental health services use, ambulatory services use, and inpatient service use, we determined (yes/no) whether participants ever received educational services, mental health services, or medications for ADHD. Parents reported whether their children used services ever or within the last nine months. Treatment initiation was measured by use of services ever. Categorizations include any service use, ambulatory service use (any community mental health or outpatient clinic, private professional, or in-home provider), and overnight stay (psychiatric or medical unit, residential treatment center, group home, or foster home). The time range of 9-12 given for Visit 4 reflects the time range counted as a single value.</description>

        <description>Using responses from the Services Assessment for Children and Adolescents (SACA), a well-validated client-reported tool and provides information on any mental health services use, ambulatory services use, and inpatient service use, we determined (yes/no) whether participants ever received educational services, mental health services, or medications for ADHD. Parents reported whether their children used services ever or within the last nine months. Treatment adherence was measured by use of services in the past nine months. Categorizations include any service use, ambulatory service use (any community mental health or outpatient clinic, private professional, or in-home provider), and overnight stay (psychiatric or medical unit, residential treatment center, group home, or foster home). The time range of 9-12 given for Visit 4 reflects the time range counted as a single value.</description>

        <description>Student Engagement is a 4-item domain (minimum score=1, maximum score=5 on a 5 point Likert scale) of the of 30-item Child- (age 8-12) and 17-item Parent Patient Reported Outcomes Scores (PROS). The minimum total score for the Student Engagement domain is 4 and the maximum total score is 20 (total scores are not shown below). Values in the table below are reported as means at each time point and therefore fall between the minimum score of 1 and maximum score of 5. Higher scores indicate better outcomes. Parent-reported PRO and child-reported PRO measures were averaged for each domain for each time point. Student Engagement PRO scores were measured at baseline (Visit 1), 3 months (Visit 2), 6 months (Visit 3), and 9-12 months (Visit 4). The time range given for Visit 4 reflects the time range counted as a single value.</description>

            <title>ADHD Portal</title>
            <description>In this arm, the ADHD Portal will be used alone as an electronic communication tool.The ADHD portal is considered standard of care at our institution for communicating information between clinicians, teachers, and parents.
ADHD Portal: The ADHD portal is a web-based platform that permits access to parts of the hospital's electronic health record. The portal permits (1) capture and sharing of patient and family treatment preferences and goals, (2) monitoring of ADHD symptoms, treatment receipt, and side effects, and (3) assessing goal attainment. The system prompts for completion of periodic check-in surveys (bi-weekly to 3 months) with parents and teachers. Within the portal, preferences and goals for ADHD treatment are measured using the ADHD Preference Goal Instrument (PGI) (Fiks et al., 2012). Parents are encouraged to consult with their children when completing the tool.</description>

            <title>ADHD Portal Plus Care Manager</title>
            <description>In this arm, the ADHD Portal is combined with the Care Manager. Clinicians, teachers, and parents will use the ADHD Portal. Clinicians, teachers, parents, and any external mental health providers will interact with a Care Manager, who will have access to information contained in the ADHD Portal.
Care Manager: The CM is responsible for communicating and coordinating ADHD care. The CM communicates with families weekly-every 3 months to assess treatment use and concerns, and problem-solve. The CM communicates with their ADHD care team (pediatrician, teacher, mental health provider) to clarify goals, communicate information, and coordinate treatment.
ADHD Portal: The ADHD portal is a web platform that permits access to parts of CHOP's electronic health record. The portal permits 1) capture, sharing of treatment preferences. 2) monitoring of ADHD symptoms, treatments, and side effects, and 3) assessing goal attainment.</description>

The minimum total score for the Teacher Connectedness domain is 9 and the maximum total score is 45 (total scores not shown below). Values in the table below are reported as means at each time point and therefore fall between the minimum score of 1 and maximum score of 5. Higher scores indicate better outcomes. Parent-reported PRO and child-reported PRO measures were averaged for each domain for each time point.

            <description>In this arm, the ADHD Portal will be used alone as an electronic communication tool.The ADHD portal is considered standard of care at our institution for communicating information between clinicians, teachers, and parents.
ADHD Portal: The ADHD portal is a web-based platform that permits access to parts of the hospital's electronic health record. The portal permits (1) capture and sharing of patient and family treatment preferences and goals, (2) monitoring of ADHD symptoms, treatment receipt, and side effects, and (3) assessing goal attainment. The system prompts for completion of periodic check-in surveys (bi-weekly to 3 months) with parents and teachers. Within the portal, preferences and goals for ADHD treatment are measured using the ADHD Preference Goal Instrument (PGI) (Fiks et al., 2012). Parents are encouraged to consult with their children when completing the tool.</description>

Care Manager: The CM is responsible for communicating and coordinating ADHD care. The CM communicates with families weekly-every 3 months to assess treatment use and concerns, and problem-solve. The CM communicates with their ADHD care team (pediatrician, teacher, mental health provider) to clarify goals, communicate information, and coordinate treatment.

Care Manager: The CM is responsible for communicating and coordinating ADHD care. The CM communicates with families weekly-every 3 months to assess treatment use and concerns, and problem-solve. The CM communicates with their ADHD care team (pediatrician, teacher, mental health provider) to clarify goals, communicate information, and coordinate treatment.
ADHD Portal: The ADHD portal is a web platform that permits access to parts of CHOP's electronic health record. The portal permits 1) capture, sharing of treatment preferences. 2) monitoring of ADHD symptoms, treatments, and side effects, and 3) assessing goal attainment.</description>

          <title>Peer Relationships</title>
          <description>Peer Relationships is a 6-item domain (minimum=1, maximum=5, on a 5 point Likert scale) of the of 30-item Child- (age 8-12) and a 7-item domain (minimum=1, maximum=5 on a 5 point Likert scale) of the 17-item Parent Patient Reported Outcomes Scores (PROS). The minimum total score is 6 and the maximum total score is 30 on the Child PROs. The minimum total score for the Peer Relationships domain is 7 and the maximum total score is 35 on the Parent PROs. Total scores not shown below. Values in the table below are reported as means at each time point and therefore fall between the minimum score of 1 and maximum score of 5. Parent-reported PRO and child-reported PRO measures were averaged for each domain for each time point. Higher scores indicate better outcomes. Peer Relationships PRO scores were measured at baseline (Visit 1), 3 months (Visit 2), 6 months (Visit 3), and 9-12 months (Visit 4). The time range given for Visit 4 reflects the time range counted as a single value.</description>

ADHD Portal: The ADHD portal is a web-based platform that permits access to parts of the hospital's electronic health record. The portal permits (1) capture and sharing of patient and family treatment preferences and goals, (2) monitoring of ADHD symptoms, treatment receipt, and side effects, and (3) assessing goal attainment. The system prompts for completion of periodic check-in surveys (bi-weekly to 3 months) with parents and teachers. Within the portal, preferences and goals for ADHD treatment are measured using the ADHD Preference Goal Instrument (PGI) (Fiks et al., 2012). Parents are encouraged to consult with their children when completing the tool.</description>

        <description>The Engagement Measure is a 28-item parent self-report measure comprised of four domains: Access (5-items, total score range 5-25), Patient Family Centered Care or PFCC (6-items, total score range 6-30), Communication (3-items, total score range 3-15), and Understanding (5-items, total score range 5-25). Total scores are not reported below. Scores for each individual item and therefore the mean for each domain (means reported in the table below) ranged from 1-5 with higher scores indicating greater engagement. The time range given for Visit 4 reflects the time range counted as a single value.</description>

            <description>In this arm, the ADHD Portal will be used alone as an electronic communication tool.The ADHD portal is considered standard of care at our institution for communicating information between clinicians, teachers, and parents.
ADHD Portal: The ADHD portal is a web-based platform that permits access to parts of the hospital's electronic health record. The portal permits (1) capture and sharing of patient and family treatment preferences and goals, (2) monitoring of ADHD symptoms, treatment receipt, and side effects, and (3) assessing goal attainment. The system prompts for completion of periodic check-in surveys (bi-weekly to 3 months) with parents and teachers. Within the portal, preferences and goals for ADHD treatment are measured using the ADHD Preference Goal Instrument (PGI) (Fiks et al., 2012). Parents are encouraged to consult with their children when completing the tool.</description>

Care Manager: The CM is responsible for communicating and coordinating ADHD care. The CM communicates with families weekly-every 3 months to assess treatment use and concerns, and problem-solve. The CM communicates with their ADHD care team (pediatrician, teacher, mental health provider) to clarify goals, communicate information, and coordinate treatment.
