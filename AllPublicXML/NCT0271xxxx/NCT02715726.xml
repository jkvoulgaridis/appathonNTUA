    <textblock>
      Primary Objective:

      To demonstrate the reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by alirocumab as
      add-on therapy to stable maximally tolerated daily statin therapy in comparison to ezetimibe
      10 mg daily after 24 weeks of treatment in Asia in participants with hypercholesterolemia at
      high cardiovascular (CV) risk.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the effect of alirocumab 75 mg in comparison with ezetimibe 10 mg on LDL-C
           after 12 weeks of treatment.

        -  To evaluate the effect of alirocumab on other lipid parameters: e.g., apolipoprotein B
           (Apo B), non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), total cholesterol (TC),
           lipoprotein a (Lp[a]), HDL-C, triglycerides (TG), apolipoprotein A-1 (Apo A-1).

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of alirocumab.

        -  To evaluate the development of anti-alirocumab antibodies.

        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of alirocumab.

        Inclusion criteria:

        Participants with hypercholesterolemia and established coronary heart disease (CHD) or CHD
        risk equivalents who are not adequately controlled with a maximally tolerated daily dose of
        statin at a stable dose for at least 4 weeks prior to the screening visit (Week -3).

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Participants without established CHD or CHD risk equivalents.

          -  LDL-C &lt;70 mg/dL (&lt;1.81 mmol/L) at the screening visit (Week -3) in participants with
             history of documented CV disease.

          -  LDL-C &lt;100 mg/dL (&lt;2.59 mmol/L) at the screening visit (Week -3) in participants
             without history of documented CV disease.

          -  Change in statin dose or dose regimen from screening to randomization.

          -  Currently taking a statin other than atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, or simvastatin.

          -  Atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, or simvastatin was not taken daily or not taken at a
             registered dose.

          -  Daily doses above atorvastatin 80 mg, rosuvastatin 40 mg, or simvastatin 40 mg.

          -  Use of cholesterol absorption inhibitor (ie, ezetimibe), omega-3 fatty acid (at doses
             ≥1000 mg daily), nicotinic acid, fibrates, bile acid-binding sequestrant, or red yeast
             rice products in the past 4 weeks prior to screening visit (Week -3).

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>The study was conducted at 61 centers in China, India and Thailand. Overall 1163 participants were screened between 27 July 2016 and 18 December 2017, of whom 548 were screen failures. Screen failures were mainly due to exclusion criteria met. A total of 615 participants were randomized in 2:1 ratio to alirocumab: ezetimibe.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Randomization was stratified according to prior history of myocardial infarction (MI) or ischemic stroke [Yes/No], and high-intensity statin treatment (Yes: atorvastatin 40 to 80 mg daily or rosuvastatin 20 to 40 mg daily, no: atorvastatin below 40 mg daily, rosuvastatin below 20 mg daily or simvastatin whatever the dose daily) and country.</pre_assignment_details>

      <desc>Reported AEs were treatment emergent AEs that developed or worsened during ‘the treatment emergent period’ (time from first dose of double-blind study drug intake [capsule or injection, whichever came first] to the day of last dose of double blind study drug injection + 70 days). Analysis was performed on safety population (participants who received at least 1 dose or partial dose of study drug [injection or capsule)]. Participants were analyzed according to the treatment actually received.</desc>
