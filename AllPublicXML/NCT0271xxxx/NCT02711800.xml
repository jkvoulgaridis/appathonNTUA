  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators seek to conduct the first open-label trial of probiotics in young children
      to reduce their anxiety and abdominal pain. Likewise, the investigators aim to assess the
      feasibility and efficacy of this treatment and to elucidate the enteric microbiota in the
      middle-lower GI tract. Self-report measures and a laboratory task will be collected from
      children, ages 9-13 years of age, and self-report measures from their primary caregivers
      prior to and following a 30-day probiotic administration. Children who score above cutoff in
      anxiety and/or abdominal pain meet the inclusion criteria for this study. Because of limited
      sample size and the iterative nature of intervention development, criteria for success at the
      pilot phase are based primarily on clinical rather than statistical criteria. The study
      personnel will do their best to keep and ensure the privacy and confidentiality of our
      participants; however, some of the risks of this study may include psychological discomfort,
      legal risks, and loss of confidentially.

    <measure>Change in Child Abdominal Pain Rating</measure>
    <time_frame>One week pre-intervention (Study Day 1), One week post-intervention (Study Day 44)</time_frame>
    <description>Child and parent report is used to obtain ratings of pain intensity on a 0-12 scale. A lower score equates to lower pain intensity. Ratings are obtained for a one-week period pre and post intervention, and measured 3 times daily. Pre-treatment assessments took place days 1-7, participants were treated days 8-36, and post-intervention assessments were completed days 37-44. All time points will be averaged and combined across raters (child and parent) resulting in an average pain severity rating pre and post-treatment. The change in this average rating will be assessed as pain severity outcome. This measure was averaged with the pain frequency average score (see Primary Outcome 2) to result in one primary severity/frequency pain rating pre and post treatment. The change in this combined measure is our primary index of change.</description>

    <measure>Change in Child Abdominal Pain Frequency</measure>
    <time_frame>One week pre-intervention (Study Day 1), One week post-intervention (Study Day 44)</time_frame>
    <description>Child and parent report is used to obtain ratings of pain frequency, the number of distinct occasions that pain was reported. Frequency was obtained for a one-week period pre and post intervention, and measured 3 times daily during these intervals. During the 30-day intervention, end of day frequencies were made. Pre-treatment assessments took place days 1-7, participants were treated days 8-36, and post-intervention assessments were completed days 37-44. The average number of episodes across these time points will be calculated pre and post treatment. The change in this average frequency from pre to post treatment will be the measure of change.</description>

    <measure>Change in Child Anxiety Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 30 days</time_frame>
    <description>We report the change in magnitude of self-reported state anxiety derived from summed raw scores obtained through the six-item short-form of the state scale of the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory at baseline and 30 days from baseline. Scores in the scale range from 6-24, with greater scores indicating worse anxiety. We obtained the summed raw scores after reverse scoring items 1, 4 &amp; 5.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Adherence to Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Adherence was calculated as: (&quot;the days probiotic was taken&quot;/&quot;total number of days of treatment&quot;) x 100, with results ranging from 0% (no probiotics taken at all) to 100% (probiotics taken 30 days out of the 30 day-treatment period). Researcher will subtract the number of pills/packets taken from the total amount.</description>

    <description>The investigators will use Culturelle®, a probiotic composed of the micro-organisms Lactobacillus GG. This formulation has been used for the treatment of gastrointestinal inflammation in numerous clinical trials. Dosing will follow the manufacturer's recommendation for children (1 capsule/packet per day), and will be monitored by Dr. Patrick Seed from the department of pediatrics. Weekly side effects and clinical changes will be monitored by both study therapist and caregiver using the Children's Global Assessment Scale and the Clinical Global Impression Scale (Severity, Improvement, and Efficacy). The intervention duration is 30 days.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Participants need to meet the criteria for functional abdominal pain as specified by the
        Rome III:

        Scenario #1 Criteria for inclusion

          1. In the last 2 months, how often did the child have pain or an uncomfortable feeling in
             the upper abdomen above the belly button? If ≥ 8 (or if the combination of #1 and #2
             is ≥8)

          2. In the last 2 months, how often did the child have pain or an uncomfortable feeling in
             the upper abdomen below the belly button? If ≥ 8 (or if the combination of #1 and #2
             is ≥8)

        Scenario #2 Criteria for inclusion 3. In the last 2 months, when the child hurt or felt
        uncomfortable above (below) the belly button, how often did your child miss school or stop
        activities? If #1 and #2 is ≥ 2 (or if the combination of #1 and #2 is ≥2) and #3 is ≥ 25%
        of the time.

        They also have to be at or above cutoff (i.e. TS&gt;= 55) for Beck Youth Inventory (BYI) which
        can be determined by finding the corresponding raw score, gender, and age on Appendix A in
        the BYI manual.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        1. Participants with immune disorders will be automatically excluded from this study.

        <title>Change in Child Abdominal Pain Rating</title>
        <description>Child and parent report is used to obtain ratings of pain intensity on a 0-12 scale. A lower score equates to lower pain intensity. Ratings are obtained for a one-week period pre and post intervention, and measured 3 times daily. Pre-treatment assessments took place days 1-7, participants were treated days 8-36, and post-intervention assessments were completed days 37-44. All time points will be averaged and combined across raters (child and parent) resulting in an average pain severity rating pre and post-treatment. The change in this average rating will be assessed as pain severity outcome. This measure was averaged with the pain frequency average score (see Primary Outcome 2) to result in one primary severity/frequency pain rating pre and post treatment. The change in this combined measure is our primary index of change.</description>

        <title>Change in Child Abdominal Pain Frequency</title>
        <description>Child and parent report is used to obtain ratings of pain frequency, the number of distinct occasions that pain was reported. Frequency was obtained for a one-week period pre and post intervention, and measured 3 times daily during these intervals. During the 30-day intervention, end of day frequencies were made. Pre-treatment assessments took place days 1-7, participants were treated days 8-36, and post-intervention assessments were completed days 37-44. The average number of episodes across these time points will be calculated pre and post treatment. The change in this average frequency from pre to post treatment will be the measure of change.</description>

Scores in the scale range from 6-24, with greater scores indicating worse anxiety. We obtained the summed raw scores after reverse scoring items 1, 4 &amp; 5.</description>
