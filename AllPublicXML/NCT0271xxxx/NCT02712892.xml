  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intracranial aneurysm (IA) is an asymptomatic cerebrovascular abnormality affecting 3.2% of
      the general population. The devastating complication of IA is its rupture, resulting in
      subarachnoid haemorrhage that can lead to severe disability and death. Unfortunately, there
      are neither reliable clues nor diagnostic tools to predict the formation and/or the fate of
      an IA in a given individual. Also, there is no pharmacological drug available to prevent the
      rupture of aneurysm and subsequent subarachnoid haemorrhage. Current treatments are invasive
      with a significant risk of procedural morbidity. Thus, still now, the management of patients
      with IA remains extremely challenging and still controversial. Although the pathogenesis of
      IA has been the subject of many studies for the last decade, the mechanisms underlying IA
      formation, growth and rupture are still mostly unknown and relevant animal models of IA are
      not available. Familial history of IA predisposes to IA formation and rupture and increasing
      evidence suggest a genetic component of IA formation, with heterogeneous modes of inheritance
      and penetrance. This project, gathering neuroradiologists, geneticists and vascular
      biologists, addresses the urgent need to understand the pathogenic mechanisms of IA to
      develop diagnostic and predictive tools of risk of IA. The investigators propose to identify
      IA-causing variants by whole-exome sequencing in familial forms of the disease. The
      investigators hypothesises that the functional analysis of the causal/susceptibility variants
      thus identified will provide clues to understanding the pathological mechanisms of IA
      formation, and the bases for developing diagnostic tools. This project aims at meeting this
      challenge. Based on preliminary data that already allowed to identify such a variant, and the
      combination of genetic and functional investigations, the specific objectives of this project
      are: - To identify IA-causing variants in familial forms of the disease by whole-exome
      sequencing; - To understand the function of these genes/variants in the formation and rupture
      of IA by molecular and cellular approaches and generation of relevant animal models; - To
      discover potential biomarkers of risk of IA formation and/or rupture.

        The initial stage of this biocollection based on the recruitment of large families for
        genetic linkage analysis. This is a first step to identify patients with intracranial
        aneurysms occurring in a family context, and to conduct a comprehensive investigation
        according to clinical guidelines in force to assess the potentially informative family and
        ensure their adherence to the prior biocollection. The next step is the fine and accurate
        phenotyping of each of the family members (imaging) and the collection of a blood sample
        for DNA extraction for molecular genetic analysis.

        The population recruited will be composed of index and their healthy relatives and cases
        with sporadic cases and IA. The kinship links will be established from family trees.
