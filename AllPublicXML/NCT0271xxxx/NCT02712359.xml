  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the persistence of hepatitis A antibodies,
      approximately 8 years and 10 years post vaccination with the complete series of Havrix (2
      doses) and the partial series completion (1 dose).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study comprises of two independent cross-sectional surveys (Year 8 and Year 10). The
      first cross-sectional serosurvey will evaluate the long term persistence of immunity
      approximately 8 years post vaccine administration and the second cross-sectional study will
      evaluate long term persistence, approximately 10 years post vaccine administration.

      <recruitment_details>The study was conducted at 4 centers in Panama. Out of the 1201 subjects originally enrolled in the study, 2 subjects were eliminated from the ATP cohort for persistence, due to non-eligibility. Hence, 1199 subjects were included in the ATP cohort for persistence.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The design of the study included 2 epochs: Epoch 001 - Persistence at Year 8 and Epoch 002 - Persistence at Year 10.</pre_assignment_details>
