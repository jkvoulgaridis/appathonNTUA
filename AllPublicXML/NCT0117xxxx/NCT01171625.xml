      Carpentier-Edwards PERIMOUNT Magna Ease Valves in patients undergoing aortic valve
      replacement with or without concomitant procedures requiring cardiopulmonary bypass.

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single-arm, multi-center, interventional study to be conducted in the
      US and outside the US (OUS). This study will enroll a minimum of 225 patients implanted with
      the study valve in order to achieve 101 aortic valve replacement subjects each followed for a
      minimum of 8 years. The study will include male and female patients, 18 years or older,
      requiring replacement for a diseased, damaged or malfunctioning natural or prosthetic aortic
      valve. Patients will be followed and assessed after implant at discharge, 6 months, one year,
      and annually for a minimum of 8 years.

        <title>Subject's Amount of Aortic Valvular Regurgitation at 8 Years Post-Implant.</title>
        <description>Aortic valvular regurgitation occurs when the aortic valve in the heart does not close tightly allowing some of the blood that was pumped out of the heart to leak back into it. Aortic valvular regurgitation is evaluated by echocardiography over time. It is assessed on a scale from 0 to 4, where 0 represents no regurgitation and 4 represents severe regurgitation.</description>

        <description>The EQ-5D is a standardized questionnaire that asks subjects to rate themselves (no problems, some problems, extreme problems) on mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. The scale ranges from a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 100 where zero is the 'worst state imaginable' and 100 is the 'best state imaginable'.</description>
