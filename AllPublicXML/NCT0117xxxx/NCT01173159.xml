  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to see if giving Omegaven (an intravenous fat emulsion
      containing fish oil) instead of the current lipid emulsion, which contains fat derived from
      soybeans, as part of your child's intravenous (IV) nutrition therapy may be tolerated better.
      It may reduce the harmful effects to the liver, may stop any further liver damage and may
      reverse damage already done to the liver because of the prolonged use of nutrition through
      your child's IV.

      Enrollment of subjects into this study will occur for up to 4 years. Subjects will receive
      Omegaven at a dose of up to 1 g/kg body weight/day until they no longer require total
      parenteral nutrition or until their conjugated/direct bilirubin has normalized and their
      enteral lipid intake is sufficient to discontinue intravenous lipids.

    <description>For the first two days of treatment, subjects will receive Omegaven® at 0.5 g/kg per day to assess tolerance and will progress to a maintenance dosage of up to 1g/kg per day over 12 hours at an infusion rate of 1 g/kg/12 hours (10 ml/kg/12 hours). Dosing is based on previously described dosing of fish-oil emulsions as monotherapy noted within the literature. Omegaven® will be infused intravenously through either a central or peripheral catheter in conjunction with other parenteral nutrition containing dextrose and amino acids. Omegaven® is isotonic.

Omegaven: For the first two days of treatment, subjects will receive Omegaven® at 0.5 g/kg per day to assess tolerance and will progress to a maintenance dosage of up to 1g/kg per day over 12 hours at an infusion rate of 1 g/kg/12 hours (10 ml/kg/12 hours). Dosing is based on previously described dosing of fish-oil emulsions as monotherapy noted within the literature. Omegaven® will be infused intravenously through either a central or peripheral catheter in conjunction with other parenteral nutrition containing dextrose and amino acids. Omegaven® is isotonic. It is compatible with parenteral nutrition solutions and may be co-infused via y-site.</description>
