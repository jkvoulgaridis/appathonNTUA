  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center pilot study in which Laronidase will be given weekly for two years in
      patients with Hurler syndrome, also known as mucopolysaccharide IH (MPS I, Hurler syndrome),
      that have previously been treated with an allogeneic transplant.

    <textblock>
      This 2-year open-label pilot study of laronidase includes patients (age 5-13 years) who are
      at least 2 years post-hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) and donor engrafted. Outcomes
      are assessed semi-annually and compared to historic controls. Eligible patients will receive
      Laronidase as an infusion over several hours once a week at a local site. The dosing of
      enzyme will be the standard doses recommended by Genzyme.

      The findings of this Pilot Study will be used to assess whether a subsequent larger study can
      be conducted.

    <description>A modified Balke Treadmill Test was performed. Briefly, patients began walking at 2.0 mph with a 2% increase in grade every 2 min. A 12-lead electrocardiogram was monitored continuously throughout the test for the determination of heart rate and dysrhythmias or ischemic changes. Heart rate was measured at the end of each stage (i.e. every 2 min) .</description>

    <measure>Correlation of 6 Minute Walk Test With Anti-laronidase Antibody + Status</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed from baseline every 6 months through 2 years; change between baseline and 24 months reported.If baseline and/or 24-month data were not available, the longest interval between measurements was reported, with a minimum requirement of 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>6 minute walk test (6MWT) was performed to assess overall physical function and health status. In brief, a 30m hospital corridor marked by colored tape at each end was used. Subjects were instructed to walk from end to end at their self-selected pace, while attempting to cover as much distance as possible in the 6 min. The patients were instructed to walk around the mark as they changed direction. The time and distance covered was recorded, as was the heart rate prior to and immediately after completion of the walk test.
To find the association between the rate of change in 6MWT, and anti drug antibody (ADA) titer, a statistical test is performed adjusting for age at the time of enrollment.</description>

        <title>Correlation of 6 Minute Walk Test With Anti-laronidase Antibody + Status</title>
        <description>6 minute walk test (6MWT) was performed to assess overall physical function and health status. In brief, a 30m hospital corridor marked by colored tape at each end was used. Subjects were instructed to walk from end to end at their self-selected pace, while attempting to cover as much distance as possible in the 6 min. The patients were instructed to walk around the mark as they changed direction. The time and distance covered was recorded, as was the heart rate prior to and immediately after completion of the walk test.
To find the association between the rate of change in 6MWT, and anti drug antibody (ADA) titer, a statistical test is performed adjusting for age at the time of enrollment.</description>
