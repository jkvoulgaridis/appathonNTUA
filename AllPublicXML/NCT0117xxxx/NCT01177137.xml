  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the Tinnitus Retraining Therapy Trial (TRTT) is to assess the efficacy
      of tinnitus retraining therapy (TRT) as a treatment for severe debilitating tinnitus. TRT is
      a non-medical intervention that uses directive counseling (DC) and sound therapy (ST)to
      habituate the patient's associated negative emotional reactions to tinnitus, its perception,
      and ultimately, its impact on the patient's life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Tinnitus Retraining Therapy Trial (TRTT), funded by the National Institute of Deafness
      and Other Communication Disorders, is a multi-center randomized clinical trial testing the
      efficacy of tinnitus retraining therapy (TRT) versus standard-of-care (SC) treatment in
      individuals who have self-perceived intolerable tinnitus. TRT is a non-medical intervention
      that uses directive counseling (DC) and low-level sound therapy (ST) achieved through sound
      generators (SGs) to habituate the patient's associated negative emotional reactions
      (annoyance) to tinnitus, its perception (awareness) and, ultimately, its impact on the
      participant's life. Study participants will include active and retired military personnel of
      the U. S. Armed Forces and their dependents who suffer from severe tinnitus. The study will
      be conducted at flagship Air Force, and Navy Medical Centers.

      This trial will evaluate the efficacy of TRT and its components (DC and ST) versus the
      standard of care (SC) as administered in the military by comparing the efficacy of:

        -  (1) TRT (DC and ST achieved using conventional sound generators) versus SC;

        -  (2) TRT versus partial TRT (DC and placebo sound generators) to evaluate the separate
           effect of sound therapy, under the assumption that placebo noise generator will not
           provide any meaningful sound therapy beyond that found in SC;

        -  (3) partial TRT versus SC to evaluate the separate effect of DC.

      Eligibility will be determined at the Baseline Eligibility Visit, which will consist of a
      medical and tinnitus history, physical examination, and baseline
      audiological/tinnitus/hyperacusis evaluation. Study participants will also complete a series
      of quality of life and psychological profile tests. Study Audiologists will administer the
      randomly assigned treatment. Follow-up visits at Clinical Centers will take place at 3, 6,
      12, and 18 months and include completion of tinnitus outcome questionnaires at all visits.
      Psychometric testing and audiological/tinnitus/hyperacusis evaluation will take place at the
      6, 12, and 18 month visits. Evaluation of audiometric pure tone and loudness discomfort level
      also will take place at treatment visits.

      The primary outcome to be measured in the TRTT will be change in scores on the Tinnitus
      Questionnaire (TQ) longitudinally assessed between baseline and follow-up (i.e., at 3, 6, 12
      and 18 months following treatment). Secondary outcomes include changes in the sub-scales of
      the TQ, change in scores from the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI), Tinnitus Functional
      Index (TFI), Hearing Handicap Inventory (HHI), and TRT visual analogue scales, and change in
      the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST). Psychometric secondary outcomes also include
      change in psychoacoustic variables related to the tinnitus sensation, including tinnitus
      pitch and loudness match, and loudness discomfort level.

      The TRTT is designed to have sufficient power to detect a minimal clinically important
      difference in the Tinnitus Questionnaire (TQ) i.e., a 10 point difference between TRT and SC
      groups on change in TQ global scores longitudinally assessed over the course of follow-up and
      a 7-point difference on TQ score by TRT components, DC and ST.

          <title>Tinnitus Retraining Therapy (TRT)</title>
          <description>TRT includes sound therapy using a conventional sound generator and educational directive counseling (DC).
The conventional sound generator (SG) is a Tranquil model (General Hearing Instruments, Inc.), worn either inside- or outside-the-ear. The device generates low-level noise and is set at or just below the participant's mixing point (i.e., noise level that just blends with the tinnitus)
Directive Counseling (DC) involves a one to two-hour educational session during which the participant is given information regarding the nature of the tinnitus problem and related problems such as hearing loss and sound intolerance; visual aids to review the audiological/tinnitus/ hyperacusis evaluation, instruction on anatomy and physiology of hearing and tinnitus, introduction to the Jastreboff neurophysiological model of tinnitus and related concepts of habituation, and use of sound therapy and environmental sound in the habituation process.</description>

          <description>Partial TRT includes treatment with a placebo sound generator (placebo SG) and directive counseling (DC).
The placebo sound generator (SG) is a Tranquil model (General Hearing Instruments, Inc.), worn either inside- or outside-the-ear. The device is set at or just below the participant's mixing point (i.e., noise level that just blends with the tinnitus) and generates a low-level sound different from the active devices.

          <title>Standard of Care (SC)</title>
          <description>The standard of care arm includes care as typically delivered in US military medical centers
The standard of care treatment will be similar to that typically provided to patients with severe tinnitus at participating military medical centers and as described in the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) Preferred Practice Patterns in Audiology (ASHA, 2006). Tinnitus management will be based on the patient's complaints, history, audiologic evaluation, and self-assessment. The goal of the tinnitus management is to reduce negative cognitive, affective, physical, and behavioral reactions to tinnitus and to improve the patient's well-being and quality of life. Specific treatment recommendations will be individualized to reflect the participant's concerns and abilities, as well as his or her engagement in the decision-making process regarding treatment options.</description>

The total score is the sum of the scores of all questions and ranges from 0 to 102, with higher scores indicating more tinnitus distress. Sub-scales (range of scores) include auditory perceptual difficulties (0 to 14), emotional distress (0 to 38), intrusiveness (0 to 14), sleep disturbance (0 to 8), and somatic complaint (0 to 8).</description>

        <title>Change in Tinnitus Questionnaire (TQ) From Baseline to 3, 6, 12, and 18 Months</title>
        <description>The TQ is a tinnitus-specific health-related quality of life instrument with 52 statements that the respondent marks as true, partly true, or not true. The TQ is scored from 0 to 102, with higher scores indicating more of an impact of the tinnitus on quality of life. Subscales include emotional distress, intrusiveness, auditory perceptual difficulties, sleep disturbance,and somatic complaints.</description>

            <title>Tinnitus Retraining Therapy (TRT)</title>
            <description>TRT includes sound therapy using a conventional sound generator and educational directive counseling (DC).
The conventional sound generator (SG) is a Tranquil model (General Hearing Instruments, Inc.), worn either inside- or outside-the-ear. The device generates low-level noise and is set at or just below the participant's mixing point (i.e., noise level that just blends with the tinnitus)
Directive Counseling (DC) involves a one to two-hour educational session during which the participant is given information regarding the nature of the tinnitus problem and related problems such as hearing loss and sound intolerance; visual aids to review the audiological/tinnitus/ hyperacusis evaluation, instruction on anatomy and physiology of hearing and tinnitus, introduction to the Jastreboff neurophysiological model of tinnitus and related concepts of habituation, and use of sound therapy and environmental sound in the habituation process.</description>

            <description>The standard of care arm includes care as typically delivered in US military medical centers
The standard of care treatment will be similar to that typically provided to patients with severe tinnitus at participating military medical centers and as described in the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) Preferred Practice Patterns in Audiology (ASHA, 2006). Tinnitus management will be based on the patient's complaints, history, audiologic evaluation, and self-assessment. The goal of the tinnitus management is to reduce negative cognitive, affective, physical, and behavioral reactions to tinnitus and to improve the patient's well-being and quality of life. Specific treatment recommendations will be individualized to reflect the participant's concerns and abilities, as well as his or her engagement in the decision-making process regarding treatment options.</description>

        <description>Change in THI score from baseline to 3 months follow-up. The THI is a tinnitus-specific health-related quality of life instrument. Subscales include the functional (scored 0 to 44), emotional (scored 0 to 36) and catastrophic (scored 0 to 20). The total score ranges from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating a greater impact of tinnitus on quality of life.</description>

            <description>TRT includes sound therapy using a conventional sound generator and educational directive counseling (DC).
The conventional sound generator (SG) is a Tranquil model (General Hearing Instruments, Inc.), worn either inside- or outside-the-ear. The device generates low-level noise and is set at or just below the participant's mixing point (i.e., noise level that just blends with the tinnitus)
Directive Counseling (DC) involves a one to two-hour educational session during which the participant is given information regarding the nature of the tinnitus problem and related problems such as hearing loss and sound intolerance; visual aids to review the audiological/tinnitus/ hyperacusis evaluation, instruction on anatomy and physiology of hearing and tinnitus, introduction to the Jastreboff neurophysiological model of tinnitus and related concepts of habituation, and use of sound therapy and environmental sound in the habituation process.</description>

            <description>The standard of care arm includes care as typically delivered in US military medical centers
The standard of care treatment will be similar to that typically provided to patients with severe tinnitus at participating military medical centers and as described in the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) Preferred Practice Patterns in Audiology (ASHA, 2006). Tinnitus management will be based on the patient's complaints, history, audiologic evaluation, and self-assessment. The goal of the tinnitus management is to reduce negative cognitive, affective, physical, and behavioral reactions to tinnitus and to improve the patient's well-being and quality of life. Specific treatment recommendations will be individualized to reflect the participant's concerns and abilities, as well as his or her engagement in the decision-making process regarding treatment options.</description>

Directive Counseling (DC) involves a one to two-hour educational session during which the participant is given information regarding the nature of the tinnitus problem and related problems such as hearing loss and sound intolerance; visual aids to review the audiological/tinnitus/ hyperacusis evaluation, instruction on anatomy and physiology of hearing and tinnitus, introduction to the Jastreboff neurophysiological model of tinnitus and related concepts of habituation, and use of sound therapy and environmental sound in the habituation process.</description>

            <description>The standard of care arm includes care as typically delivered in US military medical centers
The standard of care treatment will be similar to that typically provided to patients with severe tinnitus at participating military medical centers and as described in the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) Preferred Practice Patterns in Audiology (ASHA, 2006). Tinnitus management will be based on the patient's complaints, history, audiologic evaluation, and self-assessment. The goal of the tinnitus management is to reduce negative cognitive, affective, physical, and behavioral reactions to tinnitus and to improve the patient's well-being and quality of life. Specific treatment recommendations will be individualized to reflect the participant's concerns and abilities, as well as his or her engagement in the decision-making process regarding treatment options.</description>

Directive Counseling (DC) involves a one to two-hour educational session during which the participant is given information regarding the nature of the tinnitus problem and related problems such as hearing loss and sound intolerance; visual aids to review the audiological/tinnitus/ hyperacusis evaluation, instruction on anatomy and physiology of hearing and tinnitus, introduction to the Jastreboff neurophysiological model of tinnitus and related concepts of habituation, and use of sound therapy and environmental sound in the habituation process.</description>

            <description>Partial TRT includes treatment with a placebo sound generator (placebo SG) and directive counseling (DC).
Placebo sound generator (placebo SG): Tranquil model placebo sound generators (General Hearing Instruments, Inc.) are either inside or outside-the-ear devices that generate a sound different from the active devices.
Directive Counseling (DC): two-hour educational session during which the patient is given information regarding the nature of the tinnitus problem and related problems such as hearing loss and sound intolerance; visual aids to review the audiological/tinnitus/ hyperacusis evaluation, provide instruction on anatomy and physiology of hearing and tinnitus, introduce the Jastreboff neurophysiological model of tinnitus and related concepts of habituation, and describe and recommend the use of ST and environmental sound in the habituation process.</description>

            <description>The standard of care arm includes care as typically delivered in US military medical centers
Standard of Care (SC): The standard of care treatment will be similar to that typically provided to patients with severe tinnitus at participating military medical centers and as described in the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) Preferred Practice Patterns in Audiology (ASHA, 2006). Tinnitus management will be based on the patient's complaints, history, audiologic evaluation, and self-assessment. The goal of the tinnitus management is to reduce negative cognitive, affective, physical, and behavioral reactions to tinnitus and to improve the patient's well-being and quality of life. Specific treatment recommendations will be individualized to reflect the participant's concerns and abilities, as well as his or her engagement in the decision-making process regarding treatment options.</description>

            <description>TRT includes sound therapy using a conventional sound generator and educational directive counseling (DC).
The conventional sound generator (SG) is a Tranquil model (General Hearing Instruments, Inc.), worn either inside- or outside-the-ear. The device generates low-level noise and is set at or just below the participant's mixing point (i.e., noise level that just blends with the tinnitus)
Directive Counseling (DC) involves a one to two-hour educational session during which the participant is given information regarding the nature of the tinnitus problem and related problems such as hearing loss and sound intolerance; visual aids to review the audiological/tinnitus/ hyperacusis evaluation, instruction on anatomy and physiology of hearing and tinnitus, introduction to the Jastreboff neurophysiological model of tinnitus and related concepts of habituation, and use of sound therapy and environmental sound in the habituation process.</description>

Directive Counseling (DC): two-hour educational session during which the patient is given information regarding the nature of the tinnitus problem and related problems such as hearing loss and sound intolerance; visual aids to review the audiological/tinnitus/ hyperacusis evaluation, provide instruction on anatomy and physiology of hearing and tinnitus, introduce the Jastreboff neurophysiological model of tinnitus and related concepts of habituation, and describe and recommend the use of ST and environmental sound in the habituation process.</description>

Standard of Care (SC): The standard of care treatment will be similar to that typically provided to patients with severe tinnitus at participating military medical centers and as described in the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) Preferred Practice Patterns in Audiology (ASHA, 2006). Tinnitus management will be based on the patient's complaints, history, audiologic evaluation, and self-assessment. The goal of the tinnitus management is to reduce negative cognitive, affective, physical, and behavioral reactions to tinnitus and to improve the patient's well-being and quality of life. Specific treatment recommendations will be individualized to reflect the participant's concerns and abilities, as well as his or her engagement in the decision-making process regarding treatment options.</description>

            <title>Tinnitus Retraining Therapy</title>
            <description>TRT includes sound therapy using a conventional sound generator and educational directive counseling (DC).
The conventional sound generator (SG) is a Tranquil model (General Hearing Instruments, Inc.), worn either inside- or outside-the-ear. The device generates low-level noise and is set at or just below the participant's mixing point (i.e., noise level that just blends with the tinnitus)
Directive Counseling (DC) involves a one to two-hour educational session during which the participant is given information regarding the nature of the tinnitus problem and related problems such as hearing loss and sound intolerance; visual aids to review the audiological/tinnitus/ hyperacusis evaluation, instruction on anatomy and physiology of hearing and tinnitus, introduction to the Jastreboff neurophysiological model of tinnitus and related concepts of habituation, and use of sound therapy and environmental sound in the habituation process.</description>

            <title>Partial Tinnitus Retraining Therapy</title>
            <description>Partial TRT includes treatment with a placebo sound generator (placebo SG) and directive counseling (DC).
Placebo sound generator (placebo SG): Tranquil model placebo sound generators (General Hearing Instruments, Inc.) are either inside or outside-the-ear devices that generate a sound different from the active devices.
Directive Counseling (DC): two-hour educational session during which the patient is given information regarding the nature of the tinnitus problem and related problems such as hearing loss and sound intolerance; visual aids to review the audiological/tinnitus/ hyperacusis evaluation, provide instruction on anatomy and physiology of hearing and tinnitus, introduce the Jastreboff neurophysiological model of tinnitus and related concepts of habituation, and describe and recommend the use of ST and environmental sound in the habituation process.</description>

            <title>Standard of Care (SC)</title>
            <description>The standard of care arm includes care as typically delivered in US military medical centers
Standard of Care (SC): The standard of care treatment will be similar to that typically provided to patients with severe tinnitus at participating military medical centers and as described in the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) Preferred Practice Patterns in Audiology (ASHA, 2006). Tinnitus management will be based on the patient's complaints, history, audiologic evaluation, and self-assessment. The goal of the tinnitus management is to reduce negative cognitive, affective, physical, and behavioral reactions to tinnitus and to improve the patient's well-being and quality of life. Specific treatment recommendations will be individualized to reflect the participant's concerns and abilities, as well as his or her engagement in the decision-making process regarding treatment options.</description>

            <description>TRT includes sound therapy using a conventional sound generator and educational directive counseling (DC).
The conventional sound generator (SG) is a Tranquil model (General Hearing Instruments, Inc.), worn either inside- or outside-the-ear. The device generates low-level noise and is set at or just below the participant's mixing point (i.e., noise level that just blends with the tinnitus)
Directive Counseling (DC) involves a one to two-hour educational session during which the participant is given information regarding the nature of the tinnitus problem and related problems such as hearing loss and sound intolerance; visual aids to review the audiological/tinnitus/ hyperacusis evaluation, instruction on anatomy and physiology of hearing and tinnitus, introduction to the Jastreboff neurophysiological model of tinnitus and related concepts of habituation, and use of sound therapy and environmental sound in the habituation process.</description>

Placebo sound generator (placebo SG): Tranquil model placebo sound generators (General Hearing Instruments, Inc.) are either inside or outside-the-ear devices that generate a sound different from the active devices.
Directive Counseling (DC): two-hour educational session during which the patient is given information regarding the nature of the tinnitus problem and related problems such as hearing loss and sound intolerance; visual aids to review the audiological/tinnitus/ hyperacusis evaluation, provide instruction on anatomy and physiology of hearing and tinnitus, introduce the Jastreboff neurophysiological model of tinnitus and related concepts of habituation, and describe and recommend the use of ST and environmental sound in the habituation process.</description>

Standard of Care (SC): The standard of care treatment will be similar to that typically provided to patients with severe tinnitus at participating military medical centers and as described in the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) Preferred Practice Patterns in Audiology (ASHA, 2006). Tinnitus management will be based on the patient's complaints, history, audiologic evaluation, and self-assessment. The goal of the tinnitus management is to reduce negative cognitive, affective, physical, and behavioral reactions to tinnitus and to improve the patient's well-being and quality of life. Specific treatment recommendations will be individualized to reflect the participant's concerns and abilities, as well as his or her engagement in the decision-making process regarding treatment options.</description>

Standard of Care (SC): The standard of care treatment will be similar to that typically provided to patients with severe tinnitus at participating military medical centers and as described in the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) Preferred Practice Patterns in Audiology (ASHA, 2006). Tinnitus management will be based on the patient's complaints, history, audiologic evaluation, and self-assessment. The goal of the tinnitus management is to reduce negative cognitive, affective, physical, and behavioral reactions to tinnitus and to improve the patient's well-being and quality of life. Specific treatment recommendations will be individualized to reflect the participant's concerns and abilities, as well as his or her engagement in the decision-making process regarding treatment options.</description>

Standard of Care (SC): The standard of care treatment will be similar to that typically provided to patients with severe tinnitus at participating military medical centers and as described in the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) Preferred Practice Patterns in Audiology (ASHA, 2006). Tinnitus management will be based on the patient's complaints, history, audiologic evaluation, and self-assessment. The goal of the tinnitus management is to reduce negative cognitive, affective, physical, and behavioral reactions to tinnitus and to improve the patient's well-being and quality of life. Specific treatment recommendations will be individualized to reflect the participant's concerns and abilities, as well as his or her engagement in the decision-making process regarding treatment options.</description>

            <description>TRT includes sound therapy using a conventional sound generator and educational directive counseling (DC).
The conventional sound generator (SG) is a Tranquil model (General Hearing Instruments, Inc.), worn either inside- or outside-the-ear. The device generates low-level noise and is set at or just below the participant's mixing point (i.e., noise level that just blends with the tinnitus)
Directive Counseling (DC) involves a one to two-hour educational session during which the participant is given information regarding the nature of the tinnitus problem and related problems such as hearing loss and sound intolerance; visual aids to review the audiological/tinnitus/ hyperacusis evaluation, instruction on anatomy and physiology of hearing and tinnitus, introduction to the Jastreboff neurophysiological model of tinnitus and related concepts of habituation, and use of sound therapy and environmental sound in the habituation process.</description>

Directive Counseling (DC): two-hour educational session during which the patient is given information regarding the nature of the tinnitus problem and related problems such as hearing loss and sound intolerance; visual aids to review the audiological/tinnitus/ hyperacusis evaluation, provide instruction on anatomy and physiology of hearing and tinnitus, introduce the Jastreboff neurophysiological model of tinnitus and related concepts of habituation, and describe and recommend the use of ST and environmental sound in the habituation process.</description>

            <description>TRT includes sound therapy using a conventional sound generator and educational directive counseling (DC).
The conventional sound generator (SG) is a Tranquil model (General Hearing Instruments, Inc.), worn either inside- or outside-the-ear. The device generates low-level noise and is set at or just below the participant's mixing point (i.e., noise level that just blends with the tinnitus)
Directive Counseling (DC) involves a one to two-hour educational session during which the participant is given information regarding the nature of the tinnitus problem and related problems such as hearing loss and sound intolerance; visual aids to review the audiological/tinnitus/ hyperacusis evaluation, instruction on anatomy and physiology of hearing and tinnitus, introduction to the Jastreboff neurophysiological model of tinnitus and related concepts of habituation, and use of sound therapy and environmental sound in the habituation process.</description>

Directive Counseling (DC): two-hour educational session during which the patient is given information regarding the nature of the tinnitus problem and related problems such as hearing loss and sound intolerance; visual aids to review the audiological/tinnitus/ hyperacusis evaluation, provide instruction on anatomy and physiology of hearing and tinnitus, introduce the Jastreboff neurophysiological model of tinnitus and related concepts of habituation, and describe and recommend the use of ST and environmental sound in the habituation process.</description>

Standard of Care (SC): The standard of care treatment will be similar to that typically provided to patients with severe tinnitus at participating military medical centers and as described in the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) Preferred Practice Patterns in Audiology (ASHA, 2006). Tinnitus management will be based on the patient's complaints, history, audiologic evaluation, and self-assessment. The goal of the tinnitus management is to reduce negative cognitive, affective, physical, and behavioral reactions to tinnitus and to improve the patient's well-being and quality of life. Specific treatment recommendations will be individualized to reflect the participant's concerns and abilities, as well as his or her engagement in the decision-making process regarding treatment options.</description>

            <title>Tinnitus Retraining Therapy</title>
            <description>TRT includes sound therapy using a conventional sound generator and educational directive counseling (DC).
The conventional sound generator (SG) is a Tranquil model (General Hearing Instruments, Inc.), worn either inside- or outside-the-ear. The device generates low-level noise and is set at or just below the participant's mixing point (i.e., noise level that just blends with the tinnitus)
Directive Counseling (DC) involves a one to two-hour educational session during which the participant is given information regarding the nature of the tinnitus problem and related problems such as hearing loss and sound intolerance; visual aids to review the audiological/tinnitus/ hyperacusis evaluation, instruction on anatomy and physiology of hearing and tinnitus, introduction to the Jastreboff neurophysiological model of tinnitus and related concepts of habituation, and use of sound therapy and environmental sound in the habituation process.</description>

            <title>Partial Tinnitus Retraining Therapy</title>
            <description>Partial TRT includes treatment with a placebo sound generator (placebo SG) and directive counseling (DC).
Placebo sound generator (placebo SG): Tranquil model placebo sound generators (General Hearing Instruments, Inc.) are either inside or outside-the-ear devices that generate a sound different from the active devices.
Directive Counseling (DC): two-hour educational session during which the patient is given information regarding the nature of the tinnitus problem and related problems such as hearing loss and sound intolerance; visual aids to review the audiological/tinnitus/ hyperacusis evaluation, provide instruction on anatomy and physiology of hearing and tinnitus, introduce the Jastreboff neurophysiological model of tinnitus and related concepts of habituation, and describe and recommend the use of ST and environmental sound in the habituation process.</description>

            <title>Standard of Care (SC)</title>
            <description>The standard of care arm includes care as typically delivered in US military medical centers
Standard of Care (SC): The standard of care treatment will be similar to that typically provided to patients with severe tinnitus at participating military medical centers and as described in the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) Preferred Practice Patterns in Audiology (ASHA, 2006). Tinnitus management will be based on the patient's complaints, history, audiologic evaluation, and self-assessment. The goal of the tinnitus management is to reduce negative cognitive, affective, physical, and behavioral reactions to tinnitus and to improve the patient's well-being and quality of life. Specific treatment recommendations will be individualized to reflect the participant's concerns and abilities, as well as his or her engagement in the decision-making process regarding treatment options.</description>

            <title>Tinnitus Retraining Therapy</title>
            <description>TRT includes sound therapy using a conventional sound generator and educational directive counseling (DC).
The conventional sound generator (SG) is a Tranquil model (General Hearing Instruments, Inc.), worn either inside- or outside-the-ear. The device generates low-level noise and is set at or just below the participant's mixing point (i.e., noise level that just blends with the tinnitus)
Directive Counseling (DC) involves a one to two-hour educational session during which the participant is given information regarding the nature of the tinnitus problem and related problems such as hearing loss and sound intolerance; visual aids to review the audiological/tinnitus/ hyperacusis evaluation, instruction on anatomy and physiology of hearing and tinnitus, introduction to the Jastreboff neurophysiological model of tinnitus and related concepts of habituation, and use of sound therapy and environmental sound in the habituation process.</description>

Placebo sound generator (placebo SG): Tranquil model placebo sound generators (General Hearing Instruments, Inc.) are either inside or outside-the-ear devices that generate a sound different from the active devices.
Directive Counseling (DC): two-hour educational session during which the patient is given information regarding the nature of the tinnitus problem and related problems such as hearing loss and sound intolerance; visual aids to review the audiological/tinnitus/ hyperacusis evaluation, provide instruction on anatomy and physiology of hearing and tinnitus, introduce the Jastreboff neurophysiological model of tinnitus and related concepts of habituation, and describe and recommend the use of ST and environmental sound in the habituation process.</description>

            <description>The standard of care arm includes care as typically delivered in US military medical centers
Standard of Care (SC): The standard of care treatment will be similar to that typically provided to patients with severe tinnitus at participating military medical centers and as described in the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) Preferred Practice Patterns in Audiology (ASHA, 2006). Tinnitus management will be based on the patient's complaints, history, audiologic evaluation, and self-assessment. The goal of the tinnitus management is to reduce negative cognitive, affective, physical, and behavioral reactions to tinnitus and to improve the patient's well-being and quality of life. Specific treatment recommendations will be individualized to reflect the participant's concerns and abilities, as well as his or her engagement in the decision-making process regarding treatment options.</description>

      <desc>The only adverse event systematically collected was depression, assessed as a score of 4 or more or endorsement of suicidal ideation on the Beck Depression Inventory Short Form. This instrument was administered at each study visit (baseline, 3, 6, 12, and 18 months follow-up).
Other adverse events were not systematically collected, but reported at the time of incidence.</desc>

          <title>Tinnitus Retraining Therapy (TRT)</title>
          <description>TRT includes sound therapy using a conventional sound generator and educational directive counseling (DC).
The conventional sound generator (SG) is a Tranquil model (General Hearing Instruments, Inc.), worn either inside- or outside-the-ear. The device generates low-level noise and is set at or just below the participant's mixing point (i.e., noise level that just blends with the tinnitus)
Directive Counseling (DC) involves a one to two-hour educational session during which the participant is given information regarding the nature of the tinnitus problem and related problems such as hearing loss and sound intolerance; visual aids to review the audiological/tinnitus/ hyperacusis evaluation, instruction on anatomy and physiology of hearing and tinnitus, introduction to the Jastreboff neurophysiological model of tinnitus and related concepts of habituation, and use of sound therapy and environmental sound in the habituation process.</description>

          <title>Partial Tinnitus Retraining Therapy (Partial TRT)</title>
          <description>Partial TRT includes treatment with a placebo sound generator (placebo SG) and directive counseling (DC).
The placebo sound generator (SG) is a Tranquil model (General Hearing Instruments, Inc.), worn either inside- or outside-the-ear. The device is set at or just below the participant's mixing point (i.e., noise level that just blends with the tinnitus) and generates a low-level sound different from the active devices.
Directive Counseling (DC) involves a one to two-hour educational session during which the participant is given information regarding the nature of the tinnitus problem and related problems such as hearing loss and sound intolerance; visual aids to review the audiological/tinnitus/ hyperacusis evaluation, instruction on anatomy and physiology of hearing and tinnitus, introduction to the Jastreboff neurophysiological model of tinnitus and related concepts of habituation, and use of sound therapy and environmental sound in the habituation process.</description>

          <title>Standard of Care (SC)</title>
          <description>The standard of care arm includes care as typically delivered in US military medical centers
The standard of care treatment will be similar to that typically provided to patients with severe tinnitus at participating military medical centers and as described in the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) Preferred Practice Patterns in Audiology (ASHA, 2006). Tinnitus management will be based on the patient's complaints, history, audiologic evaluation, and self-assessment. The goal of the tinnitus management is to reduce negative cognitive, affective, physical, and behavioral reactions to tinnitus and to improve the patient's well-being and quality of life. Specific treatment recommendations will be individualized to reflect the participant's concerns and abilities, as well as his or her engagement in the decision-making process regarding treatment options.</description>
