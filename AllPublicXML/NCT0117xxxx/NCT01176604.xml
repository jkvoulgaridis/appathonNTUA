    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well yttrium Y 90 glass microspheres work in treating patients with
      hepatocellular carcinoma that cannot be removed by surgery. Radioactive drugs, such as
      yttrium Y 90 glass microspheres, may carry radiation directly to cancer cells and not harm
      normal cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Provide oversight to treatment with yttrium Y 90 glass microspheres (TheraSphere) to
      eligible patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) of the liver who are not surgical
      resection candidates.

      II. Evaluate patient experience, toxicities and overall survival associated with TheraSphere
      treatment.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive yttrium Y 90 glass microspheres via a catheter over 5 minutes on day 0.
      Patients may receive additional treatments at 4-12 week intervals until all tumors in the
      liver have been treated in the absence of disease progression or unaccepted toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3-6 weeks, then annually for
      up to 2 years.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of unresectable intrahepatic HCC. The histopathology confirmation criterion
             may be waived in patients with a radiographically identifiable liver mass, known
             laboratory or clinical risk factors for cancer or elevated tumor markers such as
             alphafetoprotein (AFP)^21 and clinical findings. Guidelines from the American
             Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the European Association for
             the Study of the Liver (EASL) describe in detail the approach and algorithm for
             diagnosing HCC

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status Score 0 - 2

             aminotransferase (AST) (Serum Glutamic-Oxalocetic Transaminase - SGOT) or alanine

             Normal Limit (UNL)

             or atropine that cannot be corrected or premedicated; Bleeding diathesis, not
             correctable by usual forms of therapy; Severe peripheral vascular disease that would
             preclude catheterization

          -  Evidence of potential delivery of greater than 16.5 mCi (30 Gy absorbed dose) of
             radiation to the lungs in a single treatment

          -  Clinical evidence of pulmonary insufficiency

          -  Evidence of any detectable Technetium-99 Macroaggregated Albumin (Tc-99m MAA) flow to
             the stomach or duodenum, after application of established angiographic techniques to
             stop or mitigate such flow

          -  Complete occlusion of the main portal vein

          -  Significant extrahepatic disease representing an imminent life-threatening outcome

          -  Active uncontrolled infection

          -  Significant underlying medical or psychiatric illness

          -  Co-morbid disease of condition that would preclude safe delivery of TheraSphere
             treatment or, in the judgment of the physician, place the patient at undue risk

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Tumor type demonstrated on imaging to be infiltrative, tumor volume &gt; 70% of the
             target liver volume, or tumor nodules too numerous to count, or tumor volume &gt; 50%
             combined with an albumin &lt; 3 g/dL, or complete occlusion of the main portal vein
