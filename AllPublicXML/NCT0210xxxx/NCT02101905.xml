    <textblock>
      This pilot phase I clinical trial studies how well lapatinib ditosylate before surgery works
      in treating patients with high-grade glioma that has come back after a period of time during
      which the tumor could not be detected. Lapatinib ditosylate may stop the growth of tumor
      cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To achieve an intratumoral lapatinib (lapatinib ditosylate) concentration of at least 1.5
      uM in at least 70% of patients 3 hours after the last dose of pulsatile lapatinib. (Group A)
      II. To determine the pharmacodynamic (PD) effect of pulsatile lapatinib (at pulsatile maximum
      tolerated dose [MTD]) on epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) phosphorylation (using
      Mesoscale Discovery enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] assay for total and
      phospho-EGFR). (Group A and Reference Group)

      SECONDARY/EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      Ia. To evaluate the safety profile of pulsatile lapatinib in pre-operative patients with EGFR
      amplified recurrent high-grade glioma. (Group A and Reference Group) Ib. To evaluate acute
      and late toxicities associated with pulsatile lapatinib. (Group A and Reference Group) II. To
      determine the effect of lapatinib on tumor cell proliferation (marker of proliferation Ki-67
      [KI-67] staining). (Group A compared to Reference Group) III. To determine the ex-vivo
      sensitivity of tumor sphere cultures to lapatinib. (Group A and Reference Group) IV. To
      assess tumor objective response rate (ORR). (Group A and Reference Group) V. To estimate
      overall survival (OS). (Group A and Reference Group) VI. To estimate progression-free
      survival. (Group A and Reference Group)

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups.

      GROUP A: Patients receive lapatinib ditosylate orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days -2 to 0.
      Within 3-5 hours after last dose of lapatinib ditosylate, patients undergo surgical resection
      of tumor on day 0. Within 30 days of surgical resection of tumor, patients receive lapatinib
      ditosylate BID for 2 days every 7 days. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      REFERENCE GROUP: Patients undergo surgical resection of tumor on day 0. Within 30 days of
      surgical resection of tumor, patients receive lapatinib ditosylate BID for 2 days every 7
      days. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for at 30 days, every 2 months
      for 2 years, and every 6 months thereafter.

          -  Patients with a history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar
             chemical or biologic composition to lapatinib are ineligible

          -  Patients with prior therapy with EGFR inhibitors are ineligible because treatment with
             EGFR kinase inhibitors or other EGFR-targeted agents has the potential to deplete the
             tumor of EGFR-amplified or EGFR mutant cell populations and confound the evaluation of
             lapatinib effects on EGFR phosphorylation; patients with prior EGFRvIII vaccine are
             eligible if recurrent tumor is positive for EGFR gene amplification

          -  Patients on enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drugs (EIAED) are not eligible for
             treatment on this protocol; patients may be on non-enzyme inducing anti-epileptic
             drugs or not be taking any anti-epileptic drugs; patients previously treated with
             EIAED may be enrolled if they have been off the EIAED for 10 days or more prior to the
             first dose of lapatinib

             unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations
             that would limit compliance with study requirements, are ineligible

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because lapatinib has potential for
             teratogenic or abortifacients effects; because there is an unknown but potential risk
             for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with
             lapatinib, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with
             lapatinib

          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients on strong cytochrome P450, family
             3, subfamily A, polypeptide 4 (CYP3A4) inducers or inhibitors are ineligible

             biliary disease are ineligible (with the exception of patients with Gilbert's
             syndrome, asymptomatic gallstones, liver metastases from the primary brain tumor, or
             stable chronic liver disease per investigator assessment)

          -  Patients receiving P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors are ineligible

          -  Patients who are receiving a drug that has a risk of QTc prolongation if QTc is &gt;= 460
             msec. are ineligible
