  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of eleclazine (GS-6615)
      compared to placebo on the overall occurrence of appropriate implantable
      cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) interventions (antitachycardia pacing [ATP] or shock) in
      adults with ICD or cardiac resynchronization therapy-defibrillator (CRT-D).

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Premature Ventricular Complex (PVC) Count as Assessed by Continuous Electrocardiogram (cECG) Monitoring</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>PVC count per 48 hours was obtained from cECG readings at Baseline and Week 12. Change in PVC from baseline was measured in units of number of episodes/48 hours. Change from baseline was calculated as the value at Week 12 minus the value at Baseline.</description>

    <description>The count of nsVTs per 48 hours was obtained from cECG readings at Baseline and Week 12. Change in nsVT from baseline was measured in units of number of episodes/48 hours. Change from baseline was calculated as the value at Week 12 minus the value at Baseline.</description>

    <measure>Change in Left Ventricular Systolic and Diastolic Function as Assessed by Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12; Baseline to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>LVEF is a measure of how much blood is pumped out of the left ventricle of the heart. Change from baseline was calculated as the value at Week 12 or 24 minus the value at Baseline.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time From First Dose of Study Drug to the First Occurrence of Appropriate ICD Interventions (ATP or Shock) or Cardiovascular (CV) Death</measure>
    <time_frame>From first dose of study drug up to 22 months</time_frame>
    <description>CV deaths were determined through the adjudication by an external independent clinical event committee (CEC). The deaths that were adjudicated as undetermined were considered cardiovascular related. For each participant, the time from the first dose of study drug to the beginning of the earliest appropriate ICD intervention through the last day on study or, in absence of appropriate ICD interventions, to a CV death was derived as (first event date - first dose date + 1). The participants without appropriate ICD interventions or CV death were censored at the last day on study. As planned, data was reported only for Cohort 2 and combined Cohorts 1 and 2. Time to first occurrence of an appropriate ICD interventions or CV death was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimates.</description>

    <description>CV hospitalizations, CV ER visits, and CV deaths were determined through the adjudication by the CEC. The events that were adjudicated as undetermined were considered cardiovascular related. For each participant, the time from the first dose of study drug to the first CV hospitalization or CV ER visit through the last day on study or, in absence of CV hospitalizations or CV ER visits, to a CV death were derived as (first event date - first dose date + 1).

        <description>CV deaths were determined through the adjudication by an external independent clinical event committee (CEC). The deaths that were adjudicated as undetermined were considered cardiovascular related. For each participant, the time from the first dose of study drug to the beginning of the earliest appropriate ICD intervention through the last day on study or, in absence of appropriate ICD interventions, to a CV death was derived as (first event date - first dose date + 1). The participants without appropriate ICD interventions or CV death were censored at the last day on study. As planned, data was reported only for Cohort 2 and combined Cohorts 1 and 2. Time to first occurrence of an appropriate ICD interventions or CV death was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimates.</description>
