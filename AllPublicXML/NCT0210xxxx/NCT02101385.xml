      OUTLINE: This is a multi-center trial.

      SEQUENCING:

      DNA from archived tumor samples collected at the time of surgery (residual disease post
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy) will be extracted and sequenced. The resulting sequencing data will
      be interrogated for known genomic drivers of sensitivity or resistance to existing FDA
      approved agents.

      CANCER GENOMICS TUMOR BOARD (CGTB):

      Realizing that optimal treatment recommendations cannot be made based on sequencing data
      alone, the CGTB will be responsible for the final treatment recommendation. The CGTB will
      consider the genomic data along with the patient's prior treatment history, ongoing
      toxicities, and comorbidities. Preference will be given to the treatment identified by the
      sequencing data unless a significant clinical or safety contraindication exists for that
      therapy. All participants and investigators will be blinded to sequencing results and CGTB
      deliberations until the time of relapse.

      PARTICIPANTS WITH A CGTB TREATMENT RECOMMENDATION:

      Participants with a CGTB recommendation will be randomized to Experimental Arm A (genomically
      directed monotherapy) or Control Arm B (standard therapy).

      EXPERIMENTAL ARM A (GENOMICALLY DIRECTED MONOTHERAPY):

      Participants randomized to Experimental Arm A will receive an FDA approved drug at standard
      dose for four cycles (12-16 weeks total duration, depending on cycle length). Clinical and
      laboratory monitoring and dose-reductions will follow the FDA package insert guidelines.

      TOP GENOMIC ACTIONABLE BIOMARKERS/PATHWAYS AND DRUG RECOMMENDATIONS:

        1. PIK3CA, PTEN: Everolimus

        2. TOP2A: Doxorubicin

        3. PARP1, BRCA1: Cisplatin and Olaparib

        4. VEGFA: Bevacizumab

        5. TYMP: Capecitabine

        6. SSTR2: Octreotide

        7. MGMT: Temozolomide

        8. MYC: Paclitaxel

        9. EGFR: Cetuximab

       10. COX2: Celecoxib

       11. hENT: Gemcitabine

       12. MET: Crizotinib

      CONTROL ARM B (STANDARD THERAPY); Recently, a randomized phase III trial of over 900
      HER2-negative patients demonstrated an improvement in disease-free survival (DFS) and overall
      survival (OS) for the addition of 8 cycles of capecitabine in the post-neoadjuvant setting.
      The hazard ratios were also significant in the triple negative subgroup. Thus, capecitabine
      can be considered a standard option in this setting. As this represents only a single trial
      (with prior data not demonstrating benefit for the addition of capecitabine in the
      neoadjuvant nor adjuvant settings in unselected patients), observation can be considered an
      option as directed by the treating physician. While not recommended, other therapies can be
      used as deemed appropriate by the treating physician.

      In the event of disease progression on the control arm, patient sequencing results will be
      forwarded to the treating physician.

      PARTICIPANTS WITH NO CGTB RECOMMENDATION:

      Participants may have no CGTB recommendation either because 1) sequencing did not identify a
      matched drug or 2) the matched drug was contraindicated. These participants will be assigned
      to Control Arm B and treated as described above for Control Arm B. As the outcome of
      participants without an 'actionable' genomically directed therapy may differ, the primary
      analysis will include only participants randomized to Control Arm B.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must have histologically or cytologically confirmed triple negative (ER-/PR-/HER2-)
             invasive breast cancer, clinical stage I-III at diagnosis (AJCC 6th edition) based on
             initial evaluation by physical examination and/or breast imaging prior to study
             registration. NOTE: ER, PR and HER2 status will be confirmed by central pathology
             review prior to randomization. ER and PR will be considered negative if ≤ 1% of cells
             stain weakly positive. HER2 will be considered negative if scored 0 or 1+ by
             immunohistochemistry (IHC) or 2+ by IHC associated with a fluorescence in situ
             hybridization (FISH) ratio of &lt; 2.0 or &lt; 6 copies per cell.

          -  Must have completed preoperative (neoadjuvant) chemotherapy. NOTE: Acceptable
             preoperative regimens include an anthracycline or a taxane, or both. Participants who
             received preoperative therapy as part of a clinical trial may enroll. Participants may
             not have received adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery prior to randomization.
             Bisphosphonate use is allowed.

          -  Must have completed definitive resection of primary tumor. The most recent surgery for
             breast cancer must have been completed at least 14 days prior (but no more than 84
             days prior) to study registration. NOTE: Negative margins for both invasive and ductal
             carcinoma in situ (DCIS) are desirable, however participants with positive margins may
             enroll if the treatment team believes no further surgery is possible and patient has
             received radiotherapy. Participants with margins positive for lobular carcinoma in
             situ (LCIS) are eligible. Either mastectomy or breast conserving surgery (including
             lumpectomy or partial mastectomy) is acceptable.

          -  Must have significant residual invasive disease at the time of definitive surgery
             following preoperative chemotherapy. Significant residual disease is defined as at
             least one of the following:

               -  Residual Cancer Burden (RBC) classification II or III6

               -  Residual invasive disease in the breast measuring at least 2 cm. The presence of
                  DCIS without invasion does not qualify as residual disease in the breast.

               -  Residual invasive disease in the breast measuring at least 1cm with any lymph
                  node involvement (does not include metastases in lymph node which are only
                  detected by immunohistochemistry).

               -  Any lymph node involvement that results in 20% cellularity or greater regardless
                  of primary tumor site involvement (includes no residual disease in the breast).

          -  Must have an FFPE tumor block with tumor cellularity of 20% or greater. NOTE: Prior to
             randomization, the tumor cellularity will be confirmed by central pathology review and
             percent values will be double checked at Paradigm (a Next Generation Sequencing
             Company).

          -  BREAST RADIOTHERAPY:

               -  Whole breast radiotherapy is required for participants who underwent
                  breast-conserving therapy, including lumpectomy or partial mastectomy.
                  Participants must have completed radiotherapy at least 14 days prior (but no more
                  than 84 days prior) to study registration.

               -  Post-mastectomy radiotherapy is required for all participants with a primary
                  tumor ≥ 5 cm or involvement of ≥ 4 lymph nodes. For participants with primary
                  tumors &lt; 5 cm or with &lt; 4 involved lymph nodes, provision of post-mastectomy
                  radiotherapy is at the discretion of the treating physician. Study registration
                  must occur within 84 days of completion of radiation.

               -  For radiation required prior to surgery, the participant must register within 84
                  days of surgery. Also, participants in this situation would not be required to
                  have additional post-mastectomy radiation therapy.

               -  For those participants who do not require radiation, registration must be within
                  84 days of surgery.

          -  Age ≥ 18 years at the time of consent.

          -  Written informed consent and HIPAA authorization for release of personal health
             information. HIPAA authorization may be included in the informed consent or may be
             obtained separately. NOTE: Central pathology review may be conducted any time after
             definitive surgery. Consenting participants may be pre-registered to the study and
             proceed with central pathology review before full eligibility has been confirmed.
             However ALL of the eligibility criteria must be met and formal study registration
             completed prior to submission of the sample for sequencing.

          -  Must consent to allow submission of adequate archived tumor tissue sample from
             definitive surgery for genomic assessment of tumor.

          -  Must consent to collection of whole blood samples for genomic analysis

          -  Women and men of childbearing potential must be willing to use an effective method of
             contraception (e.g. hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) from the
             time consent is signed until 4 weeks after protocol therapy discontinuation.

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 30 days
             prior to study registration. Women should be counseled regarding acceptable birth
             control methods to utilize from the time of screening to start of treatment. If prior
             to treatment after discussion with the subject it is felt by the treating physician
             there is a possibility the subject is pregnant a pregnancy test should be repeated.

        Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 30 days prior to
        study registration.

          -  Women must not be breastfeeding.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  No stage IV (metastatic) disease, however no specific staging studies are required in
             the absence of symptoms or physical exam findings that would suggest distant disease.

          -  No treatment with any investigational agent within 30 days prior to study
             registration.

          -  No history of chronic hepatitis B or or untreated hepatitis C.

          -  No clinically significant infections as judged by the treating physician.

          -  No active second malignancy (except non-melanomatous skin cancer or incidental
             prostate cancer found on cystectomy): Active second malignancy is defined as a current
             need for cancer therapy or a high possibility (&gt; 30%) of recurrence during the study.
             Previous contralateral breast cancer is allowable unless it meets &quot;active&quot; criteria as
             stated above.
