    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of RBP-7000 compared with
      placebo in the treatment of patients with schizophrenia.

      This will be a double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase III study with 90 mg and 120 mg doses
      of RBP-7000 compared with placebo over an 8-week treatment period.

    <measure>Mixed Model for Repeated Measures (MMRM) Analysis of Change From Baseline to End of Treatment in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 prior to treatment (Baseline), Days 15, 29, 43 and 57 or early discontinuation</time_frame>
    <description>The PANSS is a 30-item scale designed to assess various symptoms of schizophrenia including delusions, grandiosity, blunted affect, poor judgement, poor attention, and poor impulse control. The 30 symptoms are rated on a 7-point scale that ranges from 1 (absent) to 7 (extreme psychopathology). The PANSS total score is the sum of all 30 PANSS items and ranges from 30 to 210, with 30 indicating absence of symptoms of schizophrenia and 210 indicating extreme ratings of all 30 symptoms. Negative change from baseline scores indicate improvements in symptoms.
Estimates (least square means and standard errors), 2-sided confidence intervals, and -1-sided P values are based on a repeated-measures linear regression model of the change from baseline score, with fixed effects for visit as a categorical variable, baseline score, treatment and treatment by visit interaction, assuming an unstructured covariance matrix.</description>

    <measure>Mixed Model for Repeated Measures (MMRM) Analysis of Change From Baseline to End of Treatment in Clinical Global Impression - Severity Scale (CGI-S)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 prior to treatment (Baseline), Days 15, 29, 43 and 57 or early discontinuation</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-S rating scale is a 7-point global assessment that measures the clinician's impression of the severity of illness exhibited by a participant. A rating of 1 is equivalent to &quot;Normal, not at all ill&quot; and a rating of 7 is equivalent to &quot;Among the most extremely ill participants&quot;. Negative change from baseline scores indicate improvement in the severity of illness.
Estimates (least square means and standard errors), 2-sided confidence intervals, and -1-sided P values are based on a repeated-measures linear regression model of the change from baseline score, with fixed effects for visit as a categorical variable, baseline score, treatment and treatment by visit interaction, assuming an unstructured covariance matrix.</description>

    <measure>Summary of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any study-related event that represents a change (positive or negative) in frequency or severity from a baseline (prestudy) event (if any), regardless of the presence of causal relationship or medical significance. Treatment-emergent adverse events are defined as any adverse event with a start date on or after the first study dose date. AEs are determined by the Investigator to be related or not related to the study drug.
A serious AE (SAE) is defined by federal regulation as any AE occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes: death, life-threatening AE, hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Although a subject may have had 2 or more adverse experiences the subject is counted only once in a category. The same subject may appear in different categories.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 538 subjects were screened for study participation at 33 sites in the US, including 354 subjects randomly assigned to treatment. Four subjects were found to be randomized incorrectly; therefore, they were withdrawn from the study and did not receive study drug (counted as 'Physician Decision' for reason d/c below).</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Mixed Model for Repeated Measures (MMRM) Analysis of Change From Baseline to End of Treatment in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Total Score</title>
        <description>The PANSS is a 30-item scale designed to assess various symptoms of schizophrenia including delusions, grandiosity, blunted affect, poor judgement, poor attention, and poor impulse control. The 30 symptoms are rated on a 7-point scale that ranges from 1 (absent) to 7 (extreme psychopathology). The PANSS total score is the sum of all 30 PANSS items and ranges from 30 to 210, with 30 indicating absence of symptoms of schizophrenia and 210 indicating extreme ratings of all 30 symptoms. Negative change from baseline scores indicate improvements in symptoms.
Estimates (least square means and standard errors), 2-sided confidence intervals, and -1-sided P values are based on a repeated-measures linear regression model of the change from baseline score, with fixed effects for visit as a categorical variable, baseline score, treatment and treatment by visit interaction, assuming an unstructured covariance matrix.</description>

        <title>Summary of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE)</title>
        <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any study-related event that represents a change (positive or negative) in frequency or severity from a baseline (prestudy) event (if any), regardless of the presence of causal relationship or medical significance. Treatment-emergent adverse events are defined as any adverse event with a start date on or after the first study dose date. AEs are determined by the Investigator to be related or not related to the study drug.
A serious AE (SAE) is defined by federal regulation as any AE occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes: death, life-threatening AE, hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Although a subject may have had 2 or more adverse experiences the subject is counted only once in a category. The same subject may appear in different categories.</description>
