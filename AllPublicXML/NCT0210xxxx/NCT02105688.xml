  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2-part study. The purpose of Part A is to assess the efficacy and safety of
      grazoprevir (MK-5172) 100 mg in combination with elbasvir (MK-8742) 50 mg for 12 weeks in the
      treatment of chronic HCV GT1, GT4, or GT6 infection in treatment-naïve participants who are
      on opiate substitution therapy (OST). The primary hypothesis is that the percentage of
      participants who receive grazoprevir/elbasvir fixed-dose combination (FDC) in the Immediate
      Treatment Arm and achieve a Sustained Virologic Response 12 weeks after the end of all study
      therapy (SVR12) will be superior to 67%. In addition, participants who received at least 1
      dose of grazoprevir/elbasvir in Part A will be eligible to participate in Part B, which is a
      3-year observational follow-up.

    <time_frame>12 weeks after end of all therapy (Study Week 24 for Immediate Treatment Arm and Study Week 40 for Deferred Treatment Arm)</time_frame>
    <description>Blood was drawn from each participant to assess Hepatitis C Virus ribonucleic acid (HCV RNA) plasma levels using the Roche COBAS® AmpliPrep/COBAS® Taqman HCV Test, v2.0, which had a lower limit of quantification of 15 IU/mL. SVR12 was defined as HCV RNA below the lower limit of detection (&lt;LLOQ) at 12 weeks after the end of all study therapy for baseline infection, or HCV RNA≥ LLOQ demonstrated to be due to reinfection (after clearance of baseline infection). The Clopper-Pearson method was used to construct 95% confidence intervals for the SVR12 rate. The primary efficacy analysis for Part A was the percentage of participants in the immediate treatment arm (ITA) who achieved SVR12. SVR12 was also calculated for the Deferred Treatment Arm.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Experiencing at Least One Adverse Event (AE) During the Double-Blind (DB) Treatment Period and First 14 Follow-up Days</measure>
    <time_frame>DB Treatment period plus first 14 follow-up days (up to Study Week 14)</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which did not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening of a pre-existing condition that was temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor's product, was also an AE. For this outcome measure, the primary safety analysis compared the percentage of participants experiencing an AE in the Immediate Treatment Arm during the double-blinded active treatment period to that of the Deferred Treatment Arm during the double-blinded placebo treatment period.</description>

    <description>Blood was drawn from each participant to assess HCV RNA plasma levels using the Roche COBAS® AmpliPrep/COBAS® Taqman HCV Test, v2.0, which has an LLOQ of 15 IU/mL. SVR24 was defined as HCV RNA &lt;LLOQ at 24 weeks after the end of all study therapy. The Clopper-Pearson method was used to construct 95% confidence intervals for the SVR24 rate. The secondary efficacy analysis for Part A evaluated the percentage of participants in the immediate treatment arm (ITA) who achieved SVR24.

        <description>Blood was drawn from each participant to assess Hepatitis C Virus ribonucleic acid (HCV RNA) plasma levels using the Roche COBAS® AmpliPrep/COBAS® Taqman HCV Test, v2.0, which had a lower limit of quantification of 15 IU/mL. SVR12 was defined as HCV RNA below the lower limit of detection (&lt;LLOQ) at 12 weeks after the end of all study therapy for baseline infection, or HCV RNA≥ LLOQ demonstrated to be due to reinfection (after clearance of baseline infection). The Clopper-Pearson method was used to construct 95% confidence intervals for the SVR12 rate. The primary efficacy analysis for Part A was the percentage of participants in the immediate treatment arm (ITA) who achieved SVR12. SVR12 was also calculated for the Deferred Treatment Arm.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Experiencing at Least One Adverse Event (AE) During the Double-Blind (DB) Treatment Period and First 14 Follow-up Days</title>
        <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which did not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening of a pre-existing condition that was temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor's product, was also an AE. For this outcome measure, the primary safety analysis compared the percentage of participants experiencing an AE in the Immediate Treatment Arm during the double-blinded active treatment period to that of the Deferred Treatment Arm during the double-blinded placebo treatment period.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving Sustained Virologic Response 24 Weeks After the End of All Study Therapy (SVR24)</title>
        <description>Blood was drawn from each participant to assess HCV RNA plasma levels using the Roche COBAS® AmpliPrep/COBAS® Taqman HCV Test, v2.0, which has an LLOQ of 15 IU/mL. SVR24 was defined as HCV RNA &lt;LLOQ at 24 weeks after the end of all study therapy. The Clopper-Pearson method was used to construct 95% confidence intervals for the SVR24 rate. The secondary efficacy analysis for Part A evaluated the percentage of participants in the immediate treatment arm (ITA) who achieved SVR24. SVR24 was also calculated for the Deferred Treatment Arm.</description>
