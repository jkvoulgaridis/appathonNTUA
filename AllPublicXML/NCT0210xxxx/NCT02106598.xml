  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current imaging devices usually detect cancer prior to surgery. However, these devices cannot
      be used during the surgical procedure to visualize lymph nodes with cancer (called &quot;sentinel
      lymph nodes&quot;). The groups are for head and neck melanoma, colorectal and breast cancers. As a
      part of the standard of care, the they will initially undergo imaging of their lymph nodes
      prior to their surgery. Melanoma patients will be injected with a radioactive dye around the
      tumor site, and images will be acquired about 2 hours the location of the later using a
      device to image the dye. In addition, the investigators will test, for the first time in
      humans, a new, experimental dye-labeled particle (dots), cRGDY-PEG-Cy5.5-C dots for lymph
      node mapping. This particle, the size of a small protein, will be injected around sites of
      melanoma before or during your surgery to identify diseased nodes using a hand-held camera
      system. The dye-labeled particle can be viewed in tissues that may contain tumor. Based upon
      the clinical diagnosis, the patient may have a procedure called Reverse Lymphatic Mapping,
      which is a new form of sentinel lymph node mapping. The doctor will discuss this with the
      patient. If the patient is undergoing reverse lymphatic mapping, they will have the
      experimental particle injected into their hand or foot (based on their tumor type) and the
      standard of care injection will be injected around the tumor. This will allow the surgeon to
      remove only the lymph nodes that directly link to the tumor. The particles will not treat the
      cancer and any images or information found during this study will not be used for your
      treatment. The information collected may be used to guide the design of future studies to
      detect and/or treat tumors. For breast cancer patients the purpose of this study is to test
      if cRGDY-PEG-Cy5.5-C dots that can be used to take pictures of breast cancer. As a part of
      the standard of care, the patient will initially undergo imaging of the lymph nodes prior to
      surgery. Prior to your surgery, you will be injected with a radioactive dye around the tumor
      site, and images will be acquired. Physicians will test, for the first time in humans, a new,
      experimental dye-labeled particle (dots), cRGDY-PEG-Cy5.5-C dots for lymph node mapping. This
      particle, the size of a small protein, will be injected around sites of the umor before or
      during surgery to identify nodes using a hand-held camera system. The dye-labeled particle
      can be viewed in tissues that may contain tumor.

    <description>Participants will be investigated comprising 2 different regions of the body (breast and colorectal malignancies). Each cohort will be analyzed separately to assess the feasibility of conducting pre-operative SLN mapping using real-time optical detection procedures and intradermal single- or double-dose injection/s of non-radioactive cRGDY-PEGCy5.5-C dots about the primary tumor site.</description>

    <description>Patients with early oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma, and prior to standard of care wide local resection of the primary tumor and elective neck dissection, will receive a locally-administered, peritumoral injection of fluorescent cRGDY-PEG-Cy5.5-C dots (0.25 - 1 ml) around the primary lesion while under standard-of-care anesthesia for identification of optically-avid SLNs and to assess for metastatic disease. After completion of the neck dissection, nodal specimens will be examined ex vivo for fluorescence signal. Any fluorescent and non-fluorescent nodes will be compared to determine the true positive and false positive rates for cancer detection in this pilot study. No change in standard of care surgical practice will occur.</description>
