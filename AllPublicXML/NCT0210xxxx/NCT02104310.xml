  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For most brain tumors, radiation treatment is guided by a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
      scan. In this study, information from a special scan, called a Positron Emission Tomography/
      Computed Tomography (PET/CT) scan using an amino acid called
      Fluorine-18-L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (18F-DOPA) will also be used. This type of scan has
      shown promise in being able to better distinguish tumor from normal brain tissue and may help
      to more accurately plan radiation treatment. This type of scan can also assist the radiation
      oncologist in identifying the most aggressive regions of the tumor. The goal of this study is
      to compare the 18F-DOPA PET/CT scan with the MRI scan for identifying where the disease is
      that needs to be treated with radiation.
