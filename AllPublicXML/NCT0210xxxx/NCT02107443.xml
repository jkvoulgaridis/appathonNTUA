  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over 60% of cancers occur in older persons, and the number of older persons with cancer is
      expected to grow as the population ages. Oncology clinical trials have traditionally excluded
      older patients with advanced cancer and chronic health conditions. In this context, where
      data is limited and risk from treatment is high, older patients with advanced cancer and
      their caregivers must understand how cancer treatment can affect quality of life in light of
      underlying health status. Better communication about age-related health conditions between
      oncologists, older patients with advanced cancer, and their caregivers may improve
      decision-making for cancer treatment and quality of life. A geriatric assessment (GA), a
      validated set of patient-centered outcomes, has been shown to identify concerns (e.g.,
      function, cognition) important to older persons with cancer and their caregivers. In this
      cluster randomized clinical trial we examined whether providing a web-generated GA summary
      with targeted recommendations to older patients with advanced cancer, their caregivers, and
      their oncologists can improve communication about age-related concerns that could affect
      efficacy and tolerance of cancer treatment. We also determined whether the intervention
      improves patient-reported quality of life and patient and caregiver satisfaction.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Primary Aim - Direct Communication about Age-related Concerns: To determine if providing
      GA summary plus GA-driven recommendations to patients, their caregivers, and oncology
      physicians increases discussions about age-related issues during clinic consultation.
      [Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) specified]

      II. Primary Aim - Patient Satisfaction with Communication about Age-related Concerns: To
      determine if providing geriatric assessment (GA) summary plus GA-driven recommendations to
      patients, their caregivers and oncology physicians improves patient satisfaction with
      communication with the oncology physician regarding age-related concerns. [National Cancer
      Institute (NCI) specified]

      III. Secondary Aim - To determine whether initially providing patients, their caregivers, and
      oncology physicians with GA summary plus GA-driven recommendations prior to their treatment
      influences quality of life of older patients receiving treatment and their caregivers.

      IV. Secondary Aim - To determine whether providing patients, their caregivers, and oncology
      physicians with GA summary plus GA-driven recommendations influences caregiver satisfaction
      with communication about age-related issues.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      Arm I: At the first study visit with their oncologist, patients and their caregivers (if
      participating) complete the GA and receive the GA summary plus GA targeted recommendations
      which is provided to the oncology team to discuss and implement if they so choose.

      Arm II: At the first study visit with their oncologist, patients and their caregivers (if
      participating) complete the GA (no GA summary or recommendations are provided).

      Patients are followed at 4-6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months. Survival data will be collected
      at 1 year after enrollment.

    <measure>Direct Communication About Age-related Concerns: Number of Discussions Related to the Geriatric Assessment That Occur in the Clinic Visit Between the Patient, Oncology Physician, and Caregiver. [Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute Specified]</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>A geriatric assessment (GA), a validated set of patient-centered outcomes, has been shown to identify concerns (e.g., function, cognition) important to older persons with cancer and their caregivers. The geriatric assessment was used to define which age related topics discussed between patients and providers would be coded. Will apply linear mixed model methodology. The total number of conversations will be the response, and the arm will be the fixed effect. Estimation will be performed using Restricted Maximum Likelihood, and the null hypothesis of zero mean difference between arms will be tested using the Kenward-Roger small sample procedure. A 95% credible (&quot;confidence&quot;) interval will be obtained from the posterior distribution. The specific practice site differences will be assessed graphically using the Best Linear Unbiased Predictors (BLUP) of the mean response for each site.</description>

    <measure>Patient Satisfaction With Communication About Age-related Concerns: Measured by Health Care Climate Questionnaire (HCCQ). [NCI Specified]</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 1-7 days of the baseline audio-recorded clinic consultation</time_frame>
    <description>Will apply linear mixed model methodology. The total HCCQ scores will be the response, and the arm will be the fixed effect. HCCQ contains 7 questions, scale: 0-28. The higher the score the more satisfied the patients is with communication with their oncologists about age related concerns. Estimation will be performed using Restricted Maximum Likelihood, and the null hypothesis of zero mean difference between arms will be tested using the Kenward-Roger small sample procedure. 95% credible (&quot;confidence&quot;) interval will also be obtained from the posterior distribution. The specific practice site differences will be assessed graphically using Best Linear Unbiased Predictors (BLUP) of the mean response for each site.</description>

    <measure>Geriatric Assessment (GA) Summary and GA Targeted-recommendations Provided to Patients, Caregivers and Oncology Physicians Prior to Their Treatment Influences Quality of Life of Older Patients Receiving Treatment and Their Caregivers.</measure>
    <time_frame>At 4-6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months following the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Patient HRQoL will be assessed with the Functional Assessment Cancer therapy (FACT-G) and Caregiver HRQoL (burden) will be assessed with the Caregiver Reactions Assessment (CRA). We will include geriatric assessment impairment (at baseline and follow up) to evaluate if these influence patient-reported HRQoL differently in the intervention versus the usual care group. We will also compare whether the uptake of the geriatric assessment recommendations influences patient reported HRQoL and caregiver burden. Data from the intervention arm will be fit to a linear mixed model with the FACT-G or CRA as the outcome, number and percent (number implemented/number recommended) of interventions as the fixed effect, and National Cancer Institute Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) site as a random effect independent of residual error. Analyses will be adjusted for treatment status.</description>

    <description>We will compare the effect of the intervention on caregiver satisfaction (the modified health care climate questionnaire-age for the caregiver). Will apply linear mixed model methodology. The total caregiver-HCCQ scores will be the response, and the arm will be the fixed effect.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria for Patients

          -  Male or female 70 years of age or older

          -  Diagnosis of an advanced solid tumor malignancy (advanced cancer) or lymphoma. In most
             situations, this would be a stage IV cancer. A patient with a diagnosis of stage III
             cancer or lymphoma is eligible if cure is not possible or anticipated. Clinical
             staging without pathological confirmation of advanced disease is allowed.

          -  Must be considering or currently receiving any kind of cancer treatment (any line),
             including but not limited to hormonal treatment, chemotherapy, monoclonal antibody
             therapy, or targeted therapy. Patients who are considering therapy are eligible even
             if they ultimately choose not to be on therapy. Patients with a history of any
             previous cancer treatment, including radiation and/or surgery are eligible. A patient
             may also be enrolled on a treatment trial and participate in this study, if all other
             inclusion and exclusion criteria are met.

          -  Have at least one geriatric assessment domain meet the cut-off score for impairment
             other than polypharmacy.

          -  Have visits planned with the oncology physician for at least 3 months and be willing
             to come in for study visits.

          -  Able to provide informed consent or, if the oncology physician determines the patient
             to not have decision-making capacity, a patient-designated health care proxy (per
             institutional policies) must sign consent by the baseline visit.

          -  Subject has adequate understanding of the English language because not all GA measures
             have been validated in other languages.

        Exclusion Criteria for Patients

          -  Have surgery planned within 3 months of consent. Patients who have previously received
             surgery are eligible.

          -  Have already made a decision to not undergo any cancer treatment (e.g., being followed
             in best supportive care or hospice).

        Inclusion Criteria for Caregivers

          -  Selected by the patient when asked if there is a &quot;family member, partner, friend or
             caregiver [age 21 or older] with whom you discuss or who can be helpful in
             health-related matters;&quot; patients who cannot identify such a person (&quot;caregiver&quot;) can
             be eligible for the study. A caregiver need not be someone who lives with the patient
             or provides direct hands-on care. A caregiver can be any person who provides support
             (in any way) to the patient.

          -  If a health care proxy signs consent for or with a patient, and wants to participate
             in the caregiver portion of the study, this same person will always be the caregiver
             selected. If a health care proxy does not want to enroll as a caregiver in the study
             or, if enrolled, chooses to stop their own participation in the caregiver portion of
             the study, but is able to assist the patient in completing the study, the patient can
             still participate. In other words, the health care proxy can choose NOT to participate
             in the caregiver portion of the study. This does not preclude the patient from
             participating in the patient portion of the study with the health care proxy's
             assistance.

        Exclusion Criteria for Caregivers

        -Caregivers unable to understand the consent form due to cognitive, health, or sensory
        impairment will be excluded.

        <title>Direct Communication About Age-related Concerns: Number of Discussions Related to the Geriatric Assessment That Occur in the Clinic Visit Between the Patient, Oncology Physician, and Caregiver. [Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute Specified]</title>
        <description>A geriatric assessment (GA), a validated set of patient-centered outcomes, has been shown to identify concerns (e.g., function, cognition) important to older persons with cancer and their caregivers. The geriatric assessment was used to define which age related topics discussed between patients and providers would be coded. Will apply linear mixed model methodology. The total number of conversations will be the response, and the arm will be the fixed effect. Estimation will be performed using Restricted Maximum Likelihood, and the null hypothesis of zero mean difference between arms will be tested using the Kenward-Roger small sample procedure. A 95% credible (&quot;confidence&quot;) interval will be obtained from the posterior distribution. The specific practice site differences will be assessed graphically using the Best Linear Unbiased Predictors (BLUP) of the mean response for each site.</description>

        <title>Geriatric Assessment (GA) Summary and GA Targeted-recommendations Provided to Patients, Caregivers and Oncology Physicians Prior to Their Treatment Influences Quality of Life of Older Patients Receiving Treatment and Their Caregivers.</title>
        <description>Patient HRQoL will be assessed with the Functional Assessment Cancer therapy (FACT-G) and Caregiver HRQoL (burden) will be assessed with the Caregiver Reactions Assessment (CRA). We will include geriatric assessment impairment (at baseline and follow up) to evaluate if these influence patient-reported HRQoL differently in the intervention versus the usual care group. We will also compare whether the uptake of the geriatric assessment recommendations influences patient reported HRQoL and caregiver burden. Data from the intervention arm will be fit to a linear mixed model with the FACT-G or CRA as the outcome, number and percent (number implemented/number recommended) of interventions as the fixed effect, and National Cancer Institute Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) site as a random effect independent of residual error. Analyses will be adjusted for treatment status.</description>

        <description>We will compare the effect of the intervention on caregiver satisfaction (the modified health care climate questionnaire-age for the caregiver). Will apply linear mixed model methodology. The total caregiver-HCCQ scores will be the response, and the arm will be the fixed effect. Estimation will be performed using Restricted Maximum Likelihood, and the null hypothesis of zero mean difference between arms will be tested using the Kenward-Roger small sample procedure. A 95% credible (&quot;confidence&quot;) interval will also be obtained from the posterior distribution. The specific practice site differences will be assessed graphically using Best Linear Unbiased Predictors (BLUP) of the mean response for each site.</description>
