  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Safety and pharmacokinetics of an abuse-deterrent, extended-release formulation of morphine
      sulfate with a sequestered naltrexone core in children 7-17 with moderate-severe pain.

    <textblock>
      Subjects, once stabilized to Embeda, need only complete a minimum of 2 of the 6 week study
      duration to satisfy the PK endpoint. A safety follow-up visit is required at 1 week post-last
      dose.

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Pfizer released from post-marketing commitment and study terminated because too few patients in
    the age group; not because of efficacy or safety issues.

    <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study treatment without regard to possibility of causal relationship. SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death, initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization, life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying), persistent or significant disability or incapacity, congenital anomaly. A treatment emergent AE was defined as an event that emerged during the treatment period that was absent before treatment, or worsened during the treatment period relative to the pretreatment state. AEs included both serious and non-serious adverse events.</description>

Scores category: 0 to 4 = none to minimal, 5 to 12 = mild, 13 to 24 = moderate, 25 to 36 = moderately severe withdrawal and 37 to 48 = severe withdrawal. Participants experiencing a COWS score greater than equal to (&gt;=) 13 is treated for opiate withdrawal signs and symptoms according to the investigator's medical judgment. In this outcome measure, participants as per COWS score categories are reported. Only those COWS categories are presented which had at least 1 participant for any reporting arm.</description>

        <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study treatment without regard to possibility of causal relationship. SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death, initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization, life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying), persistent or significant disability or incapacity, congenital anomaly. A treatment emergent AE was defined as an event that emerged during the treatment period that was absent before treatment, or worsened during the treatment period relative to the pretreatment state. AEs included both serious and non-serious adverse events.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events According to Severity: Week 5 to Week 10</title>
        <description>An adverse event was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. AE was assessed according to severity; mild (does not interfere with participant's usual function), moderate (interferes to some extent with participant's usual function) and severe (interferes significantly with participant's usual function). A treatment emergent AE was defined as an event that emerged during the treatment period that was absent before treatment, or worsened during the treatment period relative to the pretreatment state. AEs included both serious and non-serious adverse events.</description>

        <description>COWS is a clinician-administered instrument, to assess participants' clinical opiate withdrawal level. The scale ranges from 0 (none symptoms) to 48 (severe symptoms), higher score = more severe withdrawal. Scores category: 0 to 4 = none to minimal, 5 to 12 = mild, 13 to 24 = moderate, 25 to 36 = moderately severe withdrawal and 37 to 48 = severe withdrawal. Participants experiencing a COWS score greater than equal to (&gt;=) 13 is treated for opiate withdrawal signs and symptoms according to the investigator's medical judgment. In this outcome measure, participants as per COWS score categories are reported. Only those COWS categories are presented which had at least 1 participant for any reporting arm.</description>

        <description>COWS is a clinician-administered instrument, to assess participants' clinical opiate withdrawal level. The scale ranges from 0 (none symptoms) to 48 (severe symptoms), higher score = more severe withdrawal. Scores category: 0 to 4 = none to minimal, 5 to 12 = mild, 13 to 24 = moderate, 25 to 36 = moderately severe withdrawal and 37 to 48 = severe withdrawal. Participants experiencing a COWS score greater than equal to (&gt;=) 13 is treated for opiate withdrawal signs and symptoms according to the investigator's medical judgment. In this outcome measure, participants as per COWS score categories are reported. Only those COWS categories are presented which had at least 1 participant for any reporting arm.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS) at Week 4</title>
        <description>COWS is a clinician-administered instrument, to assess participants' clinical opiate withdrawal level. The scale ranges from 0 (none symptoms) to 48 (severe symptoms), higher score = more severe withdrawal. Scores category: 0 to 4 = none to minimal, 5 to 12 = mild, 13 to 24 = moderate, 25 to 36 = moderately severe withdrawal and 37 to 48 = severe withdrawal. Participants experiencing a COWS score greater than equal to (&gt;=) 13 is treated for opiate withdrawal signs and symptoms according to the investigator's medical judgment. In this outcome measure, participants as per COWS score categories are reported. Only those COWS categories are presented which had at least 1 participant for any reporting arm.</description>

      <desc>Same event may appear as both an AE and SAE. However, what is presented are distinct events. An event may be categorized as serious in 1 participant and as non-serious in another, or a participant may have experienced both a serious and non-serious event. The study was terminated early therefore the number of participants is small and safety data (all-cause mortality, SAE and other AEs) are presented by dose group.</desc>
