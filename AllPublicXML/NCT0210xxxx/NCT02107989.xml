      Objectives:

      The overall study objective is to compare the sensitivities and specificities of morphometric
      analysis techniques using structural MRI images based on pre- and postsurgical localization
      of epileptic foci in patients undergoing presurgical evaluation for medically refractory
      epilepsy. To carry out these analyses, we aim to establish an age-stratified normative
      imaging database using healthy volunteers. Additional objectives are to identify abnormal
      networks in these patients using resting state fMRI/EEG and MEG/EEG, and to use language and
      memory fMRI tasks to examine the effects of epileptogenic zones and surgery on cognitive
      function and the networks associated with these functions.

      Study population:

      300 adults and children (age 8-65) with uncontrolled focal epilepsy, and 200 age-stratified
      healthy volunteers.

      Design: A retrospective and prospective natural history study. Research procedures for
      patients in this study include neuropsychological testing and 1-4 MRI sessions during
      presurgical evaluation and an additional 1-3 MRI sessions and neuropsychological testing
      approximately 12 months post-operatively. Research testing (such as research
      neuropsychological tests or MRI scanning sequences) will be done during a visit for clinical
      testing whenever possible, likely reducing the number of required visits. Patients will also
      have optional MEG and 7T structural imaging. Data will also be obtained from patients who
      have already undergone epilepsy surgery if they had procedures as outlined in the protocol
      and are willing to share the data. Healthy volunteers will receive a subset of the
      pre-operative procedures for patients, requiring at least 3 visits. In order to ensure
      adequate data acquisition, subjects may be re-scanned up to three times for the portions of
      the study in which they participated, possibly requiring additional visits.

      Outcome measures:

      The main outcomes will be establishment of normative values for morphometric analysis methods
      in age-stratified normal controls, and comparison of the sensitivity and specificity of these
      measures to pre- and postsurgical localization of the epileptogenic zone. Secondary outcome
      measures will include determination of the sensitivity and specificity of source localization
      using MEG/EEG and resting state fMRI/EEG, and to evaluate changes in activation during rest,
      as well as language and memory fMRI tasks in patients pre- and postsurgically, to examine the
      effects of epileptogenic zones and surgery on cognitive function and the networks underlying
      these functions.

    <description>MEG/EEG:
Magnetoencephalogra phy (MEG) is commonly used during epilepsy pre- surgical evaluations to help with localizing epileptic foci. MEG will be obtained as clinically indicated, usually in patients with unclear seizure focus localization who are undergoing presurgical evaluation, particularly when they have frequent interictal discharges on EEG. MEG records very small magnetic fields generated by the brain at rest, or in response to a task or to epileptic activity. Resting state MEG/EEG analysis will be used for research purposes only.</description>
