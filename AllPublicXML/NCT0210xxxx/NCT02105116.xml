      This pilot clinical trial studies if cells donated by a close genetic relative can help
      maintain acute myeloid leukemia (AML) complete remission (CR). Eligible patients will receive
      a standard induction chemotherapy. If a complete remission results they will receive
      irradiated allogeneic cells from a HLA haploidentical relative. Only patients who obtain a CR
      after the standard induction chemotherapy are eligible for the experimental therapy
      (irradiated haploidentical cells).

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Toxicity of haploidentical allogeneic cellular therapy in patients in complete remission
      (CR) (or CR with incomplete platelet recovery [CRp]) after induction chemotherapy with
      fludarabine (fludarabine phosphate)-cytarabine.

      II. Efficacy of haploidentical allogeneic cellular therapy in patients in CR (or CRp) after
      induction chemotherapy with fludarabine-cytarabine (remission rates at 6, 12, 18, 24 months).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Immunologic parameters before and after haploidentical therapy: host anti-leukemia T
      cells; host regulatory T cells.

      OUTLINE:

      INDUCTION CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV) over 1 hour
      once daily (QD) for 5 days and cytarabine IV over 4 hours for 5 days. Treatment may continue
      for 1 or 2 courses at the discretion of the treating physician.

      ALLOGENEIC CELLULAR THERAPY: Patients undergo irradiated donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) of 3
      x 10^8 cluster of differentiation (CD)3+ cells/kg at 8 weeks. Patients with stable disease
      may repeat irradiated DLI every 8-12 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for up to 2 years.

    <measure>Adverse Events Related to Experimental Therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be observed for incidence of adverse events related to experimental therapy, graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0.
Of the 6 patients enrolled, all were ineligible to enter the experimental treatment phase of the study because of failure to reach complete remission. None of the enrolled patients received experimental therapy (allogeneic donor lymphocyte therapy). The one death occurred while receiving standard therapy prior to eligibility for experimental allogeneic therapy. The remained of patients were ineligible for experimental therapy because they did not obtain a complete remission after standard induction chemotherapy.</description>

    <description>Patients' response rate will be determined by allogeneic cell therapy-related mortality. Of the 6 patients enrolled, all were ineligible to enter the experimental treatment phase of the study for failure to reach complete remission. Hence no outcomes are available.</description>

    <measure>Response Rate, Determined by Duration of Complete Remission</measure>

        <description>Patients will be observed for incidence of adverse events related to experimental therapy, graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0.
Of the 6 patients enrolled, all were ineligible to enter the experimental treatment phase of the study because of failure to reach complete remission. None of the enrolled patients received experimental therapy (allogeneic donor lymphocyte therapy). The one death occurred while receiving standard therapy prior to eligibility for experimental allogeneic therapy. The remained of patients were ineligible for experimental therapy because they did not obtain a complete remission after standard induction chemotherapy.</description>
