      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of low-dose total lymphoid
      irradiation (LD-TLI) in treating patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease that has not
      responded to treatment with steroids. LD-TLI is a procedure in which all of the body's major
      lymph nodes are treated with small doses of radiation in order to reset the dysfunctional
      immune system. LD-TLI may work as a treatment for graft-versus-host disease caused by a bone
      marrow or stem cell transplant.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety of total lymphoid irradiation (TLI) in cohorts of a selected
      population of refractory chronic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) patients, given to cohorts
      with a total cumulative doses of TLI of 100, 150, 200, 250 or 300 centigray (cGy).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the efficacy (failure free survival [FFS] at 6 months) of this therapy in the
      study population.

      II. Approximate the efficacy at different dose levels using the GvHD summary scores.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the effect of this therapy on relevant subpopulations of immune cells in an
      attempt to elucidate a mechanism of action.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients undergo LD-TLI daily for 1-2 days.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up on day 45, at 3 and 6 months,
      at 1 year, and then every 6 months thereafter.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients may have received a prior allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant
             (alloHSCT) for any indication and from any donor

          -  Patients must have a diagnosis of cGvHD, in accordance with National Institutes of
             Health (NIH) guidelines; patients with &quot;overlap syndrome&quot; are also eligible; NOTE:
             Patients with recurrent, late onset and/or persistent acute GvHD (alone) are not
             eligible

          -  Patients with chronic GvHD who have been exposed to two or more lines of therapy,
             including at least one of which was composed of a glucocorticoid and a calcineurin
             inhibitor are eligible.

          -  Patients must have active, but not rapidly progressive, refractory cGvHD; any degree
             of severity (as per NIH criteria) and/or pattern of organ involvement may be
             considered; that said, patients with more severe and/or extensive chronic GvHD are
             expected to be the usual candidates for therapy

          -  As above, GvHD should be controlled to a degree that would potentially allow no
             additional requirement for systemic IST before and following TLI =&lt; -15 and &gt;= day (d)
             +45, respectively

          -  The ability to administer protocol doses of TLI (i.e., 100, 200 or 300 cGy) without
             exceeding cumulative doses of radiation must be established; for patients with prior
             radiotherapy exposure, this determination will be made by Dr. Greven (or her designee)
             using published guidelines for excessive organ exposure

          -  Karnofsky performance status (KPS) &gt;= 60%

          -  White blood cells &gt;= 3,000/mcL

          -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1,500/mcL

          -  Hemoglobin &gt;= 10.0 g/dL

          -  Platelets &gt;= 100,000/mcL

          -  NOTE: If such hematologic abnormalities are present and deemed due to the process of
             cGvHD, such requirements may be waived with the approval of the PI

          -  Patients must have non-hematologic organ function as defined below:

               -  Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &gt; 40%

               -  Key pulmonary function tests (PFTs) &gt; 40%

                    -  No further criteria for non-hematologic organ function are specified;
                       however, if moderate-to-severe (major) organ function is present, such
                       should be discussed with the PI, as various degrees of non-hematologic organ
                       dysfunction may compromise either (or both) outcomes and toxicity evaluation

                    -  If there is concern regarding potential reversibility of any specific organ
                       dysfunction, this issue should be addressed by consultation with an
                       appropriate sub-specialist

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign an institutional review board
             (IRB)-approved informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with evidence of persistent or active malignancy or uncontrolled infection at
             the time of study entry

          -  Patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding
