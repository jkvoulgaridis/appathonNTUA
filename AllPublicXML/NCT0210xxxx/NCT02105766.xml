      Background:

      - Some sickle cell disease or beta-thalassemia can be cured with transplant. Researchers want
      to test a variation of transplant that uses low dose radiation and a combination of
      immunosuppressive drugs. They want to know if it helps a body to better accept donor stem
      cells.

      Objectives:

      - To see if low dose radiation (300 rads), oral cyclophosphamide, pentostatin, and sirolimus
      help a body to better accept donor stem cells.

      Eligibility:

      - People 4 and older with beta-thalassemia or sickle cell disease that can be cured with
      transplant, and their donors.

      Design:

        -  Participants and donors will be screened with medical history, physical exam, blood
           test, tissue and blood typing, and bone marrow sampling. They will visit a social
           worker.

        -  Donors:

        -  may receive an intravenous (IV) tube in their groin vein.

        -  will receive a drug injection daily for 5 or 6 days to move the blood stem cells from
           the bone marrow into general blood circulation.

        -  will undergo apheresis: an IV is put into a vein in each arm. Blood is taken from one
           arm, a machine removes the white blood cells that contain blood stem cells, and the rest
           is returned through the other arm.

        -  Participants:

        -  may undergo red cell exchange procedure.

        -  will remain in the hospital for about 30 days.

        -  will receive a large IV line that can stay in their body from transplant through
           recovery.

        -  will receive a dose of radiation, and transplant related drugs by mouth or IV.

        -  will receive blood stem cells over 8 hours by IV.

        -  will take neuropsychological tests and may complete questionnaires throughout the
           transplant process.

        -  must stay near NIH for 4 months. They will visit the outpatient clinic weekly.

        -  will have 5 follow-up visits for 3 years after transplant, then annually.

      Our ongoing nonmyeloablative allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplant protocol
      (03-H-0170) for patients with severe sickle cell disease (SCD) and B-thalassemia from
      HLA-matched family donors has excellent results thus far. Our long term leukocyte engraftment
      rate is 85-90% with the same disease-free survival. None of the engrafted patients had acute
      sickle-related events, significant toxicity associated with the conditioning regimen, or any
      evidence of graft versus host disease (GVHD).

      While these results rival the transplant outcomes from low risk transplant patients with
      B-thalassemia, there are areas for improvement. The first is the 10-15% graft rejection rate,
      where a majority of these individuals were male donor and female recipient pairs. Another
      limitation is the significant delay in donor red cell engraftment in one recipient who had
      pre-existing allo-antibody to donor red cells from previous transfusions. Also we have
      excluded another group of individuals with preformed antibodies, recipients having major ABO
      incompatibility to the donors.

      To overcome these limitations (and reduce the transplant failure rate) in this new protocol,
      we will continue our nonmyeloablative approach in the patients with SCD and B-thalassemia
      with HLA-matched family donors, but using an increased intensity regimen in a subset
      considered at high risk for transplant failure. This modified regimen consists of pentostatin
      and oral cyclophosphamide, which we hypothesize will reduce both the T cells that mediate
      leukocyte rejection and the B/plasma cells that produce anti-donor erythrocyte antibodies.
      The main transplant backbone will remain as alemtuzumab, low dose total body irradiation of
      300 cGy, and sirolimus; the transplant graft will remain as unmanipulated G-CSF mobilized,
      T-cell replete, PBSC product for hematopoietic and lymphoid reconstitution.

      The primary endpoint of this study is the percentage/number of patients who have sustained
      donor type hemoglobin at 1 year post transplant for male donors - female recipients. The
      primary endpoint for those with pre-existing antibodies is the presence of donor red cells
      with reticulocytes greater than or equal to 30 k/uL at 2 years post-transplant. Other
      endpoints include the toxicity of the pentostatin-cyclophosphamide regimen, the degree of
      donor-host chimerism necessary for long-term graft survival and disease amelioration,
      incidence of acute and chronic GVHD, incidence of graft rejection, transplant-related
      morbidity, as well as disease-free and overall survival. Since SCD and B-thalassemia are
      non-malignant disorders of red cells, severe GVHD, lack of donor erythrocyte (prolonged donor
      red cell aplasia), or graft rejection is collectively considered transplant failure.

    <description>The second cohort of patients will be patients with preexisting antibodies (major ABO mismatch or otheranti-donor red cell antibody). The primary endpoint forthis group will be different than the first cohort. It is very likely that red cell aplasia (6 months to 2 years posttransplant) and prolonged duration of red cell transfusion are expected in this second group, thus a later time point to determine treatment success is justified.</description>
