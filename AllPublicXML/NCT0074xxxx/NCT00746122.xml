  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to assess whether a strategy of endovascular repair (if aortic
      morphology is suitable, open repair if not) versus open repair reduces early mortality for
      patients with suspected ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rupture of the main blood vessel of the body in the abdomen (ruptured abdominal aortic
      aneurysm) is fatal in over three-quarters of cases. In the past, those that survive have
      reached hospital alive and undergone emergency open surgery to repair the aneurysm and stop
      the bleeding: however, after this major emergency surgery only half the patients leave
      hospital alive. A newer, less-invasive method of aneurysm repair, endovascular repair, is
      based on repairing the aneurysm by inserting the repair graft up through one of the arteries
      in the groin. Endovascular repair has been tested in the elective situation and is associated
      with a 3-fold reduction in operative mortality versus the standard open surgery. Early work
      with selected patients has suggested that endovascular repair may be associated with up to a
      2-fold reduction in operative mortality and more rapid recovery for ruptured abdominal aortic
      aneurysms. However, only 55-70% patients are anatomically suitable for endovascular repair.

      Therefore, this research aims to determine whether a strategy of preferential emergency
      endovascular repair reduces both the mortality and cost of ruptured abdominal aortic
      aneurysm.

      Critically ill patients with a clinical diagnosis of ruptured aneurysm will be randomised, in
      the emergency room, to a strategy of endovascular repair if possible (endovascular first) or
      to current standard care (immediate transfer to the operating theatre for emergency open
      surgery). Patients randomised to &quot;endovascular first&quot; will require a specialist radiological
      examination (computed tomography, CT scan) to assess anatomical suitability and plan for
      endovascular repair. This will cause a short delay before definitive repair can be commenced.
      Those patients not suitable for endovascular repair, after CT scan, will be taken for
      standard open surgery. Patients will be randomised at 16-20 specialist centres in the United
      Kingdom (UK), who have already attained sufficient experience in using endovascular repair
      for ruptured aneurysms and can offer a routine service.

      The primary outcome measure is 30-day operative mortality, which we hope will improve by 14%
      with the &quot;endovascular first&quot; strategy (from 47% to 33%). Secondary outcome measures include
      24h, in-hospital and 1-year and 3-year mortality, re-interventions associated with the two
      treatment strategies as well as quality of life, costs and cost-effectiveness.

      The research team includes specialists in clinical trials, health economics, statistics,
      pre-hospital &amp; emergency care, interventional radiology, vascular &amp; endovascular surgery,
      critical care, aneurysm research and a service user.

    <description>QALYs are a product of length of life and quality of life, since both of these are important to patients. Therefore, it is a measure of the state of health of a person or group in which the benefits, in terms of length of life, are adjusted to reflect the quality of life. One QALY is equal to 1 year of life in perfect health.
QALYs are calculated by estimating the years of life remaining for a patient following a particular treatment or intervention and weighting each year with a quality-of-life score (on a 0 to 1 scale). It is often measured in terms of the person's ability to carry out the activities of daily life, and freedom from pain and mental disturbance.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical suspicion of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm after review in Accident and
             Emergency (or other hospital unit).

          -  Men and women over the age of 50 years will be recruited.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with known connective tissue disorders (eg Marfan syndrome) where
             endovascular repair may not be beneficial.

          -  Patients with known previous repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm, because
             procedures either open or endovascular are likely to be very complex and there are no
             guidelines for anatomical restriction to repair.

          -  Deeply unconscious and moribund patients since the chances of recovery are minimal.

        <title>Quality-adjusted Life Years (QALYs) to Enable Cost-effectiveness Evaluation</title>
        <description>QALYs are a product of length of life and quality of life, since both of these are important to patients. Therefore, it is a measure of the state of health of a person or group in which the benefits, in terms of length of life, are adjusted to reflect the quality of life. One QALY is equal to 1 year of life in perfect health.
QALYs are calculated by estimating the years of life remaining for a patient following a particular treatment or intervention and weighting each year with a quality-of-life score (on a 0 to 1 scale). It is often measured in terms of the person's ability to carry out the activities of daily life, and freedom from pain and mental disturbance.</description>

      <desc>Death during pre-op CT scan This is an emergency trial where patients die without surgery. This trial compared two types of surgery, endovascular repair and open surgery. The strategy of endovascular repair requires the patient to have a pre-operative CT scan, which may cause a slight delay in reaching the operating theatre. Therefore, the only major adverse event considered during this trial was death during CT scan.</desc>
