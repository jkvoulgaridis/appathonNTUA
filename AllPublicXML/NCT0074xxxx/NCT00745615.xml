  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multinational, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group active
      extension of LAQ/5062 study (NCT00349193), assessing the tolerability, safety and efficacy of
      two doses (0.3 mg and 0.6 mg) of laquinimod, orally administered in participants with
      relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), followed by an open-label phase of laquinimod
      0.6 mg daily. This study is LAQ/5063 (i.e., double-blind extension) and LAQ/5063 OL (i.e.,
      subsequent open-label extension). - The first period of the extension study is an active,
      double-blind period. Participants from the active treatment arms in LAQ/5062 continue their
      assigned treatment in blinded fashion. Participants who were assigned to placebo treatment in
      LAQ/5062 are equally randomized in blinded-fashion to laquinimod 0.6 mg or laquinimod 0.3 mg.
      - Once termination visit of LAQ/5063 active double-blind phase (completion of the full 36
      weeks or as requested by the Sponsor) is performed, all participants continue on laquinimod
      0.6 mg daily as an open-label intervention. The open-label period continues as long as the
      Sponsor continues the development of laquinimod 0.6 mg for RRMS or early discontinuation.

    <time_frame>At the end of active double-blind phase or termination/early termination visit (up to Week 36)</time_frame>
    <description>EDSS (developed by John F. Kurtzke) is a scale for assessing disability in 8 functional systems (visual, brain stem, pyramidal, cerebellar, sensory, bowel and bladder, cerebral, and other functions). Each functional system score and an overall score ranges from 0 to 10, where 0 = Normal; 1-1.5 = No disability, but some abnormal neurological signs; 2-2.5 = Minimal disability; 3-4.5 = Moderate disability, affecting daily activities, but can still walk; 5-8 = More severe disability, impairing daily activities and requiring assistance with walking; 8.5-9.5 = Very severe disability, restricting to bed; 10 = Death due to MS. A lower score indicated less disability.</description>

        corticosteroids within 30 days prior to entering the open-label phase, except for IV
        methylprednisolone 1 grams/day for a maximum of 3 days, in the period from termination of

        and/or warfarin within 2 weeks prior to entering LAQ/5063 OL, in the period from
        termination of LAQ/5063 active double-blind phase to LAQ/5063 OL. - Use of amiodarone in
        the period from termination of LAQ/5063 active double-blind phase to LAQ/5063 OL. -

      <recruitment_details>This study is LAQ/5063 (i.e., double-blind extension) and LAQ/5063OL (i.e., subsequent open-label extension). Participants who completed double-blind core study LAQ/5062 (NCT00349193) and agreed to continue in active extension study were enrolled in this study.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Double-blind extension: Participants treated with placebo in LAQ/5062 study were equally randomized to one of 2 groups: Laquinimod 0.6 mg or Laquinimod 0.3 mg. Participants previously treated with laquinimod 0.6 mg or laquinimod 0.3 mg continued on their original treatment. Open-label extension: All participants received laquinimod 0.6 mg.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. Serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. AEs included both SAEs and non-serious AEs. A summary of other non-serious AEs and all SAEs, regardless of causality is located in the 'Reported AE section'.</description>

        <title>Double-Blind Period: Relapse Rate: Total Number of Confirmed Relapses</title>
        <description>Relapse was defined as the appearance of one or more new neurological abnormalities or the reappearance of one or more previously observed neurological abnormalities, lasting for at least 48 hours (in the absence of fever or any infection) and immediately preceded by an improving neurological state of at least 30 days from onset of previous relapse. An event was counted as a relapse only when the participant's symptoms were accompanied by observed objective neurological changes, consistent with an increase of at least 0.5 in the Expanded disability status scale (EDSS); or one grade in the score of 2 or more of the 7 Functional Systems (FS) (excluding changes in bowel or bladder function or cognition); or 2 grades in the score of one of the FS as compared to the previous evaluation. EDSS assesses disability in 8 functional systems with an overall score ranging from 0 (normal) to 10 (death due to multiple sclerosis [MS]).</description>

        <title>Double-Blind Period: Kurtzke's Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) Score</title>
        <description>EDSS (developed by John F. Kurtzke) is a scale for assessing disability in 8 functional systems (visual, brain stem, pyramidal, cerebellar, sensory, bowel and bladder, cerebral, and other functions). Each functional system score and an overall score ranges from 0 to 10, where 0 = Normal; 1-1.5 = No disability, but some abnormal neurological signs; 2-2.5 = Minimal disability; 3-4.5 = Moderate disability, affecting daily activities, but can still walk; 5-8 = More severe disability, impairing daily activities and requiring assistance with walking; 8.5-9.5 = Very severe disability, restricting to bed; 10 = Death due to MS. A lower score indicated less disability.</description>
