  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well radiation therapy and capecitabine with or
      without curcumin before surgery works in treating patients with rectal cancer. Drugs such as
      curcumin may make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as capecitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,
      either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving chemotherapy with
      radiation therapy before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal
      tissue that needs to be removed. It is not yet known whether chemotherapy and radiation
      therapy is more effective with or without curcumin when given before surgery in patients with
      rectal cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the efficacy of a combination of capecitabine and radiation therapy with or
      without curcumin in locally advanced rectal cancer as assessed by pathological complete
      response rate.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine downstaging, local control, disease-free survival and overall survival rates.

      II. To determine serum and rectal tumor tissue pharmacology of curcumin and its metabolites
      in the above patients and its correlation with clinical response.

      III. To identify surrogate molecular markers for curcumin effects. IV. To correlate serum
      cytokine levels with quality of life in patients receiving this therapy.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo radiation therapy 5 days a week for a total of 28 fractions. Patients
      also receive capecitabine orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on the days of radiation therapy and
      curcumin PO BID in weeks 1-11.5.

      ARM II: Patients undergo radiation therapy and receive capecitabine as in Arm I. Patients
      also receive placebo PO BID in weeks 1-11.5.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 month.
