  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the long term effects of early intervention
      (placement into foster care) on physical, cognitive, social and brain development and
      psychiatric symptomatology in previously institutionalized children.

      The Bucharest Early Intervention Project (BEIP) was a randomized controlled trial of foster
      care as an intervention for children abandoned at or around the time of birth and placed in
      one of six institutions for young children in Bucharest, Romania (Zeanah et al., 2003). The
      PI (Nelson) and Co-PIs (Zeanah and Fox) conducted this study beginning in the fall of 2000
      from baseline assessments and implementation of the intervention in the spring of 2001.

      The BEIP began with comprehensive assessments of 136 institutionalized children and their
      caregiving environments prior to randomization. Half the children were randomly assigned to
      high-quality foster care and the other half to remain in institutional care. The average age
      at foster care placement was 22 months (range=6-31 months). All children were initially seen
      prior to randomization and again for follow-up assessments at 30 months, 42 months 54 months,
      8 years and 12 years of age. The development of children in foster care was compared to the
      development of children in institutions and to a group of never institutionalized children
      (community controls). These children are being assessed at age 16 years.

    <description>A group of children living in institutions in Bucharest, Romania was randomly assigned to placement in foster care. Foster parents were recruited, consented to background checks, and trained in Romanian. Before placement, foster parents visited their children to begin developing a relationship with the child. Hired foster parents were supported and monitored by project social workers. Foster parents in the BEIP network received frequent visits from the social workers, with visits occurring weekly for several months after placement of the child, then biweekly and later monthly. Foster parents were invited to participate in a support group organized by social workers. Project social workers consulted weekly with US staff experienced in dealing with young children in foster care.</description>
