    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the safety, as assessed by incidence of
      dose limiting toxicity (DLT), of talimogene laherparepvec in combination with pembrolizumab
      in adults with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1b/3, multicenter, clinical trial conducted in 2 parts (phase 1b and phase
      3). In phase 1b talimogene laherparepvec is to be administered in combination with
      pembrolizumab to adults with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck
      (SCCHN). Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is to be evaluated based on the first 18 DLT-evaluable
      participants. An expansion cohort of up to an additional 22 treated patients could be
      enrolled to further evaluate the safety and to estimate the efficacy of the combination of
      talimogene laherparepvec with pembrolizumab and to support a decision to initiate the phase 3
      part of the study. The phase 3 part of the study is designed as a multicenter, randomized,
      doubleblind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy, as assessed by overall
      survival, of treatment with talimogene laherparepvec with pembrolizumab versus placebo with
      pembrolizumab in adults with recurrent or metastatic SCCHN.

    <description>The following toxicities (graded per the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v 4.0) were considered DLTs if judged by the investigator to be related to either study drug:
grade 4 non-hematologic (non-laboratory) toxicity
≥ grade 3 pneumonitis
grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity for &gt; 3 days with optimal supportive care
grade 3 fatigue was not classified as DLT, regardless of duration
any ≥ grade 3 non-hematologic laboratory value if:
medical intervention was required,
the abnormality led to hospitalization, or
the abnormality persisted at ≥ grade 3 for &gt; 1 week unless deemed not clinically important by investigator and sponsor
grade 3 or 4 febrile neutropenia
thrombocytopenia &lt; 25 x 10⁹/L associated with bleeding event requiring intervention
serious herpetic event: herpetic encephalitis, encephalomyelitis, or disseminated herpetic infection
grade 5 toxicity
other intolerable toxicity leading to permanent discontinuation of either study drug.</description>

          <description>Talimogene laherparepvec was administered by intralesional injection into injectable cutaneous, subcutaneous, and nodal lesions at an initial dose of 10⁶ plaque-forming units (PFU) per mL on day 1 followed by a dose of 10⁸ PFU/mL every 3 weeks (Q3W) thereafter. Pembrolizumab was administered by intravenous infusion at a dose of 200 mg Q3W.
Participants were treated until complete response, no injectable lesions, confirmed disease progression, intolerance of study treatment, 24 months from the date of the first dose of talimogene laherparepvec, or end of study, whichever occurred first.</description>

Complete response (iCR): Disappearance of all lesions (whether measurable or not and whether baseline or new) and confirmation by a repeat, consecutive assessment no less than 4 weeks from the date first documented was required. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm.
Partial response (iPR): Decrease in tumor burden ≥ 30% relative to baseline. Confirmation by a consecutive assessment at least 4 weeks after first documentation required.
Analyses are presented below for both the unconfirmed and confirmed results.</description>

        <description>Best overall visit response of iCR, iPR, stable disease (iSD), progressive disease (iPD) or unevaluable (iUE) based on investigator assessment using irRECIST.
iCR: Disappearance of all lesions (whether measurable or not and whether baseline or new). Any pathological lymph nodes (target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm.
iPR: Decrease in tumor size ≥ 30% relative to baseline. iPD: Increase in tumor size ≥ 20% and at least 5 mm absolute increase compared to nadir or qualitative worsening of non-target lesions or a new lesion.
iSD: Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for iCR or iPR nor sufficient increase to qualify for iPD.
iUE: Any baseline lesion which was not assessed or was unable to be evaluated leading to an inability to determine the status of that particular tumor.
Not Done: Radiographic imaging was not performed to evaluate the response. iCR, iPR, and iPD required confirmation by a consecutive assessment at least 4 weeks after first documentation.</description>

          <description>Best overall visit response of iCR, iPR, stable disease (iSD), progressive disease (iPD) or unevaluable (iUE) based on investigator assessment using irRECIST.
iCR: Disappearance of all lesions (whether measurable or not and whether baseline or new). Any pathological lymph nodes (target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm.
iPR: Decrease in tumor size ≥ 30% relative to baseline. iPD: Increase in tumor size ≥ 20% and at least 5 mm absolute increase compared to nadir or qualitative worsening of non-target lesions or a new lesion.
iSD: Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for iCR or iPR nor sufficient increase to qualify for iPD.
iUE: Any baseline lesion which was not assessed or was unable to be evaluated leading to an inability to determine the status of that particular tumor.
Not Done: Radiographic imaging was not performed to evaluate the response. iCR, iPR, and iPD required confirmation by a consecutive assessment at least 4 weeks after first documentation.</description>

    <certain_agreements>
      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>The Clinical Trial Agreement generally does not restrict an investigator's discussion of trial results after completion. The Agreement permits Amgen a limited period of time to review material discussing trial results (typically up to 45 days and possible extension). Amgen may remove confidential information, but authors have final control and approval of publication content. For multicenter studies, the investigator agrees not to publish any results before the first multi-center publication.</restrictive_agreement>
