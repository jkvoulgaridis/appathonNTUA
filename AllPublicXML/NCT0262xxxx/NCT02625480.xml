    <description>The PRO scores will be measured by the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) for children and adolescents and European Quality-of-Life-5 Dimension (EQ-5D) for all participants.
The PedsQL comprises of 23 items in the dimensions of physical, emotional, social, and school functioning. Transformed total, physical health summary, and psychosocial health summary scores range from 0-100 with higher scores indicating better health-related quality of life.
The EQ-5D is a generic questionnaire for assessing the participant's overall health status. The EQ-5D consists of a 5 dimension descriptive system including mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/comfort, and anxiety/depression and a visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS) which allows the respondent to record health. The VAS allows a participant to indicate self-reported health on a vertical scale, ranging from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state). The PedsQL scores and EQ-5D scores will be reported.</description>
