  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The InSeal vascular closure device (VCD) is assessed as percutaneous closure of artery access
      sites for quick hemostasis and ambulation in patients who have undergone large bore
      endovascular catheterization procedures.

      The study hypothesis is that the VCD is safe and efficient in achieving hemostasis in the
      study population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The increasing variety of arterial devices having a large crossing profile requiring the use
      of a large bore sheath is mandating focus on large bore closure. Such procedures include
      endovascular abdominal repair (EVAR), thoracic (TEVAR) aortic repairs and transcatheter
      aortic valve implantation (TAVI) typically involve sheaths and delivery catheters with
      14-25Fr profiles.

      Today, the typical closing technique (labeled in Europe) for such large sheath size is a one
      where sutures are deployed prior to the insertion of the large sheath with the sutures tied
      at the end of the procedure. This technique is cumbersome, hard to learn, complex to use and
      has relative high complications and failure rate.

      The InSeal VCD device model 13-517, is easy to use, fast, affords immediate reliable
      hemostasis, and supports a wide range of sheath punctures size and artery's dia. 6-10 mm,
      while leaving a minimal amount material behind and will not limit re-access.

      While each of these features may be found in one commercial device or another, to date there
      is no single device that meets all the market requirements.
