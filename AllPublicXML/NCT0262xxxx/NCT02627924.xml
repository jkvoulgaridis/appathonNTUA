      The study is designed as a prospective, observational study to assess the effect of
      adalimumab on health-related quality of life (QoL) and work productivity in patients with
      rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in Korea.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI) Score at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The HAQ-DI is a patient-reported assessment of physical function that includes 20 items in eight categories representing a comprehensive set of functional activities, including dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip and common daily activities. Patients were asked about their ability to complete these tasks in the past week using the following categories: without any difficulty (0); with some difficulty (1); with much difficulty (2); and unable to do (3). Scores on each task were summed and averaged to provide an overall score ranging from 0 (best) to 3 (worst), with a higher score representing a high-dependency disability.</description>

A clinically meaningful improvement was defined as an improvement of -0.22 points or greater in the HAQ-DI score.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Short-Form 36 (SF-36) Physical Component Summary and Mental Component Summary Scores at Weeks 12 and 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 12, and week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The Medical Outcome Study Short Form 36-Item Health Survey, Version 2 (SF-36) is a self-administered instrument that measures the impact of disease on overall quality of life and consists of 36 questions in eight domains (physical function, pain, general and mental health, vitality, social function, physical and emotional health).
The summary physical health score included the following subscales: physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, and general health. The summary mental health score included the following subscales: vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health.
Each score ranges from 0 to 100 where higher scores indicate a better quality of life. A positive change from Baseline score indicates an improvement.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in EuroQol 5-Dimension 3-Level (EQ-5D-3L) Index at Weeks 12 and 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 12, and week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L descriptive system comprises 5 dimensions of health-related quality of life states (mobility, selfcare, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) each of which can take one of three responses. The responses record three levels of severity ('no problems', 'some problems', and 'extreme problems') within a particular EQ-5D-3L dimension. The EQ-5D-3L results were converted into a weighted health state index with scores ranging from approximately 0 (death) to 1 (full health). A positive change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire (WPAI) at Weeks 12 and 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 12, and week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) questionnaire for general health is a validated tool in RA consisting of 6 questions, based on patient recall of the previous 7 days. WPAI assesses work time missed due to illness (absenteeism), impairment at work due to health (presenteeism), overall work impairment due to health (an aggregate measure of both absenteeism and presenteeism), and total non-occupational activity impairment due to health. WPAI scores are expressed as impairment percentages, with higher scores indicating worse outcomes. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Treatment Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 12 and week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were asked to answer the following four questions as either Very satisfied, Somewhat satisfied, Neither satisfied nor dissatisfied, Somewhat dissatisfied, or Very dissatisfied.
Question 1: Satisfaction with RA treatment in improving morning stiffness in and around the joints
Question 2: Satisfaction with RA treatment improving mobility
Question 3: Satisfaction with RA treatment improving the ability to perform daily living requiring fine motor skills
Questions 4: Satisfaction with RA treatment overall</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI) Score at Week 24</title>
        <description>The HAQ-DI is a patient-reported assessment of physical function that includes 20 items in eight categories representing a comprehensive set of functional activities, including dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip and common daily activities. Patients were asked about their ability to complete these tasks in the past week using the following categories: without any difficulty (0); with some difficulty (1); with much difficulty (2); and unable to do (3). Scores on each task were summed and averaged to provide an overall score ranging from 0 (best) to 3 (worst), with a higher score representing a high-dependency disability.</description>

        <description>The Medical Outcome Study Short Form 36-Item Health Survey, Version 2 (SF-36) is a self-administered instrument that measures the impact of disease on overall quality of life and consists of 36 questions in eight domains (physical function, pain, general and mental health, vitality, social function, physical and emotional health).
The summary physical health score included the following subscales: physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, and general health. The summary mental health score included the following subscales: vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health.
Each score ranges from 0 to 100 where higher scores indicate a better quality of life. A positive change from Baseline score indicates an improvement.</description>

        <description>The EQ-5D-5L descriptive system comprises 5 dimensions of health-related quality of life states (mobility, selfcare, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) each of which can take one of three responses. The responses record three levels of severity ('no problems', 'some problems', and 'extreme problems') within a particular EQ-5D-3L dimension. The EQ-5D-3L results were converted into a weighted health state index with scores ranging from approximately 0 (death) to 1 (full health). A positive change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <description>The Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) questionnaire for general health is a validated tool in RA consisting of 6 questions, based on patient recall of the previous 7 days. WPAI assesses work time missed due to illness (absenteeism), impairment at work due to health (presenteeism), overall work impairment due to health (an aggregate measure of both absenteeism and presenteeism), and total non-occupational activity impairment due to health. WPAI scores are expressed as impairment percentages, with higher scores indicating worse outcomes. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>
