    <textblock>
      This randomized pilot clinical trial studies the side effects of tremelimumab with or without
      tissue cryoablation in treating patients with kidney cancer that has spread to other places
      in the body. Tremelimumab binds to a protein called cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein
      4 (CTLA-4), which is found on the surface of T cells (a type of white blood cell).
      Tremelimumab may block CTLA-4 and help the immune system kill cancer cells. Cryoablation is a
      procedure that uses a hollow, thin tube called a cryoprobe to freeze and destroy cancer
      tissue. It is not yet known whether tremelimumab with or without cryoablation is effective in
      treating patients with kidney cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate safety of tremelimumab alone and in combination with cryoablation in patients
      with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore the longitudinal values for immunological variables (including cluster of
      differentiation [CD]4+ ICOS+ T cells; effector to regulatory T cell ratio; absolute
      lymphocyte count) following treatment with tremelimumab in patients with metastatic RCC, and
      evaluate difference between combination cryoablation and tremelimumab in comparison to
      tremelimumab alone.

      II. To determine the objective response rate and progression-free survival of patients
      treated with tremelimumab with or without cryoablation.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive tremelimumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes at weeks 1 and 5.
      Within 4-6 weeks later, patients undergo surgery or biopsy. After surgery or biopsy, patients
      receive tremelimumab IV every 4 weeks (Q4W) for 3 doses, and then every 12 weeks (Q12W) in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM B: Patients undergo cryoablation and receive tremelimumab IV over 60 minutes at weeks 1
      (2-6 days after cryoablation) and 5. Within 4-6 weeks later, patients undergo surgery or
      biopsy. After surgery or biopsy, patients receive tremelimumab IV Q4W for 3 doses, and then
      Q12W in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30, 60, and 90 days, and
      then every 6 months.
