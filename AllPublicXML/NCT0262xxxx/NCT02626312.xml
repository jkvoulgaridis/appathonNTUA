    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of radiation therapy in
      treating patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, or cancer that has
      spread from the original (primary) tumor to the liver who also have impaired liver function
      (liver damage caused by cirrhosis, chemotherapy, or surgery). Radiation therapy (RT) uses
      high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. New methods of giving RT to the
      liver may help control cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety of high dose radiotherapy in patients who have liver tumors
      (hepatocellular carcinoma [HCC]/cholangiocarcinoma/liver metastases from any primary) and who
      have impaired liver function or low functional liver volume or who have received prior liver
      radiation.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate 2 year local control with radiotherapy in these patients. II. To evaluate
      tumor response, patterns of failure, and survival in these patients.

      III. To evaluate imaging- and serum-based biomarkers in these patients, as correlates of
      hepatic toxicity and tumor response.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients undergo radiation therapy 5 days a week for a total of 15 or 25 fractions in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4-8 weeks and then every 3-4
      months for 2 years. Patients who progress during the two year follow-up period are followed
      up every 6 months.
