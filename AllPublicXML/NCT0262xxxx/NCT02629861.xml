    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Monthly Average Number of Migraine Days During the 12-Week Period After the First Dose of Study Drug</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Days -28 to Day -1), Treatment (Days 1 - Week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>A migraine day was defined as when at least 1 of the following situations occurred: - a calendar day (0:00 to 23:59) demonstrating at least 4 consecutive hours of a headache endorsing criteria for migraine with or without aura - a calendar day (0:00 to 23:59) demonstrating at least 4 consecutive hours of a headache endorsing criteria for probable migraine, a migraine subtype where only 1 migraine criterion is missing - a calendar day (0:00 to 23:59) demonstrating a headache of any duration that was treated with migraine-specific medications (triptans and ergot compounds) Monthly averages are derived and normalized to 28 days equivalent by the following formula: (# days of efficacy variable over relevant period / # days with assessments recorded in the e-diary over the relevant period) * 28. The change is calculated as postbaseline value - baseline value.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Participants With Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that develops or worsens in severity during the conduct of a clinical study and does not necessarily have a causal relationship to the study drug. Severity was rated by the investigator on a scale of mild, moderate and severe, with severe= an AE which prevents usual activities. Relationship of AE to treatment was determined by the investigator. Serious AEs include death, a life-threatening adverse event, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, a congenital anomaly or birth defect, OR an important medical event that jeopardized the patient and required medical intervention to prevent the previously listed serious outcomes.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With At Least 50% Reduction In Monthly Average Number of Migraine Days During the 12-Week Period After the First Dose of Study Drug</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Days -28 to Day -1), Treatment Month 1, Month 2, Month 3, Month 1-3 (Days 1 - Week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>Responder rates were defined as the percentage of total subjects who reached at least a 50% reduction in the monthly average of headache days (as subjectively reported by participants in the study diary) of at least moderate severity relative to the baseline period. For the overall analysis (Month 1-3), patients who discontinued early were considered nonresponders. Monthly averages are derived and normalized to 28 days equivalent by the following formula: (# days of efficacy variable over relevant period / # days with assessments recorded in the e-diary over the relevant period) * 28. The percentage reduction in monthly average is calculated as: ((baseline value - postbaseline value) / baseline value) * 100</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Monthly Average Number of Days of Use of Any Acute Headache Medicine During the 12 Week Period After the First Dose of Study Drug</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Days -28 to Day -1), Treatment (Days 1 - Week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>Patients recorded any migraine medications (name of drug, number of tablets/capsules, and the dose in milligrams per tablet/capsule) taken on each day in their electronic headache diary device. Acute migraine-specific medication included triptans or ergots. Monthly averages are derived and normalized to 28 days equivalent by the following formula: (# days of efficacy variable over relevant period / # days with assessments recorded in the e-diary over the relevant period) * 28. The change is calculated as postbaseline value - baseline value.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Number of Migraine Days During the 4 Week Period After the First Dose of Study Drug</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Days -28 to Day -1), Treatment (Days 1 - Week 4)</time_frame>
    <description>A migraine day was defined as when at least 1 of the following situations occurred: - a calendar day (0:00 to 23:59) demonstrating at least 4 consecutive hours of a headache endorsing criteria for migraine with or without aura - a calendar day (0:00 to 23:59) demonstrating at least 4 consecutive hours of a headache endorsing criteria for probable migraine, a migraine subtype where only 1 migraine criterion is missing - a calendar day (0:00 to 23:59) demonstrating a headache of any duration that was treated with migraine-specific medications (triptans and ergot compounds) Monthly averages are derived and normalized to 28 days equivalent by the following formula: (# days of efficacy variable over relevant period / # days with assessments recorded in the e-diary over the relevant period) * 28. The change is calculated as postbaseline value - baseline value.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Monthly Average Number of Migraine Days During the 12 Week Period After the First Dose of Study Medication in Patients Not Receiving Concomitant Preventive Migraine Medications</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Days -28 to Day -1), Treatment (Days 1 - Week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>A subset of patients (specified in the protocol not to exceed 30%) were allowed to use 1 concomitant migraine preventive medication. This outcome only includes those participants who did not take concomitant preventive migraine medication during this study. A migraine day has been previously defined. Monthly averages are derived and normalized to 28 days equivalent by the following formula: (# days of efficacy variable over relevant period / # days with assessments recorded in the e-diary over the relevant period) * 28. The change is calculated as postbaseline value - baseline value.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Migraine-Related Disability Score (MIDAS), As Measured by the Migraine Disability Assessment At 4 Weeks After the Last (3rd) Dose of Study Drug</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0), Treatment Week 12 (4 weeks after the 3rd dose)</time_frame>
    <description>The MIDAS questionnaire is a 5-item instrument developed to assess headache-related disability based on lost days of activity in 3 domains (work, household work, and nonwork) over the previous 3 months. The total score, ie, the sum of the # lost days answered for the first 5 questions, is used for grading of disability, with scores of 0-5 lost days = grade 1 (little or no disability), 6-10 lost days =grade 2 (mild disability), 11-20 lost days = grade 3 (moderate disability), and ≥21 lost days interpreted as grade 4 (severe disability). Negative change from baseline scores indicate a reduction (improvement) in headache-related disability.</description>

    <measure>Electrocardiogram Finding Shifts From Baseline to Overall</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0), Treatment Week 12 (or early withdrawal)</time_frame>
    <description>12-lead ECGs were performed before other assessments (eg, blood draws and administration of questionnaires) and performed in triplicate. The worst post-baseline finding for the patient is summarized. Only patients with both baseline and post-baseline ECGs are included. The ECG was evaluated by the investigator at the time of recording (signed and dated), and the printout was kept in the source documentation file. When potentially clinically significant findings were detected by the investigator, a cardiologist at a central diagnostic center was consulted for a definitive interpretation. Any ECG finding that was judged by the investigator as a potentially clinically significant change (worsening) compared with a baseline value was considered an adverse event. - NCS = abnormal, not clinically significant - CS = abnormal, clinically significant Shift format is: baseline finding / worst post-baseline finding</description>

    <measure>Participants With Positive Electronic Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale Results After the First Dose of Study Drug</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The electronic Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (eC-SSRS) was used to assess the patient's suicidal ideation (severity and intensity) and behavior (Posner et al 2011). The eC-SSRS Baseline/Screening version was completed by the patient at visit 2, and the eC-SSRS Since Last Visit version was completed by the patient at all other time points. Any positive findings on the eC-SSRS Since Last Visit version required evaluation by a physician or doctoral-level psychologist. Findings after the first dose of study drug using the eC-SSRS Since Last Visit version are summarized.</description>

          <description>The MIDAS questionnaire is a 5-item instrument developed to assess headache-related disability based on lost days of activity in 3 domains (work, household work, and nonwork) over the previous 3 months. The total score, ie, the sum of the # lost days answered for the first 5 questions, is used for grading of disability, with scores of 0-5 = grade 1 (little or no disability), 6-10 =grade 2 (mild disability), 11-20 = grade 3 (moderate disability), and ≥21 interpreted as grade 4 (severe disability).</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With At Least 50% Reduction In Monthly Average Number of Migraine Days During the 12-Week Period After the First Dose of Study Drug</title>
        <description>Responder rates were defined as the percentage of total subjects who reached at least a 50% reduction in the monthly average of headache days (as subjectively reported by participants in the study diary) of at least moderate severity relative to the baseline period. For the overall analysis (Month 1-3), patients who discontinued early were considered nonresponders. Monthly averages are derived and normalized to 28 days equivalent by the following formula: (# days of efficacy variable over relevant period / # days with assessments recorded in the e-diary over the relevant period) * 28. The percentage reduction in monthly average is calculated as: ((baseline value - postbaseline value) / baseline value) * 100</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants With At Least 50% Reduction In Monthly Average Number of Migraine Days During the 12-Week Period After the First Dose of Study Drug</title>
          <description>Responder rates were defined as the percentage of total subjects who reached at least a 50% reduction in the monthly average of headache days (as subjectively reported by participants in the study diary) of at least moderate severity relative to the baseline period. For the overall analysis (Month 1-3), patients who discontinued early were considered nonresponders. Monthly averages are derived and normalized to 28 days equivalent by the following formula: (# days of efficacy variable over relevant period / # days with assessments recorded in the e-diary over the relevant period) * 28. The percentage reduction in monthly average is calculated as: ((baseline value - postbaseline value) / baseline value) * 100</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in the Number of Migraine Days During the 4 Week Period After the First Dose of Study Drug</title>
          <description>A migraine day was defined as when at least 1 of the following situations occurred: - a calendar day (0:00 to 23:59) demonstrating at least 4 consecutive hours of a headache endorsing criteria for migraine with or without aura - a calendar day (0:00 to 23:59) demonstrating at least 4 consecutive hours of a headache endorsing criteria for probable migraine, a migraine subtype where only 1 migraine criterion is missing - a calendar day (0:00 to 23:59) demonstrating a headache of any duration that was treated with migraine-specific medications (triptans and ergot compounds) Monthly averages are derived and normalized to 28 days equivalent by the following formula: (# days of efficacy variable over relevant period / # days with assessments recorded in the e-diary over the relevant period) * 28. The change is calculated as postbaseline value - baseline value.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Migraine-Related Disability Score (MIDAS), As Measured by the Migraine Disability Assessment At 4 Weeks After the Last (3rd) Dose of Study Drug</title>
        <description>The MIDAS questionnaire is a 5-item instrument developed to assess headache-related disability based on lost days of activity in 3 domains (work, household work, and nonwork) over the previous 3 months. The total score, ie, the sum of the # lost days answered for the first 5 questions, is used for grading of disability, with scores of 0-5 lost days = grade 1 (little or no disability), 6-10 lost days =grade 2 (mild disability), 11-20 lost days = grade 3 (moderate disability), and ≥21 lost days interpreted as grade 4 (severe disability). Negative change from baseline scores indicate a reduction (improvement) in headache-related disability.</description>

        <title>Participants With Positive Electronic Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale Results After the First Dose of Study Drug</title>
        <description>The electronic Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (eC-SSRS) was used to assess the patient's suicidal ideation (severity and intensity) and behavior (Posner et al 2011). The eC-SSRS Baseline/Screening version was completed by the patient at visit 2, and the eC-SSRS Since Last Visit version was completed by the patient at all other time points. Any positive findings on the eC-SSRS Since Last Visit version required evaluation by a physician or doctoral-level psychologist. Findings after the first dose of study drug using the eC-SSRS Since Last Visit version are summarized.</description>
