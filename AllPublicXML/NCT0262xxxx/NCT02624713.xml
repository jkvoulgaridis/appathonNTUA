      Randomized Clinical Trial, the research will be composed of two parts in order to examine the
      research question: a combination of controlled randomized retrospective research and
      prospective cohort research

      Prospective Cohort Research:

      The research groups - families coming for treatment in &quot;Active Maccabi&quot; clinics in the
      Northern Region, Israel. Approximately 30 families.

      Retrospective Random Controlled Research

        1. The research group - families that have completed an intervention program of &quot;Active
           Maccabi&quot; Northern Region, Israel,within the past two to three years. The families will
           be requested to attend a follow-up meeting of all family members in which they will
           answer questionnaires. Approximately 66 families.

        2. The control groups - families who did not participate in the program who have a child
           between the age 7-14 who has suffered from obesity/weight (over the past 2-3 years), in
           correlation with the child in the intervention group. Approximately 66 families.

      Hypotheses of the research:

        1. Status of the weight of the child being treated and of his siblings will be higher than
           that at the end of the program.

        2. Indication of the obesogenic environment of families participating in the program will
           be lower in comparison with families not participating in the program.

        3. The rate of eating disorder symptoms among children who participated in the program will
           be lower in comparison with those of the obese/overweight child in families who were not
           the program.

        4. The rate of eating disorder symptoms among siblings who participated in the program will
           be lower than that of siblings in families not in the program.

      Duration of the Research -Prospective Cohort Research: 6 months of intervention. 8 months
      follow-up.

      Research Instruments

        1. Anthropometric measurements of all children in the family (height, weight and BMI). BMI
           per centile examinations according to age.

        2. An acquaintance questionnaire and demographic details - to be answered by parents

        3. A FEAQ_R questionnaire to be answered by the parents (only in the prospective research
           group). The questionnaire will examine the obesogenic burden in the family. A column
           will be added for each sibling of relevant age. The questionnaire will be valid in
           English and Hebrew. The psychometric characteristics of the questionnaire: Alpha
           cronbach - validity 0.84; Reliability 0.78 Trt

        4. Eat-26 (cheat) questionnaire to be answered by the children and their siblings. The
           questionnaire will examine the risk of developing an eating disorder.

    <description>Children Eating Attitudes Test- 26 items. The Children Eating Attitudes has been validated for children and adolescents. The items are rated on a 6-point scale: (1) never, (2) rarely, (3) sometimes, (4) often, (5) usually, and (6) always. Scores range from 0 (minimum) to 78 (maximum). Scores above 20 indicates a high level of concern about dieting, body weight, or problematic eating behaviors. Higher scores (above 20) are considered a worse outcome.</description>

    <description>Family Eating and Activity Habits questionnaire (FEAHQ-32) filled out by the participating parents (only in the prospective research group). The FEAHQ is a 32-item self-report instrument designed to assess the eating and activity habits of family members as well as obesogenic factors in the overall home environment (stimulus and behaviour patterns) related to weight. The higher the score, the greater the obsogenic load in a family so its a worse outcome. The lower the score, the less obsogenic load in the family so its a better outcome. There is no minimum or maximum score as reported by Golan &amp; Weizman, 1998 (See reference 5). The score varies from family to family according to the number of persons.The goal is to get a lower score relative to the initial score. The FEAHQ-32 has been validated in English and Hebrew.
This measure was only used to assess the Prospective Research group, as also mentioned under research instruments in the detailed study description.</description>

    <description>In the controlled retrospective follow up, (not random) 44 families participated with their 81 children and siblings. The intervention group included 18 families who participated in the &quot;Maccabi Active&quot; program (obesity treatment) in the years 2012-2013 in the northern district, with their 24 children (18 overweight children and 6 siblings). The control group included 26 families with their 57 children (27 children who had been overweight or obese in the years 2012-2013 when they were 8-14 years old and their 30 siblings). These families did not take part in a family based treatment for their overweight child. The parameters were measured at one set point time. All participants from both the control and research groups were evaluated at the follow-up and the data collected at follow-up is being reported collectively for the Retrospective Controlled Research branch.</description>

        <title>Family Eating and Activity Habits Questionnaire 32</title>
        <description>Family Eating and Activity Habits questionnaire (FEAHQ-32) filled out by the participating parents (only in the prospective research group). The FEAHQ is a 32-item self-report instrument designed to assess the eating and activity habits of family members as well as obesogenic factors in the overall home environment (stimulus and behaviour patterns) related to weight. The higher the score, the greater the obsogenic load in a family so its a worse outcome. The lower the score, the less obsogenic load in the family so its a better outcome. There is no minimum or maximum score as reported by Golan &amp; Weizman, 1998 (See reference 5). The score varies from family to family according to the number of persons.The goal is to get a lower score relative to the initial score. The FEAHQ-32 has been validated in English and Hebrew.
This measure was only used to assess the Prospective Research group, as also mentioned under research instruments in the detailed study description.</description>
