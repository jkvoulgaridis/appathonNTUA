      The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the antiretroviral activity and to
      evaluate the safety and tolerability of open-label MK-1439A consisting of a single fixed-dose
      combination (FDC) tablet of MK-1439 100 mg/lamivudine 300 mg/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate
      300 mg in treatment-naive HIV-1 infected participants with selected NNRTI transmitted
      resistance mutations.

    <description>The time to loss of virologic response (TLOVR) was reported. For participants who achieved HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 copies/mL of plasma and subsequently had two consecutive HIV-1 RNA values of ≥50 copies/mL measured at least 1 week apart, TLOVR was the time between Day 1 and the date of the first of the two consecutive values ≥50 copies/mL. For participants who achieved and sustained HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 copies/mL, time to loss of virologic response was censored at the time of the last available measurement.</description>
