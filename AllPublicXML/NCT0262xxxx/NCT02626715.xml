  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare safety and efficacy of reduced-intensity conditioning
      and myeloablative conditioning regimens prior to HSCT in high-risk AML/MDS pediatric and
      young adult patients. This study investigates the use of two novel conditioning therapies for
      hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). The primary focus of both the investigators'
      myeloablative and reduced-intensity conditioning regimens is to reduce overall toxicity so
      that pediatric and young adult patients with high-risk AML/MDS with significant pretransplant
      comorbidities who would have been ineligible to proceed to HSCT previously can now receive
      potentially life-saving treatment.

             bone marrow after the first course of Induction chemotherapy; adverse cytogenetic
             abnormalities of monosomy 5, monosomy 7, or 5q deletion; presence of FLT3 positive
             internal tandem duplication (FLT3/ITD+), particularly high allelic ratio; or
             treatment-related AML.)

             and 1.5 x 10^5 CD34+ cells/kg. If this is not attainable, then double cord blood
             transplant should be considered.

             assent.

          7. Patient must have adequate performance status (Lansky score ≥60% for patients &lt;16
             years; Karnofsky score ≥60% for patients ≥16 years).

          8. Patient must have adequate pre-transplant organ function as defined by:

          6. Patients with any inherited bone marrow failure syndrome (including, but not limited
             to, Fanconi anemia, Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, and dyskeratosis congenital) or Down
