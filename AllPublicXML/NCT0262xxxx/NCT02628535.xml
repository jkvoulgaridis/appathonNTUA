    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of MGD009 when given to patients with
      B7-H3-expressing tumors. The study will also evaluate what is the highest dose of MGD009 that
      can be given safely. Assessments will be done to see how the drug acts in the body
      (pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and to evaluate potential anti-tumor activity
      of MGD009.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase 1 open-label, dose escalation, cohort expansion, and efficacy follow-up
      study of MGD009 administered intravenously (IV) on an every-other-week schedule for up to one
      year (14 cycles).

      The dose escalation phase is designed to characterize the safety and tolerability of MGD009
      and to define the maximum tolerated or maximum administered dose (MTD/MAD). This phase will
      enroll patients with mesothelioma, bladder cancer, melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma of the
      head and neck (SCCHN), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), clear cell renal cell carcinoma
      (ccRCC), ovarian cancer, thyroid cancer, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), pancreatic
      cancer, colon cancer, soft tissue sarcoma, or prostate cancer.

      In the cohort expansion phase, 6 cohorts of 16 patients each will be enrolled to further
      evaluate the safety and potential efficacy of MGD009 administered at the MTD/MAD dose in
      patients with mesothelioma, bladder cancer, melanoma, SCCHN, NSCLC, or other specific tumors
      that express high levels of B7-H3. Pre- and on-study biopsies are required for melanoma
      patients in the cohort expansion phase. Two additional cohorts (up to15 patients each) will
      evaluate the use of prophylaxis therapies to mitigate toxicity.

      The survival follow-up phase consists of the 2-year period after the final dose of study
      drug.

      All tumor evaluations will be carried out by both Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
      Tumors (RECIST) and immune-related response criteria (irRC).
