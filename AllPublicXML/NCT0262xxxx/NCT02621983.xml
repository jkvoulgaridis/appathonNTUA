      This study will evaluate the ability of aerobic exercise (AE) to improve cognition in people
      with schizophrenia. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two interventions: (1)
      aerobic exercise class (stationary bicycle, or &quot;spin&quot; class) for up to 45 minutes three times
      per week for 12 weeks, or (2) balance and stretching class for up to 45 minutes three times
      per week for 12 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a severe, chronic, and disabling psychotic illness that affects
      approximately 87,000 Veterans. Previous studies have reported improved short-term memory with
      AE, but there in a lack of information on cognitive effects of AE in SCZ. The investigators
      want to determine if twelve weeks of AE training improves cognitive function in Veterans with
      SCZ.

    <measure>Change in Cognitive Function, Assessed by Scores on the Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (MATRICS) Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Cognitive function will be assessed by using the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB). It assesses seven key cognitive domains: processing speed, attention/vigilance, working memory, verbal learning, visual learning, reasoning and problem solving, and social cognition. The MCCB is a battery of tests with a computerized scoring system that produces T-scores, adjusted for age and sex, that are used by the MCCB software to create composite scores. The range of T-scores for a normal control population is between 0 to 100 with a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10. Higher scores indicate better overall cognitive functioning. A higher composite score on the MCCB is indicative of better cognitive function, however there are no clinically significant thresholds. The scores reported below are means +/- standard deviations of these composite scores.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Functional Ability</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Functional ability will be assessed using the University of California San Diego Performance-Based skills assessment (UPSA). The UPSA is a measure of functional ability to perform common activities of daily living. It assess communication, financial, and household skills as well as the ability to manage medication, navigate transportation, and organize and plan an activity. Each measure creates a raw score which is summed to create a composite score. A higher score indicates better functional ability. No clinically significant thresholds. The maximum score an individual could obtain was 87 and the minimum was 0. The score is reported on scale units.</description>

        <title>Change in Cognitive Function, Assessed by Scores on the Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (MATRICS) Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB)</title>
        <description>Cognitive function will be assessed by using the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB). It assesses seven key cognitive domains: processing speed, attention/vigilance, working memory, verbal learning, visual learning, reasoning and problem solving, and social cognition. The MCCB is a battery of tests with a computerized scoring system that produces T-scores, adjusted for age and sex, that are used by the MCCB software to create composite scores. The range of T-scores for a normal control population is between 0 to 100 with a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10. Higher scores indicate better overall cognitive functioning. A higher composite score on the MCCB is indicative of better cognitive function, however there are no clinically significant thresholds. The scores reported below are means +/- standard deviations of these composite scores.</description>

The UPSA is a measure of functional ability to perform common activities of daily living. It assess communication, financial, and household skills as well as the ability to manage medication, navigate transportation, and organize and plan an activity. Each measure creates a raw score which is summed to create a composite score. A higher score indicates better functional ability. No clinically significant thresholds. The maximum score an individual could obtain was 87 and the minimum was 0. The score is reported on scale units.</description>

        <time_frame>Baseline, 20 weeks</time_frame>
        <population>We had significant drop out from baseline measurement to week 20, accounting for the difference in numbers when compared to the total enrolled. We also had two drop out in the Aerobic Exercise group between week 12 and week 20 accounting, which explains the difference in number between the primary outcome and this outcome.</population>

          <title>Change in MCCB Scores</title>
          <description>Cognitive function will be assessed by using the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB). It assesses seven key cognitive domains: processing speed, attention/vigilance, working memory, verbal learning, visual learning, reasoning and problem solving, and social cognition. The MCCB is a battery of tests with a computerized scoring system that produces T-scores, adjusted for age and sex, that are used by the MCCB software to create composite scores. The range of T-scores for a normal control population is between 0 to 100 with a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10. A higher composite score on the MCCB is indicative of better cognitive function, however there are no clinically significant thresholds. The scores reported below are means +/- standard deviations of these composite scores.</description>
          <population>We had significant drop out from baseline measurement to week 20, accounting for the difference in numbers when compared to the total enrolled. We also had two drop out in the Aerobic Exercise group between week 12 and week 20 accounting, which explains the difference in number between the primary outcome and this outcome.</population>

        <description>Functional ability will be assessed using the University of California San Diego Performance-Based skills assessment (UPSA). The UPSA is a measure of functional ability to perform common activities of daily living. It assess communication, financial, and household skills as well as the ability to manage medication, navigate transportation, and organize and plan an activity. Each measure creates a raw score which is summed to create a composite score. A higher score indicates better functional ability. No clinically significant thresholds. The maximum score an individual could obtain was 87 and the minimum was 0. The score is reported on scale units.</description>
