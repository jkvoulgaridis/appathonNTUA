  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, open-label, randomized, controlled, multi-national, multi-center,
      parallel-arm study comparing tivozanib to sorafenib in subjects with refractory advanced
      renal cell carcinoma (RCC).

      Subjects will be randomized (1:1) to treatment with tivozanib or sorafenib.

      Subjects will be stratified by International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database
      Consortium (IMDC) risk category (favorable; intermediate; poor) and prior therapy (two prior
      vascular endothelial growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (VEGFR TKI); a prior
      checkpoint inhibitor [programmed cell death -1 protein (PD-1) or PD-1 ligand (PD1-L)
      inhibitor] plus a prior VEGFR TKI; a prior VEGFR TKI plus any other systemic agent).

      All subjects will be evaluated for progression free survival, overall survival, objective
      response rate, and the duration of response as well as safety and tolerability.

      Pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis are also included in study.

    <description>Progression-Free Survival (PFS), as assessed by a blinded independent radiological review (IRR), is defined as the time from randomization to first documentation of objective tumor progression (progressive disease) or death due to any reasons whichever comes first. Disease progression per RECIST 1.1 criteria is defined as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions.</description>
