    <textblock>
      The human cornea is affected by the magnitude and velocity of both internal and external
      forces because the cornea has both static and dynamic resistance components. Considering
      these natures of the human cornea, many investigators have tried to demonstrate corneal
      biomechanical properties to understand these characteristics of the cornea. Corneal
      biomechanical properties are known to influence the accuracy of measurements in intraocular
      pressure (IOP) and are recognized as important factor to explain the susceptibility of
      development of glaucomatous damage. Until recently, the only instrument which enabled the in
      vivo measurements of the ocular biomechanical properties was ocular response analyzer (ORA,
      Reichert Ophthalmic Instruments, Depew, NY, USA).8 The ORA has been used to assess the
      biomechanical properties of the cornea according to the dynamic bidirectional applanation
      process. A dynamic Scheimpflug analyzer (corneal visualization Scheimpflug technology [Corvis
      ST], OCULUS, Wetzlar, Germany) has been introduced recently and has become a useful
      instrument for evaluating corneal biomechanical properties. The dynamic Scheimpflug analyzer
      captures the dynamic process of corneal deformation caused by an air puff using an
      ultra-high-speed Scheimpflug camera at a rate of up to 4,330 images per second. Until now,
      well-organized analysis on the normative data of the corneal biomechanical profiles measured
      with the dynamic Scheimpflug analyzer for young healthy adults has not been reported yet.
      Hence, in the present study, we aim to conduct normative data analysis for the corneal
      biomechanical properties with the dynamic Scheimpflug analyzer in a cohort of young healthy
      adults in South Korea.
