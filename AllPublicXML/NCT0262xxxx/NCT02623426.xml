      The Macular Edema Ranibizumab v. Intravitreal anti-inflammatory Therapy (MERIT) Trial will
      compare the relative efficacy and safety of intravitreal methotrexate, intravitreal
      ranibizumab, and the intravitreal dexamethasone implant for the treatment of uveitic macular
      edema persisting or reoccurring after an intravitreal corticosteroid injection. MERIT is a
      parallel design (1:1:1), randomized comparative trial with an anniversary close-out at the 6
      month clinic visit. The primary outcome is percent change in central subfield thickness from
      the baseline OCT measurement to the 12 week visit.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Macular edema (ME) is the most common structural complication and cause of visual impairment
      and legal blindness in uveitis patients. Traditional approaches to the treatment of uveitic
      ME have included the use of regional corticosteroid therapy, delivered periocularly,
      including posterior sub-Tenon's and orbital floor injections, or via the intravitreal route.
      While corticosteroid injections may reduce ME and improve vision, the effect is often
      variable with a limited duration. Persistent macular edema is a common occurrence and often
      requires repeated intravitreal injections of corticosteroids, which expose eyes to a
      significant risk of increased intraocular pressure ocular and cataract development. The often
      refractory nature of uveitic ME and its impact on visual function underscores the need to
      identify effective alternative medical therapeutic options. Recent pilot studies have shown
      intravitreal methotrexate (MTX) and intravitreal ranibizumab (Lucentis®, Genentech Inc., San
      Francisco, CA) to be promising treatments for uveitic ME, and intravitreal dexamethasone
      implant (Ozurdex®, Allergan, Irvine, CA) has recently been approved by the U.S. FDA for
      uveitic ME in patients with non-infectious uveitis. In addition to being effective,
      intravitreal MTX and ranibizumab potentially may have less ocular side effects than
      corticosteroids, particularly less IOP elevation. However, the relative efficacy of these
      treatments is unknown. The Macular Edema Ranibizumab v. Intravitreal anti-inflammatory
      Therapy (MERIT) Trial will compare the relative efficacy and safety of intravitreal
      methotrexate, ranibizumab, and dexamethasone implant. MERIT is a parallel design (1:1:1),
      randomized comparative effectiveness trial with an anniversary close-out at the 6 month
      clinic visit. The primary outcome is percent change in central subfield thickness from the
      baseline OCT measurement to the 12 week visit.

    <description>The primary outcome is the percent change in central subfield thickness from the baseline OCT measurement at the 12-week visit. The assessment of OCT outcomes will be performed by masked readers. The 12-week visit was chosen as the time to assess the primary outcome because the ranibizumab treatment arm specifies injections at baseline, 4 weeks and 8 weeks in all participants, and because the peak benefit for the dexamethasone pellet appears to be at the 8 to 12 weeks.</description>

             study ophthalmologist may be significant enough to limit improvement of ME (i.e.,
             causing substantial wrinkling of the retinal surface);
