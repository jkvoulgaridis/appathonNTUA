  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is curable and surgery is considered the standard
      of care for fit, good performance status patients. However, a high proportion of patients
      with stage 1 NSCLC are elderly and/or have medical co-morbidities and are therefore at higher
      risk of surgical complications. The optimal treatment for these patients is unknown. SABR may
      be an equally appropriate treatment but this need to be formally assessed. Funded by the NIHR
      Research for Patient Benefit, SABRtooth is a UK multi-centre, two-group individually
      randomised controlled feasibility study of patients with peripheral stage I non-small cell
      lung cancer considered at higher risk from surgery. In total, 54 patients are planned to be
      recruited from 4 treatment sites and 2 referral sites. This study aims to determine the
      feasibility and acceptability of performing a largescale definitive randomised phase III
      trial comparing surgery with stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR). The qualitative
      substudy is an exploration of the reasons for nonparticipation in the SABRTooth trial. As the
      two treatments are very different, patients may have a strong preference for either surgery
      or SABR, or may feel uncomfortable to have a decision between such distinct options taken out
      of their hands. Understanding why patients choose not to participate or do not take up their
      treatment allocation will be crucial in demonstrating that recruiting to a larger scale phase
      III trial is feasible. We will explore what patients, who have declined particpation in the
      study or who intiailly consented but subsequently fail to take up their randomimsed treatment
      arm, understand, perceive and feel about, how the SABRTooth trial was presented to them and
      their expectations of study burden.

    <description>Recruitment rate/month over months 7-21 Recruitment rate/month over months 7-21 In order to demonstrate that recruitment targets for the main trial can be met within an adequate timeframe, the key objective of this feasibility study, a 'steady state' of recruitment must be observed. A formal monitoring of recruitment period will begin 6 months after the start of recruitment (allowing a run-in period for set-up), and an average of 3 patients per month must be recruited (randomised) over a consecutive 15 month period (a minimum of 45 patients) in order to demonstrate a 'steady state' of recruitment</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Primary tumour characteristics.

          2. Peripherally located tumour as defined in the RTOG 0236 study and UK SABR Consortium
             guidelines. This states that the tumour must be more than 2cm in axial diameter from a
             major airway.

               -  This includes the trachea, carina, right and left main bronchus and extends to
                  the bifurcation of the right upper, right middle, right lower, left upper and
                  left lower lobe bronchioles

          3. No evidence of hilar or mediastinal lymph nodes involvement.

               -  Any hilar or mediastinal lymph nodes that are either

               -  PET positive or &gt;1cm in axial dimension must be sampled by mediastinoscopy,
                  endobronchial ultrasound or oesophageal endoscopic ultrasound and demonstrate
                  negative cytology and/or pathology

          4. Local lung cancer MDT consensus opinion that patient is considered suitable for either
             surgical resection or SABR treatment AND also to be at higher risk complications from
             surgical resection

          5. Age â‰¥ 18

          6. Female patients must satisfy the investigator that they are not pregnant (negative
             pregnancy test within 72hrs of surgery of day 1 surgery/SABR), or are not of
             childbearing potential

          7. Able and willing to provide written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Previous radiotherapy within the planned treatment volume.

          2. History of clinically significant diffuse interstitial lung disease

          3. Any history of concurrent or previous invasive malignancy that in the opinion of the
             investigator could impact on trial outcomes

          4. Clinical or radiological evidence of metastatic spread

          5. History of psychiatric or addictive disorder or other medical condition that, in the
             opinion of the investigator, would preclude the patient from meeting the trial
             requirements

          6. Previous systemic therapies, including targeted and experimental treatments, for their
             current lung cancer diagnosis
