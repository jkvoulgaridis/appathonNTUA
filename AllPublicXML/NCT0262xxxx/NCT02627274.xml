    <description>Dose Escalation: RO6874281 will be administered as an intravenous (IV) infusion. The starting dose regimen of RO6874281 as a single agent will be 5 milligrams (mg) once weekly (QW). Different regimens may be explored based on the emerging safety, PK, and PD data of RO6874281 and may be tested in parallel. Participants will be treated with RO6874281 until disease progression, unacceptable toxicities, or withdrawal of consent. Participants may continue treatment with RO6874281 for a maximum of 24 months.</description>

    <description>Dose Escalation: RO6874281 will be administered as an IV infusion. RO6874281 will be administered QW for the first 4 administrations, then Q2W. The standard dose for trastuzumab will be a loading dose of 6 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) followed by a maintenance dose of 4 mg/kg from Cycle 2 in a Q2W regimen. Different regimens may be explored based on the emerging safety, PK, and PD data of RO6874281 and may be tested in parallel. Participants will be treated with RO6874281 in combination with trastuzumab until disease progression, unacceptable toxicities, or withdrawal of consent.

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>RO6874281 will be administered as an IV infusion. The starting dose regimen of RO6874281 in combination with cetuximab will be 5 mg QW for the first 4 administrations, then Q2W. Cetuximab will be administered Q2W at 500 milligrams per square meter (mg/m^2). Different regimens may be explored based on the emerging safety, PK, and PD data of RO6874281 and may be tested in parallel. Participants will be treated with RO6874281 in combination with cetuximab until disease progression, unacceptable toxicities, or withdrawal of consent. Participants may continue treatment with RO6874281 in combination with cetuximab for a maximum of 24 months.
Extension Phase: The MTD for RO6874281 was determined to be 10mg and therefore patients in the extension will be treated with 10mg RO6874281. Cetuximab and R06874281 will be administered weekly during induction phase (cycle 1 and cycle 2). Both IMPs will be administered Q2W starting in cycle 3.</description>
