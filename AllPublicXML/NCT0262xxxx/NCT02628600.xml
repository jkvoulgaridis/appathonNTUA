      This is an open-label safety extension study to assess the safety and tolerability of once
      daily dosing of 590 mg Liposomal Amikacin for Inhalation (LAI) added to a multi-drug regimen
      in participants with nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) lung infections due to Mycobacterium
      avium complex (MAC) who were refractory to therapy and failed to convert in Study INS-212
      (NCT02344004).

      Safety and tolerability of once daily dosing of 590 mg Liposomal Amikacin for Inhalation
      (LAI) added to a multi-drug regimen in participants with non-tuberculous mycobacterium (NTM)
      lung infections due to Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) who are refractory to therapy and
      failed to convert in Study INS-212.

      Participants participating in Study INS-212 who had not achieved the INS-212 protocol
      definition of culture conversion (3 consecutive monthly negative sputum cultures) or who had
      experienced a relapse or recurrence (agar positive or more than 2 consecutive broth positive
      results after culture conversion had occurred) by Month 6, as determined by their sputum
      culture results from Day 1 through Month 6 and confirmed at their scheduled Month 8 visit,
      were eligible to participate in Study INS-312. For participants who chose to participate in
      Study INS-312, the Month 8 visit of Study INS-212 became their end of treatment (EOT) visit;
      these participants were then asked to provide written informed consent for Study INS-312 and
      were enrolled directly into Study INS-312 after having met all eligibility criteria.

      Participants in Study INS-212 had either received 590 mg LAI plus an MDR (LAI + MDR arm) or a
      multidrug regimen alone (MDR alone arm). All participants in this safety extension study were
      to continue the multidrug antimycobacterial regimen that they were receiving during Study
      INS-212 and will receive LAI 590 mg administered daily (QD) for up to 12 months. The
      participants will remain in the study for up to a total of 13 months (up to 12 months
      on-treatment plus 1 month off LAI treatment for safety follow up).

    <description>TEAEs are defined as those AEs that occurred on or after the date of first dose of study medication in INS-312 and within 28 days after the last dose. If it couldn't be determined whether the AE is treatment emergent due to a partial onset date, then it was classified as treatment emergent.</description>

    <description>6 months: Converters are defined as participants who had 3 consecutive monthly MAC-negative sputum cultures by Month 6 (last opportunity to convert was at Month 4).

    <measure>Time to Culture Conversion</measure>
    <time_frame>by Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>The time to culture conversion is defined as the date of conversion for participants achieving culture conversion is defined as the date of the first of 3-consecutive monthly negative sputum cultures. Then, the number of days to culture conversion is defined as the difference between the date of conversion and the date of first dose of LAI.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline (Day 1) to Month 6 and Month 12 in the 6MWT Distance</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to Month 12 or end of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>A 6-minute walk assessment of exertional capability was performed at Baseline (Day 1) and Month 6 and Month 12/EOT. The standardized protocol based on the American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines (http://doi.org/10.1164/ajrccm.166.1.at1102) was used. After assessments were performed for heart rate, blood pressure, pulse oximetry (SpO2), dyspnea, and overall fatigue using the Borg scale, participants were instructed to walk on a prescribed course as far as they could in 6 minutes. Pre-test assessment parameters were repeated after exertion. The maximum distance achieved and post exertion heart rate and SpO2 were compared to pre-test values. The maximum distance achieved was recorded in the electronic case report form.</description>

        <description>A 6-minute walk assessment of exertional capability was performed at Baseline (Day 1) and Month 6 and Month 12/EOT. The standardized protocol based on the American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines (http://doi.org/10.1164/ajrccm.166.1.at1102) was used. After assessments were performed for heart rate, blood pressure, pulse oximetry (SpO2), dyspnea, and overall fatigue using the Borg scale, participants were instructed to walk on a prescribed course as far as they could in 6 minutes. Pre-test assessment parameters were repeated after exertion. The maximum distance achieved and post exertion heart rate and SpO2 were compared to pre-test values. The maximum distance achieved was recorded in the electronic case report form.</description>
