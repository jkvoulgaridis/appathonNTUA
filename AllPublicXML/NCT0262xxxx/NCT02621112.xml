  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis B virus infection remains an important clinical issue among patients on renal
      replacement therapy. Seroconversion rate as defined by an anti-HBs Ab titer &gt; 10 IU/L after
      intramuscular hepatitis B vaccination (HBVv) remains poor in this cohort. Factors associated
      with inadequate anti-HBs response include older age, diabetes mellitus, obesity and low
      hepatitis B vaccine dose. Various small-scale studies including multiple high dose
      intramuscular vaccination or multiple small dose intradermal vaccination were attempted with
      variable response. Recent study on dose sparing seasonal influenza vaccine delivered via a
      novel intradermal microneedle has demonstrated good immunogenic responses similar to
      full-dose intramuscular vaccination. Imiquimod, a synthetic TLR7 agonist useful for the
      treatment of DNA virus infection, has been shown to improve vaccine immunogenicity. The
      investigators therefore propose a prospective, randomized study to compare the safety and
      immunogenicity of intradermal hepatitis B vaccination with this novel device with
      intramuscular in patients on renal replacement therapy.

      The investigators aim to recruit at least 120 subjects on renal replacement therapy in this
      prospective double blind randomized controlled trial. All recruited subjects have to be HBsAg
      and anti-HBs negative before recruitment. Subjects were randomly assigned to three groups.

      All patients received 4 doses of hepatitis B vaccine at 0,1,3 and 6 months: Group 1: to
      receive intradermal 10mcg of recombinant hepatitis B vaccine at two separate sites (5mcg)
      with topical imiquimod ointment pretreatment 5 minutes before injection. Group 2: to receive
      intradermal 10mcg of recombinant hepatitis B vaccine at two separate sites (5mcg) with
      topical placebo aqueous cream pretreatment 5 minutes before injection. Group 3: to receive
      intramuscular 10mcg (1mL) of recombinant hepatitis B vaccine at two separate sites (5mcg)
      with topical placebo aqueous cream pretreatment 5 minutes before injection.

      Subjects will be advised not to wash the topical treatment for 8 hours after vaccination.
      Patients and investigators will be blinded to the type of topical treatment applied. Anti-HBs
      titre will be measured at baseline, before each vaccination, and at 12 and 18 months after
      the first dose of vaccination.

      The primary end point is the seroprotection rate of the HBVv at 12 months after the first
      dose of vaccination. The secondary end points are the seroprotection rate of HBVv and the
      geometric mean titre (GMT) fold increase of the anti-HBs at 1, 3, 6, 12 (GMT only) and 18
      months after the first dose of vaccination. Adverse reactions of the vaccine will also be
      assessed immediately and for 1 month after vaccination.
