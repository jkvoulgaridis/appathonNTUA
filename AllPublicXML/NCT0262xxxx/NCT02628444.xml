    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to assess the immune response and the safety of different vaccination
      schedules of CYD dengue vaccine.

      The primary objectives of the study are:

        -  To demonstrate the non-inferiority of the immune response elicited against each dengue
           serotype by CYD dengue vaccine given as a 2-dose schedule compared to the immune
           response elicited by CYD dengue vaccine given as a 3-dose schedule, in previously dengue
           exposed participants 28 days after the last injection.

        -  To demonstrate the non-inferiority of the immune response elicited against each dengue
           serotype by CYD dengue vaccine given as a 2-dose schedule compared to the immune
           response elicited by CYD vaccine given as a 3-dose schedule in previously dengue exposed
           participants, 1 year after the last injection.

        -  To demonstrate the non-inferiority of the immune response elicited against each dengue
           serotype elicited by a booster dose of CYD dengue vaccine one year or two years after
           the last injection in the primary series in previously dengue exposed participants.

      The secondary objectives of the study are:

        -  To demonstrate the superiority of the immune response elicited by CYD dengue vaccine
           given as a 2-dose schedule compared to the immune response elicited by CYD dengue
           vaccine given as a 3-dose schedule, in previously dengue exposed participants 28 days
           after the last injection.

        -  To demonstrate the superiority of the immune response elicited by CYD dengue vaccine
           given as a 2-dose schedule compared to the immune response elicited by CYD dengue
           vaccine given as a 3-dose schedule, in previously dengue exposed participants, one year
           after the last injection.

        -  To describe the neutralizing antibody levels of each dengue serotype at 28 days
           post-injection 3 to the antibody levels immediately before receiving a booster dose, by
           baseline dengue serostatus.

        -  To describe the neutralizing antibody levels of each dengue serotype at 28 days
           post-injection 2 and 28 days post-injection 3 from Group 1 in a primary series schedule
           by baseline dengue serostatus.

        -  To demonstrate the superiority of the immune response elicited against each dengue
           serotype 28 days after administration of a booster dose of CYD dengue vaccine, in
           previously dengue exposed participants, at One year or two years after last injection in
           the primary series.

        -  To describe the seroconversion rate 28 days post-booster injection in all 3 groups.

        -  To describe all hospitalized virologically confirmed dengue (VCD) cases during the
           study.

        -  To evaluate the safety profile of CYD after each and any injection during the trial.
           Safety assessments include solicited reactions within 7 or 14 days after each injection,
           unsolicited adverse events within 28 days after each injection, and serious adverse
           events during the study period.

      Healthy participants aged between 9 and 50 year receive CYD dengue vaccine in various
      schedules, in two sequential stages. In the first stage, participants receive 1, 2 or 3
      injections of CYD dengue vaccine over a 12-month period. In the second stage, participants
      are randomized to receive a booster dose of CYD dengue vaccine at either 12 months or 24
      months after the third injection of study vaccine. Only participants who were previously
      dengue exposed at baseline (dengue seropositive) are eligible to receive the booster dose.

    <description>Hospitalized suspected dengue disease is defined as an acute febrile illness with diagnosis of dengue requiring hospitalization (with bed attribution). In such cases, 1 unplanned blood sample is collected for virological confirmation: an acute sample (within the first 5 days after fever onset ). A suspected hospitalized dengue case is considered a VCD case if there is a detection of wild-type dengue virus by non-structural 1 (NS1) antigen enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and/or wild-type dengue reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.</description>
