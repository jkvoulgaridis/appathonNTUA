      This study evaluates the value of routine follow-up with a child's pediatrician after
      hospitalization for bronchiolitis. Parents of half of participants will be instructed to
      follow-up with the child's pediatrician regardless of symptom resolution, while the other
      half will be instructed to follow-up on an as-needed basis (only if the child worsens,
      doesn't improve, or other concerns develop).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bronchiolitis is highly prevalent and burdensome among children less than 2 years of age. For
      this reason, many therapies have been tried by providers and studied by researchers.
      Unfortunately, interventions have largely been shown to be ineffective, prompting campaigns
      to reduce use of ineffective therapies. One commonly prescribed but thus far unstudied
      intervention often provided to children discharged after hospitalization for bronchiolitis is
      routine follow up with their pediatrician. Whether the costs and time spent for these visits
      are worthwhile depends on the extent to which the child and the child's parents benefit.
