  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After standard multimodal therapy, the prognosis of relapsed and unresectable high-grade
      osteosarcoma is dismal and unchanged over the last decades. We have already finished a
      prospective trial about apatinib for advanced osteosarcoma(NCT02711007) and find it has a
      objective response rate of aproximately 45% with median progression-free survival around 5
      months. Thus, the investigators explored apatinib activity together with anti-PD1 therapy in
      order to induce durable response in patients with relapsed and unresectable osteosarcoma
      after the failure of first-line or second-line chemotherapy.

      Apatinib is a small-molecule vascular endothelial growth factors receptor (VEGFR) tyrosine
      kinase inhibitor, similar to pazopanib, but with a binding affinity 10 times to VEGFR-2
      comparing with pazopanib or sorafenib.

      SHR-1210 is a humanized anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody.

      Patients more than 11 years with body surface area more than 1.2m2, progressing after
      standard treatment, will be eligible to receive 250 or 500 mg of apatinib once daily together
      with SHR-1210 3mg/kg (no more than 200mg) iv every 2 weeks until progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) at 4 months and overall
      survival(OS). Secondary objectives were clinical benefit rate (CBR), defined as no
      progression at 6 months and safety.
