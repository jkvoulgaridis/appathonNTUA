  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate this regression model by injecting and tracing carbon nanoparticles (CNs) into
      the fusion node prior to NAC in patients with breast cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Guided by ultrasound, 0.3 mL of CNs suspension was injected in a fusion node prior to NAC in
      110 patients with local advanced breast cancer. Patients underwent breast surgery and total
      axillary lymph node dissection following 2-6 cycles of NAC. The distribution by
      intercostobrachial nerves (ICBN) of positive nodes, black-stained nodes and lymphovascular
      invasion was investigated by response to NAC.

    <measure>The spatial distribution of positive nodes in axillary after neoadjuvant chemotherapy based on pectoralis minor location</measure>
    <time_frame>During the surgery</time_frame>
    <description>After neoadjuvant chemotherapy, whether positive nodes remission (transform to negative), from Level III to Level II, and from Level II to Level I. This means that if the nodes at Level I are negative, the nodes at Level II or Level III will be negative; if the nodes at Level II are negative, the nodes at Level III will be negative; if the nodes at Level III are positive, the nodes at Level I and Level II will be positive.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The spatial distribution of black-stained in axillary after neoadjuvant chemotherapy based on pectoralis minor location</measure>
    <time_frame>During the surgery</time_frame>
    <description>If the chemotherapy is sensitive, the number of black-stained nodes will increase from Level I, Level II, to Level III. If the chemotherapy is resistance, the number of black-stained nodes will remain the original number or a little increasing locally.</description>

    <description>After neoadjuvant chemotherapy, whether positive nodes remission (transform to negative), from above ICBN to below ICBN. This means that if the nodes below ICBN are negative, the nodes above ICBN will be negative; if the nodes above ICBN are positive, the nodes below ICBN will be positive.</description>
