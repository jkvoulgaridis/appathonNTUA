  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study supports a line of research that seeks to improve the health of military
      veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) by teaching them mindfulness skills. The
      proposed study first gathers Veteran's Affairs mental health provider and peer support
      specialist feedback to adapt a brief mindfulness intervention and then investigates the
      feasibility of testing this intervention in a small randomized clinical trial. The study
      targets primary care patients with PTSD who may be reluctant to engage in other mental health
      treatments and provides them with mindfulness training to reduce PTSD symptoms, improve
      psychosocial functioning and increase hope for recovery.
