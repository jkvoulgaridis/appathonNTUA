      Evaluation for the range of smallest leg angulation with femoral artery and vein overlap with
      femoral central catheterization in pediatrics.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In pediatrics, femoral vein catheterization often overlaps with the femoral artery.

      In this case, the risk of artery puncture is high, vein collapse when artery puncture 2nd,
      3rd times exceeds the success rate of catheterization becomes low. In previous study,
      comparing 0, 30, and 60 degrees with frog leg position, there was a study that the overlap
      was the smallest at 60 degrees. A previous study was a simple frog leg position and a study
      in fragmented predetermined angles. On a continuous measurement, we planned the study under
      the assumption that there is a more definite range of optimal angulation.

      Ultrasound probe in the state of Inguinal crease, we find a part without bifurcation of
      femoral artery and femoral vein in frog leg position(external rotation + flexion increase).
      Increase the leg angle and check the vein and arterie relations.

    <description>The optimal range of leg abduction was defined as the range without overlap in A group and the range presenting that the overlap was less-than half of the diameter of femoral vein in S group.
A1 angle defined the point that the femoral vein and artery started non-overlapping interval when increasing the angle of the leg in the A group and the A2 angle is defined the point that the femoral vein and artery ended non-overlapping interval.</description>

    <description>B1 is the angle at which the overlap starts at the half of the femoral vein radius when increasing the angle of the leg in the S group, B2 is the angle at which overlap starts at half or more of the femoral vein radius again.
