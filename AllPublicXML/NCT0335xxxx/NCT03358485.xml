    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, randomized, doule blind, placebo-controlled, multiple dose
      escalaction phase 1b study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Aolanti Weikang tablets
      in healthy volunteers. Aolanti Weikang tablets is a Chinese patent drug designed to treat
      Functional dyspepsia (FD). The proposed dose escalaction levels is 3,6 and 8 tablets. If MTD
      is not established up to 8 tablets, the dose escalaction will be stopped. In each dose level,
      subjects will be randomly given orally Aolanti Weikang tablets or placebo tablets at a 3:1
      ratio three times a day (tid) for 7 consecutive days, then will receive the Safety follow up
      for 14 days. No intrapatient dose-escalation is permitted.
