  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is to maximize efficacy of message delivery to achieve desired Obstructive sleep
      apnea (OSA) adherence goal. Newly diagnosed black patients (n=390, all genders) from
      participating sleep clinics will be randomly exposed to either the individually tailored or
      standard OSA messages. Investigators will look at an effective and scalable intervention to
      improve OSA-related outcomes: a) clinical CVD and brain health measures and b)
      patient-centered outcomes. Patient-centered and adherence data will be captured via REDCap,
      enabling real-time application of data-driven decision rules while implementing the
      intervention.

    <measure>Change from Baseline OSA Self-Efficacy Scale Score to 6 Months Score</measure>
    <time_frame>2 Months and 6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The mean of the nonmissing item responses was calculated for each of the 3 subscales: Perceived Risk, Outcome Expectancies, and Treatment Self-Efficacy. Using this mean-weighted score prevents the distortion of the score from missing responses. Factor 1 (Risk Perception consisting of 8 questions); Factor 2 (Outcome Expectancy consisting of 9 items) and Factor 3 (Treatment Self Efficacy consisting of 9 items) are given a potential score of 1-4.</description>
