  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The surgical procedures in outpatient surgery are in perpetual increase. However, the peri
      operative stress can reduce the gastric emptying. A patient's compliance for following the
      fasting rules cannot be controlled at home. Ambulatory surgery is currently proposed to
      fragile patients with many comorbidities known to slow gastric emptying. In day case surgery
      the airway management are often managed with supraglottic device ( laryngeal mask). This
      device does not protect the respiratory tract and may expose the patient to a risk of
      inhalation of gastric content (if not empty).

      This study aim to mesure the prevalence of full stomachs in outpatient surgery and to observe
      any changes in anesthetic management secondary to the ultrasound assessment of gastric
      content. It will confront theoretical full stomach risk factors with ultrasound findings. The
      practical and clinical relevance of such a technique in the context of outpatient surgery
      will be assessed in this study. The ultimate goal is to improve the safety of the patient's
      anesthetic management by controlling the risk of pulmonary aspiration.

      Patients will be included during the pre-anesthetic evaluation. The theoretical full stomach
      risk factors and the anesthetic management will be recorded in the computerized
      pre-anesthetic evaluation.

      A qualitative and quantitative ultrasound evaluation will be performed when the patient
      arrives in the pre-anesthesia room. The examination will be performed in the right lateral
      decubitus with a low frequency convex ultrasound probe.

      The main objective is to measure the prevalence of patients with a &quot;full stomach&quot; based on
      ultrasound criteria.

      The primary endpoint is the presence of solid or fluid greater than 1.5 ml / kg of the
      predicted ideal body weight during ultrasonographic evaluation of gastric contents. In this
      situation, the patient will be considered at high risk of inhalation (considered full
      stomach).

      This study will observe and record any anesthetic changes (ie : airway management) secondary
      to this ultrasouund assessment of gastric contents.
