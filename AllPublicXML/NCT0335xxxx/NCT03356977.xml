  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 4-week study will evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and efficacy of
      crisaborole ointment 2%, applied twice daily (BID) in subjects who are 3 months to less than
      24 months of age with mild-to-moderate AD.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 125 subjects will be enrolled. Subjects must have mild-to-moderate AD involving
      at least 5% treatable %BSA assessed on Baseline/Day 1. Treatable %BSA will be defined as the
      percent of a subject's total body surface area that is AD-involved, excluding the scalp.

      In addition, a cohort of at least 16 of the 125 subjects will be included in a subgroup for
      PK assessment. These subjects must have moderate AD and a minimum of 35% treatable %BSA,
      excluding the scalp, and must complete all PK assessments to be included in the PK analysis.
      Of these subjects, at least 3 subjects who are less than 9 months of age will be enrolled.
      Subjects discontinuing for reasons other than treatment emergent adverse event ( TEAE) may be
      replaced at the discretion of the sponsor to ensure 16 subjects complete the PK assessments.
      Only selected study sites will participate in the PK assessment.

      Scheduled study visits/telephone contacts for all subjects will occur at Screening (up to 28
      days prior to Baseline/Day 1), Baseline/Day 1, Day 8, Day 15, Day 22, Day 29 (end of
      treatment/early termination), Day 36, and Day 57 (end of study).

    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) up to at least 28 days after last dose of investigational product (up to 60 days)</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received investigational product without regard to possibility of causal relationship. SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly; medically important events. Treatment-emergent were events between first dose of investigational product and up to 28 days after the last dose of investigational product that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. AEs included both SAEs and non-SAEs. Site reactions are reactions which occurred in participants at the site of application of investigational product.</description>

        <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received investigational product without regard to possibility of causal relationship. SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly; medically important events. Treatment-emergent were events between first dose of investigational product and up to 28 days after the last dose of investigational product that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. AEs included both SAEs and non-SAEs. Site reactions are reactions which occurred in participants at the site of application of investigational product.</description>
