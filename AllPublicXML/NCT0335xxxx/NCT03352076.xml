      A Comparative, Open-Label, Randomized, Parallel Group Study to determine Intraperitoneal
      fluids, tissue, and serum concentrations of VML-0501 following five days of daily vaginal
      applications of single dose of VML-0501 (100 mg Danazol), in comparison to five days of
      Danazol treatment administered as an oral capsule (Danatrol) at a daily dose of 600 mg, in
      two groups of twelve each consisting of women with suspected or confirmed endometriosis and
      scheduled for laparoscopy.
