  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The proportion of participants who achieve inactive disease based on the Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) measure</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>An ASDAS inactive disease response is a score of &lt;1.3 on a composite index to assess disease activity in Ankylosing Spondylitis. Parameters include spinal pain, the patient's global assessment of disease activity, peripheral pain/swelling, duration of morning stiffness and C-reactive protein (CRP) in mg/L. In this study, ASDAS is used to estimate the difference in response between 150mg and 300mg of secukinumab.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The proportion of participants who achieve a clinically important improvement on the Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>A change from baseline in ASDAS score of â‰¥1.1 is considered a clinically important improvement in disease activity in Ankylosing Spondylitis. In this study, ASDAS is used to estimate the difference in response between 150mg and 300mg of secukinumab.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change over time in Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>BASDAI is a validated assessment tool using 0 through 10 scales (0 indicating &quot;no problem&quot; and 10 indicating &quot;worst problem&quot;), to characterize six clinical domains pertaining to five major symptoms of AS perceived by the patients. Computed composite scores of 4 or greater indicate suboptimal disease control. In this study, BASDAI is used to estimate the difference in response between 150mg and 300mg of secukinumab.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of patients who achieve Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index 50 (BASDAI-50)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>BASDAI-50 represents a change from baseline (improvement) of at least 50% in BASDAI score. In this study, BASDAI is used to estimate the difference in response between 150mg and 300mg of secukinumab.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The proportion of participants who achieve an ASAS 20 response (Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society criteria)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>ASAS 20 response is a validated composite assessment, reflecting the proportion of treated patients who achieve within a defined time frame at least 20% improvement in score in at least 3 of a conventional set of 4 clinical domains relevant to AS and no worsening in the fourth domain. In this study, ASAS20 is used to estimate the difference in response between 150mg and 300mg of secukinumab.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The proportion of participants who achieve an ASAS 40 response</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>ASAS 40 response is a validated composite assessment, reflecting the proportion of treated patients who achieve within a defined time frame at least 40% improvement in score in at least 3 of a conventional set of 4 clinical domains relevant to AS and no worsening in the fourth domain. In this study, ASAS40 is used to estimate the difference in response between 150mg and 300mg of secukinumab.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The proportion of patients who achieve an ASAS partial remission</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The ASAS partial remission criteria are defined as a value not above 2 units in each of the four main domains on a scale of 10. In this study, ASAS partial remission is used to estimate the difference in response between 150mg and 300mg of secukinumab.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>

Patients score each item as &quot;I agree&quot; and &quot;I do not agree&quot;. In this study, ASAS-HI is used to estimate the difference in response between 150mg and 300mg of secukinumab.</description>

    <measure>Change in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT) - Fatigue over time</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The FACIT-Fatigue is a 13-item questionnaire that assesses self-reported fatigue and its impact upon daily activities and function. It is administered at Visits 4
- 19. &quot;. In this study, FACIT-Fatigue is used to estimate the difference in response between 150mg and 300mg of secukinumab.</description>
