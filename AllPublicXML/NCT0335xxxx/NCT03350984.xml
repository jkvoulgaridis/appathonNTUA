  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to determine differences in glycemic control between a traditional
      regimen with Neutral Protamine Hagedorn insulin (NPH) and a &quot;physiological&quot; regimen or basal
      bolus regimen with glargine and lispro insulin in a population of hospitalized patients with
      type 2 diabetes in a Noncritical Care Facility. Patients with a recent diagnosis of type 2
      and patients on treatment with oral hypoglycaemic agents and insulin or only insulin were
      included.

      The primary outcome of the study is to determine difference in efficacy and security between
      the treatment groups as measured by the mean daily blood glucose (efficacy is normoglycemia
      and number of days in glycemic control during the hospital stay; security is hypoglycemic
      events and complication diabetes mellitus associated).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      On the first 4 to 6 h, the use of NPH insulin present a pronounced action peak on the
      postprandial glucose metabolism, and the rest of its basal action last 12 to 18 h, its cover
      the postprandial requirements of the first two meals of the day (breakfast and lunch)
      administering 2/3 of the total dose, and the requirements for the dinner with 1/3 of the
      total dose at the night. This is considered a good scheme for handling hyperglycemia, and its
      possible to have less hypoglycemia episodes, which are possible if an ultra-rapid-acting
      insulin is added and adequate intake is not performed due to multiple factors related to
      hospitalization.

      Today it is uncertain whether there is any clear benefit of using Glargine plus Lantus
      insulin over NPH insulin in hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes. Currently, both
      Glargine and NPH based regimen is practiced in inpatient hospital facilities. Current
      practice of inpatient insulin regimen is based on the physicians familiarity with a
      particular insulin type and personal preference rather than evidenced based knowledge.
      Glargine plus ultrafast insulin are two types of insulin that are more expensive compared to
      NPH with incidental benefits in hospitalized patients. There are reports in the literature
      about the incidence of hypoglycemia with this scheme. The current research proposal is to
      compare these two schemes in the treatment of hospitalized patients with diabetes.

      <recruitment_details>A total of 111 hospitalized DM2 patients not critical to the study were evaluated. Of these, 35 did not meet the inclusion criteria and the 75 included participants were randomized into two groups. The recruitment of patients began on November 2, 2017 and ended on June 1, 2018.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Within the &quot;physiological&quot; group, 1 patient was eliminated before initiating the insulin regimen, presenting acute abdomen and requiring intensive therapy. Therefore, 36 patients will start treatment in the &quot;physiological&quot; group and 39 patients in the traditional group.</pre_assignment_details>

    <certain_agreements>
      <pi_employee>All Principal Investigators ARE employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>There is NOT an agreement between Principal Investigators and the Sponsor (or its agents) that restricts the PI's rights to discuss or publish trial results after the trial is completed. </restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>Although the patients had an oral diet, the prolonged stay due to complications not associated with DM2 reduced their caloric intake.
The physiological scheme is more demanding, making it difficult to stick to the ideal conditions of the study.</limitations_and_caveats>
