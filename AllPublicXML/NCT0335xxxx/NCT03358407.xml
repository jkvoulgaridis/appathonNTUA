  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is the first administration of GSK2983559, a selective receptor interacting
      protein 2 (RIP2) kinase inhibitor, to humans. This will be randomized, double-blinded
      (sponsor open) and two part study (A and B). Part A of the study is single ascending dose
      crossover design with two separate cohorts (1 and 2). In Part A, 9 single dose levels will be
      explored. In Cohort 1, 10 healthy subjects will randomized to receive single oral doses of
      either GSK2983559 or placebo in a ratio of 4:1 in 5 way cross-over design with 5 treatment
      periods. In Cohort 2, 8 healthy subjects will be randomized to receive single oral doses of
      either GSK2983559 or placebo in a ratio of 3:1 in 4 way cross-overs design with 4 treatment
      periods. In Cohort 2 there will be an additional period (period 5-open label) for assessing
      GSK2983559 under fed conditions. There will be 48 hours wash-out period between each dose
      escalation period. Part B is repeat ascending dose sequential group design. It will contain 4
      Cohorts of and dosing will be done sequential dosing. Subjects in Part B will receive once
      daily (QD) dose or twice daily dose (will be decided based upon the pharmacokinetic, safety
      and tolerability observed in Part A). There will 58 subjects involved in this study. Total
      duration of Part A will be approximately for 11 Weeks and Part B will be approximately for 15
      Weeks.

Participants were counted in the worst-case category that their value changed to (low, within range or no change, or high) unless there was no change in their category. Participants whose value category was unchanged (e.g., High to High), or whose value became within range, were recorded in the 'To within Range or No Change' category. Only those hematology parameters with PCI values have been presented.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This was a 2-part study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of GSK2983559 in healthy participants. The study was terminated early due to non-clinical toxicology findings and reduced safety margins. Placebo arms across similar dosing strategies were combined as pre-specified in reporting and analysis plan.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 85 participants were screened, of them, 54 participants were screen failures and 31 participants were enrolled and received study treatment in Part A. The study was terminated during Cohort 2 of Part A, hence no participants were enrolled in period 3, 4 and 5 (Cohort 2) of Part A and in Part B.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>Hematology parameters included hematocrit, hemoglobin, lymphocytes, platelet counts, total neutrophils and white blood cells (WBCs) count. PCI ranges were: hematocrit (high: &gt;0.54 proportion of red blood cells in blood and low: change from baseline&lt;0.0075); hemoglobin (high: &gt;180 grams per liter [g/L] and low: change from baseline&lt;25 g/L); lymphocytes (low: &lt;0.8 Giga cells/L); platelet count (low: &lt;100 Giga cells/L and high: &gt;550 Giga cells/L); neutrophil count (low: &lt;1.5 Giga cells/L); white blood cell count (low: &lt;3 Giga cells/L and high: &gt;20 Giga cells/L). Participants were counted in the worst-case category that their value changed to (low, within range or no change, or high) unless there was no change in their category. Participants whose value category was unchanged (e.g., High to High), or whose value became within range, were recorded in the 'To within Range or No Change' category. Only those hematology parameters with PCI values have been presented.</description>

Participants were counted in the worst-case category that their value changed to (low, within range or no change, or high) unless there was no change in their category.

        <description>12-lead ECGs were obtained using an ECG machine. Only those participants who had any abnormal ECG findings are presented. Abnormal ECG findings were categorized as clinically significant (CS) and not clinically significant (NCS) abnormal ECG findings. Clinically significant abnormal findings are those which are not associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant's condition.</description>

        <description>DBP and SBP were measured in semi-supine position after 5 minutes rest. PCI ranges included DBP: &lt;45 mmHg (lower) and &gt;100 mmHg (higher) and SBP: &lt;85 mmHg (lower) and &gt;160 mmHg (higher). Participants were counted in the worst case category that their value changes to (low, or within range or no change, or high), unless there is no change in their category. Participants whose value category was unchanged (e.g., High to High), or whose value became within range, were recorded in the 'To within Range or No Change' category.
