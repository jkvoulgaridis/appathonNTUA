  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Only a small number of research studies evaluated the impact of various subcutaneous tissue
      and skin closure methods at cesarean section. In a meta-analysis a major decline in incision
      site rupture was revealed when suturing the subcutaneous tissue in women with a subcutaneous
      depth &gt;2 cm.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative wound complications are one of the great issues in cesarean section (CS) with
      an incidence ranging from 3% to 30%.1 Obesity, operative time, diabetes, age of the patient,
      anemia, associated infection (e.g chorioamnionitis), the use of internal monitoring, delayed
      labor with many vaginal examinations and reduced nutrition are recognized risk factors for
      wound infections.

      Evaluating the various techniques for closure of the subcutaneous layer.
