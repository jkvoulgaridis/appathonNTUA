    <textblock>
      Single arm pilot study of adults â‰¥18yo investigating changes in liver stiffness as measured
      by ultrasound acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) before and after creation of TIPS.
      Duration of participation is 30 days from TIPS creation. TIPS creation with Viatorr stent
      graft will be in accordance with its FDA-approved indication for symptomatic portal
      hypertension and per the manufacturer's instructions for use. Liver stiffness will be
      measured on pre-TIPS and post-TIPS ultrasounds using Phillips Epiq Ultrasound systems
      equipped with ElastPQ ultrasound shear wave elastography. Both ultrasounds will be performed
      at times which are standard of care before and after TIPS creation. Primary objectives
      include liver stiffness as measured by ultrasound acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI)
      before and after creation of TIPS. Secondary objectives include change in portosystemic
      gradient, clinical success as measured by difference in frequency of repeat paracentesis
      post-TIPS or freedom from recurrence of variceal bleeding and rate of hepatic encephalopathy.
      Exploratory objectives include serum biomarkers of liver stiffness.

    <description>The primary study endpoint will be decrease in liver stiffness following TIPS creation as measured by ARFI using mean propagation velocity values in meters per second. Mean normal values and mean values indicating severe fibrosis range about 0.8-1.7 m/s and about 1-3.4 m/s respectively. We hypothesize TIPS creation will reduce the liver stiffness by &gt; 50%. Change in liver stiffness will be correlated to change in PSG.</description>

          <title>Childs-Pugh Score</title>
          <description>The Child-Pugh score is a system for assessing the prognosis of chronic liver disease, primarily cirrhosis. It provides a forecast of the increasing severity of liver disease and expected survival rate.The score is determined by five clinical measures of liver disease. A score of 1, 2, or 3 is given to each measure, with 3 being the most severe. The five clinical measures are:
total bilirubin
serum albumin
prothrombin time, prolongation(s) or INR
ascites
hepatic encephalopathy
The Childs-Pugh score ranges from 5 to 15 and a higher score indicates greater severity of liver disease.</description>

        <title>Decrease in Liver Stiffness</title>
        <description>The primary study endpoint will be decrease in liver stiffness following TIPS creation as measured by ARFI using mean propagation velocity values in meters per second. Mean normal values and mean values indicating severe fibrosis range about 0.8-1.7 m/s and about 1-3.4 m/s respectively. We hypothesize TIPS creation will reduce the liver stiffness by &gt; 50%. Change in liver stiffness will be correlated to change in PSG.</description>

Ultrasound: Hepatic ultrasound using gray scale, color Doppler, and spectral Doppler imaging to evaluate hepatic vein and portal vein patency, direction and velocity of flow respectively. ARFI will be performed in the right hepatic lobe. Three measurements of stiffness (m/s) will be performed and the mean value recorded.</description>
