  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a single center, open-label, single-arm study in which approximately 28 Hepatitis A
      virus (HAV)-seronegative healthy subjects were enrolled. There was a screening period of up
      to 28 days during which subjects were screened for enrollment in the study.

      Healthy subjects received a single intramuscular (IM) dose of GamaSTAN (0.2 mL/kg), followed
      by a pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling period of 150 days (approximately 5 half-lives). The
      protective levels of anti-HAV antibodies were assessed up to 60 days after the administration
      of GamaSTAN. A PK curve was obtained during the PK sampling period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a single center, open-label, single-arm study design, in which approximately 28
      subjects received the same study treatment (0.2 mL/kg dose via IM injection). There was no
      reference therapy in this study.

      The study was explained to each subject prior to the subject providing written informed
      consent. All subjects were screened to ensure that all the inclusion criteria and none of the
      exclusion criteria were met.

      A sufficient number of healthy male and female subjects were qualified by screening
      assessments and procedures for reporting to the clinical site on Day -1. The healthy subjects
      received a single IM dose of GamaSTAN (0.2 mL/kg) on Day 1. Subjects were discharged from the
      clinic on Day 2, following the scheduled assessments and procedures, and returned to the
      clinical site for the remaining ambulatory PK samples and safety monitoring, and again for
      the final visit (Day 150).

      The total duration of study participation for subjects who completed the study were
      approximately 178 days.
