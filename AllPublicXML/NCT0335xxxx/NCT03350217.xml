  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      EMR is a technique used for the removal of flat or sessile neoplasms confined to the
      superficial layers of the GI tract using a snare. Injection-assisted EMR is commonly used
      during resections of larger flat lesions as it provides submucosal lift of polyps, adenomas,
      other gastrointestinal mucosal lesions or early-stage cancers prior to EMR. This has been
      found to minimize mechanical or electrocautery damage to the deep layers of the
      gastrointestinal tract wall as the injectate provides a &quot;safety cushion&quot; as such between the
      area to be removed and healthy mucosal tissue.

      Several solutions are used today for injecting lesions including saline, hyaluronic acid, and
      hydroxyethyl starch (Hetastarch). Saline solution has been found to dissipate within minutes,
      which may result in a lower quality lesion lift. Hyaluronic acid provides a longer lift, but
      is expensive and is not readily available in the U.S.

      A new injectate known as Eleview has been developed for use in gastrointestinal endoscopic
      procedures and recently approved by the FDA. This injectate boasts a cushion of excellent
      height and duration through the use of an oil-in-water emulsion. However, the initial cost of
      this material is quite high ($80 per 10 ml).

      Hetastarch, which is the current injectate used by Dr Rex, is a safe and considerably
      inexpensive solution that provides prolonged submucosal elevation and lowers procedure times.
      Our study will aim to compare Eleview to Hetastarch in the hopes of finding the ideal
      submucosal injectate.

      This trial will focus on polyps of size ≥11 mm removed by snare EMR technique. Patients with
      lesions deemed not suitable for EMR due to features suggestive of sub-mucosal invasion will
      not be included.

      Injectate randomization:

      Study patients will be randomly assigned to the Eleview or the Hetastarch treatment group in
      a 1:1 ratio. Randomization will occur at the site using envelopes provided by the
      Investigator. The envelope's contents will specify the treatment assignment for each patient
      and opened by the research team (PI will be blinded). The investigators will monitor the
      safety and effectiveness data. The appropriate solutions will be injected into the submucosal
      space beneath the lesion(s) to be excised before the lesion(s) is/are removed. Subjects in
      both groups will receive the appropriate volume of injectate deemed necessary by the PI for
      the individual patient.

      Sample size and Statistical Analysis At least 200 patients will be enrolled. 100 of these
      patients will be randomized to Eleview injectate and 100 will be given the standard of care,
      Hetastarch injectate only. Efficacy and safety of Eleview injectate has only been reviewed in
      one previous study. Therefore, the planned sample size was not calculated using a statistical
      power analysis, but was regarded as sufficient to repeat the objectives of the COSMO study
      (2017) and satisfy the exploratory purposes of the present study.

      Study personnel will carry out a simple randomization using a commonly used online generator.
      Randomization assignments will then be sealed until day of procedure until patient
      eligibility has been confirmed. The Principal Investigator will remain blinded and will
      perform all data analysis after completion of the study.

      Data will be summarized and compared using classic descriptive statistics, i.e. mean,
      standard deviation, coefficient of variation (%), minimum, median and maximum values for
      quantitative variables, and frequencies for qualitative variables.

      The Sydney Resection Quotient will be compared between treatment groups using a Wilcoxon
      Rank-Sum test. The proportion of subjects with en bloc resection of all endoscopically
      visible lesions will also be compared between treatment groups using a Fisher's exact test. A
      nominal alpha level of 0.05 will be used for both the comparisons.

      No formal comparison will be performed for the secondary endpoints.

The Sydney Resection Quotient (SRQ) is the size of the polyp divided by the number of pieces in which the polyp was resected. A larger SRQ is better than a smaller SRQ.</description>
        <time_frame>During the large polyp removal</time_frame>
        <population>Some patients had more than one eligible polyp for the study so there ended up being 84 adenomas and 30 serrated lesions in the Eleview arm and 75 adenomas and 27 serrated lesions in the Hetastarch arm. The number of patients within a column doesn't equal the number of overall patients in the arm because some had both types of polyps.</population>

          <description>Comparison of how long the injection fluid was able to keep the polyp lifted during the large polyp removal between Eleview and Hetastarch. This was rating using the following scale: Excellent, Sufficient, or Inadequate. The longer the injection fluid stayed concentrated and kept the polyp lifted, the better rating it received while rapid dissipation of the fluid would receive a worse rating.</description>

        <title>Safety Outcomes as Assessed by Complications During or After the Procedure</title>
        <description>To evaluate the safety of Eleview for EMR procedures in relation to adverse events and occurrence of complications during and after the EMR procedure in comparison to Hetastarch injectate.</description>
        <time_frame>during large polyp removal through 30 days post procedure</time_frame>
        <population>There were 77 patients in the Eleview arm of the study. Since some patients had more than one eligible polyp for the study, there ended up being 114 lesions included in the Eleview arm. For the same reason, there are 81 patients but 102 polyps in the Hetastarch group.</population>

Eleview: If a lesion in the colon is found to fit the description listed in the protocol, the subject will be randomized to Eleview or Hetastarch as the injectate solution for the procedure. The injectate solution is used, as needed, to aid in the resection of the target lesion.</description>
