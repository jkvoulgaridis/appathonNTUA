  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Quantium Medical Company has an ElectoEcenphalograph-based (EEG-based) algorithm with two
      outputs: qCON for unconsciousness and qNOX for anti-nociception. qCON, is designed to provide
      information about the depth of the hypnotic state, similar to that provided by the BISâ„¢.
