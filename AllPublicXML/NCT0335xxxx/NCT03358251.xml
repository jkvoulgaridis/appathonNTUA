  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label split-mouth study in which Pocket-X Gel, a periodontal in-situ
      gelling product, will be applied to periodontal pockets in one/two mouth segment(s) of
      participants, following scaling and root planing on the entire mouth, while the contralateral
      segment(s) will serve as control. The aim of the study is to investigate the safety and
      efficacy of Pocket-X Gel in improving the healing of the gingiva and preventing bacterial
      re-colonization in the periodontal pocket following scaling and root planing.

      This study is an open-label split-mouth study that investigates the safety and efficacy of
      Pocket-X Gel, a periodontal in-situ gelling product, in improving the healing of the gingiva
      and preventing bacterial re-colonization in the periodontal pocket following scaling and root
      planing.

      The study includes a single arm. All participants will undergo 1-4 sessions of scaling and
      root planing (SRP), which is the conventional gold-standard treatment for periodontal
      disease. The number of SRP sessions is dependent on the severity of the periodontal disease.
      Following completion of SRP, participants will undergo treatment with Pocket-X Gel, which
      will be inserted into periodontal pockets present in one/two of the participants mouth
      segments (quadrants), following scaling and root planing. The other mouth segments will not
      undergo further intervention. The number of segments to be treated is dependent on the
      clinical symmetry between the treated segment(s) and the contralateral segment(s).
      Participants will be followed for a total duration of 6 months. Additional application of
      Pocket-X Gel may occur 1 month and/or 3 months following first application, depending on the
      state of the participant's periodontal disease.

      The rationale for the study is the hypothesis that a physical barrier inserted into
      periodontal pockets following scaling and root planing would assist in maintaining the pocket
      clean by preventing bacteria from re-entering the cleaned pocket, thus allowing the gums to
      properly heal and seal the pockets while preventing further inflammation.

    <description>This arm is a split-mouth arm, i.e., participants will receive conventional treatment for periodontitis (scaling and root planing) for the entire mouth, and, in addition, will receive experimental treatment (Pocket-X Gel) for periodontal pockets present in one/two mouth segments (quadrants), while the contralateral quadrants will serve as control and will not undergo any further intervention.</description>

    <intervention_name>Pocket-X Gel</intervention_name>
    <description>Pocket-X Gel is a biodegradable in-situ gelling product that is inserted into a pre-cleaned periodontal pocket where it quickly turns into a gel that adheres to the periodontal pocket and acts as a filler and physical barrier against bacterial re-colonization at the site of application. Administration of this product typically causes no discomfort. The product naturally degrades after 1-3 weeks.</description>
