  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the ability of subjects who are already prescribed
      Certolizumab Pergol therapy and have been self injecting with prefilled syringes for at least
      the previous three months, to safely and effectively self-inject Certolizumab Pegol (CZP)
      using the e-Device and to evaluate the post-use structural integrity of used devices and
      cassettes via visual examination.

    <measure>Percentage of Subjects Able to Self-administer Safe and Effective Injections Using the e-Device at Visit 2</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 2 (Week 2 for Q2W; Week 4 for Q4W)</time_frame>
    <description>Safe and effective self-injection was evaluated by the healthcare provider and is defined as:
Dose Delivery: Subject self-injected the complete dose of Certolizumab Pegol (CZP) as confirmed by a visual inspection of the CZP-cassette(s) which shows the pre-filled syringe container to be empty AND
No Adverse Events related to use of the e-Device (Adverse Device Effects) that would preclude continued use of the e-Device for self-injection.
For subjects on the Q4W (every 4 weeks) dosing regimen who would self-inject twice (2×200 mg CZP) at each visit, each injection was evaluated for safety and effectiveness using the above criteria. The primary endpoint of safe and effective self-injection for subjects on the Q4W dosing regimen was met only if both self-injections were determined to be safe and effective.</description>

    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product that did not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of investigational medicinal product (IMP), whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.</description>

    <description>An Adverse Device Event (ADE) was an AE related to the use of an investigational device. An ADE must have met 1 or more of the following criteria:
Adverse event that resulted from insufficiencies or inadequacies in the Instructions for Use (IFU), the deployment, the implantation, the installation, the operation, or any malfunction of the investigational medical device
Adverse event that was a result of an error or intentional misuse.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Subjects Able to Self-administer Safe and Effective Injections Using the e-Device at Visit 2</title>
        <description>Safe and effective self-injection was evaluated by the healthcare provider and is defined as:
Dose Delivery: Subject self-injected the complete dose of Certolizumab Pegol (CZP) as confirmed by a visual inspection of the CZP-cassette(s) which shows the pre-filled syringe container to be empty AND
No Adverse Events related to use of the e-Device (Adverse Device Effects) that would preclude continued use of the e-Device for self-injection.
For subjects on the Q4W (every 4 weeks) dosing regimen who would self-inject twice (2×200 mg CZP) at each visit, each injection was evaluated for safety and effectiveness using the above criteria. The primary endpoint of safe and effective self-injection for subjects on the Q4W dosing regimen was met only if both self-injections were determined to be safe and effective.</description>

          <title>Incidence of Adverse Events (AEs) During the Study</title>
          <description>An Adverse Event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product that did not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of investigational medicinal product (IMP), whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.</description>

        <description>An Adverse Device Event (ADE) was an AE related to the use of an investigational device. An ADE must have met 1 or more of the following criteria:
Adverse event that resulted from insufficiencies or inadequacies in the Instructions for Use (IFU), the deployment, the implantation, the installation, the operation, or any malfunction of the investigational medical device
Adverse event that was a result of an error or intentional misuse.</description>
