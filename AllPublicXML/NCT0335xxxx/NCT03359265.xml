  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Erectile dysfunction (ED) is common, and is defined as &quot;persistent or regular inability to
      achieve or maintain penis erection for satisfactory intercourse&quot;. Approximately 3% to 71% of
      males have this problem as they age, and it is predicted that 320 million males worldwide
      will have ED by 2025. However, sex remains a topic that is too sensitive for most people to
      discuss openly. ED therapies include oral medication, vacuum erection devices,
      intracavernosal injection, testosterone supplementation, surgery, and psychological
      counseling. In addition, germanium (Ge), titanium (Ti), and π elements are noble metals that
      can be used to produce far-infrared radiation. There has been little application of these
      metals to the treatment of ED, but their use is worth investigating. Administered as health
      textiles, the application of these metals are expected to promote blood circulation,
      especially in the reproductive system, resulting in an improved sexual performance. Hence,
      the researcher aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of Ge-Ti-π elements fiber
      textiles as an ED treatment, assessed by using the questionnaires related to the quality of
      sexual function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial recruited 30 subjects with ED (a test group of 21 subjects and a control
      group of 9 subjects). Cellulosic textiles, incorporating noble metals (Ge, Ti, and π
      elements), developed by Green Energy Nano Technology Co., Ltd, were used in the test group,
      while commercially available regular textiles were used in the control group. The safety and
      efficacy of the treatment to the subject's sexual function quality were assessed through the
      International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) and the validated Portuguese version of the
      Quality of Erection Questionnaire (QEQ) questionnaires. In the same session, the symptoms
      related to ED were assessed through the Premature Ejaculation Diagnostic Tool (PEDT) and the
      International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) questionnaires. The questionnaires were completed
      once a month and followed up for 3 months. The incidence of severe adverse effects was
      analyzed to assess product safety.

    <measure>The International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>IIEF-5 is a multidimensional validated questionnaire with 15 questions in the five domains of sexual function, such as erectile and orgasmic functions, sexual desire, satisfaction with intercourse, and overall sexual satisfaction. IIEF-5 scoring:
The IIEF-5 score is the sum of the ordinal responses to the 5 items. 22-25: No erectile dysfunction 17-21: Mild erectile dysfunction 12-16: Mild to moderate erectile dysfunction 8-11: Moderate erectile dysfunction 5-7: Severe erectile dysfunction</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Erection Questionnaire (QEQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>QEQ is a questionnaire that provides a further level of information by assessing satisfaction with the quality of the erections that were attained and maintained. QEQ is to be evaluated as a total score, which is the sum of responses to all items transformed onto a 5-30 scale.
The maximum score on the QEQ is 30, and a higher score indicates better function.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Premature Ejaculation Diagnostic Tool (PEDT)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>PEDT has been shown to be valid in detecting the presence of premature ejaculation among patients with five questions. Each item has a score of zero to four, and PEDT is scored by considering all five items together, which a higher score indicates highly suggestive of premature ejaculation.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>IPSS is a well-known questionnaire to evaluate the symptom of prostate disease in patients. The answers are assigned points from 0 to 5. The total score can therefore range from 0 to 35 (asymptomatic to very symptomatic).</description>
