  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the placebo-controlled period is to evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of BIIB092 in participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) or with mild AD. The secondary objectives of the placebo-controlled
      period are to evaluate the efficacy of multiple doses of BIIB092 in slowing cognitive and
      functional impairment in participants with MCI due to AD or with mild AD, and to evaluate the
      immunogenicity of BIIB092 after multiple doses in participants with MCI due to AD or with
      mild AD.

      The primary objective of the long-term extension period is to evaluate the long-term safety
      and tolerability of BIIB092 in participants with MCI due to AD or with mild AD.

    <time_frame>Up to Week 238</time_frame>
    <description>AEs: any sign, symptom, or diagnosis/disease that is unfavorable or unintended, that is new, or if pre-existing, worsens in participants administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. SAEs: an event that results in death; an event that, in the view of the investigator, places the participant at immediate risk of death (a life-threatening event); an outcome that results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect diagnosed in a child of a participant; an event that requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization; an event that results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. Any other medically important event that, in the opinion of the investigator, may jeopardize the participant or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline Over Time at Week 78 on the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale - Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to Week 78</time_frame>
    <description>The CDR-SB is a validated clinical assessment of global function in participants with AD. Impairment is scored in each of 6 cognitive categories on a scale in which none = 0, questionable = 0.5, mild = 1, moderate = 2, and severe = 3. The 6 individual category ratings, or &quot;box scores&quot;, can be added together to give the CDR-SB which ranges from 0 to 18 (severe impairment).</description>

          -  Use of any medications that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may contribute to
             cognitive impairment, put the participants at higher risk for adverse events (AEs), or
