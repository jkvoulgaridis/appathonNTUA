  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized, cross-over Study designed
      to determine the efficacy of multiple intrathecal administrations of autologous mesenchymal
      stem cell-derived neural progenitor cells (MSC-NP) compared to placebo in patients with
      progressive multiple sclerosis. Efficacy will be measured through assessment of disability
      outcomes. Study participants will receive six intrathecal injections of culture-expanded
      autologous MSC-NPs at two month intervals in one year and six lumbar punctures as placebo
      treatments in a second year.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The IT-MSC-NP treatments and all clinical assessments will take place at a single center
      (Tisch MSRCNY). Study subjects will be assigned to blocks stratified by baseline EDSS score
      (3.0-4.0, 4.5-5.5, 6.0, and 6.5) and disease subtype (SPMS or PPMS). Study subjects are
      randomized in an equal fashion (1:1) to study treatment and placebo at initial randomization.
      Subjects in each block will be randomized into placebo or treatment group. In the second
      year, treated subjects will cross over to the placebo group and placebo subjects will cross
      over to the treated group.

      The total study duration will be 3 years upon enrollment. Each study subject will be required
      to attend up to 18 study visits, to include 1 screening visit, 1 bone marrow visit, 1
      baseline visit, followed by study visits every 2 months during the treatment period of two
      years (12 treatment/LP procedure visits and 2 outcome visits), and an additional follow-up
      visit at the end of year 3.

    <description>MSC-NPs represent a neural subpopulation of MSCs from bone marrow with reduced pluripotency and minimized risk of ectopic differentiation, thus are likely to be more suitable for CNS delivery. Importantly, characterization of MSC-NPs demonstrated their immunoregulatory and trophic properties, and MSC-NPs derived from MS and non-MS patients alike were therapeutically viable.</description>

             and by a stable MRI disease burden (number of T2 lesions and size of lesions) in the

             months

             patient may discontinue a medication.

          -  Start of any new orthotic device or durable medical equipment &lt; 6 months prior to
             beginning treatment or during the course of the study (patients may discontinue use of

          -  Any patients with a history of or with active malignancy

          -  Significantly uncontrolled hypertension because of increased risk for stroke or CNS

             received any study drug/biologics within the last 6 months. Additionally, while in the
