  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are difficulties in the progress of the study and cancel the plan. The purpose of this
      study is to evaluate the postoperative pain control using non - opioidal analgesics in
      children. The investigators will investigate the effect of single use and combination of
      caldorol(ibuprofen) compare to denogan(propacetamol) in children.

      Participants who receive the laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair between 6 months and 6 years
      old are divided 3 groups(caldolor, denogan, combination). Each groups are received a
      medication by protocol during surgery. After operation patient's pain score and use of
      additional analgesics are recorded in postanesthesia care unit and general ward.
