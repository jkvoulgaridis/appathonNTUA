  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Impaired physical function and muscle dysfunction are a major consequence of COPD, which may
      be associated with increased mortality, poor quality of life and increased health care use.
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel group study to evaluate the
      safety and tolerability of GSK2881078, an SARM over 13 weeks of dosing in older male subjects
      and post-menopausal female subjects with COPD and muscle weakness. This study will also
      assess the effect of GSK2881078 on physical strength and function after 13 weeks of
      treatment. Approximately 100 subjects with COPD and muscle weakness will be randomized into
      two cohorts of 50 male subjects and 50 female subjects. Within each cohort, subjects will be
      randomized to receive GSK2881078 or placebo in a ratio of 1:1. All subjects will participate
      in a standardized home exercise program, which will consist of daily walking, along with
      several resistance or weight-bearing exercises, such as bicep curls, upright rows, step ups
      and a sit-to-stand maneuver. The study will consist of a screening/Baseline period of up to
      30 days, a 13-week treatment period and a post-treatment follow-up period of 6 weeks.

    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1, Pre-dose), Day 90</time_frame>
    <description>The endurance shuttle walk test is a CWR test requiring the participant to walk around a flat 10 meter track at a constant individualized pace. The test was externally paced, set to elicit a maximal exercise response (pace was based on a fixed percentage of prior incremental shuttle walk test performance, which determined a participant's peak exercise capacity). CWR duration is the time in seconds required by a participant to cover a flat 10 meter track during this test. Day 1 (Pre-dose) was considered as a Baseline. Analysis was performed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model. Change from Baseline was calculated as post-dose visit value minus the Baseline value.</description>

             nasal congestion), fever &gt;37.5 degree Celsius without any explained cause, increased
             cough, increased wheeze. A moderate exacerbation is defined as an exacerbation that
             requires treatment with antibiotics and/or oral steroids. A severe exacerbation is
             defined as an event that is additionally associated with hospitalization or emergency
             room visit.

          -  Any moderate/severe COPD exacerbation in the 4 weeks preceding the screening visit.

          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or
             GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation.

          -  Participation in a formal pulmonary rehabilitation exercise program outside or inside
             the home, either currently or completed within the previous 6 months.

          -  For subjects who opt to have magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at participating study
             sites, there must be no contraindications to MRI, for example known claustrophobia or
             a pacemaker. Specific MRI contraindications will be determined by the type of MRI
             scanner available at each site and study personnel should confirm local eligibility
             requirements.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This was a Phase II, double-blind, randomized, multicenter study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of GSK2881078 over 13 weeks of once daily oral dosing, first time administered in older men and post-menopausal female participants with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and muscle weakness, participating in home exercise.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 200 participants were screened and 97 participants were enrolled in this study. Of which, 96 participants were randomized and received the study treatment. The remaining 1 participant was randomized without fulfilling the inclusion and exclusion criteria and therefore did not receive study medication.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>SBP and DBP were measured in a seated position with a completely automated device. Baseline was defined as the latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value, including those from unscheduled visits. Change from Baseline was calculated as post-dose visit value minus the Baseline value. Safety Population comprised of all randomized participants who received at least one dose of study medication. This population was based on the treatment the participant received.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Grade Increase Post-Baseline Relative to Baseline in Hematology Parameters</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected for the analysis of following hematology parameters: hemoglobin (Hb), lymphocyte count (Lympho), neutrophil count (Neutro) and platelet count (PC). The laboratory parameters were graded according to National Cancer Institute - Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) version 4.03. Grade 1: mild; Grade 2: moderate; Grade 3: severe or medically significant; Grade 4: life-threatening consequences. Baseline was defined as the latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value, including those from unscheduled visits. An increase is defined as an increase in CTCAE grade relative to Baseline grade. Only those participants with increase to grade 3 and increase to grade 4 are presented.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Grade Increase Post-Baseline Relative to Baseline in Clinical Chemistry Parameters</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected for the analysis of following clinical chemistry parameters: alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), bilirubin (Bil),calcium (Ca), cholesterol (Chol), creatinine (Creat), glucose(Gl), phosphate (Phos), potassium (Pot) and sodium (Sod). The laboratory parameters were graded according to NCI-CTCAE version 4.03. Grade 1: mild; Grade 2: moderate; Grade 3: severe or medically significant; Grade 4: life-threatening consequences. Baseline was defined as the latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value, including those from unscheduled visits. An increase is defined as an increase in CTCAE grade relative to Baseline grade. Values (Hyper and hypo) for Ca, Gl, Pot, Phos and Sod is presented. Only those participants with increase to grade 3 and increase to grade 4 are presented.</description>

        <description>Urine samples were collected to analyze the urinalysis parameter: specific gravity. Urine specific gravity is a measure of the concentration of solutes in the urine and provides information on the kidney's ability to concentrate urine, indicated as ratio of urine density to water density. Baseline was defined as the latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value, including those from unscheduled visits. Change from Baseline was calculated as post-dose visit value minus the Baseline value.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Urinalysis Parameter; Specific Gravity: GSK2881078 1.0 mg- Female Participants</title>
          <description>Urine samples were collected to analyze the urinalysis parameter: specific gravity. Urine specific gravity is a measure of the concentration of solutes in the urine and provides information on the kidney's ability to concentrate urine, indicated as ratio of urine density to water density. Baseline was defined as the latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value, including those from unscheduled visits. Change from Baseline was calculated as post-dose visit value minus the Baseline value.</description>

        <description>Urine samples were collected to analyze the urinalysis parameter: pH. Urine pH is an acid-base measurement. pH is measured on a numeric scale ranging from 0 to 14; values on the scale refer to the degree of alkalinity or acidity. A pH of 7 is neutral. A pH less than 7 is acidic, and a pH greater than 7 is basic. Normal urine has a slightly acidic pH (5.0 - 6.0). Baseline was defined as the latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value, including those from unscheduled visits. Change from Baseline was calculated as post-dose visit value minus the Baseline value.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Urinalysis Parameter; pH: Male Participants</title>
          <description>Urine samples were collected to analyze the urinalysis parameter: pH. Urine pH is an acid-base measurement. pH is measured on a numeric scale ranging from 0 to 14; values on the scale refer to the degree of alkalinity or acidity. A pH of 7 is neutral. A pH less than 7 is acidic, and a pH greater than 7 is basic. Normal urine has a slightly acidic pH (5.0 - 6.0). Baseline was defined as the latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value, including those from unscheduled visits. Change from Baseline was calculated as post-dose visit value minus the Baseline value.</description>

        <description>Lower extremity strength was measured as 1-RM on a leg press device. Participants continued with a one set of 5 to 10 repetitions of lifting weights using 40 to 60% of estimated maximum, after warm up. Participants, then lifted progressively heavier weights in steps, with each step separated by an appropriate rest period, until participant could not complete the lift. The last successfully completed lift was recorded as the 1-RM. Baseline was defined as the latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value, including those from unscheduled visits. Percentage change from Baseline was calculated by 100*[(post-dose value minus Baseline value)/ Baseline value]. Adjusted means and standard error (SE) are presented. Analysis Population comprised of the participants in the 'All Participants (all randomized participants who received at least one dose of study medication)' Population having Baseline and at least one post-Baseline assessment of the treatment the participant was randomized to.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Maximum Leg Press Strength Following 1 Repetition Maximum (1-RM) at Day 28</title>
        <description>Lower extremity strength was measured as 1-RM on a leg press device. Participants continued with a one set of 5 to 10 repetitions of lifting weights using 40 to 60% of estimated maximum, after warm up. Participants, then lifted progressively heavier weights in steps, with each step separated by an appropriate rest period, until participant could not complete the lift. The last successfully completed lift was recorded as the 1-RM. Baseline was defined as the latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value, including those from unscheduled visits. Change from Baseline was calculated as post-dose visit value minus the Baseline value. Adjusted means and SE are presented.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Appendicular Lean Mass as Assessed by Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) at Day 28</title>
        <description>Participants were asked to lie on a padded platform while a mechanical arm passed over their body. Appendicular lean mass was calculated from the regional lean mass measurements of the arms and legs using DXA. Day 1 (Pre-dose) was considered as a Baseline. Analysis was performed using mixed model repeated measures. Change from Baseline was calculated as post-dose visit value minus the Baseline value. Adjusted means and SE are presented.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Total Lean Mass as Assessed by Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) at Day 28</title>
        <description>Participants were asked to lie on a padded platform while a mechanical arm passed over their body. Total lean mass was measured using DXA. Day 1 (Pre-dose) was considered as a Baseline. Analysis was performed using mixed model repeated measures. Change from Baseline was calculated as post-dose visit value minus the Baseline value. Adjusted means and SE are presented.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Total Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) Score at Day 28</title>
        <description>Participants were assessed for balance, time for chair rise and gait speed. These are the three components of SPPB. Each component was scored from 0 to 4. The total SPPB score was calculated by taking sum of scores of all 3 components, which ranged from 0 (worst performance) to 12 (best performance). Higher scores indicated better performance. Scores 10 to 12 indicated 'fit/normal' and scores &lt;=7 indicated frail participant. Baseline was defined as the latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value, including those from unscheduled visits. Change from Baseline was calculated as post-dose visit value minus the Baseline value. Adjusted means and SE are presented.</description>

          <description>Participants were assessed for balance, time for chair rise and gait speed. These are the three components of SPPB. Each component was scored from 0 to 4. The total SPPB score was calculated by taking sum of scores of all 3 components, which ranged from 0 (worst performance) to 12 (best performance). Higher scores indicated better performance. Scores 10 to 12 indicated 'fit/normal' and scores &lt;=7 indicated frail participant. Baseline was defined as the latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value, including those from unscheduled visits. Change from Baseline was calculated as post-dose visit value minus the Baseline value. Adjusted means and SE are presented.</description>

        <description>'Time for chair rise' is one of the 3 components of SPPB, which was assessed by repeated chair stand test and calculated as time for five successful chair stands measured in seconds. Baseline was defined as the latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value, including those from unscheduled visits. Analysis was performed using mixed model repeated measures. Change from Baseline was calculated as post-dose visit value minus the Baseline value. Adjusted means and SE are presented.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Constant Work Rate (CWR) Duration From Endurance Shuttle Walking Test</title>
        <description>The endurance shuttle walk test is a CWR test requiring the participant to walk around a flat 10 meter track at a constant individualized pace. The test was externally paced, set to elicit a maximal exercise response (pace was based on a fixed percentage of prior incremental shuttle walk test performance, which determined a participant's peak exercise capacity). CWR duration is the time in seconds required by a participant to cover a flat 10 meter track during this test. Day 1 (Pre-dose) was considered as a Baseline. Analysis was performed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model. Change from Baseline was calculated as post-dose visit value minus the Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Peak Performance From Incremental Shuttle Walking Test</title>
        <description>An incremental shuttle walk test is an externally paced maximal exercise test which determined a participant's peak exercise capacity. The maximum duration of the test is 20 minutes. Peak performance was measured in meters, which was defined as the maximum distance covered by a participant until the participant can no longer continue walking during this test. Baseline was defined as the highest non-missing pre-dose assessment from Day -9 and Day 1. Analysis was performed using ANCOVA model. Change from Baseline was calculated as post-dose visit value minus the Baseline value.</description>

        <description>The CAT is a short and simple participant-completed questionnaire which was developed for use in routine clinical practice to measure the health status of participants with COPD. The CAT is an 8-item questionnaire suitable for completion by all participants diagnosed with COPD. Participants rated their experience on a 6-point scale, ranging from 0 (no impairment) to 5 (maximum impairment). A total CAT score was calculated by summing the non-missing scores of the eight items with a scoring range of 0-40. Higher scores indicated more severe disease impact. Day 1 (Pre-dose) was considered as a Baseline. Change from Baseline was calculated as post-dose visit value minus the Baseline value. Adjusted means and SE are presented.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Participant Reported Outcome (PRO)Active Individual Component: Difficulty Score at Day 56</title>
        <description>The daily PROactive instrument consisted of a PRO questionnaire and an activity monitor to measure participant experience of physical activity. It consisted of 9-item daily assessments covering 2 different domains (amount and difficulty). The 'amount' domain was covered by 2 questions combined with 2 activity monitor outputs. The 'difficulty' domain was covered by 5 questions. Individual domains were scored by simple adding items, gave raw score values 0 to 17 for 'amount' and 0 to 20 for 'difficulty'. The raw scores were then transformed to a 0 to 100 Rasch analysis based scale for each domain. Higher scores indicated worse experience with physical activity.

          <description>The daily PROactive instrument consisted of a PRO questionnaire and an activity monitor to measure participant experience of physical activity. It consisted of 9-item daily assessments covering 2 different domains (amount and difficulty). The 'amount' domain was covered by 2 questions combined with 2 activity monitor outputs. The 'difficulty' domain was covered by 5 questions. Individual domains were scored by simple adding items, gave raw score values 0 to 17 for 'amount' and 0 to 20 for 'difficulty'. The raw scores were then transformed to a 0 to 100 Rasch analysis based scale for each domain. Higher scores indicated worse experience with physical activity. Baseline was the average of the data collected from the 7-day period after dispensing of the device on Day -9. Change from Baseline was calculated as post-dose visit value minus the Baseline value.

          <title>Change From Baseline in Participant Reported Outcome (PRO)Active Individual Component: Amount Score at Day 90</title>
          <description>The daily PROactive instrument consisted of a PRO questionnaire and an activity monitor to measure participant experience of physical activity. It consisted of 9-item daily assessments covering 2 different domains (amount and difficulty). The 'amount' domain was covered by 2 questions combined with 2 activity monitor outputs. The 'difficulty' domain was covered by 5 questions. Individual domains were scored by simple adding items, gave raw score values 0 to 17 for 'amount' and 0 to 20 for 'difficulty'. The raw scores were then transformed to a 0 to 100 Rasch analysis based scale for each domain. Higher scores indicated worse experience with physical activity. Baseline was the average of the data collected from the 7-day period after dispensing of the device on Day -9. Change from Baseline was calculated as post-dose visit value minus the Baseline value. Adjusted means and SE are presented for averaged weekly amount score.</description>

Participants wore an accelerometer for 7 days during individual timepoint. Values at Baseline, Day 56 and Day 90 were the average values collected from an accelerometer for 7 days after the Day -9, Day 56 and Day 90. Baseline was the average of the data collected from the 7-day period after dispensing of the device on Day -9. Change from Baseline was calculated as post-dose visit value minus the Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in St. George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) for COPD (SGRQ-c) Total Score</title>
        <description>SGRQ-c is the COPD specific version of SGRQ. It consisted of 40 items in total, corresponding to 3 individual domains (components): symptoms, activity and impact, with different components carrying a different weighting. Component scores were calculated by summing the weights from all positive items in that component, dividing by the sum of maximum possible weights for all items in that component, and multiplying this number by 100. Total score was calculated by summing the weight to all the positive responses in each component. Total score has the range from 0 to 100. Higher scores indicated more severe disease impact. Day 1 (Pre-dose) was considered as a Baseline. Analysis was performed using ANCOVA model. Change from Baseline was calculated as post-dose visit value minus the Baseline value.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in St. George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) for COPD (SGRQ-c) Total Score</title>
          <description>SGRQ-c is the COPD specific version of SGRQ. It consisted of 40 items in total, corresponding to 3 individual domains (components): symptoms, activity and impact, with different components carrying a different weighting. Component scores were calculated by summing the weights from all positive items in that component, dividing by the sum of maximum possible weights for all items in that component, and multiplying this number by 100. Total score was calculated by summing the weight to all the positive responses in each component. Total score has the range from 0 to 100. Higher scores indicated more severe disease impact. Day 1 (Pre-dose) was considered as a Baseline. Analysis was performed using ANCOVA model. Change from Baseline was calculated as post-dose visit value minus the Baseline value.</description>

Component scores were calculated by summing the weights from all positive items in that component, dividing by the sum of maximum possible weights for all items in that component, and multiplying this number by 100. Impact component consisted of questions 8, 10, 11, 13, 14 in Part 2 of the questionnaire. Impact score has the range from 0 to 100. Higher scores indicated more severe disease impact. Day 1 (Pre-dose) was considered as a Baseline. Analysis was performed using ANCOVA model. Change from Baseline was calculated as post-dose visit value minus the Baseline value.</description>

        <description>FEV1 is a measure of lung function and is defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. FEV1 measurements were collected using a spirometer. Baseline was defined as the latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value, including those from unscheduled visits. Change from Baseline was calculated as post-dose visit value minus the Baseline value.</description>
