  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and anti-retroviral
      activity of MK-4250 monotherapy in anti-retroviral therapy (ART)-naïve, HIV-1 infected
      participants. The primary hypothesis of the study is that at a dose that is sufficiently safe
      and generally well tolerated, MK-4250 has superior antiretroviral activity compared to a
      historical placebo, as measured by change from baseline in plasma HIV-1 ribonucleic acid
      (RNA) (log10 copies/mL) at 168 hours postdose.

      The study consists of 5 panels; Panel C (MK-4250 ≤600 mg) was removed from the study with
      Protocol Amendment 1.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Plasma HIV-1 RNA Copies Per mL at 168 Hours</title>
        <description>Plasma HIV-1 RNA was measured at Baseline and 168 hours after dosing. The log10 plasma HIV-RNA copies/mL measurements from participants in each panel were pooled and analyzed based on a longitudinal data analysis model. The change from Baseline in plasma HIV-1 RNA in participants administered MK-4250 was compared with historical placebo data.</description>

        <population>All participants who complied with the protocol sufficiently to ensure data would likely exhibit the effects of treatment, according to the scientific model. Compliance included treatment exposure, measurement availability, and lack of major protocol deviations. Panel F did not enroll because the objectives were met following completion of Panel E.</population>

          <description>Plasma HIV-1 RNA was measured at Baseline and 168 hours after dosing. The log10 plasma HIV-RNA copies/mL measurements from participants in each panel were pooled and analyzed based on a longitudinal data analysis model.
