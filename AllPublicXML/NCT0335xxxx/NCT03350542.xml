      Coronary Stent System for the treatment of subjects with atherosclerotic lesion(s) &gt; 34 mm
      and ≤ 44 mm in length (by visual estimate) in native coronary arteries ≥2.5 mm to ≤4.0 mm in

          -  Subject is eligible for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and is an acceptable
             candidate for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)

          -  Subject has either:

               -  Symptomatic coronary artery disease with one of the following: stenosis ≥ 70%,
                  abnormal fractional flow reserve (FFR), abnormal stress or imaging stress test,

             Angiographic Inclusion Criteria (visual estimate)

          -  Target lesion must be located in a native coronary artery with a visually estimated
             reference vessel diameter (RVD) ≥2.5 mm and ≤4.0 mm
