  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the persistence of immune response in subjects who
      received the HPV-16/18 vaccine, seven to eight years after the last dose of primary
      vaccination in the HPV-058 study. No new subjects will be enrolled in this extension study.

        <title>Concentration of Antibodies Against HPV-18 at Day 1 in HPV-093 (NCT03355820) and at Year 6 in HPV-039 (NCT00779766) Studies</title>
        <description>Anti-HPV-18 antibody concentrations are presented as Geometric Mean Concentrations (GMCs), expressed in EL.U/mL.
Anti-HPV-18 antibody concentrations at Day 1 in the present study were compared with the anti-HPV-18 antibody concentrations obtained as per the analysis performed on the immunogenicity subset in HPV-039 (NCT00779766) study at Year 6.
Data corresponding to Day 1 time point of the present study can also be found in the primary outcome measure.
Data at Year 6 in subjects from the immunogenicity subset in HPV-039 study can be found in the respective NCT record NCT00779766 (please refer to Outcome measure 40).</description>
        <time_frame>At Day 1 in HPV-093 (NCT03355820) study (i.e. 7 to 8 years after completion of the vaccination schedule in HPV-058 [NCT00996125] study) and at Year 6 in HPV-039 (NCT00779766) study</time_frame>
        <population>The analysis was performed on the PPS for analysis of immunogenicity in HPV-093 study and on the ATP cohort for analysis of immunogenicity which included all evaluable subjects in the immunogenicity subset of HPV-039 study. For Year 6 data in HPV-039 study, please refer to the Outcome measure 40 in NCT00779766 record.</population>
