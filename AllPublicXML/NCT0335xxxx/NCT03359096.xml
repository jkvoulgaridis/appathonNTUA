      A new, well-tolerated treatment for obstructive sleep apnea - tongue stimulation - is a
      device which opens the airway during sleep and can provide treatment for patients unable to
      use the mask and hose treatment. The study will evaluate the effect of this new treatment on
      blood pressure and heart-related measures to see if it lowers patients' risk of heart
      problems.

    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea, repetitive airway blockage during sleep, affects 1 in 10 Americans.
      If left untreated, it results in decreased quality of life and increased risk of heart
      problems. Only half of these people are able to use the main treatment (CPAP) which involves
      wearing a mask and hose at night. A new, well-tolerated treatment - tongue stimulation - is a
      device which opens the airway during sleep and can provide treatment for patients unable to
      use the mask and hose treatment. The study will evaluate the effect of this new treatment on
      blood pressure and heart-related measures to see if it lowers patients' risk of heart
      problems.

    <description>Prior to enrollment in this study, the HGNS will have been implanted as part of clinical care, and a therapeutic voltage setting will have been determined via overnight sleep study The pulse generator, using technology from cardiac pacemakers, utilizes the signal from the pressure sensor for timing of stimulation to the tongue nerve. Patient will undergo activation of the implanted device one month post-operatively. A functional threshold (in volts) is obtained based on tongue motion during device stimulation. For the next month, the patient will have steadily increased stimulation strength by 0.1V every 2-3 nights within the preset range until the upper limit is reached.</description>

        Eligibility Criteria: Similar to criteria put forth by the Federal Drug Administration
        (FDA), HGNS Implantation Inclusion Criteria include:

          -  Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) of 15-65 with &lt;25% central apneas on recent sleep testing.

          -  Not able to use PAP &gt; 4 hours for 5 nights/week -OR- unwilling to use PAP.

          -  22 years of age or older.

          -  As tolerating the therapeutic level during sleep can take time (weeks to months), all
             patients must be able to use the device at the therapeutic setting (&gt; 20 hours/week
             for &gt; 1 month) prior to enrollment, based on compliance data.

          -  All patients will have a pre-operative sleep study (baseline), 2-month in-lab sleep
             study (titration), and if applicable, a post-HGNS sleep study (efficacy) available for
             review.

          -  All patients will be English-speaking and able to give written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria include:

          -  Inspire® remote Model 2500 or later is required. Patients with older remotes are not
             candidates due to limited adherence monitoring capabilities.

          -  Patients who have fallen asleep while driving resulting in accident or &quot;near miss&quot;
             accident within 1 year prior to HGNS implantation.

          -  Pregnant women will be excluded.*

          -  Actively using positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy for treatment of OSA.

          -  Patients in whom the difference between sham and therapeutic voltages is less than 0.5
             V.

          -  * Women of child bearing potential must NOT be pregnant or plan on becoming pregnant.
             This study involves temporarily stopping treatment of obstructive sleep apnea, which
             may harm the fetus. If applicable, the patient will need to take a urine pregnancy
             test after enrollment (prior to washout #1), and again prior to washout #2.
