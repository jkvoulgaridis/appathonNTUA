    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether TAK-831 is superior to placebo in improving
      cerebellar function as measured with the average percentage of conditioned responses during
      the eyeblink conditioning (EBC) test.

      29-Apr-2020 Enrollment of new patients into this study has been paused due to the COVID-19
      situation. The duration of this pause is dependent on the leveling and control of the
      COVID-19 pandemic.

      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-831. TAK-831 is being tested to treat
      people with schizophrenia.

      The study will enroll approximately 32 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned to
      one of the two treatment sequences which will remain undisclosed to the patient and study
      doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need):

        -  TAK-831 500 mg followed by matching placebo

        -  Matching placebo followed by TAK-831 50 mg

      The first 16 participants will receive TAK-831 500 mg during the treatment period in which
      they are assigned to TAK-831. Following an interim analysis, there will be a study-wide
      decision about whether to treat the additional 16 participants with TAK-831 500 mg during the
      active treatment period to or treat them with TAK-831 50 mg during this period. After the
      interim analysis, the participant and study doctor will not be aware of which TAK-831 dose is
      being used.

      This single center trial will be conducted in United States of America. The overall time to
      participate in this study is approximately 81 days. Two treatment periods will be
      administered for 8 consecutive days, separated by a 14 to 21-day washout. Participants will
      be admitted to the clinic for two overnight stays at the beginning of each treatment period
      and one night at the end of each treatment period. After the second treatment period, a final
      follow-up safety assessment visit will be conducted approximately 10 to 14 days after the
      last administration of study drug.

    <measure>Average Percentage of Conditioned Responses During the Eye Blink Conditioning (EBC) Test at Day 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 8: For each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>EBC is a method used to investigate cerebellar function. In EBC, a conditioned stimulus (CS), a tone precedes but co-terminates with an unconditioned stimulus (US), an airpuff to the eyelid. Learning is demonstrated when an eyeblink (the conditioned response [CR]) occurs prior to the onset of the US. The percentage can range from 0% (no conditioned learning has occurred) to 100% (all responses are conditioned).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Mismatch Negativity (MMN) at Day 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 8: For each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>MMN is an event related potential (ERP) evoked in response to unattended changes in background stimulation. MMN reflects an automatic process of detecting a mismatch between a deviant stimulus and a sensory-memory trace. Smaller amplitudes of MMN have been consistently identified in schizophrenia participants. MMN amplitude will be measured at Midline frontal electrode (Fz) of electroencephalogram [EEG].</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean P300 Amplitude at Day 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 8: For each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>The P300 wave is an ERP component that is elicited by the presentation of a novel, behaviorally relevant target stimulus embedded among irrelevant stimuli in a manner similar to MMN, but requiring active listening and responding from participants. Auditory stimuli are presented in an oddball paradigm consisting of 1 standard tone and 1 target tone. Participants are instructed to push a button as quickly as possible when they hear the target tone, but not when they hear the standard tone. P300 reflects allocation of attention and activation of immediate memory. P300 amplitude indexes brain actions when the mental representation of the stimulus environment is updated, while P300 latency indexes stimulus classification speed unrelated to response selection processes. P300 amplitude will be measured at midline parietal electrode (Pz) of EEG.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Auditory Steady State Response (ASSR) to 40 Hz Stimulation at Day 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 8: For each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>ASSR are evoked oscillatory responses that are entrained to the frequency and phase of temporally modulated stimuli. Individuals with schizophrenia experience subjective sensory anomalies and objective deficits on assessment of sensory function. These deficits can be produced by abnormal signaling in the sensory pathways and sensory cortex or by later-stage disturbances in the cognitive processing of such inputs. ASSR can be used to assess the integrity of sensory pathways including cortical processing. ASSR will be measured at midline central electrode (Cz) of EEG.</description>

    <measure>Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS) Cognitive Battery Composite Score at Day 7</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 7: For each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>BACS is specifically designed to measure treatment- related improvements in cognition and includes alternate forms. The battery of tests in the BACS includes brief assessments of reasoning and problem solving, verbal fluency, attention, verbal memory, working memory, and motor speed. The primary measure from each test of the BACS is standardized by creating z-scores whereby the mean of the test session of a healthy participant is set to 0 and the standard deviation set to 1. A composite score was calculated by averaging all of the 6 standardized primary measures from the BACS, and then calculating a z-score of the composite. The composite z-score indicates how much higher or lower the participant's cognition is compared to a healthy person.</description>
