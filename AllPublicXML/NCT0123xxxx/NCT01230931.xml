  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether surgical hemostats can minimize blood loss,
      need for allogeneic blood transfusions and their associated risks, and costs in patients with
      certain acetabular fractures requiring operative fixation via a non-extensile
      Kocher-Langenbeck surgical approach. Since surgical hemostats and other topical agents like
      platelet gel products have also been linked with improved wound healing, incidence of wound
      dehiscence and/or infections will also be examined. The investigators primary hypothesis is
      the topical hemostat will result in lower blood losses intraoperatively and fewer units of
      perioperative blood product transfused.

    <description>Vitagel (by Stryker) is a topical surgical hemostat spray that results in coagulation. The components are as follows: autogenous blood is drawn and centrifuged to produce a sample of platelets and growth factors; this is combined with a bovine thrombin and collagen solution.

Vitagel: Vitagel (by Stryker) is a topical surgical hemostat spray that results in coagulation. The components are as follows: autogenous blood is drawn and centrifuged to produce a sample of platelets and growth factors; this is combined with a bovine thrombin and collagen solution. When the two are applied together, it produces the hemostatic effect.
Standard of care: Standard of care for hemostasis in acetabular surgery includes electrocautery/ligation of bleeding vessels, fracture reduction and stabilization, cell-saver, lap packing.</description>

            <description>This group of patients will receive the vitagel topical surgical hemostat spray intra-operatively, along with all the other standards of care.
Vitagel: Vitagel (by Stryker) is a topical surgical hemostat spray that results in coagulation. The components are as follows: autogenous blood is drawn and centrifuged to produce a sample of platelets and growth factors; this is combined with a bovine thrombin and collagen solution. When the two are applied together, it produces the hemostatic effect.
