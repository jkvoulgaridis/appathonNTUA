      The Phase I part of the study will apply to identify dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) and to
      define maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) for a new chemoimmunotherapy combination of bendamustine,
      ofatumumab, carboplatin, and etoposide in patients with Non Hodgkin's lymphoma whose disease
      has progressed or has recurred after prior chemotherapy.

      The Phase II part of the study will be a single-arm, open-label study in which all patients
      will receive combination bendamustine, ofatumumab, carboplatin and etoposide at the MTD dose
      defined in phase I.

      This study hopes to identify a life-prolonging therapy for patients with Non-Hodgkin's
      Lymphoma whose disease has progressed or has recurred after prior chemotherapy. The
      hypothesis is that the proposed combination of chemotherapy is well-tolerated and is
      efficacious for the treatment of relapsed/refractory aggressive B cell lymphomas.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fifty percent of patients with aggressive B cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas are expected to
      relapse after initial standard chemotherapy. There is no standard salvage regimen for
      patients with relapsed or refractory disease and at least 75% of patients are expected to
      succumb to their condition with the commonly used therapy. The recent CORAL study was
      evaluating the most frequently used rescue regimens R-ICE (rituximab, ifosfamide,
      carboplatin, etoposide) vs. R-DHAP (rituximab, dexamethasone, high-dose cytarabine and
      cisplatin) for relapsed aggressive lymphomas, the overall response (OR) was 83% and 3 year
      event-free survival (EFS) was 47% for &quot;rituximab naïve&quot; patients. In contrast, OR was 51% and
      3 year EFS was only 21% in patients who had relapsed after a rituximab containing regimen.
      There was no significant difference between R-ICE and R-DHAP (in 3-year EFS or overall
      survival). This study confirmed that rituximab containing rescue was less effective in those
      patients who had received prior rituximab. Currently, there is virtually no relapsed B-cell
      lymphoma patients who had not received a rituximab containing induction; therefore, novel
      strategies are needed to overcome rituximab resistance and to improve overall poor outcome in
      the relapsed setting. Ofatumumab is a human IgG1 monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody which binds to
      different CD20 epitopes and is presumed to destroy B cells that are insensitive to rituximab
      due to their low CD20-expression due to its higher binding avidity and higher antibody and
      complement dependent cytotoxicity. It was approved by FDA for the treatment of patients with
      refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL). It is being actively studied in low grade and
      aggressive CD20 positive lymphomas. Bendamustine is an alkylator/purine analogue hybrid
      cytotoxic compound that has demonstrated single agent activity in lymphomas refractory to
      other alkylating agents, such as cyclophosphamide. Weidmann et al (2002) demonstrated single
      agent activity and safety of bendamustine at the dose of 120mg/m2 (day 1, 2) in
      relapse/refractory aggressive lymphomas. This study had an ORR of 44% in 18 patients.
      Non-hematological toxicity was mild (13% grade 3 and 0 grade 4). Bendamustine has shown
      impressive activity and a favorable safety profile when used in combination with rituximab
      and other cytotoxic drugs: Weide R et al (2007) studied bendamustine (90 mg/m2 day 1, 2) in
      combination with rituximab and mitoxantrone in 57 patients' with indolent lymphomas and
      mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). ORR was 92% in follicular and 78% in MCL Vacirca et al presented
      interim safety analysis of bendamustine (120mg/m2, day 1, 2) and rituximab combination in
      aggressive B cell lymphomas at 2010 ASCO meeting (in 76 cycles 1 grade 4 neutropenia and 9
      additional grade 3 events). Thus, bendamustine combinations are effective and can be given
      safely in patients with relapsed lymphomas.

      The investigators propose a novel R-ICE-like salvage combination regimen in which rituximab
      is substituted with ofatumumab and ifosfamide with bendamustine in combination with
      carboplatin and etoposide for refractory or relapsed aggressive B cell lymphomas. The
      investigators hope to avoid the substantial ifosfamide mediated urinary bladder toxicity
      (incidence of grade 3 and 4 hemorrhagic cystitis 8-12%) and neurologic toxicity (10-30%:
      somnolence, confusion, psychosis and seizure) by substituting ifosfamide for bendamustine.
      The proposed regimen is convenient and can be administered on the outpatient basis which
      presents an additional benefit to the patients and to the providers. The investigators
      propose a phase I/II clinical trial and will first determine safety and toxicity of
      escalating dose bendamustine in combination with fixed doses of ofatumumab, carboplatin and
      etoposide. The investigators recognize that the commonly used doses of bendamustine in
      lymphoid malignancies range from 70-120 mg/m2. The investigators will determine
      maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of the combination by using
      dose escalation of bendamustine from 70mg/m2 in a standard 3 by 3 design. The investigators
      will then assess efficacy of the combination regimen in relapsed and refractory aggressive
      B-cell lymphomas.

             recovered from all acute toxicities from any previous therapy.

          4. Radioimmunotherapy (i.e. Zevalin) within 8 weeks of enrollment.

          5. Prior treatment with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody or alemtuzumab within 4 weeks prior
             to start of therapy.

          6. Autologous stem cell rescue within 12 weeks before study enrollment or those who
             underwent allogeneic stem cell transplant within one year of enrolment.

          7. Known leptomeningeal or parenchymal brain involvement with lymphoma unless in complete
             remission after treatment for at least 12 weeks with negative CSF cytology within 2
             weeks. Prophylaxis of CNS disease using intrathecal dosing of cytotoxic regimens is
             permitted and should be performed according to the discretion of the treating
             physician.

          8. History of serious organ dysfunction or disease involving the heart, kidney, liver or
             other organ system that may place the patient at undue risk to undergo treatment.

          9. Systemic fungal, bacterial, viral, or other infection if not controlled. Defined as
             exhibiting ongoing signs/symptoms related to the infection and without improvement,
             despite appropriate antibiotics or other treatment. (May be enrolled if controlled on
             treatment).

         10. Significant concurrent disease, illness, or psychiatric disorder that would compromise
             patient safety or compliance, interfere with consent, study participation, follow up,
             or interpretation of study results.

         11. Subjects who have current active hepatic or biliary disease (with exception of
             patients with Gilbert's syndrome, asymptomatic gallstones, liver metastases or stable
             chronic liver disease per investigator assessment)

         12. History of significant cerebrovascular disease in the past 6 months or ongoing event
             with active symptoms.

         13. Clinically significant cardiac disease including unstable angina, acute myocardial
             infarction within six months prior to randomization, congestive heart failure (NYHA
             III-IV), and arrhythmia unless controlled by therapy, with the exception of
             extrasystoles or minor conduction abnormalities.

         14. Other malignancy, unless the patient has been disease-free for at least 3 years
             following the completion of curative intent therapy, with the following exceptions:
             treated non-melanoma skin cancer, any in situ carcinoma, or cervical intraepithelial
             neoplasia, regardless of the disease-free duration, are eligible for this study if
             definitive treatment for the condition has been completed. Organ-confined prostate
             cancer with no evidence of recurrent or progressive disease based on prostate-specific
             antigen (PSA) values are also eligible for this study if hormonal therapy has been
             initiated, or radical prostatectomy or definitive prostate irradiation has been
             performed.

         15. Positive test for the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), unless undetectable viral
             load within 3 months of enrollment (HIV RNA less than 48 copies/mL) on HAART therapy.

         16. Positive serology for Hepatitis B (HB) defined as a positive test for HBsAg. .
             Patients with prior history of Hepatitis B infection, but immune, with only IgG
             Hepatitis core antibody + (HBcAb +) must be checked for hepatitis B virus titers by
             PCR and if the viral load is undetectable may be enrolled. These patients must receive
             anti-viral prophylaxis, such as lamivudine 100 mg po daily (or an equivalent) starting
             at least one week prior to cycle 1 and continued through the completion of treatment
             and for 9 months after the last dose of ofatumumab. Hepatitis B virus titers by
             quantitative PCR and HBsAg should be checked every month (+/- 1 week) while on therapy
             and every 3 months (+/- 1 month) thereafter for 9 months after the last ofatumumab
             dose. In the event of an early termination of the clinical trial for any reason, a
             treating physician will be determining the frequency and the length of follow up
             studies of hepatitis B virus titers and HBsAg status. It is recommended that the
             patient remains on prophylactic lamivudine or an equivalent, as above, regardless of
             whether the study was continued or terminated. In addition, if appropriate
             consultation with a hepatologist should be obtained.

         17. Positive serology for hepatitis C (HC) defined as a positive test for HCAb if
             confirmed by HC RIBA immunoblot assay (for positive HCAb reflexively perform a HC RIBA
             immunoblot assay on the same sample)

         18. Pregnant or lactating women.

        <title>Phase I: Maximum-Tolerated Dose of Bendamustine in Combination With Ofatumumab, Carboplatin and Etoposide (BOCE)</title>
        <description>To determine the maximum-tolerated dose of bendamustine in combination with ofatumumab, carboplatin and etoposide for patients with refractory or relapsed aggressive B cell lymphomas. Toxicity levels will be assessed after every cycle until a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is found. Toxicities will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria (CTCAE version 4.0). DLT will be defined as any grade 4 infection, or grade &gt;/= 3 non-hematologic toxicity that persists for 7 days or more.</description>

          <title>Phase I: Maximum-Tolerated Dose of Bendamustine in Combination With Ofatumumab, Carboplatin and Etoposide (BOCE)</title>
          <description>To determine the maximum-tolerated dose of bendamustine in combination with ofatumumab, carboplatin and etoposide for patients with refractory or relapsed aggressive B cell lymphomas. Toxicity levels will be assessed after every cycle until a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is found. Toxicities will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria (CTCAE version 4.0). DLT will be defined as any grade 4 infection, or grade &gt;/= 3 non-hematologic toxicity that persists for 7 days or more.</description>
