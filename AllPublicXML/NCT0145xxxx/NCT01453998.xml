  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the immunogenicity, safety and reactogenicity of the
      booster vaccine dose of 2 new formulations of DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib administered between 12 and 15
      months of age, and the immune persistence following the primary series. All children in this
      booster study received a primary vaccination at 2, 3 and 4 months of age in study 113948
      (NCT01248884). No new subjects will be enrolled in this booster study.

            <description>Subjects aged between and including 12 and 15 months at the time of booster vaccination who received the GSK217744 formulation B vaccine in the primary study and a booster dose of either GSK217744 formulation B vaccine (for subjects vaccinated before Protocol Amendment 2) or Infanrix hexa vaccine (for subjects vaccinated after Protocol Amendment 2) in this study, coadministered with a booster dose of Prevenar 13. The Infanrix hexa/GSK217744 and Prevenar 13 vaccines were administered intramuscularly into the right and left sides of the thigh, respectively.</description>

          <title>Concentrations for Anti-PNE Antibodies</title>
          <description>Concentrations were expressed as geometric mean concentrations (GMCs). The seropositivity cut-off of the assay was 0.15 µg /mL. The anti-PNE serotypes assessed were 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F and 23F.</description>
          <population>The analysis was performed on the According-To-Protocol cohort for immunogenicity, which included all evaluable subjects who met all eligibility criteria, who complied the booster protocol and for whom assay results were available for antibodies against at least one study vaccine antigen at the post-booster vaccination blood-sampling time point.</population>
