    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events</measure>

    <description>A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an AE that started after start of investigational medicinal product (IMP) treatment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline up to 52 Weeks including Week24, Week52, and Last Visit(LOCF)</time_frame>
    <description>The PANSS consisted of 3 subscales with 30 symptom constructs (positive subscale (7): delusions, conceptual disorganization, hallucinatory behavior, excitement, grandiosity, suspiciousness/perseckion, and hostility; negative subscale (7): blunted affect, emotional withdrawal, poor rapport, passive/apathetic social withdrawal, difficulty in abstract thinking, lack of spontaneity and conversation flow, stereotyped thinking and general psychopathology subscale (16): somatic concern, anxiety, guilt feelings, tension, mannerisms and posturing, depression, motor retardation, uncooperativeness, unusual thought content, disorientation, poor attention, lack of judgment and insight, disturbance of volition, poor impulse control, preoccupation, and active social avoidance). Severity was rated on 7-point scale with scores 1 (absence) &amp; 7 (extremely severe). The PANSS Total score ranged from 7 (best possible outcome) to 210 (worst possible outcome).</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in PANSS Positive Subscale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline up to 52 Weeks including Week24, Week52, and Last Visit(LOCF)</time_frame>
    <description>The PANSS consisted of three subscales that contained a total of 30 symptom constructs. For each symptom construct, severity is rated on a 7-point scale, with a score of 1 indicated the absence of symptoms and a score of 7 indicated extremely severe symptoms. In PANSS positive subscale, the 7 positive symptom constructs were: delusions, conceptual disorganization, hallucinatory behavior, excitement, grandiosity, suspiciousness/persecution, and hostility. The PANSS positive subscale score ranged from 7 (best possible outcome) to 49 (worst possible outcome).</description>

    <description>The PANSS consisted of three subscales that contained a total of 30 symptom constructs. For each symptom construct, severity was rated on a 7-point scale, with a score of 1 indicated the absence of symptoms and a score of 7 indicated extremely severe symptoms. In PANSS negative subscale the severity was rated for the following 7 negative symptom constructs: blunted affect, emotional withdrawal, poor rapport, passive/apathetic social withdrawal, difficulty in abstract thinking, lack of spontaneity and flow of conversation, stereotyped thinking. The PANSS negative subscale score ranged from 7 (best possible outcome) to 49 (worst possible outcome).</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Clinical Global Impression-Severity of Illness (CGI-S)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline up to 52 Weeks including Week24, Week52, and Last Visit(LOCF)</time_frame>
    <description>Severity of illness for each participant was rated using the CGI-S, which was the secondary efficacy endpoint. To perform this assessment, the study physician answered the following question: &quot;Considering your total clinical experience with this particular population, how mentally ill is the participant at this time?&quot; Response choices included: 0 = not assessed; 1 = normal, not at all ill; 2 = borderline mentally ill; 3 = mildly ill; 4 = moderately ill; 5 = markedly ill; 6 = severely ill; and 7 = among the most extremely ill participants.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Mean Clinical Global Impression - Global Improvement(CGI-I)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline up to 52 Weeks including Week24, Week52, and Last Visit(LOCF)</time_frame>
    <description>The efficacy of trial medication was rated for each participant using the CGI-I. The study physician would rate the participant's total improvement whether or not it is due entirely to drug treatment. All responses were compared to the participant's condition at Baseline prior to the first dose of study medication. Response choices included: 0 = not assessed, 1 = very much improved, 2 = much improved, 3 = minimally improved, 4 = no change, 5 = minimally worse, 6 = much worse, and 7 = very much worse.</description>

        <description>Severity of illness for each participant was rated using the CGI-S, which was the secondary efficacy endpoint. To perform this assessment, the study physician answered the following question: &quot;Considering your total clinical experience with this particular population, how mentally ill is the participant at this time?&quot; Response choices included: 0 = not assessed; 1 = normal, not at all ill; 2 = borderline mentally ill; 3 = mildly ill; 4 = moderately ill; 5 = markedly ill; 6 = severely ill; and 7 = among the most extremely ill participants.</description>

        <population>Efficacy sample（FAS : Full Analysis Set） consisted of all participants who received at least one dose of study medication and have Baseline and at least one Post-Baseline PANSS total score evaluation.</population>
