      Phase 1B: Open label (all patients receive PEGPH20+gemcitabine), dose escalation, safety and
      tolerability study to determine the safe dose of PEGPH20 to use in combination with
      gemcitabine in Stage IV previously untreated pancreatic cancer patients.

      Phase 2: Randomized, double blind study to compare the effect of overall survival of
      gemcitabine plus PEGPH20 vs gemcitabine plus placebo in Stage IV previously untreated
      pancreatic cancer patients.

    <textblock>
      PEGPH20 is a PEGylated version of human recombinant PH20 hyaluronidase that, in preclinical
      studies, has been shown to remove HA from the extracellular matrix surrounding tumor cells by
      depolymerizing this substrate. 87% of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDA) overexpress HA.
      PDA tumor tissue may be especially sensitive to the HA-degradation properties of PEGPH20 and
      thus more responsive to the cytotoxic effects of a given dose of gemcitabine. Modifying the
      extracellular environment to increase the penetration and efficacy of anti-cancer agents
      represents a novel approach to treating pancreatic cancer and may provide important
      therapeutic outcomes in patients with Stage IV Previously Untreated Pancreatic Cancer.

      This Phase 1B/2 study will assess safety, tolerability, treatment effect, and various PK/PD
      endpoints.

    <time_frame>first 4 weeks of Cycle 1</time_frame>
    <description>The safety and tolerability profile of PEGPH20 used in combination with gemcitabine was assessed by measuring the number of participants with a DLT during the dose-escalation phase of the study. A DLT was defined as any treatment-emergent National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event (CTCAE), Version 4.0, Grade 3 or greater event occurring within the first 4 weeks of treatment that was considered related to PEGPH20. Any PEGPH20 treatment-related AE that resulted in a drug interruption or reduction might have been considered a DLT at the Investigator's or Sponsor's discretion. Hypersensitivity/infusion reactions related to PEGPH20 dosing were not considered DLTs.</description>

    <description>The safety and tolerability profile of PEGPH20 used in combination with gemcitabine was assessed by determining the RP2D, the highest dose level at which no more than 1 of 6 evaluable participants experienced a DLT in the first 4 weeks of treatment (considered a safe dose). The RP2D was determined based on review of safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) data from participants enrolled during the dose-escalation phase of the study.</description>

    <measure>H-scores, as an Assessment of HA Staining Changes in Tumor Biopsies</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening; Cycle 1 Week 7</time_frame>
    <description>An H-score approach methodology was developed and used to analyze staining in the tumor pericellular regions and the stroma separately. The H-score calculation was the sum of the products of the percentage of positive staining areas and the staining intensity (0, 1, 2 or 3), and ranged from 0 to 300. For example: [90% * 1 (weak)] + [10% * 2 (moderate)] + [0% * 3 (strong)] = 110. A score of 0 represents the absence of expression, and an H-score of 300 represents maximum expression. A larger decrease in H-score correlated with a greater target engagement of PEGPH20. As HA is a secreted protein, the scoring was performed in the immediate areas surrounding tumor (pericellular areas) as well as in stroma.</description>

    <measure>Mean Volume Transfer Constant (Ktrans) for Scans Across Tissue Sites</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; 24 hours hours; end of Cycle 1 (Week 7)</time_frame>
    <description>Dynamic control enhanced-magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) provides a measure of the exchange of small-molecule contrast agents between the intracellular and extracellular spaces. Using a 2-compartment pharmacokinetic model, an estimate of tissue (tumor) perfusion can be obtained by determining the exchange rate constant (Ktrans) of contrast exchange. Ktrans is defined as the volume transfer constant between extravascular/extracellular space to plasma space and is a measure of blood flow, vascular permeability, or both. Mean Ktrans values across scan sites are reported per participant. DCE-MRI was performed before the first dosing visit (Week 1/Day 1), 24 hours after the first dose of PEGPH20 in Cycle 1, and 24 hours after the last dose of PEGPH20 in Cycle 1 (Week 7). Assessment was done for the entire cohort of participants, not per treatment group.</description>

      <pre_assignment_details>This study was to consist of a Phase 1b and a randomized Phase 2 study. However, the randomized Phase 2 study was not conducted due to a change to the standard-of-care chemotherapy treatment to be used in combination with PEGylated Recombinant Human Hyaluronidase PH20 (PEGPH20).</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Participants received PEGylated Recombinant Human Hyaluronidase PH20 (PEGPH20) 1.0 micrograms per kilogram (μg/kg). PEGPH20 was administered twice weekly for 4 consecutive weeks and then once weekly for the next 3 weeks during Cycle 1. For each cycle thereafter, PEGPH20 was administered once weekly for 3 consecutive weeks. Participants received gemcitabine 1000 milligrams per meters squared (mg/m^2) administered via intravenous (IV) infusion. Before the Recommend Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) was established, gemcitabine was administered 2 hours after the second dose of PEGPH20 during Weeks 1 to 4 of Cycle 1 and on the same day as PEGPH20 during each week thereafter. After the RP2D was established, gemcitabine was administered within 24 hours after the first dose of PEGPH20 during Weeks 1 to 4 of Cycle 1 and 2 to 24 hours after each PEGPH20 dose thereafter. Dexamethasone was administered approximately 1 hour prior to and 8 to 12 hours after PEGPH20 dosing.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With a Dose-limiting Toxicity (DLT)</title>
        <description>The safety and tolerability profile of PEGPH20 used in combination with gemcitabine was assessed by measuring the number of participants with a DLT during the dose-escalation phase of the study. A DLT was defined as any treatment-emergent National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event (CTCAE), Version 4.0, Grade 3 or greater event occurring within the first 4 weeks of treatment that was considered related to PEGPH20. Any PEGPH20 treatment-related AE that resulted in a drug interruption or reduction might have been considered a DLT at the Investigator's or Sponsor's discretion. Hypersensitivity/infusion reactions related to PEGPH20 dosing were not considered DLTs.</description>

For each cycle thereafter, PEGPH20 was administered once weekly for 3 consecutive weeks. Participants received gemcitabine 1000 milligrams per meters squared (mg/m^2) administered via intravenous (IV) infusion. Before the Recommend Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) was established, gemcitabine was administered 2 hours after the second dose of PEGPH20 during Weeks 1 to 4 of Cycle 1 and on the same day as PEGPH20 during each week thereafter. After the RP2D was established, gemcitabine was administered within 24 hours after the first dose of PEGPH20 during Weeks 1 to 4 of Cycle 1 and 2 to 24 hours after each PEGPH20 dose thereafter. Dexamethasone was administered approximately 1 hour prior to and 8 to 12 hours after PEGPH20 dosing.</description>

For each cycle thereafter, PEGPH20 was administered once weekly for 3 consecutive weeks. Participants received gemcitabine 1000 milligrams per meters squared (mg/m^2) administered via intravenous (IV) infusion. Before the Recommend Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) was established, gemcitabine was administered 2 hours after the second dose of PEGPH20 during Weeks 1 to 4 of Cycle 1 and on the same day as PEGPH20 during each week thereafter. After the RP2D was established, gemcitabine was administered within 24 hours after the first dose of PEGPH20 during Weeks 1 to 4 of Cycle 1 and 2 to 24 hours after each PEGPH20 dose thereafter. Dexamethasone was administered approximately 1 hour prior to and 8 to 12 hours after PEGPH20 dosing.</description>

        <title>Plasma Hyaluronan (HA) Concentration at Baseline and After PEGPH20 Administration</title>
        <description>The pharmacodynamic activity of PEGPH20 was evaluated by measuring plasma concentrations of HA after PEGPH20 dosing. Peak HA concentrations are the highest concentrations measured after a single dose of PEGPH20. HA samples were collected in Cycle 1 at the following time points: 1) Week 1/Day 1 (first visit) and Week 4 (first visit): predose and 15 minutes, 1, 2, 4, and 24 hours post-PEGPH20 dosing (24-hour sample optional for Week 4); 2) all other visits in Cycle 1: pre-PEGPH20 dose, 1 to 2 hours post-PEGPH20 dose, and immediately after the dose of gemcitabine (on the days gemcitabine was given). HA samples were collected in Cycles 2+ at the following time points: Week 3 of each cycle pre-PEGPH20 dose and 1 to 2 hours post-PEGPH20 dose.</description>

        <title>H-scores, as an Assessment of HA Staining Changes in Tumor Biopsies</title>
        <description>An H-score approach methodology was developed and used to analyze staining in the tumor pericellular regions and the stroma separately. The H-score calculation was the sum of the products of the percentage of positive staining areas and the staining intensity (0, 1, 2 or 3), and ranged from 0 to 300. For example: [90% * 1 (weak)] + [10% * 2 (moderate)] + [0% * 3 (strong)] = 110. A score of 0 represents the absence of expression, and an H-score of 300 represents maximum expression. A larger decrease in H-score correlated with a greater target engagement of PEGPH20. As HA is a secreted protein, the scoring was performed in the immediate areas surrounding tumor (pericellular areas) as well as in stroma.</description>

        <title>Mean Volume Transfer Constant (Ktrans) for Scans Across Tissue Sites</title>
        <description>Dynamic control enhanced-magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) provides a measure of the exchange of small-molecule contrast agents between the intracellular and extracellular spaces. Using a 2-compartment pharmacokinetic model, an estimate of tissue (tumor) perfusion can be obtained by determining the exchange rate constant (Ktrans) of contrast exchange. Ktrans is defined as the volume transfer constant between extravascular/extracellular space to plasma space and is a measure of blood flow, vascular permeability, or both. Mean Ktrans values across scan sites are reported per participant. DCE-MRI was performed before the first dosing visit (Week 1/Day 1), 24 hours after the first dose of PEGPH20 in Cycle 1, and 24 hours after the last dose of PEGPH20 in Cycle 1 (Week 7). Assessment was done for the entire cohort of participants, not per treatment group.</description>

Per RECIST, Version 1.1, for the evaluation of target lesions, progressive disease is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 millimeters. Note: the appearance of 1 or more new lesions is also considered progression. For the evaluation of nontarget lesions, progressive disease is defined as the unequivocal progression of existing nontarget lesions.

PEGPH20 was administered twice weekly for 4 consecutive weeks and then once weekly for the next 3 weeks during Cycle 1. For each cycle thereafter, PEGPH20 was administered once weekly for 3 consecutive weeks. Participants received gemcitabine 1000 milligrams per meters squared (mg/m^2) administered via intravenous (IV) infusion. Before the Recommend Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) was established, gemcitabine was administered 2 hours after the second dose of PEGPH20 during Weeks 1 to 4 of Cycle 1 and on the same day as PEGPH20 during each week thereafter. After the RP2D was established, gemcitabine was administered within 24 hours after the first dose of PEGPH20 during Weeks 1 to 4 of Cycle 1 and 2 to 24 hours after each PEGPH20 dose thereafter.

            <description>Participants received PEGylated Recombinant Human Hyaluronidase PH20 (PEGPH20) 1.0 micrograms per kilogram (μg/kg). PEGPH20 was administered twice weekly for 4 consecutive weeks and then once weekly for the next 3 weeks during Cycle 1. For each cycle thereafter, PEGPH20 was administered once weekly for 3 consecutive weeks. Participants received gemcitabine 1000 milligrams per meters squared (mg/m^2) administered via intravenous (IV) infusion. Before the Recommend Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) was established, gemcitabine was administered 2 hours after the second dose of PEGPH20 during Weeks 1 to 4 of Cycle 1 and on the same day as PEGPH20 during each week thereafter. After the RP2D was established, gemcitabine was administered within 24 hours after the first dose of PEGPH20 during Weeks 1 to 4 of Cycle 1 and 2 to 24 hours after each PEGPH20 dose thereafter. Dexamethasone was administered approximately 1 hour prior to and 8 to 12 hours after PEGPH20 dosing.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in CA19-9 in Participants Classified as Responders and Non-responders</title>
        <description>CA19-9 is a tumor marker. Blood samples (plasma) were collected for CA19-9 evaluations. Responders are defined as participants who had a complete response or partial response, and non-responders are defined as participants who had stable disease, progressive disease, or an unknown tumor response, per RECIST, Version 1.1.</description>

        <population>Intent-to-Treat Population. Only those participants with available data were analyzed. This study was to consist of a Phase 1b and a randomized Phase 2 study. However, the randomized Phase 2 study was not conducted due to a change to the standard-of-care chemotherapy treatment to be used in combination with PEGPH20.</population>

            <title>Responders</title>
            <description>Participants received PEGylated Recombinant Human Hyaluronidase PH20 (PEGPH20) 1.0, 1.6, or 3.0 micrograms per kilogram (μg/kg). PEGPH20 was administered twice weekly for 4 consecutive weeks and then once weekly for the next 3 weeks during Cycle 1. For each cycle thereafter, PEGPH20 was administered once weekly for 3 consecutive weeks. Participants received gemcitabine 1000 milligrams per meters squared (mg/m^2) administered via intravenous (IV) infusion. Before the Recommend Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) was established, gemcitabine was administered 2 hours after the second dose of PEGPH20 during Weeks 1 to 4 of Cycle 1 and on the same day as PEGPH20 during each week thereafter. After the RP2D was established, gemcitabine was administered within 24 hours after the first dose of PEGPH20 during Weeks 1 to 4 of Cycle 1 and 2 to 24 hours after each PEGPH20 dose thereafter. Dexamethasone was administered approximately 1 hour prior to and 8 to 12 hours after PEGPH20 dosing.</description>

      <desc>This study was to consist of a Phase 1b and a randomized Phase 2 study. However, the randomized Phase 2 study was not conducted due to a change to the standard-of-care chemotherapy treatment to be used in combination with PEGPH20.</desc>

          <description>Participants received PEGylated Recombinant Human Hyaluronidase PH20 (PEGPH20) 1.0 micrograms per kilogram (μg/kg). PEGPH20 was administered twice weekly for 4 consecutive weeks and then once weekly for the next 3 weeks during Cycle 1. For each cycle thereafter, PEGPH20 was administered once weekly for 3 consecutive weeks. Participants received gemcitabine 1000 milligrams per meters squared (mg/m^2) administered via intravenous (IV) infusion. Before the Recommend Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) was established, gemcitabine was administered 2 hours after the second dose of PEGPH20 during Weeks 1 to 4 of Cycle 1 and on the same day as PEGPH20 during each week thereafter. After the RP2D was established, gemcitabine was administered within 24 hours after the first dose of PEGPH20 during Weeks 1 to 4 of Cycle 1 and 2 to 24 hours after each PEGPH20 dose thereafter. Dexamethasone was administered approximately 1 hour prior to and 8 to 12 hours after PEGPH20 dosing.</description>
