  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about two different types of psychotherapy to help
      individuals who have body dysmorphic disorder (BDD). BDD is a severe, often chronic, and
      common disorder consisting of distressing or impairing preoccupation with perceived defects
      in one's physical appearance. Individuals with BDD have very poor psychosocial functioning
      and high rates of hospitalization and suicidality. Because BDD differs in important ways from
      other disorders, psychotherapies for other disorders are not adequate for BDD. Despite BDD's
      severity, there is no adequately tested psychosocial treatment (psychotherapy) of any type
      for this disorder. This study will compare the effectiveness of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
      and Supportive Psychotherapy as well as predictors of improvement.

      Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD) is a common and severe disorder in which a person is
      preoccupied by perceived defects in his or her appearance. The purpose of this research study
      is to learn more about two different forms of therapy to help individuals with BDD: cognitive
      behavioral therapy (CBT), a promising new treatment for BDD, and supportive psychotherapy
      (SPT), the most commonly received therapy for BDD. The investigators would like to find out
      which treatment is more effective for BDD. The investigators will also examine patient
      characteristics that may predict response to treatment.

      Participants will be randomly assigned (like the flip of a coin) to receive 22 sessions (over
      24 weeks) of either CBT or SPT. Both treatments teach participants about BDD. CBT focuses on
      helping participants to develop more adaptive thoughts and beliefs and to gradually reduce
      avoidance and compulsive (repetitive) behaviors. SPT focuses on relationships, feelings, and
      other factors that may affect BDD symptoms (e.g., work, stress), and helps participants to
      cope with challenges in their life by improving self-esteem and positive coping.

      For each participant, this study will last for 12 months. CBT and SPT sessions occur for 22
      sessions over 24 weeks. The severity of participants' BDD-related symptoms and other symptoms
      will be assessed at the end of treatment (week 24), and at 3- and 6-months after treatment
      ends.

    <measure>Body Dysmorphic Disorder Symptoms (as Measured by the BDD-YBOCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in BDD-YBOCS from baseline (week 0) to post-treatment (week 24), assessed every 4 weeks. Followup phase data was measured at week 37 and week 50.</time_frame>
    <description>The Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale Modified for BDD (BDD-YBOCS) is a 12-item, semi-structured, clinician-administered measure of BDD symptom severity. The scale's items are summed to yield a total score with a range from 0 to 48, with higher scores indicating more severe BDD symptoms. Treatment effects on BDD symptom severity were analyzed separately for the treatment period (i.e., weeks 0-24) and the follow-up period (i.e., weeks 24 to 50).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Insight Regarding BDD Beliefs (as Measured by the BABS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured every 4 weeks during treatment, and at the 3-(wk 37) and 6-month(wk 50) follow-up visits</time_frame>
    <description>The Brown Assessment of Beliefs Scale (BABS) is a 7-item, semi-structured, clinician-administered measure that was used to assess insight regarding BDD-related beliefs (e.g., &quot;I look deformed&quot;). The first six items of the BABS were summed to obtain a total score ranging from 0 to 24, with higher scores reflecting poorer insight. Treatment effects on BABS score were analyzed separately for the treatment period (i.e., weeks 0-24) and the follow-up period (i.e., weeks 24 to 50).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Depressive Symptoms (as Measured by the BDI-II)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured every week during treatment, but analysis was performed only on BDI-II assessments close to assessment visits; wk 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24. Followup phase data was measured at week 37 and week 50.</time_frame>
    <description>The Beck Depression Inventoryâ€”Second Edition (BDI-II) is a widely used 21-item self-report scale that assesses the severity of depressive symptoms during the past 2 weeks. Total scale scores range from 0 to 63, with higher scores indicating greater symptom severity. Treatment effects on depression were analyzed separately for the treatment period (i.e., weeks 0-24) and the follow-up period (i.e., weeks 24 to 50).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Life Satisfaction (Q-LESQ-SF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at week 0, 4, 12, 16, and 24 during treatment. Follow-up phase data was measured at week 37 and at week 50.</time_frame>
    <description>The Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire-Short Form (Q-LESQ-SF) is a 16-item, self-report questionnaire that assesses life satisfaction over the past week. Questions 1-14 are then summed to a total score, and the total score is reported as a percentage maximum possible, such that the % score range is 0% to 100%, with higher scores indicating greater quality of life. Treatment effects on life satisfaction were analyzed separately for the treatment period (i.e., weeks 0-24) and the follow-up period (i.e., weeks 24 to 50).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment Credibility (Credibility/Expectancy Rating Scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured twice during the study (week 0 [pre-treatment] and at week 4)</time_frame>
    <description>The Treatment Credibility/Expectancy Rating scale is a 4-item self-report questionnaire that assesses patients' judgments about the credibility of the treatment rationale, expectancy of change, and treatment acceptability. Treatment credibility is based on the mean score of the first three items, which are measured on 10-point Likert scales, so that mean scores range from 1 (lowest/worst) to 10 (highest/most). Treatment credibility was assessed at the baseline assessment (before treatment assignment) and after 1 month of treatment when patients are more familiar with the treatment protocol and rationale.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at baseline, week 4, week 12, week 16, and week 24. Follow-up phase data was measured at week 37 and at week 50.</time_frame>
    <description>The Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) is a 5-item self-report measure of functional impairment/disability. Items 1-3 (disability in work, social life/leisure, and family life/home responsibilities, respectively) are scored on Likert-scales that range from 0 (not at all) to 10 (extreme). The three items are then summed to yield an SDS total score, ranging from 0 (unimpaired) to 30 (highly impaired). Treatment effects on functional impairment were analyzed separately for the treatment period (i.e., weeks 0-24) and the follow-up period (i.e., weeks 24 to 50).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment Satisfaction (CSQ-8)</measure>
    <time_frame>The CSQ-8 was assessed twice: at week 12 [mid-treatment] and at week 24 [post-treatment]</time_frame>
    <description>The Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8) is an 8-item self-report questionnaire that assesses satisfaction with clinical services received and has a score range of 8-32, where higher scores indicate higher satisfaction.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment Expectancy (Credibility/Expectancy Rating Scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured twice during the study (week 0 [pre-treatment] and at week 4)</time_frame>
    <description>The Treatment Credibility/Expectancy Rating scale is a 4-item self-report questionnaire that assesses patients' judgments about the credibility of the treatment rationale, expectancy of change, and treatment acceptability. Treatment expectancy is a single item rating of &quot;By the end of therapy, how much improvement in your anxiety do you think will occur?&quot;, rated on a scale from 0% to 100%. It was assessed at the baseline assessment (before treatment assignment) and after 1 month of treatment when patients are more familiar with the treatment protocol and rationale.</description>

        <description>The Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale Modified for BDD (BDD-YBOCS) is a 12-item, semi-structured, clinician-administered measure of BDD symptom severity. The scale's items are summed to yield a total score with a range from 0 to 48, with higher scores indicating more severe BDD symptoms. Treatment effects on BDD symptom severity were analyzed separately for the treatment period (i.e., weeks 0-24) and the follow-up period (i.e., weeks 24 to 50).</description>

        <title>Insight Regarding BDD Beliefs (as Measured by the BABS)</title>
        <description>The Brown Assessment of Beliefs Scale (BABS) is a 7-item, semi-structured, clinician-administered measure that was used to assess insight regarding BDD-related beliefs (e.g., &quot;I look deformed&quot;). The first six items of the BABS were summed to obtain a total score ranging from 0 to 24, with higher scores reflecting poorer insight. Treatment effects on BABS score were analyzed separately for the treatment period (i.e., weeks 0-24) and the follow-up period (i.e., weeks 24 to 50).</description>

        <title>Depressive Symptoms (as Measured by the BDI-II)</title>
        <description>The Beck Depression Inventoryâ€”Second Edition (BDI-II) is a widely used 21-item self-report scale that assesses the severity of depressive symptoms during the past 2 weeks. Total scale scores range from 0 to 63, with higher scores indicating greater symptom severity. Treatment effects on depression were analyzed separately for the treatment period (i.e., weeks 0-24) and the follow-up period (i.e., weeks 24 to 50).</description>
        <time_frame>Measured every week during treatment, but analysis was performed only on BDI-II assessments close to assessment visits; wk 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24. Followup phase data was measured at week 37 and week 50.</time_frame>

        <description>The Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire-Short Form (Q-LESQ-SF) is a 16-item, self-report questionnaire that assesses life satisfaction over the past week. Questions 1-14 are then summed to a total score, and the total score is reported as a percentage maximum possible, such that the % score range is 0% to 100%, with higher scores indicating greater quality of life. Treatment effects on life satisfaction were analyzed separately for the treatment period (i.e., weeks 0-24) and the follow-up period (i.e., weeks 24 to 50).</description>
        <time_frame>Measured at week 0, 4, 12, 16, and 24 during treatment. Follow-up phase data was measured at week 37 and at week 50.</time_frame>
        <population>Intent to treat analysis on 120 subjects randomized to either CBT vs SPT. Some of the assessments visits were missed due to patient cancellations or study dropouts. The exact numbers analyzed are as specified below.</population>

        <description>The Treatment Credibility/Expectancy Rating scale is a 4-item self-report questionnaire that assesses patients' judgments about the credibility of the treatment rationale, expectancy of change, and treatment acceptability. Treatment credibility is based on the mean score of the first three items, which are measured on 10-point Likert scales, so that mean scores range from 1 (lowest/worst) to 10 (highest/most). Treatment credibility was assessed at the baseline assessment (before treatment assignment) and after 1 month of treatment when patients are more familiar with the treatment protocol and rationale.</description>

        <description>The Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) is a 5-item self-report measure of functional impairment/disability. Items 1-3 (disability in work, social life/leisure, and family life/home responsibilities, respectively) are scored on Likert-scales that range from 0 (not at all) to 10 (extreme). The three items are then summed to yield an SDS total score, ranging from 0 (unimpaired) to 30 (highly impaired). Treatment effects on functional impairment were analyzed separately for the treatment period (i.e., weeks 0-24) and the follow-up period (i.e., weeks 24 to 50).</description>

        <description>The Treatment Credibility/Expectancy Rating scale is a 4-item self-report questionnaire that assesses patients' judgments about the credibility of the treatment rationale, expectancy of change, and treatment acceptability. Treatment expectancy is a single item rating of &quot;By the end of therapy, how much improvement in your anxiety do you think will occur?&quot;, rated on a scale from 0% to 100%. It was assessed at the baseline assessment (before treatment assignment) and after 1 month of treatment when patients are more familiar with the treatment protocol and rationale.</description>

At these assessments, participants were probed for adverse events that occurred since the last adverse event assessment (usually 4 weeks prior).</time_frame>
      <desc>Participants were asked 4 questions about: (1) any major physical health problems or major physical injuries; (2) seeing a physical health or mental health provider for any reason; (3) any hospitalizations; or (4) any other major problems or concerns, all pertaining to the time since they were assessed last. Any &quot;yes&quot; resulted in a full event report. All serious adverse events are reported. Of non-serious events, only those affecting &gt;5% in either treatment group are reported.</desc>
