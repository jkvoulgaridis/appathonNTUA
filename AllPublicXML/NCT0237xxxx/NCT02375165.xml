  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acquired lymphedema is a disease that causes chronic swelling of the limb(s). It is
      frequently under-recognized or misdiagnosed. This study is designed to lead to the
      development of an accurate, noninvasive, blood test to allow testing for lymphedema. This
      approach is particularly useful to investigate relative responses to treatment interventions.

    <textblock>
      The validation of a sensitive and specific biomarker assay for human acquired lymphatic
      vascular insufficiency would represent a highly significant development for the patient
      community. Accurate bioassay for the presence of lymphatic vascular insufficiency should help
      to pave the road for future human clinical trials of experimental drugs and therapies
      designed to treat human lymphatic diseases. Molecular profiling will be performed in human
      tissues (skin) obtained by biopsy. The insights gained from these initial analyses will
      determine the targets for assay in human body fluids (blood). A subset analysis will be
      performed to assess the molecular profile of responses to ketoprofen, which has been
      identified to have a therapeutic benefit in lymphedema.

    <intervention_name>Measurement of skin thickness by caliper</intervention_name>
    <description>For each subject, at each assessment, 3 measurements will be obtained: the dorsum of the hand (or foot); the midpoint of the volar aspect of the forearm (or medial aspect of the calf); and the midpoint of the medial aspect of the upper arm (or thigh). At the initial evaluation, a dermatographic pencil is used to mark the site of each measurement. Once the locations were determined, the exact distance of each location is measured from the wrist or lateral malleolus. These locations are then reutilized when serial measurements are obtained. The calipers are calibrated prior to each use.</description>

    <intervention_name>Limb volume quantitation by circumferential measurements</intervention_name>
    <description>Limb volume will be measured through serial quantitation of the limb circumference at 4-cm intervals along its long axis. The procedure is performed with gauged tape to ensure a uniform stretching force.
Using these measurements, the volume of the limb is calculated with the truncated cone approximation.</description>
