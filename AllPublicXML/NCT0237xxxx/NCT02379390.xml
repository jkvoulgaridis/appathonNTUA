      Primary Objective:

      To demonstrate the superiority in term of radiographic Progression-Free Survival (rPFS) of
      cabazitaxel at at 25 milligram per meter square (mg/m^2) plus prednisone (Arm A) versus
      either enzalutamide at 160 milligram (mg) once daily or abiraterone acetate at 1000 mg once
      daily plus prednisone (Arm B) in chemotherapy-naïve participants with metastatic
      Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC) who have disease progression while receiving
      androgen receptor (AR) targeted therapy (abiraterone plus prednisone or enzalutamide) within
      12 months of treatment initiation (≤12 months).

      Secondary Objective:

        -  To compare efficacy for:

        -  Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rate and Time to PSA progression (TTPP).

        -  Progression Free Survival (PFS).

        -  Overall Survival (OS).

        -  Tumor response rate in participants with measurable disease (RECIST 1.1)

        -  Pain response and time to pain progression.

        -  Symptomatic skeletal events (SSE) rate and time to occurrence of any SSE.

        -  To analyze messenger ribonucleic acids (mRNAs) including androgen-receptor splice
           variant 7 messenger RNA (AR-V7) as a biomarker in Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs).

        -  To evaluate safety in the 2 treatment arms.

      The duration of the study per participant was approximately 2 years. Each participant was
      treated until radiographic disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or participants
      refusal of further study treatment, and each participant was followed after completion of
      study treatment until death, study cutoff date, or withdrawal of participant consent.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Study conducted at 6 active centers in United States and Canada. A total of 8 participants were enrolled between 17 June 2015 to 13 Mar 2016. Total 15 participants were screened, out of which 7 were screen failures and 8 were randomized and treated in the study. Study was terminated early due to very low recruitment rate in both countries involved.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants were randomized to receive either chemotherapy (cabazitaxel) or antiandrogen receptor targeted therapy (abiraterone or enzalutamide were assigned based on previous Androgen receptor [AR] targeted treatment in which participants previously treated with abiraterone were treated with enzalutamide and vice versa due to resistance).</pre_assignment_details>
