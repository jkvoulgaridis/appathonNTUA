    <textblock>
      Patients with type 2 diabetes are increasingly complex. Lack of time to address all patient
      and provider priorities during primary care visits represents a barrier to effective primary
      care. The investigators propose to design, implement, and evaluate in a randomized clinical
      trial a web-based tool linked to the electronic health record (EHR) that will enable complex
      patients to easily define care priorities for their upcoming visit.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with type 2 diabetes are increasingly living with multiple concurrent conditions and
      complicated medical regimens. For these patients, diabetes management decisions and treatment
      goals must be addressed within the larger context of other competing health concerns. In
      parallel, clinical advances have led to a substantial increase in the number of tasks that
      primary care providers must perform during each visit. These twin trends present a formidable
      challenge to effective diabetes primary care. We hypothesize that among complex patients not
      meeting diabetes management goals, a web-based health IT tool to help patients explicitly
      prioritize all health issues (both related and unrelated to diabetes) and then submit these
      priorities directly into the electronic health record (EHR) for a scheduled visit with their
      primary care provider will result in more effective diabetes management over time. To test
      this hypothesis, we propose to design, implement, and evaluate in a randomized clinical trial
      a web-based tool linked to the EHR that will enable complex patients to easily define care
      priorities for their upcoming visit.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Primary care physicians (PCPs) at Kaiser Permanente Northern California with potentially
        eligible patients (type 2 diabetes and HbA1c &gt; 8.0%) wil be recruited and consented to
        participate in this study. PCPs will review lists of potentially eligible patients of
        theirs (defined below). Patients approved by PCP's allocated to the intervention arm will
        be sent a secure message on the PCPs behalf asking them to review the Pre-Visit
        Prioritization Questionnaire to identify top priorities for discussion at the next
        scheduled visit.

        Patient Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Current adult member (&gt; 21 years old)

          -  Diagnosis of type 2 diabetes with most recent HbA1c &gt; 8.0%

          -  English as primary language

          -  Registered on kp.org.

        Patient Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Excluded by PCP, and/or: terminal illness, in hospice care or reside in a long-term
             care facility, severe mental illness (e.g. schizophrenia or personality disorder),
             currently or recently pregnant, and/or significant dementia
