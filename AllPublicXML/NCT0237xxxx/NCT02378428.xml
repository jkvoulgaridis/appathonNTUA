    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II study for patients with MIBG avid tumors. The study is to determine the
      response rate to &lt;131&gt;I-MIBG in patients with de novo, relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma
      or other MIBG avid malignant tumors 42 days post MIBG therapy. It will also be evaluating the
      tolerability and safety of the study agent by evaluating the hematopoietic and
      non-hematopoietic toxicity of &lt;131&gt;I-MIBG therapy. Tumor response will be evaluated by
      comparing the patient's disease pre-treatment against the patient's day +42 post &lt;131&gt;I-MIBG
      treatment. The evaluations may include the following: &lt;131&gt;I-MIBG scan, CT or MRI, urine
      catecholamine, bone marrow analyses and any other tests considered standard of care for
      cancer evaluation. To be eligible for participation, patients must have tumors that are MIBG
      avid. Patients must also have a stem cell source for autologous rescue in the event of
      protracted therapy associated cytopenias. Peripheral stem cell collections are preferred as
      the hematopoietic cell source. Bone marrow harvests for a hematopoietic cell source is an
      alternative. This study will provide data for future clinical trials utilizing &lt;131&gt;I-MIBG
      therapies. A room on H12 has been prepared with lead lined walls, and many radiation safety
      components to accomodate this treatment. &lt;131&gt;I metaiodobenzlguanidine (&lt;131&gt;I-MIBG) is a
      radiopharmaceutical that concentrates within adrenomedullary tissue. The agent was initially
      used for tumor imaging due to its capability to locate pheochromocytomas, neuroblastomas and
      other neuroendocrine tumors. &lt;131&gt;I-MIBG was subsequently used as an therapeutic agent for
      these tumor types. Phase I and II therapeutic trials targeting neuroblastoma have reported
      response rates of 10-50%. Toxicities observed have been mainly hematopoietic, with ~50% of
      patients receiving 15mCi/kg requiring stem cell reinfusion. Observed non-hematopoietic
      toxicities have been mild. Most recently, trials have been conducted combining the study
      agent with myeloablative chemotherapy and stem cell reinfusion have been performed with
      initial response rates of ~50%.
