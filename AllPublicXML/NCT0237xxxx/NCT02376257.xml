  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite advances in both pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy for major depression, non-response
      and partial-response remain relatively common outcomes, motivating the search for new
      treatments. This study is concerned with the development of one such novel treatment, the
      augmentation of exposure-based cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) with d-cycloserine (DCS).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will study the efficacy of DCS for augmenting therapeutic learning relevant for
      the treatment of depression (i.e., outside the extinction learning where DCS has been shown
      to have success). Specifically, the study investigates the role of DCS in enhancing
      declarative memory in depressed individuals, as evaluated by standardized tests and the
      retention of cognitive therapy session material. Investigators will also study an active
      comparison agent, modafinil, which appears to offer cognitive enhancing effects among both
      sleep-deprived and non-sleep-deprived individuals, but also appears to have drug-state (e.g.,
      mood and side) effects that are not characteristic of DCS augmentation. Therefore,
      drug-context effects may affect memory retention over time. Hence, the study will evaluate
      memory enhancement effects both during the period of drug action as well as one week later
      when no drug is taken. Overall, investigators will examine cognitive function and memory
      performance over 4 study sessions in 96 men and women with major depression, who, in a
      double-blind fashion, will be randomly assigned to either: (1) 250mg DCS, (2) 100mg
      modafinil, or (3) placebo administered on Study Weeks 2 and 3. The memory tests include both
      items unique to a given study week and memory tasks that are repeated over time that allow
      assessment of memory and retention effects across one-week periods.

    <time_frame>Week 2 and Week 3</time_frame>
    <description>A modified Cognitive Therapy Awareness Scale (CTAS) was used to assess delayed memory for cognitive therapy content from the computerized CBT. Higher scores indicate better memory for CBT skills. Scores range from 0 to 40.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>1 Week Delayed Recall Logical Memory</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 2 and Week 3</time_frame>

    <measure>Logical Memory Immediate Recall</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1, Week 2, Week 3</time_frame>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Immediate Memory Measured by the Hopkins Verbal Learning Task</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 1, Week 2, Week 3</time_frame>
    <description>The Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT) consists of a 12-item word list, composed of four words from each of the three semantic categories. The patient's free recall of the list is recorded. The same procedure is repeated for two more trials. The total recall score for the third trial was used as the recorded score and ranged from a minimum of zero to a maximum of 12 correct answers.</description>

    <measure>Immediate Recall of Emotional Story Items</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1, Week 2, Week 3</time_frame>
    <description>Immediate recall score of items from the Emotional Story presentation. Scores can range from 0 to 74, with higher scores reflect greater memory for story items.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Skills of Cognitive Therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 2 and Week 3</time_frame>
    <description>This measure assesses the self-reported use of skills from cognitive therapy. Scores can range from 8 to 40, and higher scores indicate greater use.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Digits Backward</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 1, Week 2, Week 3</time_frame>
    <description>The examiner reads a list of digits and asks that each digit be read backwards. The score is the total number of trials completed correctly; scores range from 0 to 16. Higher scores indicate better performance.</description>

          <description>The Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT) consists of a 12-item word list, composed of four words from each of the three semantic categories. The patient’s free recall of the list is recorded. The same procedure is repeated for two more trials. The total recall score for the last trial was used as the baseline score and ranged from a minimum of zero to a maximum of 12 correct answers.</description>

The patient's free recall of the list is recorded. The same procedure is repeated for two more trials. The total recall score for the third trial was used as the recorded score and ranged from a minimum of zero to a maximum of 12 correct answers.</description>
