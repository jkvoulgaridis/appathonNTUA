    <textblock>
      The purposes of this study were to investigate the caloric requirement and clinical outcomes
      in mechanically ventilated critically ill elderly patients and identify those at high
      nutritional risk who require high protein formula intervention.

  <detailed_description>

      The elderly population is rapidly increasing, but studies on calorie requirement in
      critically ill elderly patients are few, and indirect calorimetry (IC) is not available in
      every intensive care unit (ICU). The aim of this study was to compare IC and Harris-Benedict
      (HB) predictive equation in different BMI (body mass index) groups. And to investigate
      whether the nutrition intake from EN (enteral nutrition) and PN (parenteral nutrition)
      created a better clinical outcome than EN alone in HNR (high nutritional risk) mechanically
      ventilated critically ill elderly patients.Inclusion criteria were: age ≧65 years old, APACHE
      Π score ≧15, mechanical ventilation ≧48 hours and on NG tube feeding. Nutritional risk was
      screened by mNUTRIC and GNRI. Indirect calorimetry and HB equation were used to assess energy
      requirements. Patients were randomized 1:1 to two tube feeding regimens: general formula and
      high protein formula (1.5~2.0 gm/kg BW). Nutritional intake from EN, the type and amount of
      intravenous nutrition within 7 days, tolerance to feeding, MVD (Mechanical Ventilation Day),
      newly diagnosed VAP (Ventilator Associated Pneumonia), ICU and hospital LOS (Length of Stay)
      and date of death were recorded. We used SAS version 9.4 for statistical analysis.
      Statistically significance was set at α=0.05.

    <description>A total of 177 critically ill elderly patients (≧ 65 years old) underwent IC for measured resting energy expenditure (MREE). Estimated calorie requirement was calculated by the HB equation, using actual body weight (ABW) and ideal body weight (IBW) separately. Patients were divided into four BMI groups. One-way ANOVA and Pearson's correlation coefficient were used for statistical analyses.</description>

    <measure>Higher Enteral Nutrition Intake May Reduce Hospital Mortality</measure>
    <time_frame>first 28 days in the ICU</time_frame>
    <description>We included patients ≧ 65 years on mechanical ventilation ≧ 48 hours and received EN. Nutritional status was evaluated by mNUTRIC score. We calculated the energy and protein requirements as Harris-Benedict equation ╳ 1.0~1.3 and 1.0~2.0 gm/kg body weight respectively. Nutrition intake from EN and PN was recorded within 7 days. ICU and hospital mortalities in HNR elderly patients who could achieve more or less 80% of the prescribed nutrition were compared.</description>
