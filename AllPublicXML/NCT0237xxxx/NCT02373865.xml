      This exploratory double blind randomized active controlled study is designed to assess the
      effects of a treatment with therapeutical dosage of sitagliptin versus therapeutical dosage
      of glimepiride as add on therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 (T2DM) patients
      inadequately controlled on metformin monotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 Diabetes is associated with an increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Among
      patients insufficiently controlled with metformin multimorbidity and polypharmacy is common
      that makes the patients frail for cardiovascular complications related to hypoglycemic
      events.

      This exploratory double blind randomized active controlled study is designed to assess the
      effects of a treatment with therapeutical dosage of sitagliptin versus therapeutical dosage
      of glimepiride as add on therapy in patients with T2DM patients inadequately controlled on
      metformin monotherapy.

      Examinations will be performed as a 5 day recording of subcutaneous glucose concentration
      (CGMS) and holder ECG (AMEDTEC) at baseline and after a 12 weeks treatment with sitagliptin
      or glimepiride as active comparators used in combination with metformin.

      With recording of nocturnal hypoglycemia and arrhythmias it is aimed to evaluate favorable
      glycemic profile under treatment with sitagliptin compared to glimepiride. The primary
      objective is risk of serious HE for both drugs.

      The glycemic profile of sitagliptin as add-on therapy to metformin seems to be favorable
      compared to sulfonylureass such as glimepiride. Treatment with sitagliptin as add-on to
      metformin therapy causes less glycemic fluctuations and may be associated with lower
      oxidative stress and down regulation of low grade inflammation. This hypothesis will be
      tested as an explorative double blind study.
