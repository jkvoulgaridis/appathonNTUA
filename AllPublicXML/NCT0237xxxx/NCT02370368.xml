    <textblock>
      This study will examine the effects of six week dance training, using the Xbox Kinect Just
      Dance 2014 programme, on the agility scores along with general and hamstring flexibility and
      extensibility of the hip flexor. The effects of the dance programme will be compared with
      those of proven agility training techniques (ladder drills).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomised clinical trial will be used consisting of 34 (17 in each group) athletes
      undergoing training. Both groups will undergo one hour of training three times weekly for six
      weeks, with one group doing dance training (DT) using the Xbox Kinect and the other doing
      standard training (ST) using traditional ladder drills. Outcomes will be assessed using the
      Illinois Agility test for agility, sit and reach test for general flexibility, straight leg
      raise test for hamstring flexibility and the Thomas test for hip flexor extensibility.

      <time_frame>Data on adverse events was collected for the duration of the study which ran from September 2014 to January 2015. Persons were assessed at the beginning and end of every training session for the entire duration of the study's intervention, approximately six weeks per participant. Participants were advised that they could report any adverse events at any point during the research process.</time_frame>
      <desc>At the beginning and end of every training session participants were asked to indicate if they had any aches, pains or injuries. They were asked to indicate all problems even if they did not think it was related to the training programme.</desc>
