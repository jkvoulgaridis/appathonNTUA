  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine if intravitreal ranibizumab is superior to laser
      ablation therapy in the treatment of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consisted of a screening period (screening and randomization could occur up to 3
      days before the administration of the first investigational treatment), followed by a
      treatment and follow-up period (Day 1 to Day 169).

          -  Had used (either the patient or the mother) other investigational drugs as part of
             another clinical study (other than vitamins and minerals) within 30 days or within 5

          -  Had ocular structural abnormalities that were assessed by the Investigator to have had
             a clinically significant impact on study assessments

          -  Had active ocular infection within 5 days before or on the day of first
             investigational treatment

          -  Had a history of hydrocephalus requiring treatment

          -  Had a history of any other neurological conditions that are assessed by the
             Investigator to have a significant risk of severe impact on visual function

          -  Had any other medical conditions or clinically significant comorbidities or personal
             circumstances that were assessed by the Investigator to have a clinically relevant
             impact on study participation, any of the study procedures, or on efficacy assessments
