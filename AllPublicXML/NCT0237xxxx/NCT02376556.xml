      Patients who are referred for blepharoplasty with or without muller muscle resection in the
      oculoplastic clinic in the investigators institution, will be offered to participate in the
      study. After filling and informed consent form, patients recruited will fill in a
      questionnaire about dry eye symptoms, and will be examined by an ophthalmologist for visual
      acuity, intra ocular pressure, anterior segment examination using a slit lamp biomicroscopy,
      schirmer test, tear break up time assessment and tear osmolarity. These are all standard
      examination in ophthalmology. The surgical procedure planned to correct the eyelid pathology
      will not be affected by the results of these examinations.

      The same combination of ophthalmic examination will by done on postoperative follow-up
      examination 1 week, 1 month and 3 months after the surgery. Dry eye questionnaire will be
      filled in by the patients on postoperative follow-up examination 1 month and 3 months after
      the surgery.

      This data will help us assess the effect of these common surgical procedures on dry eye
      symptoms.
