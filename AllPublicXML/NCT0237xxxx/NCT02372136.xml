  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In preterm infants fed human milk, milk needs to be fortified to meet nutrient
      recommendations. Fortification can be 1) standard, 2) individualized (adjusted based on daily
      human milk nutrient analysis and milk volume), or 3) optimized (adjusted based on growth rate
      and serum analyses).

      The first specific aim will determine whether individualized and optimized nutrition during
      hospitalization results in improved growth in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) in
      extremely low gestational age (GA) neonates (ELGANs, &lt;29 weeks) and in small for GA (SGA,
      birth weight &lt;10th percentile for GA) preterm infants compared with optimized nutrition.

      The second specific aim will determine whether individualized and optimized nutrition in the
      NICU improves neurodevelopmental outcomes (acquisition of development milestones) and reduces
      the risk of disproportionate growth (i.e., excess fat) in the NICU and findings suggestive of
      metabolic syndrome in the first 3 years of life.

      Hypotheses:

        1. Primary hypothesis: In preterm infants (GA &lt;29 weeks or GA &lt;35 weeks and SGA)
           individualized and optimized nutrition will increase velocity of growth (weight gain
           velocity by 2 g x kg-1 x day-1 and length velocity by 0.2 cm per week) from birth to 36
           weeks of postmenstrual age (GA plus postnatal age) or discharge (whichever comes first)
           in comparison with optimized nutrition.

        2. Secondary hypotheses: Individualized and optimized nutrition will improve
           neurodevelopmental outcome and reduce the risk of disproportionate growth (excess fat)
           in the NICU and findings suggestive of metabolic syndrome in the first 3 years of life.

      Study design:

      Double-blinded randomized controlled trial (RCT): After consent, 150 neonates will be
      randomized to one of two groups.

      Study intervention: Patients will be randomized to either:

        1. Control: optimized nutrition: Milk fortification will be based on current
           recommendations and optimized by adjustment of nutrients once a week based on blood
           levels of urea nitrogen and albumin and velocity of growth (weight and length).

        2. Intervention: Individualized and optimized nutrition: Milk fortification will be
           optimized as in control neonates. In addition, nutrition will be individualized every
           day. Milk fortification will be adjusted based on daily measurements of macronutrients
           in human milk using near-infrared analysis.

      Randomization will be done by computer provided by a statistician using random block
      allocation and stratification by GA and size for age (AGA 23-28 weeks, SGA 23-28 weeks and
      SGA 29-34 weeks). Twins and multiples will be randomized to the same arm of the study.

    <description>Intake of macronutrients (protein, fat, and carbohydrate) will be individualized every day by adding one or more macronutrients to human milk based on daily measurements using near-infrared analysis.
In patients receiving less milk than 140 ml x kg-1 x day-1 fortification of human milk will be adjusted to reach at least the average concentrations of protein, fat, and carbohydrate in donor's milk (Wojcik. J Am Diet Assoc. 2009 Jan;109:137-40) and 20 cal/oz as provided by the Mother's Milk Bank of North Texas.
In those receiving at least 140 ml x kg-1 x day-1 of milk at 24 cal/oz fortification will be adjusted to meet recent guidelines from the the European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition Committee on Nutrition (ESPGHAN) (Agostoni et al. J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr. 2010 Jan;50:85-91).</description>
