      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the VisAbility
      Implant System (VIS) for the improvement of near visual acuity in presbyopic patients. This
      is a prospective clinical study that enrolled a total of 360 subjects ranging in age between
      45 and 60 years of age at 13 clinical sites. Subjects were implanted with the VisAbility
      Implant model SGP-046 in the primary eye and then in the fellow eye no sooner than 14 days
      later. Subjects were examined at one day, one week and at 1, 2, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months
      post-operatively.

      The study also included a 60 subject randomized controlled sub-study at 3 investigation
      sites. Sub-study subjects were randomized (1:1 ratio) to a surgery group or a control group.
      Subjects randomized to the surgery group underwent surgery and were followed for 24 months in
      the same manner as the larger non-randomized surgical group. Subjects randomized to the
      control group were observed for 6 months, and were then eligible to undergo surgery after
      completion of this 6-month observation period.

      The primary endpoint is the achievement of distance corrected near visual acuity (DCNVA) of
      Snellen equivalent 20/40 or better (at 40 cm) and at least 10 letters (ETDRS) improvement in
      DCNVA in the primary eye.

      This endpoint is evaluated against two objectives, a) 75% or more of primary eyes achieve the
      effectiveness endpoint at 12 months postoperative and b) the percentage of primary eyes
      achieving the effectiveness endpoint at 6 months postoperative (6-month responder rate) is
      higher than the percentage in the randomized control group.

      Safety data analyses were performed and separate summaries are provided for primary and all
      eyes. Descriptive statistics on the following attributes are provided for; BCDVA, IOP, Slit
      lamp findings, Fundus exam findings, and Adverse events.

      <pre_assignment_details>Once determined eligible and informed consent was obtained, both eyes were enrolled in the study. Per protocol, primary outcome analysis must be performed on the primary eye only and the primary eye is therefore the unit of analysis.

As per the protocol, the primary eye is the unit of analysis and was used for primary endpoint analysis. Fellow eyes were followed for safety and summarized separately. The primary eyes of subjects participating in the randomized sub-study were analyzed separately, though, they were also considered part of the overall study if they received implantation of the micro inserts.</description>

          <description>Measurement of the Distance Corrected Near Visual Acuity at 40 centimeters achieving 20/40 or better and Gain of At Least 10 Letters at 24 months for the primary eye.</description>
          <population>Explanted primary eyes were analyzed as failures. Data for primary eyes that missed the 24 month visit, were lost to follow-up, or withdrew consent prior to the 24 month visit were not imputed. Per protocol, primary outcome analysis must be performed on the primary eye only. Fellow eye data is used for safety outcomes and summarized separately.</population>

      <desc>An Adverse Event (“AE”) is any untoward sign, symptom or disease observed during the course of the study regardless of the suspected cause. Conditions or diseases that are pre-existing or chronic but stable are not Adverse Events. Changes in pre-existing or chronic conditions or diseases that are consistent with natural disease progression are not Adverse Events.</desc>

          <description>For post-implant safety analysis, the Implantation-Non Randomized, Implantation-Randomized, and Deferred Implantation-Randomized arms were combined into (one) safety cohort (306 subjects + 26 subjects + 28 subjects, respectively), per protocol. All 360 implanted subjects that received the VisAbility Micro Insert implantation were followed for 24 months and were not analyzed separately. I.e. Subjects who participated in the randomized sub-study crossed over into a single (safety) arm at the time of implantation. For safety analysis and adverse event reporting, all implanted subjects were considered one cohort as there was no difference in treatment nor follow-up after VisAbility Micro Insert implantation.</description>
