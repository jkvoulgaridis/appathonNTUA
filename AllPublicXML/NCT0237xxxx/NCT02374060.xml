      To evaluate the relative efficacy of three commonly utilized regional corticosteroids for the
      regional treatment of uveitic macular edema: periocular triamcinolone acetonide; intravitreal
      triamcinolone acetonide; intravitreal dexamethasone implant. The primary efficacy measure
      will be percent change in central subfield thickness as measured by OCT at 8 weeks.
      Participants will continue in the study for 24 weeks in order to evaluate relative effects of
      the 3 treatment strategies on the duration of treatment effects, requirement for additional
      injections, and adverse effects.

      Note: The planned sample size for the POINT Trial was 267 subjects. On 17 July 2017, with 192
      subjects enrolled, the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) reviewed the planned
      interim analysis and recommended that the goals of the trial could be accomplished by
      completing follow-up of enrolled subjects without the recruitment of additional subjects. Per
      the DSMC recommendations, recruitment was suspended and follow-up of enrolled subjects was
      completed according to the protocol.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Macular edema is the most common structural complication and leading cause of visual loss in
      patients with uveitis. Regional injections of corticosteroids are the most frequently used
      treatments specifically for uveitic macular edema but there is a lack of high quality
      evidence to guide choice of drug (e.g., triamcinolone acetonide, dexamethasone) and route of
      administration (e.g. periocular, intravitreal). The question of how to approach regional
      treatment of uveitic macular edema is a key question for ophthalmologists treating these
      patients. The Periocular and Intravitreal Corticosteroids for Uveitic Macular Edema (POINT)
      Trial is a randomized trial designed to compare the relative efficacy of three regional
      corticosteroids commonly utilized for the initial regional treatment of uveitic macular
      edema, periocular triamcinolone (Kenalog® , Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Princeton, NJ),
      intravitreal triamcinolone (Triesence™, Alcon Pharmaceuticals, Fort Worth, TX), and the
      intravitreal dexamethasone implant (Ozurdex®, Allergan, Irvine CA) will be conducted by the
      MUST Research Group clinical centers throughout the U.S. and one each in Australia and the
      UK. After signing informed consent and undergoing eligibility evaluation, eligible patients
      will be randomized to one of the three study treatments to be administered at the first study
      visit. Randomization is by participant, if both eyes meet eligibility requirements then both
      eyes receive assigned treatment. The design outcome is the percent change in central subfield
      macular thickness on OCT from baseline to the 8 week visit. After assessment of the primary
      outcome at 8 weeks, second injections and best medical judgment will be used if macular edema
      has not improved as follows:

      Eye(s) meeting trial eligibility criteria receive initial injection of assigned treatment at
      P01 visit.

      Second injection of assigned treatment permitted at 8 week visit for periocular triamcinolone
      and intravitreal triamcinolone and at 12 week visit for intravitreal dexamethasone if

        -  Eye does not meet the improvement definition (a 20% decrease in central subfield
           thickness of the macula) or

        -  Eye has a normal central subfield thickness but has cystoid spaces in the 1 mm central
           subfield or

        -  ME is worse after initial improvement

      And the following repeat injection criterion are met:

      • IOP of ≤21 or mm Hg and treatment with ≤3 IOP-lowering agents;

      Eyes demonstrating no improvement or worsening of ME as measured by the central submacular
      thickness on OCT (at week 12 for periocular and intravitreal triamcinolone arms and at week
      20 for intravitreal dexamethasone arm) are considered primary treatment non-responders.

    <description>The primary outcome is the change in central subfield thickness from baseline to 8 weeks measured on a relative scale as the the proportion of the baseline central subfield thickness. Values less than 1 indicate a decrease in retinal thickness with lower values indicating greater decreases. Smaller values are better.
The time point of 8 weeks was chosen for assessment of the primary outcome because it encompasses the window for maximum benefit for all three treatment strategies. Retinal thickness was evaluated using masked assessments of OCT images.</description>

             mg per day that has not been stable for at least 4 weeks(note that if patient is off
             of oral prednisone at baseline (P01 visit), dose stability requirement for past 4
             weeks does not apply);

          -  Systemic immunosuppressive drug therapy that has not been stable for at least 4 weeks;

          -  Known allergy or hypersensitivity to any component of the study drugs;

          -  Media opacity causing inability to assess fundus or perform OCT;

          -  Presence of an epiretinal membrane noted clinically or by OCT that per the judgment of
             study ophthalmologist may be significant enough to limit improvement of ME (i.e.,

          -  Torn or ruptured posterior lens capsule;

          -  Presence of silicone oil;

          -  Periocular or intravitreal corticosteroid injection in past 8 weeks;

Second injection permitted at Week 8 IF:
Eye does not meet the improvement definition (a 20% decrease in central subfield thickness of the macula) OR eye has a normal central subfield thickness but has cystoid spaces in the 1 mm central subfield OR ME is worse after initial improvement;

Periocular triamcinolone 40 mg: Periocular triamcinolone acetonide, 40 mg injection may be given either by posterior sub-Tenon’s approach or by the orbital floor approach, as both appear to have similar efficacy; the approach to the periocular injection will be recorded for analysis if needed.</description>

          <title>Visual acuity</title>
          <description>Participants' visual acuity was measured by certified examiners with best refractive correction in place.Participants were challenged with reading letters on lines of the standard ETDRS eye chart (5 letters per line). Lines became smaller as participants progressed from the top to the bottom of the chart. Participants read down the chart until no more meaningful readings could be made and were scored by how many letters could be correctly identified. More letters read is associated with higher visual acuity.</description>

        <title>Proportion of Baseline Central Subfield Thickness Observed at 8 Weeks</title>
        <description>The primary outcome is the change in central subfield thickness from baseline to 8 weeks measured on a relative scale as the the proportion of the baseline central subfield thickness. Values less than 1 indicate a decrease in retinal thickness with lower values indicating greater decreases. Smaller values are better.
The time point of 8 weeks was chosen for assessment of the primary outcome because it encompasses the window for maximum benefit for all three treatment strategies. Retinal thickness was evaluated using masked assessments of OCT images.</description>

        <description>Mean change in best-corrected visual acuity from baseline to 24 weeks. Participants' visual acuity was measured by certified examiners with best refractive correction in place.Participants were challenged with reading letters on lines of the standard ETDRS eye chart (5 letters per line). Lines became smaller as participants progressed from the top to the bottom of the chart. Participants read down the chart until no more meaningful readings could be made and were scored by how many letters could be correctly identified. More letters read is associated with higher visual acuity.</description>
