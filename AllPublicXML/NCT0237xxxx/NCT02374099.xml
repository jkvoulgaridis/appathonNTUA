      The purpose of this study to Assess the Efficacy and Safety of the Epigenetic Modifying
      Effects of CC-486 (Oral Azacitidine) in Combination With Fulvestrant in Postmenopausal Women
      with estrogen receptor positive (ER+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2-)
      Metastatic Breast Cancer Who Have Progressed on an Aromatase Inhibitor (AI).

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, open-label, two-arm study assessing the efficacy and safety of the
      combination of fulvestrant with CC-486 in subjects with ER+, HER2- metastatic breast cancer
      who have progressed after prior AI.

      Approximately 92 participants will be enrolled and assigned randomly in a 1:1 ratio to one of
      two treatment arms:

        -  Arm A: CC-486 300 mg and fulvestrant 500 mg: 46 subjects

        -  Arm B: Fulvestrant 500 mg: 46 subjects Each cycle will be 28 days. CC-486 will be
           administered orally at a dose of 300 mg daily on days 1-21 of each 28-day cycle.
           Fulvestrant will be administered by intramuscular (IM) injection at a dose of 500 mg on
           days 1 and 15 of cycle 1 and day 1 of subsequent cycles.

      Safety will be evaluated by an independent data monitoring committee (DMC) after a total of
      approximately 32 subjects have completed at least 1 treatment cycle.

    <measure>Kaplan-Meier Estimate of Progression Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From the date of randomization of study drug to the date of the cut off date of 13 December 2016; follow-up for PFS was 21 months</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival was defined as the duration from the date of randomization to the date of disease progression (DP) based on investigator's assessment using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1 or death (from any cause), whichever occurred first. Per RECIST 1.1, progressive disease (PD) was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions from nadir or appearance of a new lesion.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a Confirmed Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) to Treatment (Objective Response Rate) Based On the Investigator Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Disease response was assessed every 8 weeks, for the first 24 weeks, then every 12 weeks until DP; from date of randomization of study drug to data cut-off date of 13 December 2016; follow-up for overall response was 21 months</time_frame>
    <description>Overall response rate was defined as the percentage of participants who achieved a confirmed complete response or partial response based on RECIST Version 1.1 criteria. RECIST criteria v 1.1 defined a CR as the disappearance of all target lesions and a PR with at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions from baseline. The two-sided 95% exact binomial CI for each arm was estimated by the Clopper-Pearson method.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a Confirmed CR, PR or Stable Disease (SD) for ≥ 24 Weeks (Clinical Benefit Rate) by Investigator Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Disease response was assessed every 8 weeks, for the first 24 weeks, then every 12 weeks until DP; from date of randomization of study drug to the data cut-off date of 13 December 2016; follow-up for clinical benefit response was 21 months</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants with CR or PR or SD was defined per RECIST criteria v 1.1 as a CR that includes a disappearance of all target lesions, a PR was defined as having at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions from baseline and SD as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase of lesions to qualify for progressive disease. The two-sided 95% exact binomial CI each arm was estimated by the Clopper-Pearson method.</description>

    <measure>Kaplan Meier Estimate of Overall Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>From the date of randomization of study drug to the data cut off date of 13 December 2016; participants were followed for overall survival for 21 months</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death (from any cause). All participants who were lost to follow up prior to the end of the study or who were withdrawn from the study were censored at the time of last contact.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Kaplan Meier Estimate of Duration of Response (DoR)</measure>
    <time_frame>From the date of randomization of study drug to the data cut-off of 13 December 2016; follow up for duration of response was 21 months</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of response was defined as the time from the first tumor assessment when the confirmed CR/PR criterion was first met to the date of disease progression, based on investigator's assessment following RECIST Version 1.1 criteria.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization to 28 days after the last dose of IP; those AEs known at any time thereafter being related to IP; up to the last subject last visit of 21 November 2017; TEAE follow-up occurred up to 155 weeks and 2 days</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were defined as any AEs that begin or worsen with an onset date on or after the date of the first dose of IP through 28 days after the last dose. A serious AE (SAE) = any AE which results in death; is life-threatening; requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; constitutes an important medical event. The severity of AEs were graded based on the participant's symptoms according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, Version 4.0); AEs were evaluated for severity as follows: Grade 1 = Mild - transient or mild discomfort; no medical intervention required; Grade 2 = Moderate - mild to moderate limitation in activity; Grade 3 = Severe; Grade 4 = Life threatening; Grade 5 = Death.</description>

          <description>Percentage of participants with CR or PR or SD was defined per RECIST criteria v 1.1 as a CR that includes a disappearance of all target lesions, a PR was defined as having at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions from baseline and SD as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase of lesions to qualify for progressive disease. The two-sided 95% exact binomial CI each arm was estimated by the Clopper-Pearson method.</description>

        <description>Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were defined as any AEs that begin or worsen with an onset date on or after the date of the first dose of IP through 28 days after the last dose. A serious AE (SAE) = any AE which results in death; is life-threatening; requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; constitutes an important medical event. The severity of AEs were graded based on the participant's symptoms according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, Version 4.0); AEs were evaluated for severity as follows: Grade 1 = Mild - transient or mild discomfort; no medical intervention required; Grade 2 = Moderate - mild to moderate limitation in activity; Grade 3 = Severe; Grade 4 = Life threatening; Grade 5 = Death.</description>
        <time_frame>Randomization to 28 days after the last dose of IP; those AEs known at any time thereafter being related to IP; up to the last subject last visit of 21 November 2017; TEAE follow-up occurred up to 155 weeks and 2 days</time_frame>
