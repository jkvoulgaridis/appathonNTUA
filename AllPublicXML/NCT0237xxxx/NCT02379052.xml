  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to assess the clinical efficacy of repeat subcutaneous
      (SC) doses of dupilumab, compared with placebo, to relieve symptoms in adult participants
      with active, moderate to severe Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE).

      The secondary objectives of the study are:

        -  To assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of SC doses of dupilumab in adult
           participants with active, moderate to severe EoE

        -  To assess the effect of dupilumab on esophageal eosinophilic infiltration

        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of dupilumab in adult participants with EoE

A serious adverse event (SAE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death, life-threatening, required initial or prolonged in-participant hospitalization, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly/birth defect, or considered as medically important event. Any TEAE included participants with both serious and non-serious AEs.</description>

          1. Documented diagnosis of EoE by endoscopy prior to or at screening

          2. History of on average at least 2 episodes of dysphagia (with intake of solids off
             anti-inflammatory therapy) per week in the 4 weeks prior to screening and on average

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>A total of 80 participants were screened, of whom 47 were enrolled at 14 sites. Screen failures did not meet all inclusion criteria, met one or more exclusion criterion, or withdrew consent (33 participants). Of the 47 enrolled, 23 participants were randomized to receive dupilumab 300 mg QW and 24 participants were randomized to receive placebo.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>After providing informed consent, participants were assessed at screening (to occur between day -35 &amp; day -1) for eligibility to participate in the study. Participants who met the eligibility criteria underwent day 1 baseline assessments &amp; randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive dupilumab or placebo during the 12-week double-blind treatment phase.</pre_assignment_details>

Frequency of dysphagia events is graded on a 5-pt scale: 0=none, 1=1x/wk, 2=several/wk, 3=1x/day, 4=several/day; intensity is graded on a 6-pt scale: 0=swallowing unrestricted, 1=slight sensation of resistance, 2=slight retching with delay, 3=short period of obstruction necessitating intervention, 4=longer-lasting period of obstruction removable by vomiting, 5=long-lasting complete obstruction requiring endoscopic intervention. Total score ranges from 0-9 (higher score indicates worsening symptoms).</description>

          <description>The EoE-QOL-A questionnaire includes 30 items related to 5 established domains (eating/diet impact, social impact, emotional impact, disease anxiety, and swallowing anxiety) of daily life experiences. The EoE-QOL-A has a 1-week recall period. The items are graded on a 5-point scale: 1 (Not at All), 2 (Slightly), 3 (Moderately), 4 (Quite a bit), and 5 (Extremely). The EoE-QOL-A score is the average obtained by dividing the total score by the number of questions (for participants without disease, 120/30 = 4). Total scores range from 1 to 5 (higher scores indicate worsening symptoms).</description>

          <description>The EoE-EREFS includes a total of 6 major items related to the presence/ severity of esophageal features. Specific features scored by the investigator include rings (absent[0], mild[1], moderate[2], severe[3], not applicable); stricture (yes[1], no[0], not applicable); diameter of the stricture (if applicable; measurement not scored); exudates (absent[0], mild [1], severe[2]); furrows (absent[0], present[1]); edema (absent[0], present[1]). The total score of the 5 scored items ranges from 0 to 8 (higher score indicates worsening symptoms).</description>

Frequency of dysphagia events is graded on a 5-pt scale: 0=none, 1=1x/wk, 2=several/wk, 3=1x/day, 4=several/day; intensity is graded on a 6-pt scale: 0=swallowing unrestricted, 1=slight sensation of resistance, 2=slight retching with delay, 3=short period of obstruction necessitating intervention, 4=longer-lasting period of obstruction removable by vomiting, 5=long-lasting complete obstruction requiring endoscopic intervention. Total score ranges from 0-9 (higher score indicates worsening symptoms).</description>

        <description>The SDI is a PRO used to determine frequency/ intensity of dysphagia (recall period 1-wk). Frequency of dysphagia events is graded on a 5-pt scale: 0=none, 1=1x/wk, 2=several/wk, 3=1x/day, 4=several/day; intensity is graded on a 6-pt scale: 0=swallowing unrestricted, 1=slight sensation of resistance, 2=slight retching with delay, 3=short period of obstruction necessitating intervention, 4=longer-lasting period of obstruction removable by vomiting, 5=long-lasting complete obstruction requiring endoscopic intervention. Total score ranges from 0-9 (higher score indicates worsening symptoms).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Adult Eosinophilic Esophagitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (EoE-QOL-A) Score at Week 12</title>
        <description>The EoE-QOL-A questionnaire includes 30 items related to 5 established domains (eating/diet impact, social impact, emotional impact, disease anxiety, and swallowing anxiety) of daily life experiences. The EoE-QOL-A has a 1-week recall period. The items are graded on a 5-point scale: 1 (Not at All), 2 (Slightly), 3 (Moderately), 4 (Quite a bit), and 5 (Extremely). The EoE-QOL-A score is the average obtained by dividing the total score by the number of questions (for participants without disease, 120/30 = 4). Total scores range from 1 to 5 (higher scores indicate worsening symptoms).</description>
