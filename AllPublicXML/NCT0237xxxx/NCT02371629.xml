    <textblock>
      This study is a post-authorization commitment to the European Medicines Agency (EMA). The
      study serves to determine whether the treatment of patients with stable, symptomatic Chronic
      Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) with the investigational drug NVA237 is efficient and
      safe. The efficacy and safety of the drug was tested for twice daily dosing against once
      daily dosing.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Trough Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Spirometry testing was performed in accordance with American Thoracic Society standards. Trough FEV1 defined as the mean of two measurements at 23 hours 15 minutes and 23 hour 45 minutes post dosing. Baseline FEV1 was defined as the average of the -45 minutes and -15 minutes FEV1 values taken on Day 1. An analysis-of-covariance (ANCOVA) for repeated measurements, also known as mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM), was performed for the change from baseline of trough FEV1 at Week 12. The model included treatment, COPD severity, baseline smoking status, baseline ICS use, region, and visit (Day 1, and Weeks 12 and 26) as factors and baseline FEV1 as a covariate.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Total St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) Score at Week 12 and Week 26</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 Weeks, 26 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The health status, as reported by the patients, is assessed using the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). The SGRQ contains 50 items divided into 2 parts covering 3 aspects of health related to COPD:
Part I covers &quot;Symptoms&quot; and is concerned with respiratory symptoms, their frequency and severity
Part II covers &quot;Activity&quot; and is concerned with activities that caused or are limited by breathlessness
Part II is also concerned with &quot;Impacts&quot;, which covers a range of aspects concerned with social functioning and psychological disturbances resulting from airways disease.
A score was calculated for each of these three subscales and the total score was calculated. In each case, the lowest possible value was 0 and the highest 100. Higher values corresponded to greater impairment of health status.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Transitional Dyspnea Index (TDI) Focal Score at Week 12 and Week 26</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 Weeks, 26 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Breathlessness at Week 12 and Week 26 is measured using the Transition Dyspnea Index (TDI). On day 1, breathlessness is assessed by the Baseline Dyspnea Index (BDI). Baseline Dyspnea Index (BDI)/Transition Dyspnea Index (TDI) focal score is based on three domains: functional impairment, magnitude of task and magnitude of effort and captures changes from baseline. BDI was measured at day 1 prior to the first dose with domain scores ranging from 0=very severe to 4=no impairment and a total score ranging from 0 to 12(best). TDI captures changes from baseline. Each domain is scored from -3=major deterioration to 3=major improvement to give an overall TDI focal score of -9 to 9. Higher numbers indicate a better score.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mean Daily COPD Symptom Score at Week 26</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 26 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patients reported symptoms by using an electronic diary. The mean daily total symptom score, the mean morning symptom score and the mean evening symptom score were calculated for each patient over 26 weeks. Each symptom measured in a numeric rating scale of 0-10; 0 indicates no symptom and 10 indicates severe symptom. 0 is no waking due to symptoms, 1 woke up once, 2 woke up more than once due to symptoms ; 10 was the worst score.The daily score for an individual symptom score was the worst of the morning and evening scores on a particular day. If either the morning or evening score was missing for a symptom then the non-missing value was taken as the worst. A negative change indicates improvement. Only the scores for the 6 COPD symptoms (respiratory symptoms, cough, wheeze, production of sputum, sputum color, and breathlessness) were used to derive the total symptom score</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Trough Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) at Week 12</title>
        <description>Spirometry testing was performed in accordance with American Thoracic Society standards. Trough FEV1 defined as the mean of two measurements at 23 hours 15 minutes and 23 hour 45 minutes post dosing. Baseline FEV1 was defined as the average of the -45 minutes and -15 minutes FEV1 values taken on Day 1. An analysis-of-covariance (ANCOVA) for repeated measurements, also known as mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM), was performed for the change from baseline of trough FEV1 at Week 12. The model included treatment, COPD severity, baseline smoking status, baseline ICS use, region, and visit (Day 1, and Weeks 12 and 26) as factors and baseline FEV1 as a covariate.</description>

        <population>The Full Analysis Set (FAS) included all randomized patients who received at least one dose of study drug. Following the intent-to-treat principle, patients in the FAS were analyzed according to the treatment to which they were randomized.

        <description>The health status, as reported by the patients, is assessed using the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). The SGRQ contains 50 items divided into 2 parts covering 3 aspects of health related to COPD:
Part I covers &quot;Symptoms&quot; and is concerned with respiratory symptoms, their frequency and severity
Part II covers &quot;Activity&quot; and is concerned with activities that caused or are limited by breathlessness
Part II is also concerned with &quot;Impacts&quot;, which covers a range of aspects concerned with social functioning and psychological disturbances resulting from airways disease.
A score was calculated for each of these three subscales and the total score was calculated. In each case, the lowest possible value was 0 and the highest 100. Higher values corresponded to greater impairment of health status.</description>

        <description>Breathlessness at Week 12 and Week 26 is measured using the Transition Dyspnea Index (TDI). On day 1, breathlessness is assessed by the Baseline Dyspnea Index (BDI). Baseline Dyspnea Index (BDI)/Transition Dyspnea Index (TDI) focal score is based on three domains: functional impairment, magnitude of task and magnitude of effort and captures changes from baseline. BDI was measured at day 1 prior to the first dose with domain scores ranging from 0=very severe to 4=no impairment and a total score ranging from 0 to 12(best). TDI captures changes from baseline. Each domain is scored from -3=major deterioration to 3=major improvement to give an overall TDI focal score of -9 to 9. Higher numbers indicate a better score.</description>

Trough FEV1 defined as the mean of two measurements at 23 hours 15 minutes and 23 hour 45 minutes post dosing. Baseline FEV1 was defined as the average of the -45 minutes and -15 minutes FEV1 values taken on Day 1. An analysis-of-covariance (ANCOVA) for repeated measurements, also known as mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM), was performed for the change from baseline of trough FEV1. The model included treatment, COPD severity, baseline smoking status, baseline ICS use, region, and visit (Day 1, and Weeks 12 and 26) as factors and baseline FEV1 as a covariate.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) at Individual Timepoints at Week 26</title>
        <description>Mixed model for repeated measures was used to analyze change from baseline in FVC. Baseline FVC is defined as the average of the -45 min and -15 min FVC values taken on Day 1 prior to first dose.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Week 26 (Day 183-184)</time_frame>
        <population>The Full Analysis Set (FAS) included all randomized patients who received at least one dose of study drug. Following intent-to-treat principle, patients in FAS were analyzed according to the treatment to which they were randomized. n = number of patients included in respective analysis (i.e. who had a FVC at this time point on at least one visit).</population>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1) at Individual Timepoints at Week 26</title>
          <description>Mixed model for repeated measures was used to analyze change from baseline in FEV1. Baseline FEV1 is defined as the average of the -45 min and -15 min FEV1 values taken on Day 1 prior to first dose.</description>
          <population>The Full Analysis Set (FAS) included all randomized patients who received at least one dose of study drug. Following intent-to-treat principle, patients in FAS were analyzed according to the treatment to which they were randomized. n = number of patients included in respective analysis (i.e. who had a FEV1 at this timepoint on at least one visit).</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Mean Daily COPD Symptom Score at Week 26</title>
        <description>Patients reported symptoms by using an electronic diary. The mean daily total symptom score, the mean morning symptom score and the mean evening symptom score were calculated for each patient over 26 weeks. Each symptom measured in a numeric rating scale of 0-10; 0 indicates no symptom and 10 indicates severe symptom. 0 is no waking due to symptoms, 1 woke up once, 2 woke up more than once due to symptoms ; 10 was the worst score.The daily score for an individual symptom score was the worst of the morning and evening scores on a particular day. If either the morning or evening score was missing for a symptom then the non-missing value was taken as the worst. A negative change indicates improvement. Only the scores for the 6 COPD symptoms (respiratory symptoms, cough, wheeze, production of sputum, sputum color, and breathlessness) were used to derive the total symptom score</description>
