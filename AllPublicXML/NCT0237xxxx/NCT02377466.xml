  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study's primary objective is to demonstrate the superiority of retosiban to prolong
      pregnancy and improve neonatal outcomes compared with placebo. It is a Phase III, randomized,
      double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter study and will be conducted in approximately 900
      females, aged 12 to 45 years, with an uncomplicated, singleton pregnancy and intact membranes
      in preterm labor between 24^0/7 and 33^6/7 weeks of gestation. Eligible maternal subjects
      will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either retosiban IV infusion or placebo
      IV infusion over 48 hours. If not previously administered, antenatal corticosteroid treatment
      should be administered as either (1) two 12-mg doses of betamethasone given intramuscularly
      24 hours apart or (2) four 6-mg doses of betamethasone administered intramuscularly every 12
      hours. A single rescue course of antenatal corticosteroids is permitted if the antecedent
      treatment was at least 7 days prior to study enrolment. Investigators have discretion to use
      a standardized regimen of magnesium sulphate, as well as intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis
      for perinatal group B streptococcal infection. Prior to randomization, each subject will be
      stratified by progesterone treatment and gestational age. The progesterone strata will
      consist of subjects on established progesterone therapy or subjects not on established
      progesterone therapy at Screening. The study will comprise 6 phases: Screening, Inpatient
      Randomized Treatment, Post Infusion Assessment, Delivery, Maternal Post-Delivery Assessment,
      and Neonatal Medical Review. The duration of any subject's (maternal or neonatal)
      participation in the study will be variable and dependent on gestational ages (GA) at study
      entry and the date of delivery.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Signed and dated written informed consent is required prior to a subject's
             participation in the study and the performance of any protocol specific procedures.
             Adolescents aged 12 to 17 years must provide written agreement to participate in the
             study in accordance with applicable regulatory and country or state requirements.
             Subjects will also be asked to sign a release for medical records at the time of
             consenting to allow access to both the maternal and neonatal records including
             information about delivery and infant care as well as information collected prior to
             the consent having been signed.

          -  Females aged 12 to 45 years, with an uncomplicated, singleton pregnancy and intact
             membranes in preterm.

          -  Gestational age between 24 and 33 weeks as determined by (1) known fertilization date,
             either in vitro fertilization or intrauterine insemination, (2) last menstrual period
             confirmed by the earliest ultrasound prior to 24 weeks gestation, or (3) the earliest
             ultrasound alone prior to 24 weeks gestation, whichever is the most accurate method
             available for each subject. In situations where prenatal ultrasound records are not
             available at the time the subject presents, the investigator will make every effort to
             obtain these records (either via computer records, directly from the subject's primary
             care obstetrician, or via telephone). However, in cases in which these records are not
             readily available (e.g., off hours, holiday), it is within the investigator's
             discretion to use GA based on a verbal history from the subject with the intent of
             getting confirmation from the medical records as soon as possible.

          -  Females must be diagnosed with preterm labor according to both of the following
             criteria: a) Regular uterine contractions at a rate of &gt;=4 contractions of at least 30
             seconds' duration during a 30-minute interval confirmed by tocodynamometry and at
             least 1 of the following, b) Cervical dilation &gt;=2 centimeter (cm) and &lt;=4 cm by
             digital cervical examination or c) If &lt;2 cm dilation by digital cervical examination,
             a cervical change consisting of an increase of at least 25% effacement or 1-cm
             dilation.

          -  Current or past tocolytic treatment as follows: a) Subjects in whom tocolytic
             treatment has not been initiated prior to consent are eligible for the study, b)
             Transferred or referred subjects for whom parenteral magnesium sulfate treatment has
             been started before Screening are eligible provided they meet all eligibility
             criteria, c) Subjects receiving a prohibited tocolytic in this study are eligible only
             if the treatment is stopped before randomization and provided they meet all
             eligibility criteria, d) Subjects with a historical failure of a tocolytic treatment
             in a previous episode of preterm labor during the current pregnancy are eligible
             provided they meet all eligibility criteria.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Fever with a temperature &gt;100.4 degree Fahrenheit (38 degree centigrade) for more than
             1 hour or &gt;=101 degree Fahrenheit (38.3 degree centigrade) in the 24 hours prior to
             the start of study treatment.

          -  Women with maternal-fetal conditions that potentially necessitate the need for
             delivery, such as pre-eclampsia or fetal compromise.

          -  A fetus with any diagnosis, condition, treatment, or other factor that in the opinion
             of the investigator has the potential to affect or confound assessments of efficacy or
             safety (for example: nonreassuring fetal status, intrauterine growth restriction,
             major congenital anomaly).

          -  Preterm premature rupture of membranes.

          -  Women with any confirmed or suspected contraindication to prolongation of pregnancy,
             such as placental abruption, chorioamnionitis, or placenta previa.

          -  Evidence of polyhydramnios (AFI &gt;25 cm) or oligohydramnios (AFI &lt;5 cm).

          -  Women with co-morbid medical or obstetric conditions that in the opinion of the
             investigator have the potential to complicate the pregnancy course and outcomes, such
             as uncontrolled hypertension or uncontrolled diabetes (if known, history of
             glycosylated hemoglobin &gt;8% at any time during pregnancy), or compromise the safety of
             the subject, such as underlying cardiovascular disorder (specifically ischemic cardiac
             disease, congenital heart disease, pulmonary hypertension, valvular heart disease,
             arrhythmias, and cardiomyopathy).

          -  Women with a history of substance abuse during the pregnancy or urine drug screen
             positive for cocaine, phencyclidine (PCP), methamphetamine, or amphetamine.

          -  Women in whom the combination of history and screening test results is suggestive of
             abuse or dependency that may have the potential to complicate the pregnancy outcome.

          -  Women with any diagnosis, condition, treatment, or other factor that, in the opinion
             of the investigator, has the potential to affect or confound assessments of efficacy
             or safety.

          -  Current active liver or biliary disease (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or
             asymptomatic gallstones or otherwise stable chronic liver disease per investigator
             assessment).

          -  History of sensitivity to any of the investigational products (IPs) or components
             thereof or a history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator
             or GlaxoSmithKline/ Pharmaceutical Product Development (GSK/PPD) medical monitor,
             contraindicates the subject's participation.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>NEWBORN-1 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter study to investigate efficacy and safety of retosiban in female participants aged 12 to 45 years with an uncomplicated singleton pregnancy in preterm labor with intact membranes between 24 0/7 and 33 6/7 weeks gestation. The study was conducted in 3 countries.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Twenty-five participants were randomly assigned to study treatments: 12 participants to retosiban intravenous (IV) infusion and 13 participants to matched placebo IV infusion. Two participants randomized to retosiban arm did not receive study treatment. The study was terminated early due to feasibility of recruiting the study in a timely manner.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>Time to delivery or treatment failure is the number of days from the first dose of study treatment until delivery or treatment failure whichever occurs first. Treatment failure is defined as the administration of any putative tocolytic medication for treatment of preterm labor or as prophylaxis of preterm labor. Maternal intent-to-treat (ITT) Population comprised of all mothers randomly assigned to treatment who have been exposed to study treatment irrespective of their compliance to the planned course of treatment. The mean number of days to delivery or treatment failure along with standard deviation has been presented. Statistical analysis was not performed due to early termination of the study and resultant small sample size.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP) and Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP)</title>
        <description>SBP and DBP were measured with participants in a semirecumbent or seated position. SBP and DBP were measured during inpatient randomized treatment phase (15 to 30 minutes, 4 to 8 hours, and 20 to 24 hours after the start of the infusion, at the end of the infusion) and at the post-infusion assessment. Baseline is the last available assessment prior to first dose of study treatment. Change from Baseline is the post-dose visit value minus Baseline. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n=X in category title).</description>

        <title>Number of Maternal Participants With a Score of 12 or Higher on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS)</title>
        <description>The effect of preterm birth on maternal health status was assessed using the EPDS. The EPDS is a 10-item self-reported assessment of depression, validated for administration during both the antenatal and the post-natal periods. Items are rated on a 4-point variable Likert scale, ranging from 0 to 3. The total score was calculated by adding individual scores for each item and ranged from 0 to 30. A score of less than 8 indicates depression not likely; score of 9 to 11 indicates possible depression and a score of more than 12 indicates an increased probability of depression. Maternal participants were required to complete the EPDS at the maternal follow-up assessment 6 weeks post-delivery.</description>

          <title>Number of Maternal Participants With a Score of 12 or Higher on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS)</title>
          <description>The effect of preterm birth on maternal health status was assessed using the EPDS. The EPDS is a 10-item self-reported assessment of depression, validated for administration during both the antenatal and the post-natal periods. Items are rated on a 4-point variable Likert scale, ranging from 0 to 3. The total score was calculated by adding individual scores for each item and ranged from 0 to 30. A score of less than 8 indicates depression not likely; score of 9 to 11 indicates possible depression and a score of more than 12 indicates an increased probability of depression. Maternal participants were required to complete the EPDS at the maternal follow-up assessment 6 weeks post-delivery.</description>

        <description>APGAR is a quick test to assess the health of new born children. The test is performed at 1 and 5 minutes after birth. APGAR scale is determined by evaluating the new born on five categories (appearance, pulse, grimace, activity and respiration) on a scale from zero to two, then summing up the five values obtained. APGAR score ranges from 0 to 10 where a score of 7 and above is normal. The mean and standard deviation of APGAR scores at one minute and at five minutes of birth has been presented.</description>

        <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: results in death; is life threatening; requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in disability/incapacity; is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; important medical events that may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes described before; is associated with liver injury and impaired liver function. The number of participants who experienced at least one AE and one SAE has been presented. Neonatal Safety Population consisted of neonates whose mothers received randomized treatment.</description>
