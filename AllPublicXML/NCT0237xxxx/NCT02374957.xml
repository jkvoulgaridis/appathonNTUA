  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Twenty patients will be recruited to CLEAR. Ten will be randomized to the treatment arm
      (Cilostazol) and tenwill be randomized to the control group. Patients randomized to the
      treatment arm will receive Cilostazol for 90 days. The primary purpose of this study is to
      collect quality of life data on patients undergoing peripheral revascularization in order to
      determine the sample size required to adequately power a trial of Cilostazol versus usual
      care without Cilostazol and its effect on quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cilostazol is the only medication approved for use in peripheral arterial disease (PAD)
      patients to reduce claudication symptoms. Contemporary data has demonstrated that Cilostazol
      improves patency after endovascular interventions in multiple randomized trials and
      retrospective studies done in Japan in both critical limb ischemia and claudication patients.
      However, Cilostazol use after peripheral revascularization has been sporadic and there has
      been no research to estimate patient quality of life with use of Cilostazol after open or
      endovascular lower extremity revascularization.

      This is a prospective investigator initiated single-center open-label, non-placebo controlled
      pilot study. Eligible patients would be randomized to either the Cilostazol treatment or the
      non-Cilostazol treatment groups using a closed envelope randomization technique. Twenty
      patients will be recruited and randomized; Ten to the treatment group and tento the control
      group.

      The primary purpose of this pilot study is to collect quality of life data on patients
      undergoing peripheral revascularization in order to determine the sample size required for
      adequate powered trial of Cilostazol versus usual care without Cilostazol and its effect on
      Quality of Life.

    <measure>Change in Quality of Life in Relation to Use of Cilostazol After Lower Extremity Revascularization (EQ-5D Sum Score) at 6 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The Euroqol 5D (EQ5D) questionnaire will be completed at baseline, six weeks and three months follow-up. Cross-sectional and change scores will be used to project sample size requirements for a full trial. The EuroQol (EQ-5D) questionnaire is a standardized instrument for measuring generic health status. The descriptive system consists of the following five dimensions: 1) mobility, 2) self-care, 3) usual activities, 4) pain/discomfort, 5 anxiety/depression. Each participant was asked to choose one level that reflects their own health state today for each of the five dimensions. The EQ5D sum score is a composite sum of the individual dimension scores. Values of the total score can range from 5 to 25 with higher scores indicating a worse health state. Separate change scores are estimated at each follow-up time point.</description>

    <measure>Change in Quality of Life in Relation to Use of Cilostazol After Lower Extremity Revascularization (Euroqol-5D Visual Analog) at 6 Weeks.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Six Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Euroqol 5D (EQ5D) questionnaire will be completed at baseline, six weeks and three months follow-up. Cross-sectional and change scores will be used to project sample size requirements for a full trial. The EuroQol (EQ-5D) questionnaire is a standardized instrument for measuring generic health status. The second part of the Euroqol-5D is a analog scale with endpoints labeled &quot;best imaginable health state&quot; and &quot;worst imaginable health state&quot; with 0 representing worst health state and 100 representing best health state. Participants choose which number best represents their health on that day. Separate change scores are estimated at each follow-up time point.
Higher numbers are better.</description>

    <measure>Change in Quality of Life Scores - Estimation of Ambulatory Capacity by History-Questionnaire (EACH-Q) at 6 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Six Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The quality of life instrument EACH Q questionnaire was administered at baseline, 6-week and 3-month follow-up visits. Cross-sectional and change scores will be used to project sample size requirements for a full trial. The EACH-Q is a four-item questionnaire that estimates the maximum duration that patients can maintain different displacement speeds, ranging from &quot;slow walk&quot; to &quot;running.&quot; Values of the total score can range from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating a better health state. Separate change scores are estimated at each follow-up time point.
With the EACH-Q higher scores are better.</description>

        <title>Change in Quality of Life in Relation to Use of Cilostazol After Lower Extremity Revascularization (EQ-5D Sum Score) at 6 Weeks</title>
        <description>The Euroqol 5D (EQ5D) questionnaire will be completed at baseline, six weeks and three months follow-up. Cross-sectional and change scores will be used to project sample size requirements for a full trial. The EuroQol (EQ-5D) questionnaire is a standardized instrument for measuring generic health status. The descriptive system consists of the following five dimensions: 1) mobility, 2) self-care, 3) usual activities, 4) pain/discomfort, 5 anxiety/depression. Each participant was asked to choose one level that reflects their own health state today for each of the five dimensions. The EQ5D sum score is a composite sum of the individual dimension scores. Values of the total score can range from 5 to 25 with higher scores indicating a worse health state. Separate change scores are estimated at each follow-up time point.</description>

        <title>Change in Quality of Life in Relation to Use of Cilostazol After Lower Extremity Revascularization (Euroqol-5D Visual Analog) at 3 Months.</title>
        <description>The Euroqol 5D (EQ5D) questionnaire will be completed at baseline, six weeks and three months follow-up. Cross-sectional and change scores will be used to project sample size requirements for a full trial. The EuroQol (EQ-5D) questionnaire is a standardized instrument for measuring generic health status. The second part of the Euroqol-5D is a analog scale with endpoints labeled &quot;best imaginable health state&quot; and &quot;worst imaginable health state&quot; with 0 representing worst health state and 100 representing best health state. Participants choose which number best represents their health on that day. Separate change scores are estimated at each follow-up time point.
Higher numbers are better.</description>

Cross-sectional and change scores will be used to project sample size requirements for a full trial. The EACH-Q is a four-item questionnaire that estimates the maximum duration that patients can maintain different displacement speeds, ranging from &quot;slow walk&quot; to &quot;running.&quot; Values of the total score can range from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating a better health state. Separate change scores are estimated at each follow-up time point.
