  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients meeting eligibility criteria will be randomized into two groups, one receiving
      pharmacogenetic testing and the other not receiving pharmacogenetic testing. In this
      open-label trial, a pharmacist will make medication therapy recommendations using YouScript®
      Personalized Prescribing System for patients who receive genetic testing and standard drug
      information resources per usual for patients who do not undergo pharmacogenetic testing.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Both groups will be followed for 60 days. The number of re-hospitalizations and emergency
      department (ED) visits will be recorded as well as time to first re-hospitalization and time
      to first ED visit. Select Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS) metrics (e.g. M1034,
      M1242, M1710, M1720, M1745, M2110) and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-2 will be evaluated
      and documented at time of admission to home health, at 30 days, and at 60 days for
      improvement in overall status, pain, confusion, anxiety, depression, disruptive behavior, and
      the need for assistance with activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental activities of
      daily living (IADLs). The number of falls will be collected as well as the proportion of
      YouScript® recommendations accepted by study pharmacist and passed on to clinicians and the
      proportion of recommendations accepted by clinicians.

    <description>To assess time to first re-hospitalization, we compared the exploratory time-to-event outcomes between the tested and untested groups at 30 days and 60 days.

    <measure>Overall Status as Measured by Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days, 60 days post discharge</time_frame>
    <description>We assessed the impact of genetic testing on overall status according to OASIS M1034 at 30 and 60 days post discharge. OASIS measures various data items to assess home health care quality and performance. OASIS M1034, one data point in the OASIS system, measures overall patient status on a scale of 0 to 3, with a lower score indicating better overall status.</description>

    <measure>Confusion as Measured by OASIS Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days, 60 days post discharge</time_frame>
    <description>We assessed the impact of genetic testing on frequency of confusion according to OASIS M1710 at 30 and 60 days post discharge.

    <description>We assessed the impact of genetic testing on frequency of anxiety according to OASIS M1720 at 30 and 60 days post discharge. OASIS measures various data items to assess home health care quality and performance. OASIS M1720, one data point in the OASIS system, measures patient confusion frequency on a scale of 0 to 3, with a lower score indicating less frequent confusion.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Depression as Measured by Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-2 Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days, 60 days post discharge</time_frame>
    <description>We assessed the impact of genetic testing on frequency of depressive mood according to PHQ-2 at 30 and 60 days post discharge. PHQ-2 evaluates patient depression by assessing two factors: frequency of little interest or pleasure in doing things and frequency of feeling down, depressed, or hopeless. This outcome measure assessed the second factor, frequency of feeling down or depressed. The scale for this factor ranges from 0 to 3, with a lower score represented less frequent depressive feelings.</description>

OASIS measures various data items to assess home health care quality and performance. OASIS M1745, one data point in the OASIS system, measures frequency of disruptive behavior by patient on a scale of 0 to 5, with a lower score indicating less frequent disruptive behavior.</description>

          <description>Baseline data was extracted from patient charts &amp; manually entered into the study database.Study pharmacist reviewed DDIs, DGIs, and cumulative drug and/or gene interactions in the tested group using the YouScript generated reports and CDST to provide drug therapy recommendations to clinicians, after which prescriptions were altered at clinician discretion. Patients in the untested group were screened for DDIs using standard drug information resources (Lexicomp) with recommendations acted on according to clinician judgment. Time to change therapy was similar to those in the tested group.</description>

          <description>OASIS (Outcome and Assessment Information Set) Score represents an outcome measure in home health at an individual patient level to plan care, measure quality, and calculate reimbursement. On an overall scale of 0 to 3, a lower number represents a better outcome.
Average Pharmacogenetic Risk score estimates individual patient risk of having at least one significant adverse drug event due to genetic variation. Total range is 0 to 100, representing percentage, where a larger number indicates a higher risk.</description>

        <description>We assessed the impact of genetic testing on frequency of depressive mood according to PHQ-2 at 30 and 60 days post discharge. PHQ-2 evaluates patient depression by assessing two factors: frequency of little interest or pleasure in doing things and frequency of feeling down, depressed, or hopeless. This outcome measure assessed the second factor, frequency of feeling down or depressed. The scale for this factor ranges from 0 to 3, with a lower score represented less frequent depressive feelings.</description>
