  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study for participants with advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction
      adenocarcinoma who have had tumor progression after first-line treatment with platinum and
      fluoropyrimidine doublet therapy. The primary study hypotheses are that pembrolizumab
      (MK-3475) prolongs progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) for participants
      with tumors that show positive programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression.

      As of 20-March-2016, enrollment will be limited to PD-L1 positive participants.

    <time_frame>Up to 30 months (through database cut-off date of 26 Oct 2017)</time_frame>
    <description>PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first documented disease progression per RECIST 1.1 based on BICR, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. According to RECIST 1.1, progressive disease (PD) was defined as a 20% relative increase in the sum of diameters (SOD) of target lesions, taking as reference the nadir SOD and an absolute increase of &gt;5 mm in the SOD, or the appearance of new lesions. PFS was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and median PFS (95% confidence interval [CI]) in months was reported for PD-L1 positive participants by treatment group.</description>

If PD confirmed, participant was discontinued from treatment unless investigator determined benefit. If repeat scan indicated stable disease (SD; neither sufficient shrinkage or increase of target lesion), partial response (PR; ≥30% decrease in the SOD of target lesions), or complete response (CR; disappearance of all non-nodal target lesions), participant could continue treatment at investigator's discretion.

        <description>PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first documented disease progression per RECIST 1.1 based on BICR, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. According to RECIST 1.1, progressive disease (PD) was defined as a 20% relative increase in the sum of diameters (SOD) of target lesions, taking as reference the nadir SOD and an absolute increase of &gt;5 mm in the SOD, or the appearance of new lesions. PFS was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and median PFS (95% confidence interval [CI]) in months was reported for PD-L1 positive participants by treatment group.</description>

Following initial PD by RECIST 1.1 (20% relative increase in SOD of target lesions), participants were assessed according to irRECIST: tumor assessment was repeated ≥4 weeks later to confirm PD with the option of continuing treatment until this scan was obtained for clinically stable participants. If PD confirmed, participant was discontinued from treatment unless investigator determined benefit. If repeat scan indicated stable disease (SD; neither sufficient shrinkage or increase of target lesion), partial response (PR; ≥30% decrease in the SOD of target lesions), or complete response (CR; disappearance of all non-nodal target lesions), participant could continue treatment at investigator's discretion.

        <description>PFS defined as time from randomization to first documented PD per irRECIST based on BICR, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Following initial PD by RECIST 1.1 (20% relative increase in SOD of target lesions), participants were assessed according to irRECIST: tumor assessment was repeated ≥4 weeks later to confirm PD with the option of continuing treatment until this scan was obtained for clinically stable participants. If PD confirmed, participant was discontinued from treatment unless investigator determined benefit. If repeat scan indicated SD (neither sufficient shrinkage or increase of target lesion), PR (≥30% decrease in the SOD of target lesions), or CR (disappearance of all non-nodal target lesions), participant could continue treatment at investigator's discretion. PFS analyzed using Kaplan-Meier method and median PFS (95% CI) in months was reported for PD-L1 positive participants by treatment group.</description>

        <title>TTP According to RECIST 1.1 Based on Investigator Assessment in All Participants</title>
        <description>TTP was defined as the time from randomization to the first documented disease progression per RECIST 1.1 based on investigator assessment. Using RECIST 1.1, progressive disease was defined as a 20% relative increase in the SOD of target lesions, taking as reference the nadir SOD and an absolute increase of &gt;5 mm in the SOD, or the appearance of new lesions. If there was no documented disease progression, TTP was censored at last tumor assessment date. TTP was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and median TTP (95% CI) in months was reported for all participants by treatment group.</description>

        <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening of a pre-existing condition that was temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor's product was also an AE. The percentage of participants with at least one AE was reported for PD-L1 positive participants by treatment group.</description>

          <title>Percentage of PD-L1 Positive Participants Who Experienced an Adverse Event (AE)</title>
          <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening of a pre-existing condition that was temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor's product was also an AE. The percentage of participants with at least one AE was reported for PD-L1 positive participants by treatment group.</description>
