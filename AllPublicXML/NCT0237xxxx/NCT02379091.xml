  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish proof of concept and identify the optimal
      efficacious dose for namilumab in RA in patients with an inadequate response to methotrexate
      (MTX-IR) and in patients with an inadequate response to one tumor necrosis factor
      (TNF)-inhibitor (TNF-IR).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called namilumab. Namilumab is being tested to treat
      rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in people who have an inadequate response to methotrexate, and in
      people who have an inadequate response to tumor necrosis factor-inhibitor (TNF-IR). This
      study will look at improvement in disease activity in participants who take namilumab.

      The study will enroll approximately 100 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned (by
      chance) to one of the four treatment groups—which will remain undisclosed to the patient and
      study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need):

        -  Namilumab 20 mg/mL subcutaneous injection

        -  Namilumab 80 mg/mL subcutaneous injection

        -  Namilumab 150 mg/mL subcutaneous injection

        -  Placebo (dummy inactive subcutaneous injection) - this is a medication that looks like
           the study drug but has no active ingredient.

      All participants will receive namilumab or placebo as specified in the protocol. A stable
      dose of methotrexate and daily folic acid will also be required treatments.

      This multi-centre trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this
      study is up to approximately 40 weeks. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic,
      including a follow-up assessment up to 18 weeks after the last dose of study medication.

    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The DAS28-CRP score is a measure of the participant's disease activity calculated using the tender joint count (TJC) [28 joints], swollen joint count (SJC) [28 joints], general health: patient's global assessment of disease activity [visual analog scale: 0=no disease activity to 100=maximum disease activity] and acute phase response: C-Reactive Protein (CRP) for a total possible score of 0 (best) to approximately 10 (worst). Scores below 2.6 indicate best disease control and scores above 5.1 indicate worse disease control. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement. A mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) model with main effects for study site, treatment, visit, and previously failed medication with interactions between visit and treatment, visit and previously failed medication, and visit and baseline value as a covariate and participant as a random effect with an unstructured covariance structure was used for analysis.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Disease Activity Score 28 C-Reactive Protein (DAS28-CRP) at Week 12</title>
        <description>The DAS28-CRP score is a measure of the participant's disease activity calculated using the tender joint count (TJC) [28 joints], swollen joint count (SJC) [28 joints], general health: patient's global assessment of disease activity [visual analog scale: 0=no disease activity to 100=maximum disease activity] and acute phase response: C-Reactive Protein (CRP) for a total possible score of 0 (best) to approximately 10 (worst). Scores below 2.6 indicate best disease control and scores above 5.1 indicate worse disease control. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement. A mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) model with main effects for study site, treatment, visit, and previously failed medication with interactions between visit and treatment, visit and previously failed medication, and visit and baseline value as a covariate and participant as a random effect with an unstructured covariance structure was used for analysis.</description>

Participants were assessed for response (a 20% improvement from Baseline in both swollen and tender joint counts). If the participant was a responder, the current treatment continued every 4 weeks up to Week 24. If the participant was a non-responder, the participant entered an open-label period and received namilumab 150 mg/mL, SC injection, every 4 Weeks up to Week 24. All participants were on a stable dose of methotrexate tablets (15-25 mg weekly) and folic acid (at least 5 mg/week) orally throughout the duration of the study.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in DAS28-CRP at Weeks 2, 6, and 10</title>
        <description>The DAS28-CRP score is a measure of the participant's disease activity calculated using the tender joint count (TJC) [28 joints], swollen joint count (SJC) [28 joints], general health: patient's global assessment of disease activity [visual analog scale: 0=no disease activity to 100=maximum disease activity] and acute phase response: C-Reactive Protein (CRP) for a total possible score of 0 (best) to approximately 10 (worst). Scores below 2.6 indicate best disease control and scores above 5.1 indicate worse disease control. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement. A MMRM model with main effects for study site, treatment, visit, and previously failed medication with interactions between visit and treatment, visit and previously failed medication, and visit and baseline value as a covariate and participant as a random effect with an unstructured covariance structure was used for analysis.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in DAS28-CRP at Week 24</title>
        <description>The DAS28-CRP score is a measure of the participant's disease activity calculated using the tender joint count (TJC) [28 joints], swollen joint count (SJC) [28 joints], general health: patient's global assessment of disease activity [visual analog scale: 0=no disease activity to 100=maximum disease activity] and acute phase response: C-Reactive Protein (CRP) for a total possible score of 0 (best) to approximately 10 (worst). Scores below 2.6 indicate best disease control and scores above 5.1 indicate worse disease control. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>
