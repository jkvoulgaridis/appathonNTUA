    <textblock>
      Surgery for ovarian cancer involves a big cut on your tummy (abdomen) followed by removal of
      pelvic organs (womb, tubes and ovaries), abdominal organs (fat tissue {omentum}, appendix)
      and any other tissues involved with cancer. Several studies worldwide have reported that
      women survive longer and enjoy a longer disease free interval before their disease returns if
      all visible disease is removed at the time of their surgery. Achieving this is not easy and
      often there is widespread disease and the surgeons are unable to remove every tumour nodule
      present as it is attached to the surface of the bowel, diaphragm and other important
      Extensive surgery with prolonged operating is associated with higher risks. Plasma energy is
      commonly referred to as the 4th state of matter after solid, liquid and gas. When a gas is
      heated, it partially or wholly ionizes resulting in high energy particles like ions,
      electrons and atoms referred to as 'plasma'. PlasmaJetÂ® (PJ) is a new device which uses fine
      jet of neutral argon plasma from the handpiece that has been shown to have the ability to
      vaporise nodules close to sensitive organs like the bowel. It may offer the potential to
      treat the tumour nodules close to sensitive areas like the bowel. There have been no studies
      exploring its role in vaporising tumour nodules and its impact on survival. The PJ may be
      used by the surgeon to seal bleeding tissues (coagulate) or to burn away thin layers of
      tissue (ablate) by vaporization. It is licensed for use to achieve effects of coagulation and
      ablation. It is similar to conventional surgical devices that are routinely used (called
      diathermy) to achieve these effects. The PJ however is slightly different in that it may also
      be used on tissue to vaporise tumour nodules in women with ovarian cancer during surgery
      though the full extent of this role remains unclear.
