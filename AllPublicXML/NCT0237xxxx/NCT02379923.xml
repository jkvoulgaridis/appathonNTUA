      The primary objective of this trial is to evaluate confirmation of placement of any guidewire
      beyond the chronic total occlusion (CTO) in the true vessel lumen in patients in which at
      least one Asahi series of guidewires and/or Corsair microcatheter were used.

      Procedure success will be defined as angiographic visualization of any guidewire in a
      position either distal or proximal to the occlusion depending on the route of access and the
      absence of in-hospital major adverse cardiac events (MACE).

      This prospective, multi-center, single-arm, intent-to-treat (ITT) study is designed to assess
      the safety and effectiveness of the investigational products for the treatment of CTOs in a
      native coronary artery.

      The primary objective of this trial is to evaluate confirmation of placement of any guidewire
      beyond the CTO in the true vessel lumen in patients in which at least one Asahi series of
      guidewires and/or Corsair microcatheter were used.

      The population for this study is subjects with signs and/or symptoms considered typical of
      ischemic heart disease attributed to a CTO in a native coronary artery, who are suitable for
      a percutaneous revascularization.

      Procedure success will be defined as angiographic visualization of any guidewire in a
      position either distal or proximal to the occlusion depending on the route of access and the
      absence of in-hospital major adverse cardiac events (MACE). All subjects are followed through
      hospital discharge.

    <description>This is a single arm intent to treat study. A subject is considered enrolled when the subject has given informed consent and meets all inclusion and exclusion criteria, including angiographic inclusion and exclusion criteria, which includes an attempt to cross the target lesion with an investigational device (ASAHI PTCA Guidewire or ASAHI Corsair Microcatheter). Clinical evaluation up to hospital discharge is conducted on all enrolled subjects. The purpose of the clinical follow-up is to determine if the subject has experienced or is experiencing any adverse events</description>

                  following conditions are met:

                    -  It has been at least 9 months since the previous stenting

                    -  The previously stented segment (stent plus 5 mm on either side) has no more
                       than 40% diameter stenosis, based on visual estimate

              18. The target vessel has other lesions proximal to the total occlusion identified
                  with greater than 75% diameter stenosis based on visual estimate. However,
                  planned stenting of the lesion in target vessel which is proximal to the target
                  lesion and can be covered by a single stent (i.e., tandem lesions) are
                  acceptable.

          <description>This is a single arm intent to treat study. A subject is considered enrolled when the subject has given informed consent and meets all inclusion and exclusion criteria, including angiographic inclusion and exclusion criteria, which includes an attempt to cross the target lesion with an investigational device (ASAHI PTCA Guidewire or ASAHI Corsair Microcatheter). Clinical evaluation up to hospital discharge is conducted on all enrolled subjects. The purpose of the clinical follow-up is to determine if the subject has experienced or is experiencing any adverse events.
Crossing of Coronary Artery CTO: Standard angiographic procedures will be followed for this study. The primary objective of this trial is to evaluate confirmation of placement of any guidewire beyond the chronic total occlusion (CTO) in the true vessel lumen in patients in which at least one Asahi series of guidewires and/or Corsair microcatheter were used.</description>
