  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study objective of this project is to examine the mechanisms of the venous distension
      reflex (VDR) in humans. We hypothesize that COX blockade with ketorolac tromethamine, an
      intravenous NSAID, will attenuate the muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) response to
      limb venous distension. To gain further insight into whether the COX byproducts directly
      stimulate chemically-sensitive afferents, or enable venodilation and indirectly evoke
      afferent stimulation, we will measure vein size using 3T MRI during venous distention with
      and without ketorolac infusions.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will use a prospective observational design to examine if a COX blockade will inhibit the
      MSNA response to venous distension (Aim1), and if a COX blockade will alter vein sizes during
      venous distension (Aim2). Each subject will serve as their own control.

      Aim 1:

      An IV will be inserted in the antecubital fossa of one arm, and the wrist-to-elbow occlusion
      will be performed.

      To block the COX system, 6 mg ketorolac tromethamine in 10 ml saline will be infused into the
      forearm over 1 minute (Infusion 1). After 10 minutes, a second infusion of ketorolac
      tromethamine (up to 3 mg) in 5% of the forearm volume of saline,( ~40-60 ml) will be infused
      into the occluded forearm at a rate of ~ 30 ml/min (Infusion 2). Five minutes of data will
      then be collected before releasing the upper arm cuff. Infusion 1 is to block the COX
      pathway, while infusion 2 is to induce venous distension.

      In the saline control trial, saline (without ketorolac) in identical volumes as those in the
      COX blockade trial will be performed on a separate day.

      Aim 2:

      The subject will lie supine inside the MRI scanner. The subject will be instrumented with
      cuffs for the wrist-to-elbow occlusion procedure on one arm, and cuffs for automated BP and
      HR measurements from the other arm, The images will be obtained before and during the
      wrist-to-elbow occlusion procedure. The sizes of veins (i.e. cross sectional area) will be
      measured offline.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Microneurography (MSNA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Recorded continuously during the 3-4 hour study visit</time_frame>
    <description>This technique provides direct recordings of sympathetic nerve activity directed to blood vessels in skeletal muscle and will be our primary index of sympathoexcitation. This procedure may be performed in the either leg. External mapping of the peroneal or tibial nerve course (10-60 volts, 1-5msec, 1Hz) will be performed just behind the fibular head of the leg or in the popliteal fossa. A reference electrode will be placed subcutaneously about 2-3 cm away from the recording site. Multiunit recordings of MSNA in the leg will be obtained by transcutaneous placement of a tungsten microelectrode (insulated 200 ?m diameter with a tapered un-insulated 1-5 ?m tip) into C-fiber containing fascicle in the nerve. The electrode will be manipulated to yield a neurogram with characteristic bursts of MSNA, that will be amplified, filtered, rectified and integrated to obtain a mean voltage neurogram. Analysis consists of counting burst frequency and amplitude.</description>

    <description>Forearm cross sectional images will be obtained in HMC MRI facility. The proton weighted images will be obtained with Siemens Magnetom Trio 3T scanner (Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany). Contrast agents are not required for this completely noninvasive technique. The subject will lie supine inside the MRI scanner, and will be instrumented with an cuffs for the wrist-to-elbow occlusion procedure on one arm, and cuffs for automated BP and HR measurements from the other arm, The images will be obtained before and during the wrist-to-elbow occlusion procedure.

    <measure>Impedance</measure>
    <time_frame>Recorded continuously during the 3-4 hour study visit</time_frame>
    <description>The electrical impedance or resistance (Zo, in ohms) of a limb segment will be measured, which reflects the total fluid content of the limb. Fluid is an excellent conductor of electricity and the electrical current travels more easily through a ?wet? limb with more blood/fluid volume in the limb. The relative change in Zo will be used as an index for the fluid/blood volume change in a limb segment. By placing 2 pieces of tape with metal strips on the limb, we are able to measure impedance of the limb segment between the tapes.</description>

    <description>An IV will be inserted in the antecubital fossa of one arm. The arm will be fitted with occlusion cuffs arranged in a continuous fashion from the wrist to the elbow. A final cuff will be placed on the upper arm. The cuffs from the wrist to the elbow will be inflated to the same pressure of up to 300 mmHg using a pressurized air tank.
First, the subject?s arm will be elevated and the subject will make a fist to squeeze blood from the hand. Then the wrist cuff will be inflated. Once that cuff is fully inflated, the next cuff in the sequence will be inflated. Cuffs are inflated in sequence until the elbow cuff is inflated. After a 10-15 second period to allow blood to drain, the upper arm cuff will inflate (up to 250 mmHg) to keep any additional blood from entering the forearm. Next, the cuffs on the forearm will be removed but the upper arm cuff will remain inflated.</description>
