  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical utility of comprehensive medication
      monitoring using the Patient Medication Profile to improve heart failure patient medication
      therapy and associated outcomes relative to usual care in a hospital setting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Congestive heart failure has an exceptionally high rate of hospital admission and is
      responsible for more re-admissions (23.5% at 30 days) in the United States than the 2nd and
      3rd leading causes combined. Inadequate medication reconciliation both on admission and
      discharge from the hospital is a significant cause of medical error. In one study of
      cardiovascular patients, 44% believed they were taking a medication they were not, and 96%
      were unable to recall at least one medication they were taking. In the same study patients
      omitted on average 6.8 medications from their medication list. Medication optimization
      through improved adherence and reconciled medical records has been postulated to
      significantly improve admission and 30-day hospital readmission rates.

      Sano has developed a blood-based comprehensive medication monitoring tool that identifies and
      quantitates 235 prescription drugs and drug metabolites. It does not detect illicit drugs.
      This tool, which produces an output report designated the 'Patient Medication Profile', is
      designed to be used with clinical decision support to improve medication adherence, reduce
      medication errors, and optimize medication therapy. For heart failure patients, the
      investigators hypothesize that deploying the Patient Medication Profile with clinical
      decision support at key points of treatment intervention will A) improve medication
      adherence, B) identify and reconcile significant discrepancies in the medication list, C)
      result in reduced hospital admissions, and D) result in better overall patient outcomes.
      These outcome expectations are relative to usual care for heart failure patients.

    <description>For each patient, the proportion of prescribed medications that are detected using the baseline and final PMP will be calculated; change in adherence will be defined as proportion using final PMP, minus proportion using baseline PMP. Compare adherence difference in intervention vs. control groups.</description>

    <description>Baseline adherence to prescribed cardiology medications as a predictor of hospital admission for heart failure within 90 days. This endpoint will use baseline adherence and the Patient Medication Profile will not have been discussed with the care team in the intervention group, therefore both intervention and control groups will be pooled</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Drug Related Problem identification and resolution</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Documented drug related problems identified by medication reconciliation will be compared between the intervention and control groups. The number of changes in medications to resolve drug related problems, such as medication additions, terminations, dosage or frequency changes will be compared between the intervention and control groups.</description>
