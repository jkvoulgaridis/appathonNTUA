             psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, or another autoimmune skin condition that is managed
             without systemic therapy; or arthritis that is managed without systemic therapy beyond
             oral acetaminophen and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs).

          -  Has any condition requiring systemic treatment with corticosteroids, prednisone
             equivalents, or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days prior to first dose
             of study drug (except that inhaled or topical corticosteroids or brief courses of
             corticosteroids given for prophylaxis of contrast dye allergic response are
             permitted).

          -  Receipt of an organ allograft.

          -  Prior treatment with any checkpoint inhibitor therapy regimen that targets both PD1/L1
