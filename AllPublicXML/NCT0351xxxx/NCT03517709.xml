  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to determine how home blood pressure monitoring, using a
      commercially available blood pressure monitor with the capability of transmitting readings to
      stroke doctors can help manage blood pressure in the optimal range after a stroke. High blood
      pressure is the leading risk factor for stroke. It is important to control high blood
      pressure after a stroke to prevent another one from happening. We will use the Withings Smart
      Blood Pressure Monitor for daily blood pressure measurements.

      Tracking of blood pressure measurements will be done via iPod Touch equipped with internet
      connectivity. We hope to learn if this method of managing blood pressure is more effective
      than the standard way of having patients visit primary care physicians (the control group for
      this study). We will also get feedback from participants who will receive the Withings Smart
      Blood Pressure Monitor about the ease of use and overall satisfaction with this blood
      pressure device. People 18-100 years old who have had a stroke in the past 6 months may join.
      You will be excluded from the study if you are pregnant or plan on becoming pregnant in the
      near future.
