  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      By comparing dimethicone administration with/without subsequent repetitive position change
      before magnetically controlled capsule endoscopy (MCE) examination, the investigators aim to
      determine the efficacy of repetitive position change in improving gastric cleanliness for MCE
      examination.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-blind, randomized controlled trial. Subjects receiving magnetically
      controlled capsule endoscopy at the institution will be randomly allocated into positional
      change group and conventional group before the procedure. Right after ingesting 5 g
      dimethicone mixed with 100 ml water, subjects in the position change group will be instructed
      to repeatedly change the body position according to a pre-specified protocol for a period of
      15 min: in the order of supine to the left lateral position to prone, left lateral, supine,
      right lateral, and repeat last four positions twice, each for 1 min; finally supine for 1
      min. Thirty and 40 min after dimethicone administration, subjects in both groups will
      additionally take 200 ml and 800 ml water, respectively, and undergo MCE examination. Gastric
      cleanliness will be rated by two physicians independently.

    <time_frame>30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The image cleanliness of gastric cavity of six primary anatomical landmarks of stomach (cardia, fundus, body, angulus, antrum, and pylorus) were recorded for evaluation. A 4-point grading scale was introduced to define the cleanliness as excellent (no adherent mucus and foam: score 4), good (mild mucus and foam but does not obscure vision: score 3), fair (considerable amount of mucus or foam present precluding a completely reliable examination: score 2) and poor (large amount of mucus or foam residue needing water to clear it: score 1)</description>

    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Safety of MCCG, or adverse events, defined as symptoms or signs such as abdominal distention, nausea, or vomiting, were monitored closely during the MCCG procedure. Capsule retention (i.e., a capsule endoscope remaining in the gastrointestinal tract for more than two weeks or a capsule endoscope that requires directed intervention or therapy to aid its expulsion) was monitored and followed up for up to two weeks.</description>
