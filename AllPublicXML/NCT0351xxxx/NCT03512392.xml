  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RADAR-2 will be a randomised, open-label, allocation concealed, pilot trial of conservative
      fluid administration and deresuscitation compared with usual care in patients who are
      critically ill.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The optimal approach to fluid balance in critically ill patients is uncertain. A recent
      systematic review found low quality evidence in favour of a conservative fluid or
      deresuscitative approach (active removal of accumulated fluid using diuretics and/or renal
      replacement therapy) compared with a liberal strategy or usual care. The RADAR-2 pilot
      randomised trial will compare conservative fluid and deresuscitation with usual care in
      patients who are mechanically ventilated in an intensive care unit. The main hypothesis is
      that in critically ill patients, a post-resuscitation fluid strategy comprising conservative
      fluid administration and active deresuscitation reduces net fluid balance, is safe and
      improves clinical outcomes.

    <description>Health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) (assessed using absolute values of a telephone-administered EQ-5D (EuroQoL 5 Dimension Scale) questionnaire). This has 5 domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression, each of which are scored 1-5, with 1 being best and 5 being worst health. Each domain is reported separately. A total score is generated and is indexed to population reference values for that country (in this case UK) according to the time of data collection. It is therefore not possible to pre-specify a range for the indexed score.</description>
