  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a prospective study to evaluate the short-term safety and acceptability of the Liger
      Medical thermal coagulation device for treatment of cervical precancerous lesions. Study
      results will inform the Honduras Ministry of Health regarding potential use of the Liger
      device for precancer treatment in Honduras and results may be of interest to other Latin
      American settings as well.

      The research was conducted in the Tegucigalpa Region in Honduras in 4 health facilities in
      urban and peri-urban settings. Participants were women ages 30-49 who met the study
      eligibility criteria. Human papilloma virus (HPV) and visual inspection with acetic acid
      (VIA)-positive women who were eligible for ablative treatment were offered thermal
      coagulation with the Liger instrument to treat their lesions and asked about acceptability of
      the treatment. At this visit, biopsies were also be taken. Women were followed-up at 1 month
      to evaluate short-term safety outcomes with a physical exam and receive their biopsy results.
      Depending on their biopsy results, they will be asked to return for repeat screening,
      referred for further treatment or asked to come back for a 12-month study visit. At the
      12-month visit after treatment, women were followed up to evaluate cure rates.

      A second investigational device, Pocket Colposcope, wes used to take cervix photos at the
      enrollment and 12-month study visit with participant consent. The photos were used to explore
      factors influencing treatment failure. De-identified photos and women's diagnosis information
      were also shared with the device developers, Duke University, for the purposes of improving
      their device. Women had the option to opt out of having cervix photos taken and still
      participate in the treatment portion of the study.

    <description>Level of pain women experienced during the thermal coagulation procedure will be calculated by the number and percent of women indicating minimal to worst possible levels of pain using the Wong-Baker FACES® pain rating scale. Women's acceptability will also be assessed by asking if they would recommend the Liger Thermocoagulator treatment to a friend or relative who needed similar treatment as well as reasons for her response.
Wong-Baker FACES® pain rating scale:
MINIMUM value: 0 (no hurt = best outcome) Value: 2 (hurts little bit) Value: 4 (hurts little more) Value: 6 (hurts even more) Value: 8 (hurts lot more) MAXIMUM value: 10 (hurts whole lot = worst outcome)</description>

    <measure>Disappearance of Lesions</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>To calculate rates of disappearance of lesions, we will include women with histologically-confirmed cervical squamous intraepithelial neoplasia 2-3 lesions. The 12 month rate of disappearance of cervical squamous intraepithelial neoplasia 2-3 lesions will be calculated by dividing the number of eligible women who had no evidence of cervical squamous intraepithelial neoplasia 2-3 at 12 months after undergoing thermal coagulation for the treatment of their cervical squamous intraepithelial neoplasia 2-3 lesions (numerator), divided by those women evaluated at 12 months (denominator). Analysis will include considering potential confounding factors such as clinic and provider as well as drop-out rates. Chi-square or Fisher's exact test will be used to confirm whether there are differences in rates by these potential confounding factors.</description>

    <measure>Treatment Failure</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Analysis of cervical photos will be a qualitative comparison of the characteristics of the uterine cervix and the pre-cancerous lesions at Visit 1 (enrollment) in women whose treatment resulted in disappearance of lesions and women with persistent pre-cancerous lesions after 12 months. The evaluation will examine what features or cervical conditions prior to treatment might be related to disappearance or persistence of lesions, such as shape of the cervix, size and location of the lesions, etc. Chi-square or Fisher's exact test will be used to confirm whether there are any differences by these features.</description>

        <title>Disappearance of Lesions</title>
        <description>To calculate rates of disappearance of lesions, we will include women with histologically-confirmed cervical squamous intraepithelial neoplasia 2-3 lesions. The 12 month rate of disappearance of cervical squamous intraepithelial neoplasia 2-3 lesions will be calculated by dividing the number of eligible women who had no evidence of cervical squamous intraepithelial neoplasia 2-3 at 12 months after undergoing thermal coagulation for the treatment of their cervical squamous intraepithelial neoplasia 2-3 lesions (numerator), divided by those women evaluated at 12 months (denominator). Analysis will include considering potential confounding factors such as clinic and provider as well as drop-out rates. Chi-square or Fisher's exact test will be used to confirm whether there are differences in rates by these potential confounding factors.</description>

        <title>Treatment Failure</title>
        <description>Analysis of cervical photos will be a qualitative comparison of the characteristics of the uterine cervix and the pre-cancerous lesions at Visit 1 (enrollment) in women whose treatment resulted in disappearance of lesions and women with persistent pre-cancerous lesions after 12 months. The evaluation will examine what features or cervical conditions prior to treatment might be related to disappearance or persistence of lesions, such as shape of the cervix, size and location of the lesions, etc. Chi-square or Fisher's exact test will be used to confirm whether there are any differences by these features.</description>
