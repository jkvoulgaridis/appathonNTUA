  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After completion of 5 years of medical school training, the next step of becoming a House
      Officer is said to be associated with high levels of stress. It has been associated with
      mental health problems amongst HOs and sometimes quitting the medical line altogether. In
      Malaysia, the number of HOs not completing housemanship training within the allocated time is
      slowly declining from 86.4% (2009) to 58.8% (2012). The dropout rate is said to be increasing
      yearly.

      This causes a lot of constraints on the HO, their family, sponsors, patients and also the
      country. Amongst the reason for stress is the feeling of incompetency or &quot;fear of making
      mistakes&quot;. Other work-related issues include workload, time management, financial, colleague
      and superior related issues.

      Medicorp is a company that specializes in training for junior doctors and has come up with a
      module to help medical graduates cope with these issues. The module is a 3-day-course named
      the HO Preparatory Course. It was initially the brainchild of the Islamic Medical Association
      of Malaysia (IMAM) but was later privatized to accommodate the demand and the running of the
      module and courses. The module has been re-evaluated through feedback of participants and
      trainers to cater to the needs and wants of the newly graduate; be it local or overseas.

      Therefore, the investigators would like to assess whether this intervention module is
      effective in addressing HO stress, therefore consequently reduce the risk of drop out and
      extension in HO training.

      METHODOLOGY

      Study Setting:

      This study will be conducted in International Youth Centre, Cheras. It has been the main
      focal point of where most of the courses have been conducted. It is within easy reach and
      centrally located near National University of Malaysia Hospital. Many participants will come
      from all around Malaysia to attend. The centre is equipped with a lecture hall and boarding
      for the participants.

      Study Design:

      This is a pre-post quasi-experimental study that will be conducted over 12 months duration.
      Participants in this study will undergo a House Officer (HO) preparatory course. The level of
      confidence, readiness and psychological wellbeing will be evaluated. There will be three
      assessment time points: at baseline (before the course), immediately after the course (only
      for level of confidence and readiness) and 1 month after working as HO. This study is unable
      to have a control because of constraints in resources.

      Study Duration:

      This study will start from April 2018 - March 2019

      Sampling of participants:

      Recruitment

      Participants who attend the Medicorp HO Preparatory Course from April 2018 -March 2019 will
      be recruited into this study as the sampling frame. The eligibility criteria are based on the
      following:

      The sampling methods employed in this study will be taking all participants who fulfill the
      eligibility criteria and agree to participate in this study.

      Intervention:

      The intervention in this study will be the Medicorp HO preparatory course which comprises of
      a 3-day training touching on aspects of HO training that is needed practically for an HO to
      function. The training will touch on the nature of the HO job, explaining about technical
      details such as the shift and on-call system. The tagging period, and assessments that HOs
      need to undergo during their training. They will be guided on how to clerk, review and
      present common as well as emergency cases. Other aspects involved in clerking such as common
      forms used in the wards and also how to refer cases is also discussed. Apart from that, soft
      skills such as communication among staff, financed, balancing social life and future career
      planning is incorporated in the training. There are hands-on training for participants for
      common procedures such as continuous bladder drainage insertion and venepuncture. The
      trainers are specialists, specialists in training, medical officers, and also house officers
      who come to share their experience. Medicorp encourages their alumni to be part of their
      training program. This module will be held on a 1-2 monthly basis. The Module Content is
      moderated by Medicorp based on discussions with the board of directors, advisors and feedback
      from participants. The training program is done as a lecture, tutorial and hands-on session.
      Before commencing the course, participants will be included in a WhatsApp group, for easier
      content sharing and updates of the course. They will continue this networking even after
      completion of this course. They will be also be guided in the online applications of their
      job through this application and also through Facebook. During the commencement of their job,
      Medicorp will use their database to guide them into different WhatsApp groups according to
      their place of work for additional support.

      Sample size The sample size was calculated using G*Power 3.1 sample size calculator software.
      Based on reports by confidence score from a study analysing pre and post-emergency department
      posting in junior doctors was used. The mean overall confidence score was 56.475(24.67) at
      the end of month 1 and 62.775(28.69) at the end of month 4(Williams et al., 1997). The
      estimated sample size was 208 participants after accounting for the power of 80%,
      significance level of 0.05% and 30% attrition.

      using the questionnaire.

      Data collection

      A pre-tested self-administered questionnaire which includes baseline socio-demography,
      adaptation of the IMU Student Competency Survey, and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale will
      be used. 1 month follow-up will be done by telephone. After the participants have completed
      the course, their level of readiness and confidence will again be assessed via a
      self-administered questionnaire. This will be done on the last day of the course.

      The participants will later be followed up 1 month after they have been working as a HO in
      their respective hospitals. The organisers will keep track of placements of all participants
      via social media applications as part of the course is still maintaining connections and
      informal training after the course has ended and as participants start the process of job
      application and working.

      Ethical considerations

      This study's approval for ethical clearance will be obtained from JETHIC COMMITTEE FOR
      RESEARCH INVOLVING HUMAN SUBJECT University Putra Malaysia ETHIC COMMITTEE FOR RESEARCH
      INVOLVING HUMAN SUBJECT (JKEUPM) ) and National Medical Research Register (NMRR); Medical
      Research and Ethics Committee (MREC) as the participants will be working in Ministry of
      Health facilities during the 1 month follow up. This study will also be registered in the
      National Institute of Health (NIH) as a trail registration.

      Informed consent will be obtained from each study participant and they will be told the right
      not to respond to the questions they don't want to respond to or to withdraw from the study
      at any time. All data obtained will be kept confidentially and for research purposes only.

      The benefits of the study includes assessing issues in relations to HO wellbeing and to
      assess what is needed in training a functional HO. The potential risk, discomforts and
      inconvenience is almost none. However, should the DASS score be suggestive of depression or
      anxiety, team members of the research team will refer the participant appropriately. Should
      participants choose to withdraw from study, they will be allowed to do so.

      Data Analysis

      The data will be analysed using IBM Social Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 24. A
      descriptive analysis of the demographic characteristics of the participants, clinical
      experience and baseline level of confidence, readiness and psychological wellbeing will be
      reported using means and standard deviations (SD) or median and inter-quartile range (IQR)
      for continuous variables (depending on the data distribution) and as frequencies and
      percentages for categorical data. An analysis to compare between participants who completed
      and withdrew from the study will be made using Chi-square or Exact test (for unbalanced data)
      for categorical variables and independent t-test for continuous data.

      A repeated measures ANOVA will be conducted to determine the effectiveness of the
      intervention within the groups across the study periods (baseline, immediately after
      intervention and at 1 month after working). Controlling for baseline measures will be done to
      determine the change over time on the measured outcomes (level of confidence, readiness and
      psychological wellbeing). All analyses conducted are two-tailed with significant level set at
      p value &lt;0.05.

        <description>This will be adapted from the IMU Student Competency Survey (Appendix 2) as there are no published studies on the confidence level of medical graduates before beginning HO-ship. The questionnaire comprises of 5 sections. The first 4 sections asses on generic skills, practical tasks, soft skills and their confidence as a whole, using a Likert scale assessment. Scoring is a mean score of 1-5 and the higher the score, the higher the confidence. The last section asks on the one daunting aspect of being a HO out of a list of 7 things, this section is descriptive.</description>

      <desc>This is an education module, hence, there should be no adverse events. However, in the module there were needle used in practical session. Therefore, needle prick injury can be one of the adverse events that we can include in the study.
The adverse event is somehow monitored but not observed.</desc>

          <description>Pre-intervention: The participants screened based on the exclusion and inclusion criteria leaving the number of 239 participants after registration.
Post-intervention: Drop outs mainly due to failure in submitting the complete post-intervention questionnaires before they headed home.
Post 1 month after work: Major drop outs purely as a result of unavailability to answer and time constraint due to the hectic schedule of a houseman.</description>
