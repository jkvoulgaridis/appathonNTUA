      The study will investigate the effects of an intradialytic resistance training on miRNA´s
      expression and muscle strength in haemodialysis patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is accompanied by distortions of immune functions and
      acceleration of inflammation processes. Regular exercise has shown great potential for
      improving the health-related parameters of CKD patients. Moreover, muscle strength is
      considered to be an important predictor of protein- and energy- wasting, inflammation,
      quality of life and mortality in CKD patients. The behaviour and individual variability of
      adaptation to regular, controlled, supervised physical activities in CKD patients are not
      well defined and understood. The understanding of molecular adaptation mechanisms,
      represented by the epigenetic impact of exercise on renal specific miRNA´s expression, is
      necessary for future improvements in clinical practice. Monitoring pro- and anti-inflammation
      genes activity, their transcription factors and expression of miRNA molecules (influencing
      the signalling pathways of specific genes) will enable us to draft a new transcription and
      translation model for exercise-induced adaptation in CKD patients. Additionally, our results
      will indicate the clinical value of selected markers for the diagnostics and prognostics of
      disease.

    <description>Blood plasma will be collected for miRNAs analysis. We will analyze the activity of miRNAs involved in TRIM63 and IGF-1 signalling pathways for better definitions of chronic renal insufficiency and muscular adaptation following progressive resistance training. For miRNA analysis, we selected circulatory miRNA´s which were previously connected with regulation of calcium metabolism, calcification processes, protein-energy wasting, muscle mass and functions</description>

    <description>Clinical data will be collected from the medical documentation of patients. The extracted database will contain patient´s nephrological diagnosis profile, data about the presence of other diagnosis and comorbidities, body composition parameters and standard dialysis biochemistry, haematology and dialysis adequacy measures.</description>

    <measure>Change in score on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Before the intervention and 1-5 days after the completion of 12-week intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) will be used to assess states of depression and anxiety in the setting of a hospital medical outpatient clinic. The HADS consists of two subscales, subscale for anxiety and subscale for depression. Both subscales contains seven items and each item is rated on a four-point scale (numeric score range from 0 to 3 points). Maximal score for both subscales is 21, minimal score is 0. Scores of 11 or more on either subscale are considered to be a significant indicator of psychological morbidity. Scores between 8 and 10 represents &quot;borderline&quot; and scores between 0 and 7 represents &quot;normal&quot; indication of anxiety and depression.</description>

    <description>The Health literacy level will be assessed using The Health Literacy Questionnaire and The Brief Health Literacy survey. This questionnaire comprises nine domains to provide a detailed profile of health literacy of populations, groups or patients of interest. The HLQ is divided into two parts which differ in response categories. Part 1 (domains 1-5) has 4 response categories rating the extent of agreement from 1 to 4. Part 2 (domains 6-9) has 5 response categories rating the level of difficulty from cannot do or always difficult (1), to always easy (5). Each domain was scored as the average of the item scores. The score ranges from 1 to 4 or 1 to 5 respectively, a higher score indicating higher level of health literacy.</description>
