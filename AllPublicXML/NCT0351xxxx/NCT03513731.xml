  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, active controlled, single site safety and efficacy study
      in subjects suffering from chronic lumber back pain due to facet joint osteoarthritis
      comparing a single ADRC injection generated with the Transpose® RT system into the facet
      joint.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will fall into two categories: treatment group (20 subjects) and non-treatment or
      control group (20 subjects). The treatment group will undergo a small liposuction procedure
      and receive facet joint osteoarthritis treatment with an ultrasound-guided injection of 5 ml
      adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) into the point of injury. The control group will receive a
      5 ml corticosteroid injection into the point of injury

             includes completion of patient reported outcome instruments.

         19. Body habitus precluding adequate fluoroscopic visualization for the procedure or the
             procedure is physically impossible due to inability to inject the facet joint.

         20. Failed any component of the lumbar neurological exam at baseline (i.e., motor,
             sensory, or a reflex portion of the exam).

         21. The subject is receiving immunosuppressant therapy or has a known immunologic or
             severe autoimmune disease that requires chronic immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory

             radiculopathy) or clinically significant sacroiliac joint pain based on targeted,
             pre-specified physical examination, and, if deemed medically necessary, confirmed by
             anesthetic injection. If a previously performed anesthetic injection to confirm SI
             joint pain was performed up to 6 months prior to injection (with documentation
             indicating no SI joint pain), this does not need to be repeated at screening.

         24. Symptomatic central vertebral canal, lateral recess stenosis or foraminal stenosis, in
             the opinion of the investigator.

             to stabilize the segment would be required.

         26. An acute fracture of the spine. Clinically compromised, in the opinion of the
             investigator, vertebral bodies at the symptomatic level due to current or past trauma,
             e.g., sustained a pathological fracture or multiple fractures of vertebrae.

         27. History of Chronic tobacco and nicotine usage.

         28. Insufficient amount of subcutaneous tissue to allow recovery of at least 100 mL of
             adipose tissue.

         29. Subjects who have document allergy to radiographic agents or sodium citrate or any
             &quot;caine&quot; type of local anesthetic.

         30. Subjects with radicular leg pain as determined by investigator
