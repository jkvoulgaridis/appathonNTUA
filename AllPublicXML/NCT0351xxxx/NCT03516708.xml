      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate epacadostat when given with routine
      radiation therapy and chemotherapy (capecitabine and oxaliplatin) to treat rectal cancer
      before routine surgery is performed to remove the tumor.

    <time_frame>Completion of the first 2 cycles of treatment for all patients (estimated to be 38 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) is defined as the dose level immediately below the maximally administered dose at which 0 or 1 of a cohort of 3 to 6 patients experienced a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) during first 2 cycles.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Safety and toxicity profile of the combination as measured by adverse events experienced</measure>
    <time_frame>Through 4 weeks after completion of treatment (approximately 25 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 will be utilized for all toxicity reporting.
Adverse events will be tracked from first dose of epacadostat through 4 weeks after the last day of epacadostat. Surgical complications will not be tracked if not thought to be at least possibly related to epacadostat.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Antitumor activity of the combination as measured by Neoadjuvant Rectal (NAR) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>At the time of surgery (approximately week 25)</time_frame>
    <description>The NAR formula is = [5pN-3(cT-pT) + 12]^2 divided by 9.61
pN = pathologic nodal stage
cT = clinical tumor stage
pT=pathologic tumor stage</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Antitumor activity of the combination as measured by pathological complete response rate</measure>
    <time_frame>At the time of surgery (approximately week 25)</time_frame>
    <description>--Pathologic complete response is defined as no histology evidence of invasive tumor cells in the surgical specimen.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Antitumor activity of the combination as measured by progression-free survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>At the time of surgery (approximately week 25)</time_frame>
    <description>-Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first. For those who are alive and do not experience progression, the investigators will censor them at the time of loss to follow-up.</description>

    <description>Patients will receive epacadostat at the designated dose level starting the day of radiation therapy, throughout chemotherapy, and until the day of surgery
Epacadostat is taken by mouth twice per day every day of each 21 day cycle
Standard of care preoperative therapy will consist of a total of approximately 20 weeks' preoperative therapy followed by surgery. Breakdown of the 20 weeks of preoperative therapy are as follows:
Short-course pelvic radiation therapy, 5 fractions over 1 week
2 to 3 weeks of break; tumor biopsy will be obtained on or after the last radiation day (D5-8) and before the start of chemotherapy (D21-28)
6 cycles of CAPOX for a total of 18 weeks
surgery will follow approximately 4 to 6 weeks after completion of chemotherapy
CAPOX is typically capecitabine at 1000 mg/m2 PO BID and oxaliplatin 130 mg/m2 IV Q3W. The second cycle of epacadostat will begin when CAPOX starts (so may be more than 21 days long depending on when exactly CAPOX starts).</description>
