      Describe the safety profile of carfilzomib plus dexamethasone regimen (Kd 56 mg/m2 twice
      weekly in cycles 1-6 followed by Kd 70 mg/m2 once weekly in cycles 7-12) in subjects with

    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, multicenter, open-label study in subjects with RRMM in US community
      oncology centers. Subjects with 1-3 prior lines of therapy at study entry are eligible to be
      screened for participation. Subjects refractory to their last line of treatment are eligible
      to participate as long as their last line of treatment did not include a proteasome inhibitor
      (PI). The study will consist of a screening period of up to 28 days for bone marrow
      assessments and up to 21 days for all other assessments, up to 12 cycles of treatment, and a
      30-day safety follow-up period following the last dose of study drug. During the treatment
      period, all subjects will be treated with Kd 20/56 mg/m2 twice weekly for up to six 28-day
      cycles followed by up to Kd 70 mg/m2 once weekly for another six 28-day cycles. After
      discontinuation of study drugs, subjects will be followed for 30 days for safety.

    <ipd_time_frame>Data sharing requests relating to this study will be considered beginning 18 months after the study has ended and either 1) the product and indication have been granted marketing authorization in both the US and Europe or 2) clinical development for the product and/or indication discontinues and the data will not be submitted to regulatory authorities. There is no end date for eligibility to submit a data sharing request for this study.</ipd_time_frame>
    <ipd_access_criteria>Qualified researchers may submit a request containing the research objectives, the Amgen product(s) and Amgen study/studies in scope, endpoints/outcomes of interest, statistical analysis plan, data requirements, publication plan, and qualifications of the researcher(s). In general, Amgen does not grant external requests for individual patient data for the purpose of re-evaluating safety and efficacy issues already addressed in the product labelling. Requests are reviewed by a committee of internal advisors. If not approved, a Data Sharing Independent Review Panel will arbitrate and make the final decision. Upon approval, information necessary to address the research question will be provided under the terms of a data sharing agreement. This may include anonymized individual patient data and/or available supporting documents, containing fragments of analysis code where provided in analysis specifications.
