    <textblock>
      Investigate the acute effect of the steviol glycoside, rebaudioside A, on the glucose
      excursion during an oral glucose tolerance test in 30 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus will be invited for four study visits.
      During the first and third study visit, rebaudioside A or the placebo will be administered.
      During the second and fourth study visit, an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) will be
      executed to measure the response of administration of rebaudioside A versus placebo on the
      glucose homeostasis. The area under the curve blood glucose values during the first two hours
      of the OGTT will be compared for both conditions.

             subject or could impact the outcome of the study results.
