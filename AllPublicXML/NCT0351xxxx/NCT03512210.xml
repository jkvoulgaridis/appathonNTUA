    <textblock>
      This study is being done to see if a minimal monitoring approach is effective and safe when
      providing HCV treatment. The minimal monitoring approach will require fewer study visits and
      lab tests with no medication refills. This study is trying to see whether taking an HCV
      treatment with fewer clinic visits and laboratory tests can cure just as many people as the
      standard approach that uses more visits and laboratory tests. The results of this study will
      be compared with what has been observed in other studies using a standard approach.

        Inclusion Criteria (Step 1):

          -  Ability and willingness of participant to provide informed consent.

          -  Active HCV infection confirmed by a detectable HCV RNA by PCR (HCV RNA &gt;1000
             international units (IU)/ml) within 35 days prior to study entry. HCV RNA must be
             obtained by any FDA-approved test for quantifying HCV RNA at any local laboratory that
             has a CLIA certification, its equivalent, or at any network-approved non-US laboratory
             that operates in accordance with Good Clinical Laboratory Practices (GCLP) and
             participates in appropriate external quality assurance programs. NOTE: HCV NRA can be
             obtained at screening visit.

          -  HCV treatment naïve defined as not having been previously treated for HCV infection
             with any medications approved for the treatment of HCV in any country.

          -  Liver disease stage defined as non-cirrhotic or compensated cirrhotic
             (metric/diagnostic criteria used for fibrosis staging) within 35 days prior to study
             entry as listed below:

        A. FIB-4 &lt;3.25 corresponding to no cirrhosis OR B. FIB-4 ≥3.25 AND Child-Turcotte-Pugh
        (CTP) Score ≤6 indicating CTP Class A corresponding to compensated cirrhotic.

          -  HIV-1 infection status documented as either absent or present, as defined below:

        Absence of HIV-1 infection, as documented by any licensed rapid HIV test or HIV-1 enzyme or
        chemiluminescence immunoassay (E/CIA) test kit, within 60 days prior to entry.

        OR

        HIV-1 infection, documented by any licensed rapid HIV test or HIV-1 E/CIA test kit at any
        time prior to entry and confirmed by a licensed Western blot or a second antibody test by a
        method other than the initial rapid HIV and/or E/CIA, or by HIV-1 antigen or plasma HIV-1
        RNA viral load.

        NOTE: The term &quot;licensed&quot; refers to a US FDA-approved kit, which is recommended. For sites
        that are unable to obtain an FDA-approved kit, a kit that has been certified or licensed by
        an oversight body within the country and validated internally is acceptable.

        WHO and CDC (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) guidelines mandate that
        confirmation of the initial test result must use a test that is different from the one used
        for the initial assessment. A reactive initial rapid test should be confirmed by either
        another type of rapid assay or an E/CIA that is based on a different antigen preparation
        and/or different test principle (e.g., indirect versus competitive), or a Western blot or a
        plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load.

          -  For HIV co-infected participants, HIV-1 RNA obtained within 90 days prior to study
             entry by any US laboratory that has a CLIA certification or its equivalent, or at any
             network-approved non-US laboratory that operates in accordance with Good Clinical
             Laboratory Practices (GCLP) and participates in appropriate external quality assurance
             programs.

          -  HIV co-infected participants must satisfy one of the two criteria listed below:

        A. If a participant is HIV-infected and is taking ART then, plasma HIV RNA &lt;400 copies/mL
        based on criteria listed in protocol AND current ARV regimen does not include efavirenz
        (EFV) AND no exposure to EFV ≤14 days prior to study entry. Any absolute CD4+ count is
        acceptable if this HIV RNA criterion is met.

        NOTE: Any participant on an EFV containing ART regimen during the screening period must be
        switched off EFV and have another regimen, excluding EFV, started at least 14 days prior to
        study entry.

        OR

        B. If a participant is HIV-infected AND not taking ART, absolute CD4+ count must be &gt;350
        cells/µl.

          -  The following laboratory values obtained within 35 days prior to entry by any US
             laboratory that has a CLIA certification or its equivalent, or at any network-approved

             (GCLP) and participates in appropriate external quality assurance programs:

               -  Albumin &gt;3.0 g/L

               -  Hemoglobin &gt;8.0 g/dL for women; &gt;9.0 g/dL for men

               -  Platelet count &gt;50,000/mm3

               -  Calculated creatinine clearance (CrCl) using Cockcroft-Gault method &gt;30 mL/min

               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST/SGOT) &lt;10 times the upper limit of the normal
                  range (ULN)

               -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT/SGPT) &lt;10 times the ULN

               -  Total bilirubin &lt;1.5 times the ULN for participants not on atazanavir (ATV) and
                  &lt;3 times the ULN for participants on ATV

               -  International normalized ratio (INR) &lt;1.5 times the ULN

          -  Female participants of reproductive potential (defined as women who have not been
             post-menopausal for at least 24 consecutive months, i.e., who have had menses within
             the preceding 24 months, or women who have not undergone surgical sterilization,
             specifically hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy or bilateral salpingectomy)
             must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 48 hours prior to study
             entry by any laboratory or clinic that has a CLIA certificate or its equivalent, or is
             using a point-of-care (POC)/CLIA-waived test. The serum, urine or POC pregnancy test
             must have a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL.

          -  All participants of reproductive potential must agree not to participate in a
             conception process (e.g., active attempt to become pregnant or to impregnate, sperm
             donate, in vitro fertilization,) while on study treatment and for 6 weeks after
             stopping protocol-specified medication.

          -  When participating in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy, all participants
             of reproductive potential must agree to use at least one reliable form of
             contraceptive while receiving protocol-specified medication, and for 6 weeks after
             stopping the medication. Such methods include: Condoms (either self or require their
             partner to use one) with or without a spermicidal agent; Diaphragm or cervical cap
             with or without spermicidal agent; Intrauterine device (IUD); Hormone-based
             contraceptive; Tubal ligation.

        NOTE: Providers and participants should be advised that not all contraceptive choices
        listed above can prevent HIV transmission and that some may actually increase the risk of
        HIV acquisition. Study participants who are sexually active with HIV-1 negative or unknown
        HIV-1 serostatus partners should be advised that they need to consider effective strategies
        for reducing the risk of HIV transmission, as well as meeting the requirement for effective
        contraception during their participation in the study. Study participants should discuss
        contraceptive choices and HIV risk reduction methods with their health care provider.

          -  Participants who are not of reproductive potential (women who have been
             post-menopausal for at least 24 consecutive months or have undergone hysterectomy
             and/or bilateral oophorectomy or salpingectomy or men who have documented azoospermia
             or undergone vasectomy) are eligible without requiring the use of contraceptives.
             Acceptable documentation of sterilization and menopause is specified below. Male
             participants do not need to provide information on their female partner's reproductive
             potential.

        following:

          -  Physician report/letter

          -  Operative report or other source documentation in the patient record (a laboratory
             report of azoospermia is required to document successful vasectomy)

          -  Discharge summary

          -  Follicle stimulating hormone-release factor (FSH) measurement elevated into the
             menopausal range as established by the reporting laboratory.
