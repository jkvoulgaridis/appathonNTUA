  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project offers the opportunity to obtain detailed measurements on the health of body
      composition, metabolic health, and intestinal microbial diversity in overweight adults;
      moreover to provide information about the effects of physical exercise on them. The aim of
      the research is to advance in the understanding of the mechanisms induced by physical
      exercise, which includes the measurement of nutritional parameters, clinical and biochemical
      biomarkers of hepatic/cardiometabolic health, as well as the application of differential
      proteomics technologies by means of Arrays of cytokines and intestinal microbiome, making
      this study a novel and pioneer in sensitive areas of primary health care in Latin America.

Exercise will be performed at three sessions per week. All sessions will be supervised by an exercise physiologist during 6-weeks.</description>
