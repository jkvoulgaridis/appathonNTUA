  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine if remote limb ischemic conditioning
      (RLIC) can enhance learning of a motor (balance) and an ecologically valid, complex
      cognitive-motor (driving) task, and increase skeletal muscle strength in
      neurologically-intact young adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ischemic conditioning is an endogenous phenomenon in which exposing a target organ or tissue
      to one or more brief episodes of ischemia results in protection of that organ against
      subsequent ischemia. The effects of ischemic conditioning are not confined within an organ
      but can be can be transferred from one organ to another, a technique called remote ischemic
      conditioning. A clinically feasible method for this is remote limb ischemic conditioning
      (RLIC), where episodes of ischemia and perfusion are induced with a blood pressure cuff
      placed on the arm.

      The overall goal of this line of work is to use ischemic conditioning to enhance learning and
      outcomes in persons with neurologic injuries. Two previous studies have shown that remote
      limb ischemic conditioning (RLIC) can enhance learning a motor task in healthy young adults.
      The current study extends that work to determine if RLIC enhances muscle strength training
      and a complex cognitive-motor task (simulated driving). This Phase I study will yield the
      necessary information to design and execute subsequent trials in neurologic patient
      populations.

            <title>Remote Limb Ischemic Conditioning (RLIC)</title>
            <description>RLIC is achieved via blood pressure cuff inflation to 20 mmHg above systolic blood pressure on the dominant arm. RLIC requires 45 minutes and involves 5 cycles of 5 minutes blood pressure cuff inflation followed by alternating 5 minutes of cuff deflation. RLIC is performed on visits 1-8.
RLIC is delivered for 8 visits. Visits 1-3 occur on consecutive work days and visits 4-8 occur on alternating week days.
Muscle strength training: All participants undergo muscle strength training of the wrist extensor muscles on one side. Strength training follows standard American College of Sports Medicine guidelines for frequency, intensity, progression etc. Strength training is provided at visits 3-8</description>

Sham conditioning requires 45 minutes and involves 5 cycles of 5 minutes blood pressure cuff inflation followed by alternating 5 minutes of cuff deflation. Sham conditioning is performed on visits 1-8.
Sham conditioning is delivered for 8 visits. Visits 1-3 occur on consecutive work days and visits 4-8 occur on alternating week days.
