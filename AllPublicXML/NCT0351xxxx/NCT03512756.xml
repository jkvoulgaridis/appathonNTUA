  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, open-label phase 2/3 trial in metastatic pancreatic cancer subjects who have
      failed two lines of prior systemic therapy. The trial is designed to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of SM-88 used with MPS (methoxsalen, phenytoin and sirolimus) in pancreatic cancer
      and will measure multiple endpoints, including overall survival, progression free survival,
      relevant biomarkers, quality of life, safety, and overall response rate.

      (Part 1 enrollment complete) In the initial stage of the trial (36 subjects), two dose levels
      of SM-88's metyrosine-derivative was evaluated.

      (Part 2 actively enrolling) The second part will consist of a subsequent expansion of the
      trial to further assess safety and efficacy of SM-88 used with MPS containing the selected
      SM-88 RP2D from Part 1. A total of 250 subjects in the second part will be randomized 1:1
      either to the SM-88 arm (125 subjects) or Physician's Choice of therapy for the Control Arm
      (125 subjects). Subjects should have previously received two lines of prior systemic therapy.

        Part 1 enrollment complete

        Biopsy-proven metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma with documented radiographic disease
        progression on or after one or more systemic therapies. Chemotherapy given as part of prior
        chemoradiation in the setting of non-metastatic pancreatic cancer does not count as a line
        of therapy. Chemotherapy given for at least 4 months as adjuvant after complete response is
        considered as a first line therapy.

        Part 2 actively enrolling

        develop within 6 months of completing the chemosensitization. Chemotherapy given for at
        least 4 months as adjuvant after a CR to any therapy (e.g. surgery and radiation therapy)

             Examples include intercurrent illness such as active uncontrolled infection, active or
             chronic bleeding event within 28 days of baseline, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, or

             access, percutaneous feeding tube, or biopsy) within 28 days of the first dose of
             study drug.

         10. Minor surgical procedures within 7 days of baseline, or not yet recovered from any

             porphyria, xeroderma pigmentosum, and albinism.

         28. Subjects treated, or anticipated to be treated, with delavirdine (due to potential for

         29. Subjects with cutaneous melanoma or invasive squamous cell carcinomas or a history
             thereof, except for those in complete remission for ≥5 years (due to contraindication

         30. Subjects with prior organ transplant or being treated, or anticipated to be treated,
             with cyclosporine (because long-term administration of the combination of cyclosporine
             and sirolimus is associated with deterioration of renal function).

         31. Subjects with a seizure disorder that is not well controlled or who have required a
             change in seizure medications within 60 days of enrollment to the trial.

         32. Subjects treated, or anticipated to be treated, with a calcineurin inhibitor (because
             concomitant use of sirolimus and a calcineurin inhibitor increases the risk of
             calcineurin inhibitor-induced hemolytic uremic syndrome/thrombotic thrombocytopenic
             purpura/thrombotic microangiopathy [HUS/TTP/TMA]).

         33. Subjects with interstitial lung disease (ILD) [including pneumonitis, bronchiolitis
             obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), and pulmonary fibrosis].

             (CTCAE Grade 1) using Fredericia's QT correction formula.

         35. A family history of Long QT Syndrome or Torsades de Pointes

         36. Clinically significant cataracts or aphakia.
