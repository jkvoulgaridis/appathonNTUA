  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study has been launched to collect spectral Raman data paired with validated
      glucose reference values in private homes of subjects.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Protocol consists of two parts:

      Part A) Subjects will collect spectral Raman data on device every 15 minutes for 10 hours a
      day for five days. The five days will be distributed within a timeframe of ten days. A Flash
      Glucose Monitor will be used as a comparator. In addition to this, four daily capillary Blood
      Glucose readings will be collected.

      Part B) Subjects will perform four daily measuring sessions in which optical Raman readings
      are paired with capillary Blood Glucose comparator. Measuring sessions are performed in
      subjects' own home while maintaining usual diabetes management routines. Subjects will
      collect data for 30 days during a 60 days' period.

    <description>Optical glucose data will be collected together with paired reference values (BGM and FGM, Protocol 1 and BGM, Subprotocol 2).
For subprotocol 1, measurements will be collected every 15 minutes for 10 hours a day for 5 days distributed over a period of 10 days.
For subprotocol 2, four daily measurements will be collected while subject is maintaining normal routines. Data will be collected for 30 days distributed over a period of 60 days.
Optical glucose readings will be masked to the subjects.
Collected data will be used to generate individual calibration models capable of predicting tissue glucose. Models will be validated on independent data sets using MARD and ISUP measures.</description>
