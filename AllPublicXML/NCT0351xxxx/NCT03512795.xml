  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The analysis of HIV resistance to antiretrovirals (Sanger sequencing on RNA) is difficult
      when the viral load is undetectable or during therapeutic breaks. In these situations, the
      ultra-deep sequencing (UDS) can be done on proviral DNA in order to improve characterization
      of archived resistant variants with may reflect past virological failures.

      This study is a cross-sectional study which will require only one additional tube which can
      be taken during a routine check-up as part of the usual follow-up of the individuals
      included.

          -  Adult patient

          -  Patient living with HIV-1

          -  Controlled viral load (&lt;50 RNA copies/ml) for at least 1 year.

               -  A rebound in HIV viral load to more than 50 copies/ml after a period of
                  virological success, confirmed on two consecutive samples at least one month
                  apart.
