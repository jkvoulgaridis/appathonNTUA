    <measure>Percentage of Participants With a ≥1-point Increase (Improvement) on the Evaluating Investigator's (EI's) Assessed 5-point Lip Fullness Scale (LFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Month 3 Post Last Treatment (JUVÉDERM® VOLBELLA® XC with Lidocaine arm) or Month 3 Post Randomization (No-treatment Control arm)</time_frame>
    <description>The investigator assessed the participant's lip fullness using the 5-point LFS where: 0=Minimal (Flat or nearly flat contour, minimal red lip show), 1=Mild (Some red lip show; no lower lip pout), 2=Moderate (Moderate red lip show with slight lower lip pout), 3=Marked (Significant red lip show and lower lip pout), and 4=Very Marked (Very significant red lip show, lower lip pout, and upper lip pout). Improvement was defined as a ≥1-point increase in fullness from Baseline. Number analyzed is the number of participants with data available for analysis at Baseline and Month 3.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to Month 3 Post Treatment ( JUVÉDERM® VOLBELLA® XC with Lidocaine arm) or Month 3 Post Randomization (No-treatment Control arm)</time_frame>
    <description>Overall lip volume was measured by 3-dimensional (3D) photography images. A positive change from Baseline indicates improvement. Number analyzed is the number of participants with data available for analysis at Baseline and Month 3.</description>

    <measure>Percentage Change From Baseline in Lip Surface Area</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Month 3 Post Treatment ( JUVÉDERM® VOLBELLA® XC with Lidocaine arm) or Month 3 Post Randomization (No-treatment Control arm)</time_frame>

    <measure>Procedural Pain Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 30 days after initial treatment with JUVÉDERM® VOLBELLA® XC with Lidocaine</time_frame>
    <description>Procedural pain (pain during injection) was evaluated by the participant using an 11-point scale, where: 0=No pain to 10=Worst pain imaginable. Participants recorded procedural pain in safety diary for 30 days after initial treatment. Number analyzed is the number of participants with safety diary data available for analysis.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Injection Site Responses (ISRs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 30 days after each treatment with JUVÉDERM® VOLBELLA® XC with Lidocaine</time_frame>
    <description>ISRs were recorded by the participant in a safety diary for 30 days after each treatment and were summarized by treatment (initial and touch-up). ISRs were defined as redness, pain after injection, tenderness to touch, firmness, swelling, lumps/bumps, bruising, itching and discoloration. Number analyzed is the number of participants with safety diary data available for analysis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Month 12 Post Treatment</time_frame>
    <description>An Adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or a participant using an investigational drug, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. A TEAE is an AE that occurred after receiving the first dose of study device or study injection or an AE present prior to first dose but increased in severity during the Treatment Period.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</title>
        <description>An Adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or a participant using an investigational drug, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. A TEAE is an AE that occurred after receiving the first dose of study device or study injection or an AE present prior to first dose but increased in severity during the Treatment Period.</description>
