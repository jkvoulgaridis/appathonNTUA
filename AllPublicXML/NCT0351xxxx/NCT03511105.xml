  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to investigate the effect of GSK2798745 on
      alveolar-septal barrier permeability following LPS challenge in healthy subjects. The influx
      of protein-rich fluid into the lung due to damage to the alveolar capillary barrier, with
      resultant adverse effects on respiratory function, is a fundamental underlying defect in
      Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). In this Phase 1, proof-of-mechanism study, a LPS
      challenge will be used as a surrogate injury model to investigate the effects of Transient
      receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) channel blockade on alveolar-septal barrier
      permeability in man. This is a randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel group, double-blind
      (sponsor-open), segmental LPS challenge study of GSK2798745 in healthy subjects. Subjects
      will be randomised in a ratio of 1:1 to take 2 single doses of either 4.8 milligrams
      GSK2798745 followed by 2.4 milligrams GSK2798745 after 12 hours or a dose of placebo followed
      by another dose of placebo after 12 hours. The first dose will be administered on Day 1 at 2
      hours before Baseline bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) sampling from a segment in the left lower
      lobe of lung. LPS 4 nanogram per kilogram will subsequently be instilled into the right
      middle segment and saline control into the lingula segment of the contralateral side. The
      second dose of study treatment will be administered 10 hours after LPS challenge followed by
      post-dose BAL sampling on Day 2. Each subject will take approximately 5 weeks to complete the
      study.

    <measure>Baseline Adjusted Total Protein Concentration in Broncho-alveolar (BAL) Samples at 24 Hours After Segmental LPS Challenge (26 Hours Post-first Dose)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at 26 hours post-first dose</time_frame>
    <description>Participants underwent segmental challenge to lungs, via bronchoscopy, at 2 hours after first dose of investigational medicinal product. BAL samples were taken, via bronchoscopy and total protein was measured. Baseline (2 hours) samples were taken immediately before the LPS and saline challenges, from a segment in the left lower lobe, and post-challenge samples were taken at 24 hours (26 hours post-first dose) after the LPS and saline challenges, from the challenged segments. Evaluable Population consists of all participants for whom results of the primary analysis can be determined i.e. all randomized participants who received two correct doses of study treatment, received LPS and saline segmental challenge (in contralateral lobes) and for which results of both baseline (2 hours) and LPS lobe (26 hours) BAL samples are evaluable. This population will be based on treatment the participant actually received. Median and 95% credible interval (CrI) has been presented.</description>

        <description>Participants underwent segmental challenge to lungs, via bronchoscopy, at 2 hours after first dose of investigational medicinal product. BAL samples were taken, via bronchoscopy and total protein was measured. Baseline (2 hours) samples were taken immediately before the LPS and saline challenges, from a segment in the left lower lobe, and post-challenge samples were taken at 24 hours (26 hours post-first dose) after the LPS and saline challenges, from the challenged segments. Evaluable Population consists of all participants for whom results of the primary analysis can be determined i.e. all randomized participants who received two correct doses of study treatment, received LPS and saline segmental challenge (in contralateral lobes) and for which results of both baseline (2 hours) and LPS lobe (26 hours) BAL samples are evaluable. This population will be based on treatment the participant actually received. Median and 95% credible interval (CrI) has been presented.</description>

        <title>Baseline Adjusted Total Cell Count of Neutrophils in BAL Samples at 24 Hours After Segmental LPS Challenge (26 Hours Post-first Dose)</title>
        <description>Participants underwent segmental challenge to the lungs, via bronchoscopy, at 2 hours (Baseline) after the first dose of investigational medicinal product. BAL samples were taken, via bronchoscopy and total neutrophil cell count was measured. Baseline samples were taken immediately before the LPS and saline challenges, from a segment in the left lower lobe, and post-challenge samples were taken at 24 hours (26 hours post-first dose) after the LPS and saline challenges, from the challenged segments. Median and 95% CrI at indicated time point has been presented.</description>

        <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability, is a congenital anomaly/ birth effect and other important medical events. All Subjects Population consists of all randomized participants who received at least one dose of study treatment. This population was based on the treatment the participant actually received. SAEs and non-SAEs were analyzed up to follow-up or early withdrawal (FU/EW) of Day 9.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Urine Potential of Hydrogen (pH)</title>
        <description>Urine samples were collected for measurement of urine pH at indicated time points. pH is a measure of hydrogen ion concentration and used to determine the acidity or alkalinity of urine. pH is measured on a numeric scale ranging from 0 to 14; values on the scale refer to the degree of alkalinity or acidity. A pH of 7 is neutral. A pH less than 7 is acidic, and a pH greater than 7 is basic. Baseline values were defined as the latest pre-treatment assessment with a non-missing value. Change from Baseline value is calculated as the value at the post-dose visit minus the Baseline value.</description>

        <description>Urine samples were collected for the analysis of urine specific gravity. Urine specific gravity is a measure of the concentration of solutes in the urine and provides information on the kidney's ability to concentrate urine. The dipstick test gives results in a semi-quantitative manner. Baseline values were defined as the latest pre-treatment assessment with a non-missing value. Change from Baseline value is calculated as the value at the post-dose visit minus the Baseline value.</description>

The second dose of a single tablet of 2.4 mg GSK2798745 was administered 10 hours after LPS and saline challenge.</description>
