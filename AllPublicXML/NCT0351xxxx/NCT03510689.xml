    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this study is to use patient-centered in vitro and in vivo models to
      answer the fundamental question of whether or not pathogenic mutations in BRCA1/2 result in
      an increased risk of CV disease

    <intervention_name>Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing</intervention_name>
    <description>A cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET, also called V02 test) will be completed at each study time point utilizing a standard clinical protocol, on either a stationary bike or treadmill. The purpose of this test is to estimate maximal oxygen consumption (V02 max) as in index of cardiopulmonary fitness. Resting ECG, heart rate, and BP will be obtained prior to beginning the test, during each stage of the test and for 5 minutes after the test is stopped.</description>

    <description>We will obtain blood samples (approximately 16mL) at baseline and (approximately 12mL) at each follow-up visit. Typically these will be drawn via peripheral venipuncture, however if patients have a port-a-cath in place, blood may be drawn from the port instead.</description>

          -  Non-carriers will have been treated with an anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimen;
             carriers may or may not have been treated with an anthracycline-based chemotherapy
             regimen.

          -  Stage IV Breast Cancer

          -  Genetic testing confirming a variant of unknown significance (VUS) or benign
             polymorphism in BRCA1 or BRCA2

          -  V02 Testing contraindicated for any reason, including:

               -  Myocardial infarction (within past 3 months)

               -  Any other condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, may impede testing
                  of the study hypothesis or make it unsafe to engage in the V02 test

          -  Women who are pregnant

          -  Any other clinically significant medical disease or condition that, in the
             investigator's opinion, may interfere with protocol adherence or a subject's ability
             to give informed consent
