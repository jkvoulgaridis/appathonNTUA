      Phase 2, open label study of bermekimab in patients with moderate to severe Hidradenitis
      Suppurativa. The study is multicenter and will consist of two patient groups, each of which
      will receive a total of 13 X 400mg weekly subcutaneous injections of bermekimab: Group A
      (n=10) patients who have failed anti-TNF therapy, and Group B (n=10) patients who have had no
      prior treatment with biological agents that block TNF.

      Patients will be followed for 13 weeks to allow for assessment of safety and preliminary
      efficacy.

      Additionally, patients who had received the 200 mg weekly subcutaneous injections of
      bermekimab under the previous version of this protocol are eligible to begin receiving the
      400 mg dose starting with his/her next scheduled visit, and for the remainder of his/her
      treatment plan.
