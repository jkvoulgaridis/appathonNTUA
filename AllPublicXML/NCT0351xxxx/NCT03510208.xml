    <textblock>
      The phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of panitumumab-IRDye800 in
      diagnosing participants with malignant glioma who undergo surgery. Panitumumab-IRDye800 can
      attach to tumor cells and make them more visible using a special camera during surgery, which
      may help surgeons better distinguish tumor cells from normal brain tissue and identify small
      tumors that cannot be seen using current imaging methods.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine/verify the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of panitumumab conjugated to the
      optical dye IRDye800CW (panitumumab-IRDye800), as an imaging agent in patients undergoing
      surgery for malignant glioma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the efficacy of panitumumab IRDye800 in identifying malignant glioma compared to
      surrounding normal central nervous system tissue.

      II. Determine whether a loading dose of panitumumab is necessary to achieve an effective
      tumor-to-background ratio.

      III. Determine the optimal timing of the surgical procedure to maximize the
      tumor-to-background ratio.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose escalation study of panitumumab-IRDye800 followed by a phase
      II study.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Panitumumab Loading Dose</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>The fluorescence intensity of tissue obtained from patients undergoing surgery will be evaluated as an indicator of whether or not the loading dose of panitumumab is necessary to achieve an effective tumor-to-background ratio (TBR). The Fluorescence intensity of tissue will be assessed on the specimens collected on the day of surgery (Day 1-5 Post infusion), in group a vs group b, for Cohorts 1 and 2, in order to determine the tumor-to-background ratio (TBR). The outcome will be expressed as TBR by group and cohort. TBR will be reported as means +/- STD.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Optimal Timing of Surgical Procedure</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The fluorescence intensity of tissue collected at surgery will be measured 1 to 5 days after infusion, and the outcome will be assessed as highest daily mean tumor-to-background ratio (TBR), with standard deviation. The tissue analysis to obtain the outcome data will occur within 1 year from surgery.</description>
