  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK),
      pharmacodynamics (PD) and preliminary efficacy of FPA150, an anti-B7H4 antibody alone or in
      combination with pembrolizumab an anti-PD1 antibody in patients with advanced solid tumors.
      The Phase 1a, open-label, cohort will identify a recommended dose of FPA150 to use for Phase
      1a Combination (FPA150 and Pembrolizumab) Safety Lead-in and for Phase 1b monotherapy
      cohorts.

      This is a Phase 1a/1b open-label, multicenter study to evaluate the dosing, safety,
      tolerability, PK, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary efficacy of FPA150 as monotherapy and in
      combination with pembrolizumab, an anti-PD1 antibody, in patients with advanced solid tumors.

      This study includes a Phase 1a FPA150 Monotherapy Dose Escalation, Phase 1a Monotherapy Dose
      Exploration, Phase 1a combination Safety Lead-in (FPA150 + pembrolizumab), a Phase 1b FPA150
      Monotherapy Dose Expansion, and a Phase 1b combination Dose Expansion (FPA150 +
      pembrolizumab).

      The Phase 1a Monotherapy Dose Escalation will include an initial accelerated titration design
      followed by a standard 3+3 dose escalation design until the MTD and/or RD for Phase 1b is
      determined. The Phase 1a combination Safety Lead-In will start enrolling once the FPA150
      monotherapy RD is identified in Phase 1a monotherapy dose escalation and will continue until
      the FPA150 MTD/RD in combination is identified. Phase 1a FPA150 monotherapy Dose Exploration
      may include cohorts that may enroll beyond 3 patients whose tumors express high levels of
      B7-H4 protein and/or have varying levels of B7H4 expression including low (&lt;10% IHC 2+ or 3+
      scores) or no expression on their tumor cells (up to 20 additional patients across all dose
      levels) to further evaluate safety, PK, pharmacodynamics, and clinical activity at that dose
      (to be conditional upon the dose level clearing DLT criteria).

      Phase 1b will be the Dose Expansion (monotherapy and combination) portion of the study.

      Enrollment into Phase 1b Dose Expansion will begin after identification of the MTD and/or RD
      in Phase 1a (monotherapy and Safety Lead-in). Preliminary efficacy will be evaluated in Phase
      1b in planned expansion cohorts that include patients with specific tumor types that are
      B7-H4+ advanced solid tumors.
