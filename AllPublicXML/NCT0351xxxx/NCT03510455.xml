  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      People with tumor-induced osteomalacia (TIO) have small tumors that may cause low blood
      phosphorus, weak muscles, bone pain, and broken bones. The tumors may be so small they are
      hard to find or impossible to remove. Researchers want to test a drug that may help treat
      TIO.

      Objective:

      To see how the drug BGJ398 affects people with tumor-induced osteomalacia.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 18-85 who are in NIH protocol 01-D-0184 and have TIO that cannot be found or
      easily removed

      Design:

      At every study visit, participants will have:

        -  Medical history

        -  Physical exam

        -  Blood and urine tests

        -  Questions about their health and fatigue

      At the screening visit, participants will also have a heart and eye tests. They may have
      other tests to find their tumor.

      The baseline visit will be a 1-week stay in the clinic. Participants will have the regular
      study tests, plus:

        -  Their first dose of the study drug capsules

        -  Blood and urine collected every 2-4 hours for 24 hours. A thin plastic tube will be
           inserted in a vein to collect blood.

        -  Heart and kidney ultrasounds

        -  Activities that test strength

        -  6-minute walk test

      Participants will take the study drug for six 1-month cycles. In each cycle, participants
      will:

        -  Take the study drug every day for 3 weeks. Not take it for 1 week.

        -  Have 1 visit. Participants will collect their urine for 24 hours and have their blood
           drawn. Participants will have the regular study tests and repeat some baseline tests.

        -  Have blood and urine tests at their local lab.

      Participants will have 1 visit at the end of the last cycle and another 3 months later....

      Background:

        -  Tumor-induced osteomalacia (TIO) is a rare disorder in which fibroblast growth factor
           (FGF23)-producing neoplasms cause renal phosphate wasting and skeletal disease.

        -  Recent studies have shown that chromosomal translocations causing a fibronectin-FGFR1
           (FN1/FGFR1) fusion gene have been identified in 40-60% of these tumors.

        -  BGJ398 is an orally bio-available, selective and ATP competitive pan-fibroblast growth
           factor receptor (FGFR) kinase inhibitor which has demonstrated anti-tumor activity in
           preclinical, in vitro and in-vivo tumor models harboring FGFR genetic alterations.

      Objectives:

      To induce complete metabolic response in subjects with tumor-induced osteomalacia (TIO) with
      BGJ-398 as demonstrated by normalization of FGF23 and phosphate homeostasis.

      Eligibility:

      Patients may be eligible if they:

        -  Are adults 18-85 years with documented evidence of TIO due to a non-localized or
           unresectable tumor, or metastatic disease, or resectable tumor that cannot be easily
           removed.

        -  Are not taking any exclusionary medications or foods that may interfere with BGJ398.

        -  Are not pregnant or nursing and are willing to use contraception (at least two forms of
           contraception), if able to become pregnant.

        -  Have no significant ophthalmologic, gastrointestinal, renal, or hematologic disease.

      Design:

        -  Phase 2, open-label, non-randomized, single-arm, drug treatment trial.

        -  10 subjects to be studied.

        -  Treatment duration 6 months with 3 months off drug follow-up and optional extension
           phase.

        -  Monthly NIH visits with additional labs obtained in between visits.

        -  Imaging performed in those with identifiable tumors.

        -  Analyses to include repeated measures ANOVA assessing changes in biochemical indices
           over time in response to BGJ398.

                            of spontaneous amenorrhea with serum FSH &gt;40 mIU/ml or 6 weeks

                            taking drug and for 3 months after the last dose of the study drug and
                            should not father a child in this period. A condom is required to be
                            used also by vasectomized men in order to prevent delivery of the drug
                            via seminal fluid.

                         -  Patients with TIO who are currently taking BGJ398 or have been treated
                            with BGJ398 in the past are eligible to participate in this study,
                            provided that they discontinue BGJ398 for 2 weeks prior to the baseline
                            visit.
