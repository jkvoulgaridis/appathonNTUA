  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a non-interventional, observational, prospective, and global participant data
      registry. The study will collect effectiveness and safety data from approximately 1000
      participants with liver cancers treated with TheraSphere® in a real-life setting from
      multiple centers globally. The absorbed dose to tumor and normal tissue will be calculated
      using the Simplicit90Y™ software in the subgroup of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
      participants.

      This study is a non-interventional, observational, prospective and global participant data
      registry.

      Approximately 1000 participants with liver cancers who are treated with TheraSphere® will be
      enrolled.

      Data regarding participant and treatment characteristics (TheraSphere® and other anti-cancer
      treatments) will be collected within a 12-month period post TheraSphere® administration to:

        -  Assess treatment effectiveness and safety in a real-life administration setting

        -  Identify prognostic and predictive factors for liver cancer participants receiving
           TheraSphere® treatment

      Data for dosimetry determination will be collected on approximately 300 HCC participants to
      assess:

        -  Technetium-99m Macroaggregated albumin (99mTc-MAA) normal tissue and tumor Absorbed Dose
           using pre-procedural Single Proton Emission Computed Tomography/ Computed Tomography
           (SPECT/CT)

        -  Yttrium-90 and isotopes (Y90) normal tissue and tumor Absorbed Dose using
           post-procedural PET/CT (or equivalent for Asia) scans
