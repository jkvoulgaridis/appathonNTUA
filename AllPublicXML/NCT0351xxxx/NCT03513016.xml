      injection of UBX0101 in patients diagnosed with painful osteoarthritis of the knee.

      This study is a phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled single ascending dose
      study that will evaluate safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of UBX0101 in patients
      diagnosed with painful femoro-tibial osteoarthritis. The study consists of 2 parts: Part A is
      a single ascending dose study, whereas Part B is a single-dose study at a dose that has been
      determined to be safe and tolerable in Part A of the study.

      In Part A, subjects will be randomly allocated to receive UBX0101 or placebo in 3:1
      randomization by dose level (cohort), whereas in Part B subjects will be randomly allocated
      to receive UBX0101 or placebo in a 2:1 randomization.

      The primary objective is to establish the safety and tolerability of UBX0101 given as a
      single intra-articular injection into the femoro-tibial joint of patients with
      osteoarthritis.
