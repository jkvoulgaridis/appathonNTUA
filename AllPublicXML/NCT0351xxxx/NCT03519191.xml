    <textblock>
      The California Adolescent Health Collaborative (CAHC) brings together multiple nonprofit
      organizations in California's Central Valley to implement the Healthy Relationships and
      Economic Pathways (H-REP) program, which aims to increase and promote healthy relationships
      and stability among youth between the ages of 14 and 24.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research project was designed to explore three core questions (RQs).

      Research Question 1:Does assignment to the HRE improve the knowledge and skills necessary to
      develop and maintain caring and supportive personal and professional relationships among
      youth between the ages of 18 and 24 in Stanislaus and Merced Counties?

      In addition, American Institutes for Research (AIR), an independent evaluator, has been asked
      to answer two supplemental RQs:

      Research Question 2: Does participation in the HRE Technology Boot Camp improve technological
      knowledge and skills as well as awareness of professional and educational opportunities among
      youth between the ages of 18 and 24?

      Research Question 3: Does HRE have the same effect on relationship knowledge and skills for
      youth between the ages of 18 and 24 who participate in the HRE-only training as it does for
      youth who participate in HRE plus Technology Bootcamp?

      H-REP provides a comprehensive, three-pathway program of services to (a) students in
      traditional, comprehensive high schools; (b) students in continuation of alternative schools
      (e.g. court schools); and (c) youth between the ages of 18 and 24 who are receiving
      employment support services from Central Valley nonprofit programs. The H-REP program
      involves formal classes in Healthy Relationship Education (HRE) and technology use, case
      management, and job skills training.
