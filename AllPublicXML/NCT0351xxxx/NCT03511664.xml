  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to compare overall survival (OS) in patients with
      progressive PSMA-positive mCRPC who receive 177Lu-PSMA-617 in addition to best
      supportive/best standard of care versus patients treated with best supportive/best standard
      of care alone.

      Key secondary objectives are an arm-to-arm comparison of the following:

        -  Radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS)

        -  Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) response

        -  Time to a first symptomatic skeletal event (SSE)

      Additional Secondary Objectives:

        -  Safety and tolerability of 177Lu-PSMA-617

        -  Health-related quality of life (HRQoL; EQ-5D-5L, FACT-P and Brief Pain Inventory - Short
           Form (BPI-SF))

        -  Health economics

        -  Progression-free survival (PFS) (radiographic, clinical, or prostate-specific antigen
           [PSA] progression-free survival)

        -  Biochemical response as measured by PSA. Alkaline phosphatase [ALP] levels and lactate
           dehydrogenase [LDH] levels will also be measured.

      Patients with PSMA positive scans will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either
      177Lu-PSMA-617 plus best supportive/best standard of care or to receive best supportive/best
      standard of care only. Best supportive/best standard of care will be determined by the
      treating physician/investigator but will exclude investigational agents, cytotoxic
      chemotherapy, other systemic radioisotopes, and hemi-body radiotherapy. Novel androgen axis
      drugs [NAADs] (such as abiraterone or enzalutamide) are allowed.

      The study is open-label and patients will be monitored throughout the 6 to 10-month treatment
      period for survival, disease progression, and adverse events.

      A long-term follow-up period will include the collection of survival and treatment updates,
      adverse events assessment, as well as blood for hematology and chemistry testing. During
      follow-up, patients will be contacted every 3 months (±1 month) via phone, email, or letter
      for 24 months or until the the overall censoring rate for survival reduces to a level
      identified in the SAP.

      An End of Treatment visit should occur once a patient is to enter the long term follow up.
      This visit should occur approximately 30 days from the last dose of 177Lu-PSMA-617 or best
      supportive/best standard of care, but before the initiation of subsequent anti-cancer
      treatment, outside of what is allowed on study.

      The planned enrollment for this study is 750 patients.

             Strontium-89, Samarium-153, Rhenium-186, Rhenium-188, Radium-223, hemi-body
             irradiation. Previous PSMA-targeted radioligand therapy is not allowed.

          2. Any systemic anti-cancer therapy (e.g. chemotherapy, immunotherapy or biological
             therapy [including monoclonal antibodies]) within 28 days prior to day of

          7. Patients with a history of CNS metastases must have received therapy (surgery,
             radiotherapy, gamma knife) and be neurologically stable, asymptomatic, and not
             receiving corticosteroids for the purposes of maintaining neurologic integrity.
             Patients with epidural disease, canal disease and prior cord involvement are eligible
             if those areas have been treated, are stable, and not neurologically impaired. For
             patients with parenchymal CNS metastasis (or a history of CNS metastasis), baseline
             and subsequent radiological imaging must include evaluation of the brain (MRI
             preferred or CT with contrast).

             heart failure, history of congenital prolonged QT syndrome, uncontrolled infection,
             known active hepatitis B or C, or other significant co-morbid conditions that in the
             opinion of the investigator would impair study participation or cooperation.

         11. Diagnosed with other malignancies that are expected to alter life expectancy or may
             interfere with disease assessment. However, patients with a prior history of
             malignancy that has been adequately treated and who have been disease free for more
             than 3 years are eligible, as are patients with adequately treated non-melanoma skin
             cancer, superficial bladder cancer.
