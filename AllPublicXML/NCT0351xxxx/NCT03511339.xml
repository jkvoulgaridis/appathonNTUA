  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to quantify the clinical safety and efficacy of head and neck
      cooling when applied up to 8 days after mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) among adolescents
      participating in sporting activities.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, prospective, randomized, non-blinded, dual-arm comparator study that
      will include two-phases, the 60-patient pilot study (30 patients in the treatment arm and 30
      patients in the control arm) followed by a pivotal study (up to 200 patients in the treatment
      and control arm combined) for a total of up to 260 patients overall in both phases. The pilot
      study will serve as an opportunity to assess the protocol and make adjustments, if necessary.
      In addition, descriptive statistics including effect size will be calculated and the safety
      of the device will be assessed at the conclusion of the pilot study.

      Subjects will be assigned to study arm based on a block randomization schedule generated a
      priori.

      The study sponsor believes that the device and therapeutic treatment that will be evaluated
      in this study is a non-significant risk (NSR) to the subjects.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The SCAT5 overall score will be collected at the initial visit in the Sports Medicine Clinic, and compared to follow-up visits throughout the study, with the objective of demonstrating better outcomes in the treatment group compared to the control group.</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from initial visit to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Formal statistical hypothesis testing will be employed in the evaluation of this endpoint.
Additionally, comparisons between treatment groups on the baseline SCAT5 (SCAT5-PRE) will be performed at initial visit (as reported by subject) and at each follow-up (72 hours, 10 days, and 4 weeks) separately to evaluate the time trend in recovery. Individual SCAT5 symptoms, each scored on a scale of 0-6, will also be summarized and compared by treatment group to investigate the effect of treatment on specific symptoms. These comparisons are intended to provide additional information on the pattern of recovery and are not attached to intended labeling claims; however, statistical testing of these endpoints will be accompanied by adjustment for multiplicity using the Hochberg-Holm method.</description>
