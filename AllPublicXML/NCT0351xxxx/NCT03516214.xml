      The aim of this trial is to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/recommended phase II
      dose (RP2D), to define pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters and the preliminary efficacy of a
      continuous treatment with EGF816 and trametinib in locally advanced or metastatic (stage IIIB
      or IV) lung cancer patients with activating mutations in the epithelial growth factor
      receptor (EGFR).

      The population of interest for this trial is defined by patients with non-small cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC) harbouring the sensitizing EGFR mutations del19 or p.L858R. Patients may be
      enrolled in first- or later lines of therapy and independently of the prior (approved) EGFR
      inhibitor administered and independently of the EGFR p.T790M-status. Those individuals whose
      tumors harbour high-level amplifications of MET or other EGFR mutations except for del19,
      p.L858R or p.T790M will be excluded from the trial. The molecular status must have been
      determined in a biopsy collected at progression to the last systemic and prior to the
      initiation of the trial treatment

      The aim of the trial is to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/recommended phase II
      dose (RP2D) for a continuous treatment with the 3rd generation EGFR inhibitor EGF816 and the
      MEK inhibitor trametinib.

      The recommendations for dose level escalations will be based on an &quot;up-and-down&quot; design
      proposed by Storer, 1989. The dose limiting toxicity (DLT) period comprises the first 28 days
      of treatment with EGF816 and trametinib at the designated dose level (Cycle 1).

      PK parameters of the combination treatment will be assessed for every dose level in every
      patient during the dose-escalation part.

      Preliminary efficacy of EGF816 and trametinib in the trial population will be assessed by
      RECIST (v1.1) analysis of scheduled CT scans (every 8 weeks or as clinically indicated.

      Throughout the study blood samples will be collected to monitor cell free plasma DNA (cfDNA).

      Patients who develop resistance upon treatment with the study drugs will undergo a rebiopsy
      to identify potential mechanisms of resistance.
