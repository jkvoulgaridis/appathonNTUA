        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects must be receiving treatment in an ICU or in an acute care setting (e.g.,
             Emergency Room, Recovery Room).

          2. Subjects with either compelling evidence of infection OR clinical syndromes highly
             likely to be bacterial in origin, as follows (Please refer to Appendix B):

               1. Compelling objective evidence of bacterial infection and a known site of
                  infection: Objective evidence would be met with a grossly purulent site of
                  infections, Gram stain evidence, confirming a bacterial pathogen from normally
                  sterile fluids (blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), peritoneal fluid, etc.),
                  having either:

                    -  White Blood Cell (WBC) count greater &gt; 12,000/mm3 or &lt; 4,000/mm3 or &gt; 10%
                       bands within 36 hours of randomization OR

                    -  Temperature &lt;36°C or fever &gt;38°C

               2. Clinical syndromes highly likely to be bacterial in origin but not compelling

                    -  White Blood Cell (WBC) count greater &gt; 12,000/mm3 or &lt; 4,000/mm3 or &gt; 10%
                       bands within 36 hours of randomization AND

                    -  Temperature &lt;36°C or fever &gt;38°C

          3. Current treatment with intravenous antibiotics for the acute bacterial infection (i.e.
             not prophylactic antibiotics)

          4. Subjects with sepsis-associated organ dysfunction defined by at least one of the
             following:

               1. Cardiovascular Dysfunction defined as requiring both adequate fluid resuscitation
                  and vasopressors* to maintain Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) greater than or equal
                  to (≥) 65 mmHg (implies fluid resuscitation alone does not raise MAP to ≥ 65
                  mmHg), with onset time being the time of vasopressors are initiated (end of
                  surgery if initiated in surgery), with adequate fluid resuscitation defined as:

                  • Intravenous administration of at least 20 mL/kg crystalloid or 10 mL/kg colloid
                  infusion within 6 hours.

                  OR

                  Wedge Pressure (PAWP) of greater than (&gt;) 12 mmHg.

                    -  If dopamine is the only vasopressor used, the infusion rate must be greater
                       than (&gt;) 5 μg/kg/min (i.e., must be prescribed to support cardio-pulmonary
                       perfusion). If vasopressin is used, it must be given in conjunction with
                       another vasopressor.

               2. Respiratory Dysfunction is defined as the acute need for mechanical ventilation
                  and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of &lt;250 (or &lt; 200 when lung is the site of infection) with
                  onset time being time of intubation prior to first qualifying PaO2:FiO2 (if
                  intubated for surgery and unable to extubate the qualifying time is the end of
                  surgery), with mechanical ventilation defined as any type of ventilation
                  administered via an endotracheal or nasotracheal tube.

          5. Subjects with coagulopathy characterized by an INR &gt;1.40 without other known etiology
             (e.g., anticoagulant therapy, chronic liver disease), and having an onset at the time
             of the first blood draw yielding a qualifying result (point of care device INR results
             must be confirmed by local laboratory).

          6. Subjects with coagulopathy characterized by platelet count that meets any of the below
             criteria, and having an onset at the time of the first blood draw yielding a
             qualifying result.

               1. ≥ 20,000/mm3 and ≤ 30,000/mm3 that upon retesting after platelet transfusion is &gt;
                  30,000/mm3 (qualifying at the time of the first blood draw yielding a result ≥
                  20,000/mm3 and ≤ 30,000/mm3)

               2. &gt; 30,000/mm3 to &lt; 150,000/mm3

               3. &gt; 30% decrease in platelet count within 24 hours

          7. First and last qualifying criteria of sepsis associated organ dysfunction (as defined
             in Inclusion #4), platelet count and INR occurring in ≤ 24 hours

             malformation)

         14. Gastrointestinal bleeding (e.g., melena, hematemesis) or genitourinary bleeding within

             anticoagulants exceeding thromboprophylaxis doses within 72 hours prior to the first
             dose of study drug (see Appendix D for more detail)

         17. Acute liver failure not due to sepsis, sepsis associated acute liver failure in any
             patient with a history of cirrhosis, Class C Chronic liver disease (Child-Pugh score
