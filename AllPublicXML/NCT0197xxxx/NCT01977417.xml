  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prediabetes, characterized by elevated fasting blood sugar or exaggerated blood sugar
      response to sugar ingestion, effects over 79 million adult Americans and is a precursor to
      the development of Type 2 diabetes. Importantly, approximately 42% of Iowans (950,000) have
      diabetes and 32% (670,000) have prediabetes with the majority of those with prediabetes going
      undiagnosed. Adults with prediabetes demonstrate early signs of cardiovascular and nervous
      system abnormalities and are at high risk for developing overt diabetes unless aggressive
      lifestyle (weight loss, exercise) or pharmacological interventions are employed.
      Interestingly, data in recent years has linked obesity and diabetes to chronic inflammation
      of the blood vessels and brain areas that regulate blood pressure. Therefore, the current
      study will test whether a commonly used aspirin-like anti-inflammatory drug called salsalate,
      will improve blood vessel health and nervous system dysfunction in adults with prediabetes.
      Eligible subjects will have measurements of blood pressure, blood vessel function in the arms
      and eyes, assessments of nerve activity, and blood samples taken before and after 4 weeks of
      ingesting an FDA approved aspirin-like drug called salsalate. The study is important because
      it will identify a potentially new pharmacological strategy to treat vascular and nervous
      system abnormalities in overweight and obese adults with early stage type 2 diabetes using an
      inexpensive, generically available drug with an excellent safety record that has been used
      for decades to treat chronic inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. If proven
      effective, this will provide preliminary support for the concept of targeting inflammation as
      a new clinical approach to treating early diabetes related complications. Furthermore, the
      current pilot study will provide support for developing a larger clinical trial using
      salsalate that could potentially then be extended to patients with type 2 diabetes and
      cardiovascular disease, as well as lead to the development of new anti-inflammatory agents
      with greater specificity for selective inflammatory pathways.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 30 healthy men and women ages 18-79 years who are obese defined as body mass index
      (BMI) of 30 kg/m2 or greater and with prediabetes (defined as fasting blood glucose between
      100-126 mg/dl, a fasting blood glucose of 140-199 mg/dl at 120 min during an oral glucose
      tolerance test; or HbA1C of 6-6.5%) will be enrolled and randomized to 4-5 weeks of salsalate
      or placebo in the study. CONTROL GROUP: Another n=10 healthy obese men and women age 18-49
      WITHOUT prediabetes will be enrolled for baseline testing but will not undergo randomization
      to the salsalate/placebo intervention. Therefore, total enrollment will be n=40.

      All subjects will have no history of cardiovascular, metabolic or pulmonary disease as
      determined from medical history and physical exam, and a resting 12-lead ECG. Subjects may be
      on anti-hypertensive medications but will be asked to hold the medication on the morning of
      testing. Subjects on medications for Type I or II diabetes mellitus or for hyperlipidemia
      will be excluded (see complete list below). Subjects will be non-smokers or quit smoking at
      least one year ago. Women will have regular menses and will be tested during the early
      follicular phase of their menstrual cycle (within 8 days of onset of menses) to control for
      differences in circulating estradiol concentrations. Aim 1 will measure microvascular
      function and aortic wall stiffness in obese prediabetic adults before and after 1 month of
      salsalate or placebo. Hypothesis 1 is that chronic inflammation inhibition will improve
      microvascular and large elastic artery function in obese adults with prediabetes. Aim 2 will
      measure muscle sympathetic nervous system activity (MSNA) and baroreflex sensitivity in obese
      prediabetic adults before and after 1 month of salsalate or placebo. Hypothesis 2 is that
      chronic inflammation inhibition will decrease MSNA and improve baroreflex sensitivity in
      obese adults with prediabetes.
