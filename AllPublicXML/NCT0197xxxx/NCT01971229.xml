  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgery is a stress on the body and recovering well after surgery is very important to
      patients and their doctors. It is therefore important to prepare patient's bodies for the
      stress of surgery, and one way to do this is to provide proper nutrition. In the past,
      patients were asked to prepare for surgery by fasting from midnight before surgery. Today, it
      is known that this practice is not beneficial to patient's recovery. In fact, it has been
      recognized that drinking a sugary beverage (e.g., juice) before surgery stimulates the
      production of insulin, which is a hormone that helps make the proteins needed for wound
      healing after surgery. This is currently practiced at the MUHC. It might also be beneficial,
      however, to drink a beverage that contains sugar and whey proteins (a protein isolated from
      milk) before surgery. In fact, whey proteins stimulate insulin and may also have the added
      benefit of improving muscular strength. In this study, investigators will measure the level
      of insulin produced after drinking a carbohydrate (i.e., sugar)-whey protein beverage to
      determine how it compares to the level of insulin produced after drinking the sugary beverage
      used at the MUHC.

      It is hypothesized that the increase in plasma insulin following a mixed carbohydrate whey
      protein drink is significantly greater than that elicited by a carbohydrate drink.

    <description>The acetaminophen absorption test, as an indirect assessment of gastric emptying.Since gastric emptying is the rate-limiting step in delivering the drug to its absorption site, it is believed that the rate of appearance of acetaminophen in the blood reflects the rate of gastric emptying.
Blood samples will be collected every 30 minutes for 3 hours.</description>
