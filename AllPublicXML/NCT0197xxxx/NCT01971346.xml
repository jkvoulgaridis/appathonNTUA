      The purpose of this study is to determine the relationship between two types of cell signals,
      type I interferon (IFN) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), in psoriatic skin prior to and
      during treatment with etanercept and correlate that information with the degree of the
      improvement in the psoriasis.

      Hypothesis: The balance between type I IFN and TNF determines the response to anti-TNF
      treatment. The goal of the proposed study is to address this hypothesis and demonstrate that
      the strength of the type I IFN signature in psoriatic skin is the major determinant of the
      clinical response to anti-TNF treatment.

      Purpose: Determine the strength of the type I interferon and TNF signal in psoriatic skin
      prior to and during treatment with etanercept and correlate with degree of clinical
      improvement.

      Study Population: up to 50 subjects, men or women over the age of 18 with clinically stable
      plaque psoriasis, who meet the wash out requirements and other exclusion criteria

      Psoriatic patients will receive 100 mg etanercept per week (2 separate single-use pre-filled
      50 mg subcutaneous injections taken on two separate days) for 3 months.

      Procedures: Urine pregnancy test, TB test, photography, Physical Examinations, Skin
      Examinations, Study Drug, Peripheral blood and biopsies

      Anticipated Results: We expect that patients with strong IFN-α signature in psoriatic skin
      along with weak TNF-α signature will have minimal response to anti-TNF treatment, while
      patients with the opposite pattern, weak IFN and strong TNF signature, will have significant
      clinical improvement.

    <measure>Change in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A cumulative change in PASI score from baseline to week 12 will be calculated for each patient. The PASI is the industry standard to decrease/eliminate subjectivity in determining psoriasis severity. It is a quantitative rating scale for measuring the severity of psoriatic lesions based on area coverage and plaque appearance. The severity of plaque characteristics (erythema, thickness and scaling) for body regions (head, upper limbs, trunk and lower limbs) is combined with the degree of plaque involvement in each body region to determine a single PASI score in the range of 0 (no disease) and 72 (maximal disease).</description>

    <measure>Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-Alpha Signal Strength</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Strength of TNF-alpha signatures will be measured in skin of study subjects at initiation, during and after treatment. The strength of these signals will be done using bioinformatic approach quantifying transcriptional signature of these cytokines. The strength of the cytokine signals will be treated as a response variable in a univariate repeated measure analysis of variance, with PASI response profile and time as covariates. PASI response profile will be categorized according to improvement in PASI score: responders (greater than 75% reduction in PASI from baseline), intermediate-responders (those with greater than 25% and less than 75% reduction in PASI from baseline), and non-responders (less than 25% reduction in PASI from baseline).</description>

          <title>Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) Score</title>
          <description>The Psoriasis Area and Severity Index is the industry standard to decrease/eliminate subjectivity in determining psoriasis severity. It is a quantitative rating scale for measuring the severity of psoriatic lesions based on area coverage and plaque appearance. The severity of plaque characteristics (erythema, thickness and scaling) for body regions (head, upper limbs, trunk and lower limbs) is combined with the degree of plaque involvement in each body region to determine a single PASI score in the range of 0 (no disease) and 72 (maximal disease).</description>

        <description>Strength of TNF-alpha signatures will be measured in skin of study subjects at initiation, during and after treatment. The strength of these signals will be done using bioinformatic approach quantifying transcriptional signature of these cytokines. The strength of the cytokine signals will be treated as a response variable in a univariate repeated measure analysis of variance, with PASI response profile and time as covariates. PASI response profile will be categorized according to improvement in PASI score: responders (greater than 75% reduction in PASI from baseline), intermediate-responders (those with greater than 25% and less than 75% reduction in PASI from baseline), and non-responders (less than 25% reduction in PASI from baseline).</description>

        <description>Strength of IFN-alpha signatures will be measured in skin of study subjects at initiation, during and after treatment. The strength of these signals in skin will be done using bioinformatic approach quantifying transcriptional signature of these cytokines.

PASI response profile will be categorized according to improvement in PASI score: responders (greater than 75% reduction in PASI from baseline), intermediate-responders (those with greater than 25% and less than 75% reduction in PASI from baseline), and non-responders (less than 25% reduction in PASI from baseline).</description>
