  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The local and systemic manifestations that affect patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary
      Disease (COPD) cause severe dyspnoea and limitation of functional capacity, leading to
      impairment in the performance of activities of daily living (ADL). The combination of aerobic
      and resistance training, for both upper limbs (UL) and lower limbs (LL), appears to be the
      physiologically most complete resource for improving quality of life and increased survival
      of these patients. Therefore, the aim of the study is to assess the impact of aerobic and
      resistance training of different intensities on the performance and dyspnoea during
      activities of daily living and prediction of mortality in patients with COPD. There will be
      include 45 COPD patients with moderate to severe obstruction, aged between 50-80 years of
      both gender. All patients will undergo to the following assessments and reassessments:
      history and anthropometric data, Scale London Chest Activity of Daily Living Scale (LCADL),
      modified Medical Research Council (mMRC), BODE index, test peripheral muscle strength,
      mobility and balance tests, 6-minute walk test (6MWT), Circuit ADL Test, 1 repetition maximum
      (1RM) and Incremental Cardiopulmonary Testing (ICPT). Patients will be randomly divided into
      two groups and undergo to the treatment program will consist of sessions lasting
      approximately 1 hour, three times a week for 12 consecutive weeks, totaling 36 sessions. All
      patients will undergo general stretching and aerobic training on a cycle ergometer with the
      intensity between 70-80 % of the maximum load achieved in ICPT. After aerobic training, a
      group of patients will achieve a protocol of low-intensity resistance training (LI-RT), with
      emphasis on gaining muscle strength, and the other group will be submitted to a protocol of
      high intensity (HI-RT), aiming greater gain in muscle strength. The calculation of the
      intensity of training will be conducted by the 1RM test. After the training protocol, it is
      expected to find improved performance and dyspnoea during activities of daily living and
      reduction of BODE index for both groups, however, it is expected that the group of
      low-intensity resistance training presents greater benefits in ADL.

    <measure>Change in Dyspnea Related During Activities of Daily Living</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after 36 sessions, an average of 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Dyspnea in ADL was assessed by London Chest Activity of Daily Living Scale(LCADL), that consists 15 quantitative questions of 4 domains: self-care, domestic, physical, and leisure. Subjects indicate a score of 0-5, in a total of 75 points. A higher total score indicates greater limitation in performing ADL due to dyspnea.</description>

    <measure>Change in BODE index</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after 36 sessions, an average of 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>In order to calculate the BODE index, the following variables were considered: BMI (body mass index), forced expiratory volume in one second, as the percentage of the predicted value (pred FEV1 %), mMRC score (modified Medical Research Council Scale) and in the 6MWD (Six-Minute Walk Distance). The score was considered according to the results obtained from the four variables (0-3 for FEV1; 0-3 for mMRC; 0-3 for 6MWD and 0-1 for BMI), and total score ranged from 0 to 10 (higher scores indicate more severity).</description>
