    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline in the Eczema Area Severity Index Score (EASI) to Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The EASI score was used to measure the severity and extent of atopic dermatitis (AD) and measures erythema (E), infiltration (I), excoriation (Ex) and lichenification (L) on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper and lower extremities. The total EASI score ranges from 0 (minimum) to 72 (maximum) points, with the higher scores reflecting the worse severity of AD. Values after first rescue medication use were set to missing and missing values imputed by last observation carried forward (LOCF).</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) Score of &quot;0&quot; or &quot;1&quot; at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>IGA was an assessment scale used to determine severity of AD and clinical response to treatment on a 5-point scale (0 = clear; 1 = almost clear; 2 = mild; 3 = moderate; 4 = severe) based on erythema and papulation/infiltration. Therapeutic response was an IGA score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear). Values after first rescue medication were set to missing and participants with missing IGA score at Week 16 were considered as non-responders.</description>

    <description>IGA was an assessment scale used to determine severity of AD and clinical response to treatment on a 5-point scale (0 = clear; 1 = almost clear; 2 = mild; 3 = moderate; 4 = severe) based on erythema and papulation/infiltration. Participants with reduction in IGA score from baseline of ≥2 points at Week 16 were reported. Values after first rescue medication were set to missing and participants with missing IGA score at Week 16 were treated as non-responders.</description>

    <measure>Absolute Change From Baseline in Pruritus Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Pruritus NRS was an assessment tool that was used to report the intensity of a participant's pruritus (itch), both maximum and average intensity, during a 24-hour recall period. Participants were asked the following question: how would a participant rate his itch at the worst moment during the previous 24 hours (for maximum itch intensity on a scale of 0 - 10 [0 = no itch; 10 = worst itch imaginable]). Values after first rescue treatment were set to missing and missing values were imputed by LOCF.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>SCORAD was a clinical tool for assessing the severity of atopic dermatitis developed by the European Task Force on Atopic Dermatitis (Severity scoring of atopic dermatitis: the SCORAD index). Consensus Report of the European Task Force on Atopic Dermatitis. Dermatology (Basel) 186 (1): 23-31. 1993. Extent and intensity of eczema as well as subjective signs (insomnia, etc.) were assessed and scored. Total score ranged from 0 (absent disease) to 103 (severe disease). Values after first rescue medication use were set to missing and missing values were imputed by LOCF.</description>

    <description>EASI score was used to measure the severity and extent of AD and measured erythema, infiltration, excoriation and lichenification on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper and lower extremities. The total EASI score ranged from 0 (minimum) to 72 (maximum) points, with the higher scores reflecting the worse severity of AD. EASI-50, EASI-75 and EASI-90 responders were the participants who achieved ≥50%, ≥75% and ≥90% respectively, overall improvement in EASI score from baseline to Week 16. Values after first rescue treatment were set to missing and participants with missing EASI score at Week 16 were counted as non-responders.</description>

          <description>The EASI score was used to measure the severity and extent of atopic dermatitis (AD) and measures erythema, infiltration, excoriation and lichenification on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper and lower extremities. The total EASI score ranges from 0 (minimum) to 72 (maximum) points, with the higher scores reflecting the worse severity of AD.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in the Eczema Area Severity Index Score (EASI) to Week 16</title>
        <description>The EASI score was used to measure the severity and extent of atopic dermatitis (AD) and measures erythema (E), infiltration (I), excoriation (Ex) and lichenification (L) on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper and lower extremities. The total EASI score ranges from 0 (minimum) to 72 (maximum) points, with the higher scores reflecting the worse severity of AD. Values after first rescue medication use were set to missing and missing values imputed by last observation carried forward (LOCF).</description>

Values after first rescue treatment were set to missing and missing values were imputed by LOCF.</description>

        <description>The EASI score was used to measure the severity and extent of AD and measured erythema, infiltration, excoriation and lichenification on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper and lower extremities. The total EASI score ranges from 0 (minimum) to 72 (maximum) points, with the higher scores reflecting the worse severity of AD. Values after first rescue medication use were set to missing and missing values were imputed by LOCF.</description>

        <title>Absolute Change From Baseline in SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) Score to Week 16</title>
        <description>SCORAD was a clinical tool for assessing the severity of atopic dermatitis developed by the European Task Force on Atopic Dermatitis (Severity scoring of atopic dermatitis: the SCORAD index). Consensus Report of the European Task Force on Atopic Dermatitis. Dermatology (Basel) 186 (1): 23-31. 1993. Extent and intensity of eczema as well as subjective signs (insomnia, etc.) were assessed and scored. Total score ranged from 0 (absent disease) to 103 (severe disease). Values after first rescue medication use were set to missing and missing values were imputed by LOCF.</description>

        <description>SCORAD was a clinical tool for assessing the severity of atopic dermatitis developed by the European Task Force on Atopic Dermatitis (Severity scoring of atopic dermatitis: the SCORAD index). Consensus Report of the European Task Force on Atopic Dermatitis. Dermatology (Basel) 186 (1): 23-31. 1993. Extent and intensity of eczema as well as subjective signs (insomnia, etc.) were assessed and scored. Total score ranges from 0 (absent disease) to 103 (severe disease). SCORAD-50, SCORAD-75 and SCORAD-90 responders were the participants who achieved ≥50%, ≥75% and ≥90% respectively, overall improvement in SCORAD score from baseline to Week 16. Values after first rescue treatment were set to missing and participants with missing SCORAD score at Week 16 were counted as non-responders.</description>

        <description>Individual components of the AD lesions (erythema, infiltration/papulation, excoriations, and lichenification) were rated globally (each assessed for the whole body, not by anatomical region) on a 4-point scale (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate and 3 = severe) using the EASI severity grading criteria. Total score ranges from 0 (absent disease) to 12 (severe disease).Values after first rescue medication use were set to missing and missing values were imputed by LOCF.</description>
