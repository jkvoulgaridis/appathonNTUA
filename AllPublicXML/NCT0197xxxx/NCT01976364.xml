  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, long-term open-label extension study to evaluate the safety, tolerability
      and efficacy of tofacitinib in subjects with active PsA who have previously participated in
      randomized studies of tofacitinib for this indication.

      This study will include a sub-study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of
      tofacitinib 5 mg BID administered as monotherapy after methotrexate withdrawal compared to
      tofacitinib 5 mg BID continued in combination with methotrexate. The sub-study will be
      available to subjects who have completed at least 24 months of participation in the
      open-label extension study and meet eligibility criteria for the sub-study.

        <description>HAQ-DI assessed the degree of difficulty a participant had experienced during the past week in 8 domains of daily living activities: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, reach, grip, hygiene, and other activities. There were total of 2-3 items distributed in each of these 8 domains. Each item was scored for level of difficulty on a 4-point scale from 0 to 3: 0= no difficulty; 1= some difficulty; 2= much difficulty; 3= unable to do. Overall score was computed as the sum of domain scores and divided by the number of domains answered. Total possible HAQ-DI score ranged from 0 (least difficulty) to 3 (extreme difficulty), where higher score indicated more difficulty while performing daily living activities.</description>

        <description>Participants with 50% improvement from baseline in tender and swollen joint counts and 50% improvement in at least 3 of the 5 measures: PtGA, PhyGA, participant's assessment of arthritis pain, HAQ-DI and CRP in mg/L. PtGA: participant assessed health on VAS, 0 mm (very well) to 100 mm (worst health condition), higher score = worse condition. PhyGA: physician judged participants' pain on VAS, 0 (no pain) to 100 mm (extreme pain), higher score = more pain. Participant's assessment of arthritis pain: participant assessed pain on VAS, 0 mm (no pain) to 100 mm (most severe pain), higher score = more pain. HAQ-DI: functional disability evaluation, score: 0 (no difficulty) to 3 (extreme difficulty), higher score implied more disability.</description>

        <description>Participants with 70% improvement from baseline in tender and swollen joint counts and 70% improvement in at least 3 of the 5 measures: PtGA, PhyGA, participant's assessment of arthritis pain, HAQ-DI and CRP in mg/L. PtGA: participant assessed health on VAS, 0 mm (very well) to 100 mm (worst health condition), higher score = worse condition. PhyGA: physician judged participants' pain on VAS, 0 (no pain) to 100 mm (extreme pain), higher score = more pain. Participant's assessment of arthritis pain: participant assessed pain on VAS, 0 mm (no pain) to 100 mm (most severe pain), higher score = more pain. HAQ-DI: functional disability evaluation, score: 0 (no difficulty) to 3 (extreme difficulty), higher score implied more disability.</description>

        <title>Main Study: Change From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI) Score at Months 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33 and 36</title>
        <description>HAQ-DI assessed the degree of difficulty a participant had experienced during the past week in 8 domains of daily living activities: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, reach, grip, hygiene, and other activities. There were total of 2-3 items distributed in each of these 8 domains. Each item was scored for level of difficulty on a 4-point scale from 0 to 3: 0= no difficulty; 1= some difficulty; 2= much difficulty; 3= unable to do. Overall score was computed as the sum of domain score and divided by the number of domains answered. Total possible HAQ-DI score range 0 (least difficulty) and 3 (extreme difficulty), where higher score indicated more difficulty while performing daily living activities.</description>

        <title>Main Study: Percentage of Participants Achieving Psoriatic Arthritis Response Criteria (PsARC)</title>
        <description>PsARC is comprised of 4 clinical improvement criteria: greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 20% improvement in PhyGA (VAS), &gt;=20% improvement in PtGA; and &gt;= 30% reduction in the number of tender joints; and &gt;=30% reduction in the number of swollen joints. PtGA: participant assessed health on VAS, 0 mm (very well) to 100 mm (worst health condition), higher score = worse condition. PhyGA: physician judged participants' pain on VAS, 0 (no pain) to 100 mm (extreme pain), higher score = more pain. To achieve a clinical response, the participant must improve in 2 of the 4 PsARC criteria, 1 of which has to be the number of tender or swollen joints and none of the 4 score could worsen.</description>

        <title>Main Study: Change From Baseline in Physician's Global Assessment of Psoriasis (PGA-PsO) Score (For Participants With Baseline PGA-PsO Score Greater Than [&gt;]0) at Months 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33 and 36</title>
        <description>The PGA-PsO was a 5-point scale, reflecting a global consideration of the erythema, induration, and scaling across all psoriatic lesions. Average erythema, induration, and scaling were scored separately over the whole body according to a 5-point severity scale (0-4). Higher score indicated higher disease severity. Severity score for each erythema, induration and scaling were summed and averaged after which the total average was rounded to the nearest whole number score to determine a PGA-PsO score on a scale of 0 to 4 (0= clear, except for any residual discoloration, 1= almost clear, 2= mild, 3= moderate, 4= severe).</description>

        <description>PASI: combined assessment of lesion severity and body area affected into single score; range =0 (no disease) -72 (maximal disease). Higher score representing greater severity of psoriasis. PASI is a composite scoring by investigator of degree of erythema, induration, and scaling (each scored separately) for each of 4 body regions (head and neck, upper limbs, trunk including axillae and groin, and lower limbs including buttocks). For each section % area of skin involved was estimated: 0 (0%) - 6 (90-100%) and severity estimated by clinical signs of erythema, induration, scaling; ranged 0-4: 0=none, 1 =slight, 2 =moderate, 3 =marked, 4 =very marked. Final PASI =sum of severity parameters for each section*area score*weighing factor (head=0.1, upper limbs=0.2, trunk=0.3, lower limbs=0.4). PASI75: at least a 75 % reduction in PASI relative to Baseline.</description>

PASI is a composite scoring by investigator of degree of erythema, induration, and scaling (each scored separately) for each of 4 body regions (head and neck, upper limbs, trunk including axillae and groin, and lower limbs including buttocks). For each section % area of skin involved was estimated: 0(0%) - 6(90-100%) &amp; severity estimated by clinical signs of erythema, induration, scaling; ranged 0-4: 0=none, 1=slight, 2=moderate, 3=marked, 4=very marked. Final PASI=sum of severity parameters for each section*area score*weighing factor (head=0.1, upper limbs=0.2, trunk=0.3, lower limbs=0.4).</description>

For each section % area of skin involved was estimated: 0(0%) - 6(90-100%) and severity estimated by clinical signs components for erythema, induration, scaling; ranged 0-4: 0=none, 1=slight, 2=moderate, 3=marked, 4=very marked. Final PASI=sum of severity parameters for each section*area score*weighing factor (head=0.1, upper limbs=0.2, trunk=0.3, lower limbs=0.4).</description>

        <description>Dactylitis was characterized by swelling of the entire finger or toe. The DSS was a function of finger circumference and tenderness, assessed and summed across all dactylitic digits. The severity of dactylitis was scored on a scale of 0-3, where 0 =no tenderness and 3 =extreme tenderness in each digit of the hands and feet. The range of total dactylitis severity score for a participant was 0-60. Higher score indicated greater severity.</description>

        <description>Enthesitis was inflammation in the tendon, ligament, and joint capsule fiber insertion into bone. The LEI assessed enthesitis in 6 sites including (right and left): lateral epicondyle humerus, medial femoral condyle and achilles tendon insertion. Tenderness is recorded as either present (score 1) or absent (score 0) for each of the 6 sites for a total score of 0-6. Higher score indicated a greater number of sites that are affected by enthesitis.</description>

        <description>The SPARCC enthesitis index identifies the presence or absence of tenderness at 16 enthesial sites, including (right and left): medial epicondyle humerus, lateral epicondyle humerus, supraspinatus insertion into greater tuberosity of humerus, greater trochanter, quadriceps insertion into superior border of patella, patellar ligament insertion into inferior pole of patella or tibial tubercle, Achilles tendon insertion into calcaneum and plantar fascia insertion into calcaneum. On examination, tenderness was recorded as present (1) or absent (0) for each of the 16 sites, with an overall total score ranging from 0 to 16. Higher score indicated a greater number of sites that are affected by enthesitis.</description>

        <description>BASDAI was a validated self-assessment tool used to determine disease activity in participants with ankylosing spondylitis. Utilizing a VAS of 0-10 cm (0= none and 10= very severe) participants answered 6 questions pertaining to 5 symptoms including fatigue, spinal pain, joint pain/swelling, areas of localized tenderness and morning stiffness. The final BASDAI score was an average of answers to 6 questions, with an overall possible score range of 0 to 10 centimeter (cm) with higher score represented more severe ankylosing spondylitis disease activity.</description>

        <description>BASDAI was a validated self-assessment tool used to determine disease activity in participants with ankylosing spondylitis. Utilizing a VAS of 0-10 cm (0= none and 10= very severe) participants answered 6 questions pertaining to 5 symptoms including fatigue, spinal pain, joint pain/swelling, areas of localized tenderness and morning stiffness. The final BASDAI score was an average of answers to 6 questions, with an overall possible score range of 0 to 10 cm with higher score represented more severe ankylosing spondylitis disease activity.</description>

        <description>The SF-36v2 acute was a 36-item measure that evaluates 8 domains: physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. The 8 health domains were aggregated into two summary scores known as the physical component summary (PCS) score and the mental component summary (MCS) score. Norm-based domain scores, PCS and MCS scores were used in the analyses; each of which has a population mean of 50 with a standard deviation (SD) of 10 points, and ranges from minus infinity to plus infinity. A higher PCS score represented better physical health status.</description>

        <description>The SF-36v2 acute is a 36-item measure that evaluates 8 domains: physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. The 8 health domains are aggregated into two summary scores known as the PCS score and the MCS score. Norm-based domain scores, PCS and MCS scores are used in the analyses; each of which has a population mean of 50 with a SD of 10 points, and ranges from minus infinity to plus infinity. A higher MCS score represents better mental health status.</description>

        <description>SF-36v2 was a 36-item measure evaluating 8 domains: physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. The 10 items of the physical functioning scale represented levels and kinds of limitations between extremes of physical activities, including lifting and carrying groceries; climbing stairs; bending, kneeling, or stooping; walking moderate distances; self-care limitations. The physical functioning items capture the presence and extent of physical limitations using a 3-level response continuum. Norm-based domain scores were used in the analyses; each of which had a population mean of 50 with a SD of 10 points, and ranges from minus infinity to plus infinity. A higher physical functioning domain score represented better physical functioning.</description>

        <description>SF-36v2 acute was a 36-item measure evaluating 8 domains: physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, &amp; mental health. The 4-item role-physical scale covers an array of physical health-related role limitations, including: a) limitations in the kind of work or other usual activities; b) reductions in the amount of time spent on work or other usual activities; c) difficulty performing work or other usual activities; &amp; d) accomplishing less. Norm-based domain scores were used in the analyses; each of which had a population mean of 50 with a SD of 10 points, and ranges from minus infinity to plus infinity. A higher role-physical domain score represented better role-physical functioning.</description>

The bodily pain scale comprises of 2 items pertaining to the intensity of bodily pain and extent of interference with normal work activities. Norm-based domain scores were used in the analyses; each of which had a population mean of 50 with a SD of 10 points, and ranges from minus infinity to plus infinity. A higher bodily pain domain score represented less bodily pain.</description>

        <description>The SF-36v2 acute was a 36-item measure that evaluates 8 domains: physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. The general health scale consisted of 5 items including a rating of health and 4 items addressing the respondent's view and expectations of his or her health. Norm-based domain scores were used in the analyses; each of which had a population mean of 50 with a SD of 10 points, and ranged from minus infinity to plus infinity. A higher general health domain score represented better general health perceptions.</description>

The 4-item measure of vitality captures a broad range of subjective evaluations of well-being from feelings of tiredness and being worn out to feeling full of energy all or most of the time. Norm-based domain scores were used in the analyses; each of which had a population mean of 50 with a SD of 10 points, and ranged from minus infinity to plus infinity.

        <description>The SF-36v2 acute was a 36-item measure that evaluates 8 domains: physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. The 2-item social functioning scale assessed health-related effects on quantity and quality of social activities. Norm-based domain scores were used in the analyses; each of which had a population mean of 50 with a SD of 10 points, and ranged from minus infinity to plus infinity. A higher social functioning domain score represented better social functioning.</description>

        <description>The SF-36v2 acute was a 36-item measure that evaluates 8 domains: physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. The 3-item role-emotional scale assessed mental health-related role limitations in terms of a) time spent in work or other usual activities; b) amount of work or activities accomplished; c) care with which work or other activities were performed. Norm-based domain scores were used in the analyses; each of which had a population mean of 50 with a SD of 10 points, and ranged from minus infinity to plus infinity. A higher role-emotional domain score represented better role-emotional functioning.</description>

          <description>The SF-36v2 acute was a 36-item measure that evaluates 8 domains: physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. The 3-item role-emotional scale assessed mental health-related role limitations in terms of a) time spent in work or other usual activities; b) amount of work or activities accomplished; c) care with which work or other activities were performed. Norm-based domain scores were used in the analyses; each of which had a population mean of 50 with a SD of 10 points, and ranged from minus infinity to plus infinity. A higher role-emotional domain score represented better role-emotional functioning.</description>

        <description>The SF-36v2 acute was a 36-item measure that evaluates 8 domains: physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. The 5-item mental health scale includes 1 or more items from each of 4 major mental health dimensions: anxiety, depression, loss of behavioral/emotional control, and psychological well-being. Norm-based domain scores were used in the analyses; each of which had a population mean of 50 with a SD of 10 points, and ranged from minus infinity to plus infinity. A higher mental health domain score represented better mental health functioning.</description>

        <description>EQ-5D-3L, a health profile questionnaire was used to assess quality of life along 5 dimensions i.e. mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression). The status of each dimension had 3 possible responses (1 =no problem, 2 =some problem 3 =severe problems) in the relevant health dimension. Higher score indicated a worsening health condition. Data for change from baseline in EQ-5D-3L usual activities domain score were reported in this measure.</description>

        <description>EQ-5D-3L, a health profile questionnaire was used to assess quality of life along 5 dimensions i.e. mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression). The status of each dimension had 3 possible responses (1 =no problem, 2 =some problem 3 =severe problems) in the relevant health dimension. Higher score indicated a worsening health condition. Data for change from baseline in EQ-5D-3L anxiety/depression domain score were reported in this outcome measure.</description>

        <title>Sub-study: Change From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI) Score at Months 1, 3, 9 and 12</title>
        <description>HAQ-DI assessed the degree of difficulty a participant has experienced during the past week in 8 domains of daily living activities: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, reach, grip, hygiene, and other activities. There were total of 2-3 items distributed in each of these 8 domains. Each item was scored for level of difficulty on a 4-point scale from 0 to 3: 0= no difficulty; 1= some difficulty; 2= much difficulty; 3= unable to do. Overall score was computed as the sum of domain score and divided by the number of domains answered. Total possible HAQ-DI score range 0 (least difficulty) and 3 (extreme difficulty), where higher score indicated more difficulty while performing daily living activities.</description>

        <description>PASDAS was composite PsA disease activity score that included following components: Physician and patient global assessment of disease activity (assessed on a 0-100 VAS) in mm, swollen (66 joints) and tender joint counts (68 joints), Leeds enthesitis index (enthesitis assessed at 6 sites; total score of 0-6), tender dactylitic digit score (scored on a scale of 0-3, where 0= no tenderness and 3= extreme tenderness), SF-36 physical component summary (norm-based domain score were used in analyses; with a population mean of 50 with a SD of 10 points, and ranges from minus infinity to plus infinity) and CRP in mg/L. PASDAS was composite score and was a weighted index with score range of 0 to 10, where higher score indicated more severe disease.</description>

PtGA: participant assessed health on VAS, 0 mm (very well) to 100 mm (worst health condition), higher score = worse condition. PhyGA: physician judged participants' pain on VAS, 0 (no pain) to 100 mm (extreme pain), higher score = more pain.

        <description>The PGA-PsO is a 5-point scale, reflecting a global consideration of the erythema, induration, and scaling across all psoriatic lesions. Average erythema, induration, and scaling were scored separately over the whole body according to a 5-point severity scale (0-4). Higher score indicated higher disease severity. Severity score for each erythema, induration and scaling were summed and averaged after which the total average was rounded to the nearest whole number score to determine a PGA-PsO score on a scale of 0 to 4 (0= clear, except for any residual discoloration, 1= almost clear, 2= mild, 3= moderate, 4= severe).</description>

        <title>Sub-study: Percent Change From Baseline in Body Surface Area (BSA) (For Participants With BSA &gt;0%) Psoriasis at Months 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12</title>
        <description>Assessment of BSA with psoriasis was estimated by means of the handprint method, where the full palmar hand of the participant (fully extended palm, fingers and thumb together) represented approximately 1% of the total BSA. Body regions are assigned specific number of handprints with percentage (Head and neck = 10 handprints [1 handprint =10%], upper extremities = 20 handprints [1 handprint =5%], Trunk (including axillae and groin) = 30 handprints [1 handprint =3.33%], lower extremities (including buttocks) = 40 handprints [1 handprint =2.5%]. The number of handprints of psoriatic skin in a body region was used to determine the extent (%) to which a body region was involved with psoriasis. The total BSA affected was the summation of individual regions affected.</description>

          <description>Assessment of BSA with psoriasis was estimated by means of the handprint method, where the full palmar hand of the participant (fully extended palm, fingers and thumb together) represented approximately 1% of the total BSA. Body regions are assigned specific number of handprints with percentage (Head and neck = 10 handprints [1 handprint =10%], upper extremities = 20 handprints [1 handprint =5%], Trunk (including axillae and groin) = 30 handprints [1 handprint =3.33%], lower extremities (including buttocks) = 40 handprints [1 handprint =2.5%]. The number of handprints of psoriatic skin in a body region was used to determine the extent (%) to which a body region was involved with psoriasis. The total BSA affected was the summation of individual regions affected.</description>

        <description>Dactylitis was characterized by swelling of the entire finger or toe. The DSS was a function of finger circumference and tenderness, assessed and summed across all dactylitic digits. The severity of dactylitis was scored on a scale of 0-3, where 0 =no tenderness and 3 =extreme tenderness in each digit of the hands and feet. The range of total dactylitis score for a participant was 0-60. Higher score indicated greater degree of tenderness.</description>

        <description>Dactylitis was characterized by swelling of the entire finger or toe. The DSS was a function of finger circumference and tenderness, assessed and summed across all dactylitic digits. The severity of dactylitis was scored on a scale of 0-3, where 0 =no tenderness and 3 =extreme tenderness in each digit of the hands and feet. The range of total dactylitis score for a participant was 0-60. Higher score indicated greater degree of tenderness.</description>

        <description>Enthesitis was inflammation in the tendon, ligament, and joint capsule fiber insertion into bone. The LEI assessed enthesitis in 6 sites including (right and left): lateral epicondyle humerus, medial femoral condyle and Achilles tendon insertion. Tenderness is recorded as either present (score 1) or absent (score 0) for each of the 6 sites for a total score of 0-6. Higher score indicated a greater number of sites that are affected by enthesitis.</description>

        <description>Enthesitis was inflammation in the tendon, ligament, and joint capsule fiber insertion into bone. The LEI assessed enthesitis in 6 sites including (right and left): lateral epicondyle humerus, medial femoral condyle and Achilles tendon insertion. Tenderness is recorded as either present (score 1) or absent (score 0) for each of the 6 sites for a total score of 0-6. Higher score indicated a greater number of sites that are affected by enthesitis.</description>

          <title>Sub-study: Percentage of Participants With Absence of Enthesitis Assessed Using Leeds Enthesitis Index (LEI) (For Participants With Baseline LEI &gt;0) at Months 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12</title>
          <description>Enthesitis was inflammation in the tendon, ligament, and joint capsule fiber insertion into bone. The LEI assessed enthesitis in 6 sites including (right and left): lateral epicondyle humerus, medial femoral condyle and achilles tendon insertion. Tenderness is recorded as either present (score 1) or absent (score 0) for each of the 6 sites for a total score of 0-6. Higher score indicated a greater number of sites that are affected by enthesitis.</description>
          <population>Analysis population included all participants who were randomized to the sub-study and received at least one dose of the sub-study drug (tofacitinib, MTX or placebo) with baseline LEI &gt;0.</population>

        <description>68 joints were assessed to determine joints that are considered tender or painful. Response to pressure/motion on each joint was assessed using the following scale: Present/Absent/Not Done/Done/Not Applicable (to be used for artificial or missing joints). The 68 joints assessed were: 1) Upper Body: temporomandibular, sternoclavicular, acromioclavicular. 2) Upper Extremity: shoulder, elbow, wrist (includes radiocarpal, carpal and carpometacarpal considered as one unit), metacarpophalangeals (MCP I, II, III, IV, V), thumb interphalangeal (IP), proximal interphalangeals (PIP II, III, IV, V), distal interphalangeals (DIP II, III, IV, V). 3) Lower Extremity: hip, knee, ankle, tarsus (includes subtalar, transverse tarsal and tarsometatarsal considered as one unit), metatarsophalangeals (MTP I, II, III, IV, V), great toe IP, proximal and distal interphalangeals combined (PIP II, III, IV, V).</description>

        <title>Sub-study: Change From Baseline in Short-Form-36 Health Survey Version 2 (SF-36v2) Physical Component Summary Score at Months 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12</title>
        <description>The SF-36v2 acute is a 36-item measure that evaluates 8 domains: physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. An additional item measures health transition. The 8 health domains are aggregated into two summary scores known as the PCS score and MCS score. Norm-based domain scores, PCS and MCS scores are used in the analyses; each of which has a population mean of 50 with a standard deviation (SD) of 10 points, and ranges from minus infinity to plus infinity. A higher PCS score represents better physical health status.</description>

        <title>Sub-study: Change From Baseline in Short-Form-36 Health Survey Version 2 (SF-36v2) Mental Component Summary Score at Months 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12</title>
        <description>The SF-36v2 acute is a 36-item measure that evaluates 8 domains: physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. An additional item measures health transition. The 8 health domains are aggregated into two summary scores known as the PCS score and the MCS score. Norm-based domain scores, PCS and MCS scores are used in the analyses; each of which has a population mean of 50 with a SD of 10 points, and ranges from minus infinity to plus infinity. A higher MCS score represents better mental health status.</description>

        <description>SF-36v2 was a 36-item measure evaluating 8 domains: physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, &amp; mental health. The 10 items of the physical functioning scale represented levels and kinds of limitations between extremes of physical activities, including lifting &amp; carrying groceries; climbing stairs; bending, kneeling, or stooping; walking moderate distances; self-care limitations. The physical functioning items capture the presence &amp; extent of physical limitations using a 3-level response continuum. Norm-based domain scores were used in the analyses; each of which had a population mean of 50 with a SD of 10 points, and ranges from minus infinity to plus infinity. A higher physical functioning domain score represented better physical functioning.</description>

        <description>SF-36v2 acute was a 36-item measure evaluating 8 domains: physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, &amp; mental health. The 4-item role-physical scale covers an array of physical health-related role limitations, including: a) limitations in the kind of work or other usual activities; b) reductions in the amount of time spent on work or other usual activities; c) difficulty performing work or other usual activities; &amp; d) accomplishing less. Norm-based domain scores were used in the analyses; each of which had a population mean of 50 with a SD of 10 points, and ranges from minus infinity to plus infinity. A higher role-physical domain score represented better role-physical functioning.</description>

        <description>The SF-36v2 acute was a 36-item measure that evaluates 8 domains: physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. The bodily pain scale comprises of 2 items pertaining to the intensity of bodily pain and extent of interference with normal work activities. Norm-based domain scores were used in the analyses; each of which had a population mean of 50 with a SD of 10 points, and ranges from minus infinity to plus infinity. A higher bodily pain domain score represented less bodily pain.</description>

        <description>The SF-36v2 acute was a 36-item measure that evaluates 8 domains: physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. The general health scale consisted of 5 items including a rating of health and 4 items addressing the respondent's view and expectations of his or her health. Norm-based domain scores were used in the analyses; each of which had a population mean of 50 with a SD of 10 points, and ranged from minus infinity to plus infinity. A higher general health domain score represented better general health perceptions.</description>

        <title>Sub-study: Change From Baseline in Short-Form-36 Health Survey Version 2 (SF-36v2) Vitality Domain Score at Months 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12</title>
        <description>The SF-36v2 acute was a 36-item measure that evaluates 8 domains: physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. The 4-item measure of vitality captures a broad range of subjective evaluations of well-being from feelings of tiredness and being worn out to feeling full of energy all or most of the time. Norm-based domain scores were used in the analyses; each of which had a population mean of 50 with a SD of 10 points, and ranged from minus infinity to plus infinity. A higher vitality domain score represented better vitality.</description>

          <title>Sub-study: Change From Baseline in Short-Form-36 Health Survey Version 2 (SF-36v2) Vitality Domain Score at Months 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12</title>
          <description>The SF-36v2 acute was a 36-item measure that evaluates 8 domains: physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. The 4-item measure of vitality captures a broad range of subjective evaluations of well-being from feelings of tiredness and being worn out to feeling full of energy all or most of the time. Norm-based domain scores were used in the analyses; each of which had a population mean of 50 with a SD of 10 points, and ranged from minus infinity to plus infinity. A higher vitality domain score represented better vitality.</description>
          <population>FAS for sub-study included all participants who were randomized to the sub-study and received at least one dose of the sub-study drug (tofacitinib, MTX or placebo).</population>

The 2-item social functioning scale assessed health-related effects on quantity and quality of social activities. Norm-based domain scores were used in the analyses; each of which had a population mean of 50 with a SD of 10 points, and ranged from minus infinity to plus infinity. A higher social functioning domain score represented better social functioning.</description>

        <title>Sub-study: Change From Baseline in Short-Form-36 Health Survey Version 2 (SF-36v2) Role Emotional Domain Score at Months 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12</title>
        <description>The SF-36v2 acute was a 36-item measure that evaluates 8 domains: physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. The 3-item role-emotional scale assessed mental health-related role limitations in terms of a) time spent in work or other usual activities; b) amount of work or activities accomplished; c) care with which work or other activities were performed. Norm-based domain scores were used in the analyses; each of which had a population mean of 50 with a SD of 10 points, and ranged from minus infinity to plus infinity. A higher role-emotional domain score represented better role-emotional functioning.</description>

The 5-item mental health scale includes 1 or more items from each of 4 major mental health dimensions: anxiety, depression, loss of behavioral/emotional control, and psychological well-being. Norm-based domain scores were used in the analyses; each of which had a population mean of 50 with a SD of 10 points, and ranged from minus infinity to plus infinity. A higher mental health domain score represented better mental health functioning.</description>

      <desc>Analysis performed on safety analysis set. As pre-specified in protocol/SAP, safety data were planned to be assessed as a single group (without regard to tofacitinib doses) in the main study. For the main study report, the analysis of the safety data included cumulative safety data from both the main and the sub-study as a single group. In addition, the safety data collected in the sub-study was analyzed for tofacitinib 5 mg BID + MTX and tofacitinib 5 mg BID + placebo, separately.</desc>
