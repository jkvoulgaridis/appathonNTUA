    <textblock>
      This study has two primary objectives:

        1. To compare combination therapy with acetazolamide and low-dose loop diuretics versus
           high-dose loop diuretics (standard of care) in patients with acute decompensated heart
           failure at high risk for diuretic resistance.

        2. To demonstrate the safety and efficacy of upfront therapy with spironolactone in
           addition to loop diuretic therapy in patients with acute decompensated heart failure at
           high risk for diuretic resistance.

    <measure>Acetazolamide Arm: Natriuresis 24 h</measure>
    <time_frame>24h</time_frame>
    <description>For the acetazolamide arm of the study, the primary end-point is total natriuresis after 24 h (mmol). To assess this, urine is collected for 24 h after the first administration of diuretics according to the study protocol and natriuresis is calculated as the total amount of diuresis (L) multiplied by the urinary sodium concentration (mmol/L). Subsequently, patients receiving acetazolamide and low-dose loop diuretics (both the groups with and without upfront spironolactone together) are compared to patients not receiving acetazolamide but high-dose loop diuretics instead (both the groups with or without upfront spironolactone together)</description>

    <time_frame>72h</time_frame>
    <description>For the spironolactone arm of the study, the primary end-point is the incidence of either hypo- (serum potassium &lt;3.5 mmol/L) or hyperkalemia (serum potassium &gt;5.0 mmol/L) at any of 3 morning blood samples at consecutive days after randomization. Patients receiving upfront spironolactone (both the group receiving acetazolamide+low dose loop diuretics and the group receiving high-dose loop diuretic therapy) are compared with them receiving no spironolactone (both the group receiving acetazolamide+low dose loop diuretics and the group receiving high-dose loop diuretic therapy).</description>

    <description>Patients receive 500 mg of intravenous acetazolamide immediately after randomization, with 250 mg intravenous acetazolamide administered on each consecutive day in the morning for as long as the patient is considered volume overloaded by his/her treating cardiologist.
Patients receive 2 mg of intravenous bumetanide immediately after randomization, with 1 mg intravenous bumetanide administered on each consecutive day in the morning for as long as the patient is considered volume overloaded by his/her treating cardiologist.
If diuresis &lt;1,5 L while the patient is still considered volume overloaded by his/her treating cardiologist, the dose of acetazolamide is maintained at 500 mg and the dose of bumetanide is maintained at 2mg.
In case of therapy-refractory congestion, treatment is at the discretion of the treating physician, but addition of chlorthalidone 50 mg PO is recommended by the investigators as a first-line option.</description>

    <description>Patients receive the double of their daily maintenance dose of oral loop diuretics converted to mg bumetanide as an intravenous bolus after randomization.
Patients continue to receive this dose daily on the next 3 days divided between two administrations with at least a 6 h interval for as long as they are considered volume overloaded by the treating cardiologist.
If diuresis &lt;1,5 L while the patient is still considered volume overloaded by the treating cardiologist, the dose of bumetanide is doubled.
In case of therapy-refractory congestion, treatment is at the discretion of the treating physician, but addition of chlorthalidone 50 mg PO is recommended by the investigators as a first-line option.</description>

Patients continue to receive this dose daily on the next 3 days divided between two administrations with at least a 6 h interval for as long as they are considered volume overloaded by the treating cardiologist.
Spironolactone use is prohibited during the first 72 h, but encouraged at discharge.</description>

        <description>For the acetazolamide arm of the study, the primary end-point is total natriuresis after 24 h (mmol). To assess this, urine is collected for 24 h after the first administration of diuretics according to the study protocol and natriuresis is calculated as the total amount of diuresis (L) multiplied by the urinary sodium concentration (mmol/L). Subsequently, patients receiving acetazolamide and low-dose loop diuretics (both the groups with and without upfront spironolactone together) are compared to patients not receiving acetazolamide but high-dose loop diuretics instead (both the groups with or without upfront spironolactone together)</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Worsening Renal Function</title>
        <description>Worsening renal function is defined as a rise in serum creatine &gt;0.3 mg/dL or a &gt;20% decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate by the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) formula compared to baseline at any time point before 72 h. Serum creatinine values are assessed at three consecutive mornings after study inclusion.</description>

        <description>Scale name and construct: Visual analogue scale presented as a line with a movable indicator. Far left of the line indicates no dyspnea at all and far right of the line indicates the worst imaginable dyspnea. The participant can move the indicator to one certain point among the line and the investigator can read at the back a number going from 0 to 100 with 0 indicating no dyspnea and 100 the worst imaginable dyspnea.</description>
