  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a global, multi-centre, open-label, study of GSK2118436 conducted in up to 30
      evaluable subjects with resectable, BRAF V600E or V600K mutation-positive metastatic melanoma
      to the brain. All subjects in this study are required to have accessible extracranial
      metastases and are agreeable to undergo repetitive biopsies. The first cohort of 15 subjects
      will receive dabrafenib orally 150mg twice daily (BID) for 7 to 14 days prior to surgery
      (Cohort A); the second cohort of 15 subjects will receive the combination of dabrafenib 150
      mg BID and trametinib 2 mg once daily for 7 to 14 days prior to surgery (Cohort B). The
      primary purpose of this study is to determine levels and distribution of dabrafenib, its
      metabolites, and trametinib (Cohort B only) in parenchymal brain metastases, extracranial
      metastases, and peripheral blood (plasma) within two cohorts of subjects with BRAF V600E/K
      mutation-positive melanoma that has metastasized to the brain. All subjects will be followed
      for survival and new anti-cancer therapy for a total of two years or until death or the
      subject wishes to withdraw from further follow-up.

        <description>Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis of dabrafenib and its active metabolites, including hydroxy-, carboxy-, and desmethyl-dabrafenib were collected on day of surgical resection of the brain metastasis(es), Two samples were collected before surgery and 2 samples after surgery with one hour gap in between. Upon collection blood was placed on wet ice. Plasma was isolated within 60 minutes of collection and frozen at -20 degree celsius.</description>

        <description>Concentrations of dabrafenib, its metabolites, hydroxy-, carboxy, and desmethyl-dabrafenib, and possibly other drug-related species were quantified in the pharmacokinetic tissue sample by an investigative Liquid chromatography- mass spectrometry (LC-MS)/MS method. The spatial distribution of dabrafenib, its metabolites, hydroxy-, carboxy, and desmethyl-dabrafenib and possibly other drug-related species in the tissue samples were determined using an investigative matrix assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) analysis method. Parenchymal brain metastases and extracranial metastases using MALDI imaging was not determined for all participants (completed by GSK for the first two participants enrolled)</description>

        <description>112-lead ECGs were planned to be obtained at screening during the study using an ECG machine that automatically calculates the heart rate and measures PR, QRS, QT, and corrected QT (QTc) intervals. At each assessment a 12-lead ECG was planned to be performed by qualified personnel at the site after at least a five-minute rest with the participants in a semi-recumbent or supine position. But data for 12-lead ECGs were not summarized and listed as the study was terminated.</description>
