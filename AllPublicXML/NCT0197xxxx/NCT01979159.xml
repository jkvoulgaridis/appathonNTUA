  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In order to determine if speech-language therapy has positive effect, reliable measurement
      tools are required to document outcomes. Currently, there is very limited information
      concerning the measurement of changes in speech production as a result of treatment for
      acquired apraxia of speech and aphasia. This study will obtain information concerning the
      reliability of several speech production measures over time. Thirty persons with chronic
      aphasia and apraxia of speech will be asked to provide speech samples in response to commonly
      used assessment tools on three sampling occasions so that the stability of measurements may
      be examined.

      After establishment of appropriate outcome measures, a small, pilot treatment study will be
      conducted with four participants. The participants will receive a new treatment for aphasia
      and acquired apraxia of speech and outcomes will be measured relative to speech and language
      production.

  <detailed_description>

      A single group, repeated measures design will be used to obtain repeated speech samples from
      30 persons with chronic acquired apraxia of speech and aphasia. Speech samples will be
      elicited using commonly employed motor speech assessment protocols; an initial sample, a
      sample one week following the initial sample, and a sample at four weeks following the
      initial sample. The following measures will be obtained from the samples: percent consonants
      correct, percent fluent utterances, and duration of utterance. Stability of the measures will
      be examined.

      After the preceding measures have been analyzed, a series of four, single-subject
      experimental designs will be conducted. Four participants with chronic aphasia and apraxia of
      speech will receive a new treatment for aphasia and apraxia of speech applied sequentially to
      two sets of experimental picture picture stimuli. Outcomes will be measured in terms of
      speech production (measures described above) as well as in terms of language production.

    <measure>Change in Language Content Production for Treated Stimuli: Effect Sizes (Magnitude of Change From Baseline to Follow-up)</measure>
    <time_frame>Following completion of treatment at 6 weeks post</time_frame>
    <description>Correct Information Units (CIUs) is a measure of the amount of relevant content produced in connected language tallied according to operationalized criteria. CIU is not a test or scale - it is a measure that is applied to language samples - in this case, description of treated pictures. Participants described experimental pictures, responses were transcribed and CIUs counted. CIUs can range from 0 to an unlimited maximum. Effect sizes (ESs) were calculated as an indication of the magnitude of change in number of CIUs produced (pre treatment to post treatment. ESs can range from negative (poorer performance post-treatment) to positive values (better performance post-treatment), with larger positive values reflecting greater gains. Benchmarks are as follows: &gt;11.14 = large, 11.13 - 6.56 = medium, 6.55 - 3.88 = small, &lt;3.88 = negligible. Small to large ESs indicate production of measurably more CIUs in picture descriptions post-treatment. Larger the ES, the greater the change.</description>

    <description>Correct Information Units (CIUs) is a measure of the amount of relevant content produced in connected language tallied according to operationalized criteria. CIU is not a test or scale - it is a measure that is applied to language samples - in this case, description of untreated pictures. Participants described experimental pictures, responses were transcribed and CIUs counted. CIUs can range from 0 to an unlimited maximum. Effect sizes (ESs) were calculated as an indication of the magnitude of change in number of CIUs produced (pre treatment to post treatment.

Benchmarks are as follows: &gt;9.53 = large, 9.52 - 5.52 = medium, 6.55 - 3.29 = small, &lt;3.29 = negligible.

    <measure>Changes in Speech Intelligibility on the Assessment of Intelligibility of Dysarthric Speech</measure>
    <time_frame>pre and post treatment - prior to the start of treatment and at 6 weeks following the completion of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Speech intelligibility (understandability of speech) was measured by having participants produce 50 words from the Assessment of Intelligibility of Dysarthric Speech (ASSIDS) Two speech-language (blinded) scored pre and post treatment ASSIDS samples. The percentage of words correctly understood was calculated for each participant. The ASSIDS is not a scale - it is a procedure for calculating intelligibility. Speech intelligibility can range from 0% to 100% intelligible (no words understood to all words understood). The higher the percentage, the better the speech is understood by the listener. Change in percent words intelligible has the potential to be a negative (reflecting a poor outcome of less intelligible speech) or positive (reflecting a good outcome of more intelligible speech). The maximum possible amount of gain in intelligibility for these 4 participants, based on their pretreatment performance, ranged from +2% to +25%.</description>

          <title>Change in Language Content Production for Treated Stimuli: Effect Sizes (Magnitude of Change From Baseline to Follow-up)</title>
          <description>Correct Information Units (CIUs) is a measure of the amount of relevant content produced in connected language tallied according to operationalized criteria. CIU is not a test or scale - it is a measure that is applied to language samples - in this case, description of treated pictures. Participants described experimental pictures, responses were transcribed and CIUs counted. CIUs can range from 0 to an unlimited maximum. Effect sizes (ESs) were calculated as an indication of the magnitude of change in number of CIUs produced (pre treatment to post treatment. ESs can range from negative (poorer performance post-treatment) to positive values (better performance post-treatment), with larger positive values reflecting greater gains. Benchmarks are as follows: &gt;11.14 = large, 11.13 - 6.56 = medium, 6.55 - 3.88 = small, &lt;3.88 = negligible. Small to large ESs indicate production of measurably more CIUs in picture descriptions post-treatment. Larger the ES, the greater the change.</description>

        <title>Changes in Speech Intelligibility on the Assessment of Intelligibility of Dysarthric Speech</title>
        <description>Speech intelligibility (understandability of speech) was measured by having participants produce 50 words from the Assessment of Intelligibility of Dysarthric Speech (ASSIDS) Two speech-language (blinded) scored pre and post treatment ASSIDS samples. The percentage of words correctly understood was calculated for each participant. The ASSIDS is not a scale - it is a procedure for calculating intelligibility. Speech intelligibility can range from 0% to 100% intelligible (no words understood to all words understood). The higher the percentage, the better the speech is understood by the listener. Change in percent words intelligible has the potential to be a negative (reflecting a poor outcome of less intelligible speech) or positive (reflecting a good outcome of more intelligible speech). The maximum possible amount of gain in intelligibility for these 4 participants, based on their pretreatment performance, ranged from +2% to +25%.</description>

Combined Aphasia and Apraxia of Speech Treatment (CAAST): Therapy is delivered in a face-to-face format. The therapist uses picture stimuli, verbal modeling, feedback, reinforcement, forward-chaining to increase verbal production. For speech errors that occur, the therapist uses modeling, feedback, reinforcement, simultaneous production, articulatory instruction, and repeated practice to improve articulation.</description>
