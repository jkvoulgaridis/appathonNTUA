    <textblock>
      In this study, an FDA-cleared device and type of treatment called &quot;AMES,&quot; which stands for
      Assisted Movement with Enhanced Sensation, will be used to determine whether sensation in the
      upper limb of individuals with incomplete spinal cord injuries, acquired brain injury, or
      stroke improves along with movement through treatment. We hypothesize that measureable
      improvement in the sensation of the upper limb will precede improvement in functional
      movement.

      The AMES device performs tests of sensorimotor impairment as well as delivering therapy. In
      this study, we are testing 2 additional diagnostic tests (i.e., Joint Position Test and
      &quot;Frisbee&quot; Test), both of proprioception, in order to determine which of the two is the best
      test of proprioception. Our hypotheses are: (1) both sensation and movement recover with AMES
      treatment, (2) sensory recovery precedes that of movement, (3) robotic delivery of the Joint
      Position Test produces more reliable test results than does manual delivery of this test, and
      (4) the Frisbee Test results will parallel those of the Joint Position Test.

    <description>Testing proprioceptive sensation, the AMES device moves the subject's wrist through a 30 degree range, at variable speeds, as the subject attempts to identify when their wrist reaches a particular target, either by opening contact between the thumb and index finger (if possible) or blinking the eyes. The subject receives feedback about the accuracy of the testing.</description>

    <description>During treatment, the AMES device rotates the hand, into flexion and extension, while the patient assists with this motion,and while the lengthening muscle(s) are vibrated mechanically. At the end of the treatment, several diagnostic tests are performed to measure the participant's level of proprioceptive perception. This study provides for 25 AMES treatments and diagnostic tests over 8-13 weeks, at a rate of 2-3 sessions per week.</description>

    <intervention_name>AMES Therapy</intervention_name>
    <description>During the therapy session, the AMES device rotates the hand into flexion and extension, while the patient assists with this motion, as possible. At the same time, the AMES device provides sensory stimulation by vibrating the tendons of muscles stretched by the movement. The vibratory stimulus switches from one side of the limb to the other when the rotation reverses direction so that the sensory stimulation remains functionally related to the movement. The subject will receive visual bio-feedback of their contribution to the motor movement.</description>

        <title>Joint Position Test - AMES Device</title>
        <description>Testing proprioceptive sensation, the subject, with eyes closed, attempts to identify verbally the direction of motion (i.e., flexion or extension) as the AMES device randomly moves the subject's thumb and fingers, or the whole hand, into flexion and extension.</description>
        <time_frame>Immediately after each treatment on the AMES Device</time_frame>
        <population>Device used for eye-blinks did not perform as expected. Study terminated prior to any further analyses.</population>

            <title>AMES Therapy and Diagnostic</title>
            <description>AMES therapy: During treatment, the AMES device rotates the hand, into flexion and extension, while the patient assists with this motion,and while the lengthening muscle(s) are vibrated mechanically. At the end of the treatment, several diagnostic tests are performed to measure the participant's level of proprioceptive perception. This study provides for 25 AMES treatments and diagnostic tests over 8-13 weeks, at a rate of 2-3 sessions per week.
AMES Diagnostic: Immediately following the therapy session, the AMES device rotates the hand into flexion and extension, while the patient, with eyes closed, indicates verbally the perceived direction of motion.</description>

        <title>Frisbee Test - Device</title>
        <description>Testing proprioceptive sensation, the AMES device moves the subject's wrist through a 30 degree range, at variable speeds, as the subject attempts to identify when their wrist reaches a particular target, either by opening contact between the thumb and index finger (if possible) or blinking the eyes. The subject receives feedback about the accuracy of the testing.</description>

AMES Diagnostic: Immediately following the therapy session, the AMES device rotates the hand into flexion or extension, while the patient, with eyes closed, indicates the moment he/she perceives the hand passes through a prescribed joint angle.</description>
