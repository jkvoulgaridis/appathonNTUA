  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify and evaluate dissemination strategies to promote the
      uptake of evidence-based cancer and other chronic disease prevention among state-level public
      health practitioners. Dissemination strategies such as multi-day in-person training workshops
      and electronic information exchange modalities are hypothesized to associate with improved
      access and use of public health evidence and organizational supports for program and policy
      decision making based on evidence-based public health.

    <textblock>
      Evidence-based public health approaches to prevent cancer and other chronic diseases have
      been identified in recent decades and have the potential for high impact. Yet barriers to
      implement prevention approaches persist as a result of multiple factors including lack of
      organizational support, limited resources, competing priorities, and limited skill among the
      public health workforce. The purpose of this study was to learn how best to promote the
      adoption of evidence based public health practice related to chronic disease prevention. This
      cluster randomized trial aimed to evaluate the dissemination of public health knowledge about
      evidence-based prevention of cancer and other chronic diseases and test receptivity and
      usefulness of dissemination strategies directed toward state health department chronic
      disease practitioners to enhance capacity and organizational support for evidence-based
      chronic disease prevention. Twelve state health department chronic disease units were
      randomly selected and assigned to intervention or control. State health department staff and
      the university-based study team jointly identified, refined, and selected dissemination
      strategies. Intervention strategies included multi-day in-person training workshops, remote
      telephone follow-up and technical assistance, supplemental brief remote trainings, and health
      department work unit procedural changes to support and strengthen evidence-based decision
      making. Evaluation methods included pre-post surveys and structured qualitative phone
      interviews.
