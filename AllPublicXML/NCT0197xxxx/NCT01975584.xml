    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study. We are testing the physiologic, immune and chemical responses to
      stress. We believe the results of all measures to stress will be blunted in schizophrenia
      compared to healthy controls. We will test sex, early life stress and other factors on the
      relationship to a stress response.

      The proposed study examines the response of neuroimmune and inflammatory responses to a
      stress in both men and women with a DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective
      disorder. The measurements include stress hormones or other elements in the blood which
      indicate stress . Early childhood trauma/stress (ELS) information will be collected so we can
      examine differences in those with trauma histories vs. those with none by sex. There will be
      one visit for screening before the testing visit. The sample will consist of up to 45
      clinically stable inpatients and outpatients with DSM-IV schizophrenia or schizoaffective
      disorder, of which approximately 15 will be women. We will also enroll up to 45 healthy
      controls without a DSM-IV Axis I or II disorder. Prior to the study all subjects must meet
      inclusion and exclusion criteria including a medical history.

      The (TSST) is a standard and widely used research assessment procedure that is used to
      reliably induce stress in human research participants. The TSST uses situations where people
      think they are being socially evaluated during an interview for a job. Participants are told
      they are competing with other people for this job, and their task is to convince interviewers
      that they are the best person for the job. Participants are told they have to prepare a
      speech, and complete a math challenge in their head.

    <description>Participants will participate in a standardized role play (Trier Social Stress Test ). A role play is pretending to be in a certain situation. A research staff member will describe the role play, during which teh participant will act out a scene. Participants will be asked to imagine that they are in a certain role with several other research team members who will also participate in the role play. Participants will also be asked to do some math problems without using paper or pencil.</description>
