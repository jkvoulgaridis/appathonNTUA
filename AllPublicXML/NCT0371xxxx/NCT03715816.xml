  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Minimally invasive surgeons have a prevalence of work-related musculoskeletal complaints of
      up to 86% due to the exposure to static loading, awkward postures, work pressure, and
      patient's wellbeing. Researchers have developed postural interventions to counteract the
      prevalence of musculoskeletal complaints and disorders, such as robot-assisted surgeries,
      arm-support systems, and rotatable handle pieces. An alternative intervention is to implement
      work breaks during the surgeries, which has shown to give promising results including that
      surgery duration does not prolong.

      The aim of the current study is to simulate 90-min laparoscopic surgery activities in the
      laboratory and compare two intervention situations with the control situation. The control
      situation is without work breaks. The two intervention situations include 2.5-min breaks
      provided two times, i.e. after every 30-min work period, which are passive (rest) or active
      (targeted mobilization exercises). The assessment is based on changes in muscular activity on
      the back and upper extremities, back and upper extremity postures, feelings of discomfort,
      and work performance.
