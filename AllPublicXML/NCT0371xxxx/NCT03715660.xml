    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this prospective, single-centre study is to establish the clinical
      performance characteristics of Xpert Bladder Cancer Monitor on the GeneXpert Instrument
      Systems in comparison to the methods currently used at the site for detecting recurrent
      bladder cancer.

    <description>Xpert Bladder Cancer Monitor, is a qualitative in vitro diagnostic test designed to monitor for the recurrence of bladder cancer in patients previously diagnosed with bladder cancer.The test utilizes a voided urine specimen and measures the levels of five targetmRNAs (ABL1, CRH, IGF2, UPK1B, ANXA10) by means of real-time, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The Xpert Bladder Cancer Monitor is indicated as an aid to standard clinical evaluation in monitoring for bladder cancer recurrence in patients previously diagnosed with bladder cancer and should be used in conjunction with other clinical measures to assess disease recurrence.</description>
