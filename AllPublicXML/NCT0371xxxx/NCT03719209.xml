  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the effect and impact of a technology which
      creates a virtual reality (VR), personalized representation of a patient's endoscopic
      findings in comparison our standard practice (SP). Our study will compare the level of
      knowledge, understanding and satisfaction the patient and family have between those receiving
      SP and those receiving both SP and VR.

    <description>Our study will measure the levels of patient and family engagement using a survey designed specifically for the study. The survey is at a roughly 3rd grade reading level and includes approximately 10 questions with answers on a Likert scale. The internally designed survey will specifically measure patient and family opinions on learning about the results of their procedure, as well as objective anatomical knowledge. The minimum score for each question is a 1, designating &quot;Strongly disagree.&quot; The maximum score for each question is a 10, designating &quot;Strongly agree.&quot; Thus, higher scores represent better outcomes.</description>

    <measure>Patient Satisfaction Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Satisfaction Scale (Hojat et al., 2011) will be used to measure patient satisfaction. The Patient Satisfaction Scale is a validated survey with 10 questions. Respondents can answer 1 through 7 for each question. 1 represents &quot;Strongly Disagree&quot; while 7 represents &quot;Strongly Agree.&quot; Higher score represent better outcomes in this scale.</description>

    <measure>Client Satisfaction Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (Larsen et al., 1979) will measure client satisfaction. The questionnaire has 8 questions with 4 possible answers for each question. A 4 represents the best possible outcome; a 1 represents the worst possible outcome.</description>

    <description>HealthVoyager is a virtual reality application that allows providers to create customized representations for patients and share the results of endoscopic procedures via an interactive platform. The app can show both normal and abnormal endoscopic findings and anatomy. Families will also receive a web link so that they may access the procedure results via the app at home on their smartphone or tablet.</description>
