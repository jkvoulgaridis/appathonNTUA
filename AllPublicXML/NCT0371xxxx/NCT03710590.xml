  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to find out how different types of electronic
      cigarettes settings, combined with e-liquids of differing nicotine concentrations, affect
      blood nicotine levels, use behavior (how users puff), and how users feel.

    <intervention_model_description>The purpose of this study is to determine differences in nicotine delivery, use behavior (puff topography), carbon monoxide delivery, subjective effects, and physiological effects, when cigarette smokers and experienced electronic cigarette users use an electronic cigarette with different settings (different voltage and resistance settings, which together determine power levels) and different e-liquid concentrations.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Change in blood pressure, measured in mm/hg</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>General Labeled Magnitude Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>The General Labeled Magnitude Scale will be administered twice in each approximately 4 hour session--after a 5-minute 10 puff use bout, and after the approximately 90 minute ad lib period.</time_frame>
    <description>This scale measures the flavor sensation, harshness, and throat hit (in three questions that correspond to those constructs) of the e-cigarette used in each session. The scale ranges from 0 - 100, with 0 being no sensation and 100 being the strongest imaginable sensation of any kind. Each item if scored nd analyzed separately (there are no sub-scales).</description>
