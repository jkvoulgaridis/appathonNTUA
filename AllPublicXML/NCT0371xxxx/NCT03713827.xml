    <textblock>
      This is a double blinded, split mouth, randomized clinical study that evaluated the
      performance of a glass hybrid restorative material in non-carious servical lesions in
      patients with bruxism. The lesions were restored with glass hybrid restorative (Equia Forte)
      or nano ceramic composite resin (Ceram-x One). Restorations were evaluated after 24 months
      according to USPHS criteria and the data were evaluated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical performance of a glass-hybrid-restorative
      compared with a nano ceramic composite resin in non-carious cervical lesions (NCCLs) of
      patients with bruxism.

      For this purpose, twenty-five patients having NCCLs and bruxism enrolled to the present
      study. Before treatment, the dimensions of the NCCLs were measured in depth, gingival-incisal
      height and mesio-distal width using a CPI probe. Degree of tooth wear (TWI) and gingival
      conditions (GI) are also recorded. A total of 148 NCCLs were randomly restored with a a
      glass-hybrid-restorative system (Equia Forte Fil, GC, Tokyo, Japan) or a nano ceramic
      composite resin (Ceram.X One Universal, Dentsply, DeTrey, Konstanz, Germany) and restorations
      were evaluated at baseline and after 6,12 and 24 months according to the modified-USPHS
      criteria. Data were analyzed with Chi- Square, Fisher's Exact Test, Mann Whitney-U and
      Cochran's Q tests (p &lt; 0.05).

    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary factor for determining the clinical performance of a restorative material is the retention rate. It represents the survival rates of the restorations after a period of time. According to ADA guidelines, a restorative material should show at leat 90% alpha retention rate after 18 months to be considered as clinically acceptable. The retention is assesed as alpha (retentive restoratation) or charlie (failed restoration). Clinical evaluation is performed to examine if the restoration is in place or has fallen.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>marginal adaptation score alpha</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>It represents the marginal integrity of the restorations. It is scored as alpha (perfect marginal adaptation), bravo (detectable marginal discrepency, clinically acceptable) or charlie (marginal crevice, clinically unacceptable). The examination of marginal adaptation is performed by clinical examination of the restoration with probe.</description>
