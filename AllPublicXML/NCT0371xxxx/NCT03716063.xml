  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will take disease-free survival time and recurrence and metastasis rate as the
      main evaluation indexes, to evaluate the clinical efficacy of strengthening the spleen and
      reducing phlegm method in patients with stage II high-risk and stage III colorectal cancer
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study enrolled 350 patients with stage II high-risk and stage III colorectal cancer who
      underwent adjuvant chemotherapy (based on a 5-fluorouracil（5-FU） regimen for at least 3
      months) and patients who received chemotherapy for less than 3 months. The study will use a
      large sample, multicenter, randomized, double-blind study. The experimental group was given
      oral Jianpi Huatan dispensing granule, once a day in the morning and evening, 1 course per 1
      month, a total of 3 courses; the control group of oral Chinese medicine formula low dose
      control granules (including the test group dose 1 /10), 1 time each morning and evening, 1
      course per month, for a total of 3 courses.

      The patients were followed up once a month during the treatment period and once every 3-6
      months after the end of treatment until the patient relapsed, died or the study was over.Some
      patients in the study will be tested for circulating tumor cells.

      Main outcome measures is Disease-free survival time（DFS）and Metastasis recurrence rate in 1
      year；Secondary outcome measures：Quality of life score: applied quality of life
      scale.Metastasis recurrence rate in 2、3years.

    <masking_description>This study was double-blind. According to the randomized results, the experimental group was given orally therapeutic granules, while the control group was given orally low-dose granules. Random sequence was generated by professional statisticians of group leader unit by statistical software. 350 subjects were divided into experimental group and control group according to the ratio of 1:1, 175 cases in each group. Random seeds and random sequences are stored as confidential data in opaque envelopes, and emergency envelopes are handed over to a third party to ensure that patients, researchers and outcome evaluators are unaware of the patient group before blindness is uncovered. After successful screening and signing the informed consent form, the patient can open a random envelope in turn and record the subject's name, hospital number and admission time on the envelope.</masking_description>
