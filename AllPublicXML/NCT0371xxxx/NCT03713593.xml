  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lenvatinib
      (E7080/MK-7902) in combination with pembrolizumab (MK-3745) versus lenvatinib in combination
      with placebo as first-line therapy for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma in
      adult participants.

      The primary hypotheses of this study are that lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab is superior to
      lenvatinib plus placebo with respect to progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival
      (OS).
