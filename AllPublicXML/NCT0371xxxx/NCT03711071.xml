  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exploring patients` ideas, concerns and expectation (ICE) is a communication tool to promote
      patient centredness and shared decision making during a consultation. This study evaluates
      whether offering ICE training to doctors can decrease overdiagnosis in the management of
      acute backache.

      The study is a cluster randomized trial recruiting general practitioner from practices in
      Northern Bavaria/Germany forming a research network within the recently implemented framework
      of PRO PRICARE (Preventing Overdiagnosis in Primary Care).

      At baseline, the intervention group (24 out of 48 doctors) will take part in a one-day
      training session covering theoretical background and clinical implementation of ICE
      communication in association with frequent consultation contents.

      Primary outcome measure are referrals to physiotherapists and medical specialists such as
      orthopaedic surgeons, neurologists and radiologists, obtained from routinely collected
      practice data. Secondary outcomes are patients' and doctors' satisfaction measured via
      structured questionnaires and semi-structured interviews. Blinding is attempted by hiding the
      trial purpose and treatment allocation from the participating doctors.
