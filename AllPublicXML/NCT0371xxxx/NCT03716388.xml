  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ulcerative colitis is a chronic idiopathic inflammatory disease of the colon that is
      characterized by abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea. The pathogenesis of UC involves a
      complex interplay of genetic factors, immune dysregulation and environmental triggers.
      Conventional therapies for UC (including 5-aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, azathioprine or
      6-mercaptopurine and biologics) focus on altering the immune response by suppression of
      immune cells. However, the primary pathogenic mechanism underlying UC maybe gut microbiota
      dysbiosis and a dysfunctional intestinal barrier resulting in an aberrant host immune
      response. Several studies have shown reduced microbial diversity in UC patients with under
      representation of anti-inflammatory phyla (Bacteroides and Firmicutes), and a relative
      increase of pro-inflammatory phyla (Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria). Motivated by this,
      therapies targeting intestinal dysbiosis (prebiotics, probiotics, synbiotics and fecal
      microbiota transplant (FMT)) have thus been tried in patients with UC. Though several case
      series and subsequently four high quality randomized controlled trails have established the
      efficacy of FMT in induction of remission in active UC, all these studies have used it as an
      add-on therapy, along with the previously ongoing conventional therapies. The investigators
      aim to assess the safety and efficacy of FMT as the sole modality for induction of remission
      in patients with newly diagnosed active UC.

      This will be a prospective randomised placebo-controlled trial. Newly diagnosed treatment
      naive patients with mild to moderately severe UC will be recruited (n=15). The patients will
      be randomized into 3 groups; i.e group I (n=5): FMT with placebo, group II (n=5): FMT with
      mesalamine, group III (n=5): Placebo infusion with mesalamine. The patients will undergo
      colonoscopic administration of fecal slurry (groups I and II) or placebo (group III) at weeks
      0,2,6,10 and 14. Mesalamine will be administered in a dose of 4g/day. In case of clinical
      worsening during the study, a short course of steroids will be added. The primary end point
      will be clinical remission (Mayo score ≤2, all subscores ≤ 1) at week 14. Secondary end
      points will be achievement of endoscopic remission (endoscopic Mayo score 0) and histological
      remission (Nancy grade 0, 1) at the end of 14 weeks.
