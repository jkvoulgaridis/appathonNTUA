      This cluster randomized controlled study evaluates the effect of a tailored observation,
      reflection and communication tool on used by long-term care facility staff on antibiotic
      prescription for urinary tract infection in long-term care facility residents.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Healthcare-associated infections due to antimicrobial use in long-term care facilities (LTCF)
      is an increasing problem in europe. It is well established that there exists a positive
      correlation between the amount of antibiotics used in treatment and resistant bacteria in
      both individual patients and society as a whole. A point-prevalence audit from 2017 in LTCFs
      showed that 10.5% of all LTCF residents in Denmark are treated with an antibiotic agent. In
      78% of the cases, the cause for treatment was urinary tract infection (UTI). In addition,
      this group of elderly are particularly vulnerable to healthcare-associated infections, drug
      interactions and adverse effects. Thus, there are persuasive reasons for reducing antibiotic
      use in this specific group.

      In the diagnostic process for UTI in a LTCF resident, there are several non-clinical factors
      influencing the diagnosis and leading to unnecessary treatment. First, because of dementia,
      sequelae from apoplexies, difficulties walking and other ailments, the typical LTCF resident
      is unable to express symptoms clearly and attend the GPs office. Consequently, the diagnosis
      is based on observations made by LTCF staff, which are then communicated to the General
      Practitioner (GP). Second, the prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria is up to 50% in this
      particular group. Though several studies have found that asymptomatic bacteriuria is a benign
      condition, it continues to be treated. Third, unspecific symptoms such as mental status
      change, falls or decreased function are unlikely to be caused by UTI. However, unspecific
      symptoms are still driving diagnosis and treatment of UTI. These factors may influence
      diagnosis and treatment in the Danish LTCF setting and therefore, a significant portion of
      the prescribed antibiotics for UTI could be due to overtreatment.

      There is some evidence suggesting that antibiotic stewardship programs focusing on education
      of LTCF staff decreases antibiotic prescriptions and increases adherence to guidelines. In
      addition, there is moderate evidence that the widely used communication tool ISBAR
      (Identification, Situation, Background, Analysis, Recommendation) improves patient safety by
      improving interprofessional communication especially when communicating over the phone. Thus,
      if LTCF staff were educated on relevant observation, how to approach ASB, unspecific symptoms
      and structured handover of clinical information, the impact of these factors on diagnosis and
      treatment of UTI in LTCF residents may decrease. Overall, antibiotic stewardship programs in
      LTCF are somewhat effective. However, most of these were targeted at prescribers only or
      prescribers and nurses and some were also prone to bias because of the choice of study
      design. At present, there exists no cluster Randomized Controlled Trials (cRCT) targeting
      only LTCF staff with nursing tasks through a combined education- and communication-centered
      intervention.

    <description>The intervention has two parts: an educational session and a dialogue tool. The educational session consists of 75 minutes of education in diagnosing urinary tract infection. The dialogue tool consists of 1) a checking box for the most important symptoms and observations for urinary tract infection 2) an algorithm to evaluate if urinary tract infection is likely based on the present symptoms and observations 3) a list of reflection points to evaluate with a collegue 4) a specialized ISBAR (communication tool) if long-term care facility staff finds it appropriate to contact the General Practicioner</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  LTCFs eligible for inclusion have common service areas with attending staff 24 hours a
             day and they cannot be specialized i.e. not psychiatric LTCFs or LTCFs for the blind,
             except for LTCFs specialized in dementia. The residents living in these types of
             facilities requires a level of care that typically ensures that the LTCF staff handles
             all contact with the GP on behalf of the resident, while the LTCF residents remains a
             somewhat homogenous group.

          -  We include only social and health helpers, social and health assistants and nurses,
             who have a permanent contract at the LTCF and do day- or evening shifts for the
             educational session. It is optional for the LTCF to use the educational material to
             educate LTCF staff in nightshifts. However, a UTI is rarely observed and reported
             during the night, which is why we chose this pragmatic approach. Usually, if a UTI is
             suspected, the night shift will report to the day shift, who then reevaluates and
             contacts the GP if necessary. We also target the permanently employed, as they are the
             majority of employees with nursing responsibilities and set the standard for the
             temporary staff.

          -  All incidents of suspected UTI in LTCF residents or antibiotic prescriptions for UTI
             must be registered. All registrations must be made on LTCF residents above 65 years of
             age and with a permanent address at the LTCF, otherwise the incidence of ASB is
             different than assumed in preparing the intervention.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  None
