  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase I study of oncolytic polio/rhinovirus recombinant (PVSRIPO) to
      primarily characterize the safety and tolerability of PVSRIPO in patients with AJCC Stage
      IIIB, IIIC, or IV melanoma in a modified 3+3 phase 1 trial design. Lesion biopsies and blood
      samples will be obtained pre- and post-injection throughout the study for routine
      histology/molecular genetic testing and immunologic analysis, respectively. Exploratory
      objectives include describing the response rates of PVSRIPO-injected versus non-injected
      lesion(s), the number of CD8 positive T cells present in the tumor biopsies before and after
      injection of PVSRIPO, and after PVSRIPO administration: the pathologic response in tumor
      biopsies, changes in the tumor microenvironment, and how systemic immune cell populations may
      change.

      The Primary Objective of the study is to determine the safety profile of PVSRIPO in Stage
      IIIB, IIIC, and IV recurrent melanoma patients as determined by DLTs when PVSRIPO is injected
      intralesionally into 1 to 3 cutaneous or subcutaneous lesions. As planned, up to 12 patients
      may be treated with PVSRIPO. A modified 3+3 phase 1 trial design will be implemented over
      three dosing cohorts and additional cohorts will be based on the number of toxicities noted.

      Biopsy material will be obtained from tumor tissue prior to and following virus
      administration, which may be subjected to routine histology along with molecular genetic
      testing and evaluation of pathological response. Whole blood for immunologic analyses will
      also be collected throughout the study period.

      Routine study visits will occur through Day 126. Thereafter, visits will occur every 2-3
      months for up to 2 years for subjects who do not progress. For patients with progressive
      disease, chart review only will occur every 3 months starting at the time of progression.
