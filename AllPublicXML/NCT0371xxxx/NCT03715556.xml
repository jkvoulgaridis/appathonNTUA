  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Amiodarone is considered the medicine of choice in heart rate control in critically ill
      patients with atrial fibrillation with high ventricular response. However, a recent
      retrospective study showed a greater number of events in critical patients in whom there was
      an attempt to control versus in which there was no. Therefore, the prospective and randomized
      comparative use of amiodarone in this group of patients has not yet been described. The aim
      of this study was to evaluate the safety of the use of amiodarone (restricted group) versus
      placebo (liberal group) in heart rate control in atrial fibrillation with high ventricular
      response in patients with sepsis and vasopressor cardiovascular dysfunction. For this, a
      unicentric, randomized, blind and prospective study will be performed, in which the
      restrictive versus liberal strategy is performed in a comparative way. Hospital data (test
      results, medical evolutions complications) of patients will be analyzed to calculate safety
      and effectiveness. Expected results: The liberal strategy is superior to the restrictive
      strategy and causes fewer adverse events.

    <description>Amiodarone (5 mg / kg EV in 30 minutes) will be the drug of choice in the Restricted group blinded to the principal investigator. If there is no reversal / control and there is no adverse event, a further dose of the same previously administered medicinal product will be performed within 30 minutes, amiodarone 3 mg / kg. After the second dose, continuous infusion of amiodarone at a dose of 900 mg in 24 hours will be initiated. Administration of the drug will be blinded within the first hour to the principal investigator.</description>
