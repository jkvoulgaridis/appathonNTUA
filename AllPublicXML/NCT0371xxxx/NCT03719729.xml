  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this single-arm, one-stage Phase II study, the investigators hypothesize that gut
      decontamination with rifaximin will reduce the frequency of hospital admission due to painful
      crisis in patients with SCD. The study will accrue 20 SCD patients who had at least two
      hospital admissions in the previous 12 months. These patients will receive rifaximin 550 mg
      twice a day for a total of 12 months. This following clinical parameters will be measured: 1.
      Changes in the annual rate of hospital admissions due to painful crisis; 2. Changes in the
      annual rate of days hospitalized; 3. Annual rates of uncomplicated crises; 4. Annual rate of
      acute chest syndrome; 5. Changes in the quality of life; and 6). Toxicities. The following
      laboratory parameters will be measured: 1. Changes in the number of circulating activated
      neutrophils; 2. Changes in the intestinal microbiome diversity; 3. Changes in the urinary
      3-indoxyl sulfate levels; 4. Changes in the serum biomarkers of intestinal permeability
      (lipopolysaccharides; zonulin, citrulline, and fatty acid binding proteins).

      In this single-arm Phase II study, the investigators will accrue 20 SCD patients who had at
      least two hospital admissions in the previous 12 months to receive rifaximin 550 mg twice a
      day for a total of 12 months. The investigators will measure changes in the annual rate of
      hospital admissions due to vaso-occlusive crisis and the annual rate of hospital days. The
      investigators will also determine the annual rates of uncomplicated crises and acute chest
      syndrome. Quality of life due to the disease and to treatment will be determined using a
      questionnaire. This study will be complemented with exploratory laboratory studies to
      determine changes in the number of circulating activated neutrophils, intestinal microbiome
      diversity, urinary 3-indoxyl sulfate levels and serum biomarkers of intestinal permeability
      (lipopolysaccharides; zonulin, citrulline, and fatty acid binding proteins).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with HbSS, HbSC, or HbS beta thal.

          2. Age 18-70 years.

          3. More than two hospital admissions for painful VOC in the prior 12 months, whether on
             any anti-sickling agents (e.g. hydroxyurea, L-glutamine, or transfusion therapy) or
             not. These agents may be continued during the study period. However, subjects are not
             allowed to be started on any of these agents during the study period.
