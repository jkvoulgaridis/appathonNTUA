    <textblock>
      The Conventus CAGE™ PH (PH Cage) System Post-Approval Observational Data Collection Study
      (Study) is a single center, prospective, post-approval clinical study designed to collect
      device and procedure experience in everyday clinical practice.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective, non-randomized, post-market approval data collection study that
      is designed to collect device/procedure and outcome data on patients who have experienced
      proximal humerus bone fractures and received a PH Cage.

      Specifically, the study will provide:

        1. Patient outcome and performance data for the implant and implant procedure that that may
           be used to support scientific publications.

        2. Assurance of continued product safety and effectiveness.

    <time_frame>Change from Baseline in Constant Murley Score at the 2 year post op</time_frame>
    <description>Constant Murley Score (CMS) The Constant Murley Score is a combination of visual analog scales assessing pain, activities of daily living and assessments of range of motion and strength using a long-armed goniometer and isometer. The higher the score the better for the following sections of the CMS: A. Pain (0-15 points) (e.g.15=no pain, 2=high pain), B. Everyday activities-question 1 (0-2 points) (e.g. 2=best, 0=worst), questions 2 and 3(0-4 points) (the higher the score the better), question 4 (0-10 points) C. Movement- questions 1 and 2 (0-20 points) (e.g. the greater the range of motion performed, the more points assigned), questions 3 and 4 (0-10 points) (e.g. points assigned based on movements performed) D. Strength (0-25 points) Score is calculated from the highest score of three attempts, with each score corresponding to the force in pounds (max 25 points) The overall score is then calculated by combining all sections (A+B+C+D= 0-100 points)</description>
