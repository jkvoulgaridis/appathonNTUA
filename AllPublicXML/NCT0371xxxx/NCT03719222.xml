  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Genomic alterations have long been recognized as an important factor in tumor formation and
      drive tumor cell growth. However, the degree of genomic mutation (tumor mutation load, TMB)
      varies widely between tumors. In addition to gene mutations in tumor cells, the extent of
      immune cell infiltration in tumor tissues and the type and nature of immune cells (tumor
      microenvironment, TME) also play an important role in controlling tumor growth.

      In recent years, more and more clinical studies have shown that the degree of genomic
      alteration (TMB) and tumor microenvironment (TME) have great potential in predicting a cancer
      patients' response to immunotherapy. Therefore, understanding the interaction and correlation
      between genomic alteration and tumor immune environment will not only deepen our
      understanding of tumor biology but also provide an important reference for developing
      immunotherapy treatment strategies for solid tumors.

      This is a non-interventional, mono-centric retrospective study to be carried out in Chi Mei
      Medical Center (CMMC) in order to determine the association between the genomic alterations
      and gene expression level of immune-related genes in cancer. Samples in paraffin-embedded
      block of biopsies or surgical pieces (either primary tumor or metastases) will be analyzed.
      For each sample, clinically relevant data associated with treated cancer and needed for
      characterization of tumor microenvironment will be documented. No additional procedures
      besides those already used in the routine clinical practice will be applied to the patients.
      Treatment assignment will be done according to the current practice.

      This trial is, through accessing to archival tumor materials, to establish the relationship
      between tumor mutation burden and tumor immune microenvironment for future immunotherapy
      strategy.
