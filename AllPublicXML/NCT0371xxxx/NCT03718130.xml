      To evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of the hantaan virus (HTNV), puumala virus (PUUV),

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The development of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) vaccines, such as those to be utilized in this
      study, is based on the observation that antigen-encoding DNA plasmids can induce both
      cellular and humoral immune responses against various viral and bacterial pathogens. DNA
      vaccines are perceived as having a number of potential advantages over other types of
      vaccines. For example, DNA vaccines are easily constructed by recombinant technology; easily
      and inexpensively manufactured as a well-characterized molecule [DNA plasmid]; and at boost,
      not eliminated by prior immune response to the carrier or vector. Furthermore, as nonliving
      vaccines, they cannot lead to infection. The object of DNA vaccination is to deliver DNA into
      the nuclei of cells capable of presenting the encoded antigen to immune reactive cells that
      can elicit an immune response.

      The study will enroll 6 randomized groups of 12 subjects each, for a total of 72 subjects.
      This approach will ensure at least 60 subjects complete all vaccinations at around 10
      subjects per group, taking possible attrition into account. Subjects will receive one dose of
      vaccine on each of Days 0, 28, and 56 either intramuscularly or intradermally by
      electroporation and will be followed until Day 220.

             of screening

          -  Have demonstrated adequate comprehension of the protocol by achieving a score of at
             least 80% correct on a short multiple-choice quiz. Individuals who fail to achieve a
             passing score on the initial quiz will be given the opportunity to retest after a
             review of the protocol information. Individuals who fail the quiz for the second time
             will not be enrolled.

          -  Have provided written informed consent before screening

          -  Subject is in good health as determined by past medical history, medication use, and
             abbreviated physical examination

               -  Good health is defined by the absence of any medical condition described in the
                  exclusion criteria in a subject with a normal abbreviated physical examination
                  including vital signs. If the subject has another current, ongoing medical
                  condition, the condition cannot meet any of the following criteria: (1) first
                  diagnosed within 3 months of enrollment, (2) is worsening in terms of clinical
                  outcome in last 6 months, or (3) involves need for medication that may pose a
                  risk to subject's safety or impede assessment of adverse events or immunogenicity
                  if they participate in the study.

               -  An abbreviated physical examination differs from a complete physical examination
                  in that it does not include a genitourinary and rectal examination.

          -  Available and able to participate for all study visits and procedures

          -  Sexually active men and women of childbearing potential must agree to use an effective

               -  A sexually active man is defined as one whose partner is a woman of childbearing
                  potential (see definition below) and has not had a vasectomy performed &gt; 1 year
                  prior to screening. They must agree not to father a child until 6 months after
                  the last vaccination. These subjects must agree to use a barrier method of birth
                  control (eg, either condom with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream or partner usage
                  of occlusive cap [diaphragm or cervical/vault caps] with spermicidal
                  foam/gel/film/cream/suppository).

               -  Women of childbearing potential are defined as those who have not been sterilized
                  via tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy,
                  hysterectomy, or successful Essure® placement (permanent, non-surgical,
                  non-hormonal sterilization) with history of documented radiological confirmation
                  test at least 90 days after the procedure and are still menstruating or &lt; 1 year
                  of the last menses if perimenopausal. For this study, an effective contraceptive
                  method is defined as one that results in a failure rate of less than 1% per year
                  when it is used consistently and correctly (see the Manual of Procedures [MOP]
                  for a list of acceptable methods).

          -  Female subjects agree to not donate eggs (ova, oocytes), and male subjects agree to
             not donate sperm from the start of screening until at least 6 months after the last
             vaccination.

          -  Negative hantavirus PsVNA test result at screening

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of prior infection with any hantavirus virus or prior participation in an
             HTNV, PUUV, or Andes virus vaccine trial.

        Dobrava virus transmission

          -  History of severe local or systemic reactions to any vaccine or vaccine products or a
             history of severe allergic reactions.

          -  Is currently participating in or plans to participate in another study involving any
             investigational product (eg, vaccine, drug, or biologics) or a study that involves
             blood drawing, and/or an invasive procedure.

               -  An invasive procedure includes endoscopy, bronchoscopy, or procedure requiring
                  administration of IV contrast or removal of tissue.
