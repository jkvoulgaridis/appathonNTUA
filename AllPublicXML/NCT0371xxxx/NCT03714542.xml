  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The precision of MRI has improved over the past few years, in particular for the
      hepatobiliary and pancreatic pathologies. The role of MRI in the management of operated
      pancreas tumors remains nevertheless unclear and few studies have compared MRI to the actual
      gold standard (CT). Compared to CT, MRI is not only a morphologic imaging technique but also
      a functional imaging technique. MRI could therefore evaluate in a non-ionizing and dynamic
      way several important pre- and postoperative aspects after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD). This
      study on the perioperative role of MRI includes 3 parts:

      First, CT is known to minimize the real size of the pancreatic tumors and to underestimate
      the vascular invasion correlated to resectability. The preoperative determination of the
      resection surgical margins could be improved thanks to the high-contrast resolution of MRI.

      Moreover, PD is a complex surgery encompassing a fragile anastomosis between the pancreatic
      parenchyma and the digestive tract. The permeability of the pancreatic anastomosis after PD
      remains presently unknown and has not been correlated to the clinical state of the patient.
      MRI associated with secretin injection allows evaluating this permeability, which cannot be
      done by CT due to the absence of functional evaluation.

      Finally, present radiological follow-up after PD for tumors of the pancreatic head is
      performed with CT. The MRI performance has not been demonstrated yet in the context of
      follow-up. This imaging modality nevertheless offers unique specificities that are very
      interesting and that could be helpful for the diagnosis of recurrence.
