  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is the most common form of vasculitis after age 50. It is a
      vasculitis affecting the large vessels, in particular the aorta and its collateral vessels,
      especially those in the external carotid area.

      Corticosteroids are the cornerstone of GCA treatment. They are very effective but are
      generally continued for 18 to 24 months or more since at least 30% of patients with GCA will
      relapse during their follow-up. Thus, the vast majority of patients treated for GCA have at
      least one adverse event from corticosteroid therapy, which is the main source of morbidity in
      these elderly patients.

      Reducing the use of corticosteroids, especially during relapses, is therefore a major
      objective to improve the treatment of patients with GCA. Methotrexate, abatacept and
      tocilizumab have been shown to be effective during GCA. However, the therapeutic effect of
      the first two is modest. As for tocilizumab, its use has many limitations: suspensive effect,
      many contraindications and there are no biological parameters available for reliable
      monitoring of inflammatory syndrome in these patients.

      Recent data have shown the major role of T helper (Th) Th1 and Th17 T cells in the
      pathophysiology of GCA. Th17 lymphocytes are sensitive to corticosteroid therapy but Th1
      persists despite treatment and produces interferon-γ which activates macrophages and smooth
      muscle cells, leading to remodelling of the vascular wall responsible for ischemic GCA
      manifestations. Joint targeting of Th17 and Th1 responses is therefore necessary to fully
      treat the vascular inflammation that exists during GCA. Ustekinumab, which is a monoclonal
      antibody blocking the subunit common to IL-12 and IL-23 (p40), blocks the Th1 and Th17
      responses, and could therefore be an excellent treatment for GCA.

      This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of ustekinumab for the treatment of GCA relapses.

      Very little data is available on the use of ustekinumab during GCA. Recently, 14 patients
      with refractory GCA, defined as the occurrence of at least 2 relapses and the inability to
      reduce the prednisone dose below 10 mg/d, received ustekinumab treatment. No patients
      relapsed during treatment while the median dose of prednisone was reduced from 20 to 5 mg/d.

      Ustekinumab has also been used successfully in a patient with refractory GCA. Under
      treatment, the patient did not have a new relapse and the dose of prednisone was reduced. In
      addition, there was a major decrease in the percentages of circulating Th1 and Th17
      lymphocytes.

      However, to date, no controlled studies have been conducted to confirm the efficacy of
      ustekinumab during GCA relapses.

      This guarantees the originality and innovation of this study.
