  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, investigators will examine the brain mechanism behind the synergistic effects
      of combining acupuncture and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) treatments.
      Specifically, chronic low back pain (cLBP) patients will be recruited and randomized to one
      of four groups (30 per group, one month of treatment): 1) verum acupuncture + real tDCS, 2)
      sham acupuncture + real tDCS, 3) verum acupuncture + sham tDCS, and 4) sham acupuncture +
      sham tDCS. Investigators will study 1) the longitudinal (one-month) effects of different
      treatments as indicated by changes in resting state functional connectivity (rsFC), cerebral
      blood flow (CBF), clinical outcomes of low back pain, and quantitative sensory test (QST) and
      2) the association between these changes.

    <measure>Periaqueductal Gray (PAG) Resting State Functional Connectivity (rsFC) Changes</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (pre-intervention); post-intervention at Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will explore whether tDCS and acupuncture treatments evoke PAG rsFC connectivity changes. This outcome will be assessed by comparing participants' pre-treatment MRI scans to their post-treatment scans.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Outcomes as Measured by LBP Intensity Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (pre-intervention); post-intervention at Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The Low Back Pain Numeric Rating Scale (LBP NRS) will be used to assess clinical outcomes. Participants will be required to rate their pain on this scale prior to the first treatment and after all treatments.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF) Differences Before and After Treatments</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (pre-intervention); post-intervention at Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will examine CBF changes before and after treatment in several pain-related brain areas. CBF data will be collected during arterial spin labeling (ASL) scans that will take place before the first treatment and after the last treatment. Images from these scans will be aggregated to an average CBF-weighted image to be used for analysis.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST) Differences</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (pre-intervention); post-intervention at Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Participants' QST ratings will be analyzed before and after all treatments.</description>

    <measure>Differences in rsFC of M1 and Other Networks</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (pre-intervention); post-intervention at Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Similar to the CBF measure, rSFC will be analyzed from ASL data (obtained during MRI scanning). rSFC from pre- to post-treatment will be compared.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  volunteers 18-60 years of age

          -  meet the classification criteria of chronic low back pain (having low back pain for
             more than 6 months), as determined by the referring physician

          -  at least 4/10 clinical pain on the 11-point Low Back Pain Numeric Rating Scale (LBP
             NRS)

          -  at least a 10th grade English-reading level; English can be a second language provided
             that the patients understand all questions used in the assessment measures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  history of epilepsy or loss consciousness (LOC)

          -  specific causes of back pain (e.g. cancer, fractures, spinal stenosis, infections)

          -  complicated back problems (e.g. prior back surgery, medicolegal issues)

          -  the intent to undergo surgery during the time of involvement in the study

          -  history of cardiac, respiratory, or nervous system disease that, in the investigator's
             judgment, precludes participation in the study because of a heightened potential for

          -  presence of any contraindications to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning. For
             example: cardiac pacemaker, metal implants, claustrophobia, pregnancy, inability to
             remain still in MRI scanner
