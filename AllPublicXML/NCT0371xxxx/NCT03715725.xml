  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Using mandatory nationwide registries and possibly hospital electronic medical records in
      Norway, the researchers want to understand how well a group of drugs called &quot;non-vitamin K
      antagonist oral anticoagulants&quot; (rivaroxaban - Xarelto; apixaban - Eliquis; dabigatran -
      Pradaxa) works in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (this is a condition when
      the heart beats irregularly) compared to another older drug, a vitamin K antagonist oral
      anticoagulants (warfarin) and how safe these drugs are. The primary objective of the study is
      to assess the occurence of an ischemic stroke (a condition when an artery that brings blood
      to the brain is blocked) and intracranial hemorrhage (a serious condition when a diseased
      blood vessel within the brain bursts).

        The study population will comprise all adult OAC naïve NVAF patients in Norway who filled a
        prescription for an OAC (rivaroxaban, apixaban, dabigatran, warfarin) in the study period,
        defined as from 1 January 2014 to 30 June 2018 (or later depending on availability of data)
        and followed until outcome of interest, the end of the study period or death. This
        initiation of an OAC is the index event and requires that there is no previous prescription
        dispensed for an OAC in the preceding 365 days (from end date of OAC supply to date of new
        OAC dispensation).

             Defined as ICD10 codes; I480 (paroxysmal AF), I481 (persisting AF), I482 (chronic AF),
             I483 (typical AF), I484 (atypical AF) or I489 (unspecified atrial fibrillation or
             flutter) as given by either NPR (Norwegian Patient Register) or as a OAC (warfarin,

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Valvular atrial fibrillation defined as presence of ICD10 codes in NPR; I05.2 mitral
             stenosis with insufficiency, I05.8 other mitral valve diseases (mitral (valve)
             failure), I342 (non-rheumatic mitral valve stenosis), Z952 (presence of prosthetic
             heart valve) and procedure codes FKD (prosthetic replacement of mitral valve), FKA
             (Repair of mitral valve for stenosis), FKB (Annuloplasty of mitral valve for
             insufficiency), FKC (Repair of mitral valve for insufficiency), FKW (Other operations
             on mitral valve) and FMD (replacement of aortic valve).

             months before index date.

          -  Knee and/or hip replacement surgery (NCSP (Nordic Classification of Surgical
             Procedures) procedure codes; NGB, NGC, NFB or NFC) 5 weeks before index date.
