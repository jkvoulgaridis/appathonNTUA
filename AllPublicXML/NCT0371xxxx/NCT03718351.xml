  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transanal endoscopic microsurgery is the main treatment option for rectal tumors such as
      large adenoma, early cancer because of lower complications and mortality rates and shorter
      hospital stays rather than conventional surgery. Particularly, However, transanal endoscopic
      microsurgerymust be performed under either general or spinal anesthesia, and expensive
      surgical instruments are required. Colorectal endoscopic submucosal dissection is a novel
      endoscopic procedure that enables en bloc resection of benign colorectal lesions and early
      colorectal cancer. Endoscopic submucosal dissectioncan be performed under conscious sedation
      without anesthesia, and there are fewer hospital days than those for transanal endoscopic
      microsurgery. In the present study, we compared the treatment efficacy and safety between
      endoscopic submucosal dissectionand transanal endoscopic microsurgery for the treatment of
      early rectal neoplasms and large rectal adenomas.
