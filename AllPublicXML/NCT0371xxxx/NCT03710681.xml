  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multiple dose escalating and open labeled clinical trial to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of multiple subcutaneous (s.c.) injections of
      SHR-1314 in adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.

      The primary objective of this study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of multiple
      doses of subcutaneous SHR-1314 in subjects with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.
      Secondary objectives are to determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) and immunogenicity profile of
      SHR-1314 in subjects with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      16 subjects with 2 dose groups will be enrolled in the study, all of whom received the
      SHR-1314 without placebo control. There are 8 subjects in each cohort. The dose will be
      started at 160mg and will be escalated by following dose escalating rules. The primary
      endpoint is the safety and tolerability : adverse events, vital signs, physical examination,
      laboratory examination, 12 lead electrocardiogram, injection site reactions, etc.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female at age between 18 and 65 years old at screening.

          2. History of chronic plaque-type psoriasis for at least 6 months, with either documented
             medical history of psoriasis for at least 6 months or confirmation of the diagnosis by
             the Investigator at screening, if the subject was diagnosed by another physician.

          3. At the time of randomization, moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, defined by:

               -  PASI score of 12 or greater and

               -  PGA score of 3 or greater and

               -  BSA affected by plaque-type psoriasis of 10% or greater.

          4. A subject is a candidate for systemic psoriasis therapy and/or phototherapy and/or
             chemo phototherapy.

             within the last 4 weeks or at least 5 half-lives of the last dosing prior to

             other trials.

          9. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a

             positive human chorionic gonadotropin laboratory test at screening or Day 0.

         10. Females of childbearing potential (defined as all females physiologically capable of
             becoming pregnant) and males who are unwilling or unable to use highly effective
             contraception during the study and 21 weeks after the last administration of IP
             (anticipated 5 half-lives).
