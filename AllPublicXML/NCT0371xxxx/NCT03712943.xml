      The main purpose of this study is to test the safety, tolerable side effects, and determine
      the highest tolerable dose of the combination of Regorafenib and Nivolumab. Researchers want
      to find out if this combination of Regorafenib and Nivolumab can help people with metastatic
      colorectal cancer with mismatch repair (MMR) proficiency.
