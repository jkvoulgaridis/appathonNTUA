  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acupuncture research in regards to PONV has been fairly well established, however, studies
      about perioperative pain control and acupuncture are a little more murky. In 2008, a meta
      analysis looked at randomized controlled studies and found that while acupuncture was shown
      to decrease pain, there were limitations including credible placebo or sham intervention, and
      thus, blinding. The main purpose of this feasibility trial is to determine whether or not
      adequate blinding is possible in the intraoperative setting with the patient sedated.

    <description>Patients' ability to determine whether or not they received acupuncture. The success of patient blinding in each group will be quantified using the Bang Blinding Index which ranges from -1 to 1. Scores closest to 0 indicate a less likelihood that patients were able to guess which group they were randomized into. A score of 1 or -1 means that patients were able to guess which group they were in. This value is obtained by asking patients which group they believe they were randomly assigned to.</description>

    <description>Patients will receive spinal anesthesia (4 cc Mepivacaine) with IV sedation. Intraoperative anti-emetics will consist of IV odansetron and IV dexamethasone. Intra-operative analgesics will include IV Ketamine, IV Ketorolac, and IV Acetaminophen.
Patients will have ATP acupuncture (8 ear points - Hypothalamus, Amygdala, Hippocampus, Prefrontal Cortex, Point Zero, Shen Men, Insula, Vagus) bilaterally with electrostimulation at Shen men and Hypothalamus at 30 hz.</description>
