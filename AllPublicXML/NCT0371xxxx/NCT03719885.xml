    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate acute tear production produced by the intranasal
      tear neurostimulator in participants with Sjögrens syndrome and aqueous tear deficiency. Our
      primary goal is to evaluate whether Sjögrens patients respond to this intervention and
      whether there is a baseline tear production level below which these patients do not respond.
