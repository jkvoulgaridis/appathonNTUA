  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of pamiparib in participants with metastatic
      castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) positive for circulating tumor cells (CTC) with
      homologous recombination deficiency (CTC-HRD). All participants will receive pamiparib. The
      purpose of this study is to demonstrate that pamiparib will improve Objective Response Rate
      (ORR) and Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) response rate

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a global, Phase 2, open-label study of pamiparib in approximately 100 participants
      with with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) positive for circulating
      tumor cells (CTC) with homologous recombination deficiency (CTC-HRD). Participants in Cohort
      1 will include 50 mCRPC participants with CTC-HRD-positive, measurable metastatic disease
      (soft tissue with/without bone lesions), and positive BRCA1/2 mutation or negative/unknown
      BRCA1/2 mutation. Cohort 2 will include 30 mCRPC CTC-HRD positive participants with bone
      metastasis only and positive or negative/unknown BRCA1/2. Cohort 3 and 4 will include 20
      mCRPC CTC-HRD negative/unknown participants with BRCA1/2 positive mutations, metastatic
      disease (measurable soft tissue with/without bone), and bone only. Participants will undergo
      PSA level assessments approximately every 4 weeks as well as tumor assessments every 8 weeks,
      or as clinically indicated. Administration of pamiparib will continue until disease
      progression, unacceptable toxicity, death or another discontinuation criterion is met.
