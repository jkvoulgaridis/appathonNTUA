  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low thermal dissection devices have been introduced as a tool to improve surgical outcomes.
      PlasmaBlade, a low thermal dissection device, has shown to be associated with effective
      cutting, and significantly lower temperature than traditional electrosurgical dissection
      device. Thus, low thermal devices would improve flap perfusion by decreasing the thermal
      injury resulted by the dissection. Looking into the use of low thermal devices in cases of
      mastectomy and immediate breast reconstruction has not been documented. The aim of this study
      is to determine if there are clinical flap perfusion, surgical site drainage, and pain scores
      differences between mastectomy flaps created using low thermal dissection device and those
      done with the standard care of Bovie cautery in order to warrant a formal study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-blinded, randomized, controlled clinical trial comparing postoperative flap
      perfusion and surgical site drainage between patients randomized to breast flap creation by
      PlasmaBlade (low thermal dissection intervention) on one breast and by a Bovie cautery
      (Control) for the contralateral breast flap. Candidates will have elected to undergo
      bilateral post-mastectomy immediate breast reconstruction (IBR). Participants meeting
      inclusion criteria will be enrolled and baseline data collection completed prior to
      randomization and surgery.

      Patients and the plastic surgeon will be blinded in regards to intervention randomization.
      Only the oncology surgeon has knowledge of which device used for each breast flap. However,
      after the plastic surgeon makes the assessment of the flap, he/she will be unblinded in order
      to complete the reconstruction procedure using the same dissection device on the same side it
      was used for in the mastectomy procedure. Patient-specific surgical details will be recorded
      intraoperatively. Following the surgery, post-operative flap perfusion will be recorded using
      SPY imaging system. Surgical site drainage will be measured until drainage removal.
      Post-operative pain (Visual Analog Scale for Pain) and the occurrence of adverse events will
      be recorded up until discharge and 30-days postoperative follow up visit.
