      This is Phase 1, single-center, open-label, single-sequence drug-drug interaction study to
      determine the effect of CT1812 (560 mg) once daily on the pharmacokinetics of 4 probe drugs
      (tolbutamide, midazolam, dextromethorphan and omeprazole).

      This is Phase 1, single-center, open-label, single-sequence drug-drug interaction study to
      determine the effect of CT1812 (560 mg) once daily on the pharmacokinetics of 4 probe drugs
      (tolbutamide, midazolam, dextromethorphan and omeprazole).

      Each subject will qualify for entry into the study within 35 days before admission to the
      clinical unit. Subjects will check into the clinical unit on Day -3 for baseline assessments.
      Each subject will receive a single dose of each of the probe drugs on Day -2 as a 'cocktail'.
      A single dose of CT1812 and each of the probe drugs will be co-administered on Day 6. On Days
      1 through 5, subjects will receive a single daily dose of CT1812.

             study-related procedures.

          2. Men and women ≥ 18 and ≤ 55 years of age

          3. In good health as determined by medical history, physical exam, laboratory
             examinations, ECG, and vital signs

          4. BMI between 18 and 35 kg/m2, inclusive

          5. Have a normal 12-lead electrocardiogram, without any clinically significant
             abnormalities of rate, rhythm or conduction

          6. Non-smokers; defined as not having smoked in the previous 6 months

          7. Women who are neither pregnant (negative pregnancy test) nor nursing, and are either:

                  include abstinence and any double combination of: hormonal contraceptive,
                  intrauterine device (IUD), male or female condom, diaphragm, sponge, and cervical
                  cap. Spermicides may be used, but is not considered one of the required double
                  barrier methods. All premenopausal female subjects (regardless of whether they
                  are surgically sterile) must have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening
                  and baseline.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             gastrointestinal, hepatic, or central nervous system; or other conditions that may
             interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of study drug, or
             would place the subject at increased risk

          4. The presence of abnormal laboratory values which are considered clinically significant

          5. Positive screen for Hepatitis B (HbsAg, Hepatitis B Surface Antigen), Hepatitis C
             (anti HCV, Hepatitis C Antibody), or HIV (anti-HIV 1/2)

          6. Received an investigational drug within a period of 30 days prior to enrollment in the

          7. Received any drug therapy within 2 weeks prior to administration of the first dose of
             any study-related treatment. This exclusion is extended to 4 weeks for any drugs known
             to induce or inhibit hepatic drug metabolism.

          8. Consumption of alcohol within 14 days prior to dose administration or during any
             in-patient period

          9. A positive urine drug screen including ethanol, cocaine, THC, barbiturates,
             amphetamines, benzodiazepines, and opiates

         10. Any history of alcohol abuse, illicit drug use, significant mental illness, physical
             dependence to any opioid within the past two years, or any history of drug abuse or
             addiction within the past two years

         11. A history of difficulty with donating blood

         12. Donated whole blood within 45 days or blood products within 7 days prior to
