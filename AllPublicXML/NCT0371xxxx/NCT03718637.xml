  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are testing the efficacy of a new, FDA-approved bioinductive patch in
      lateral epicondylitis (tennis elbow) patients. A bioinductive patch is an implant that may
      foster tendon regrowth and healing following surgery. Patients will be randomize into one of
      two groups: control and investigational. Patients in the &quot;control group&quot; will receive the
      normal surgery for patients who do not respond to physical therapy, lifestyle changes, and
      anti-inflammatory treatment. Patients in the &quot;experimental group&quot; will receive the same
      surgical treatment, with the addition of the bioinductive patch. This patch will be implanted
      during surgery. Then, using a combination of ultrasound studies and other measures, the
      investigators will assess how well the patch works compared to surgery alone.

      A bioinductive patch is an implant that may foster tendon regrowth and healing following
      surgery. Patients will be randomized into one of two groups: control and investigational. All
      surgical patients will have failed non surgery options for 6 months (physical therapy,
      lifestyle changes, anti-inflammatories, injections) Patients in the &quot;control group&quot; will
      receive the standard surgery (open lateral epicondylectomy) . Patients in the &quot;experimental
      group&quot; will receive the same surgical treatment, with the addition of the bioinductive patch.
      This patch will be implanted during surgery. Then, using a combination of ultrasound studies
      and other measures, the investigators will assess how well the patch works compared to
      surgery alone.

    <intervention_model_description>Patients will be randomized into one of two groups. In the &quot;control group,&quot; patients will receive the current surgical treatment for lateral epicondylitis: tendon debridement and repair. Patients in the &quot;experimental group&quot; will receive a bio-inductive patch following the same surgical treatment. Both groups of patients will participate in preoperative and postoperative ultrasound imaging studies.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>The study participant will not have knowledge of which treatment group he/she is randomized into for the duration of the study. Because the care provider/investigator will be required to implant the bioinductive patch, the physician will know into which treatment group each patient falls.</masking_description>
