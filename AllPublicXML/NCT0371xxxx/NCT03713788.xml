  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates the influence of a remote, painful stimulus on stretch tolerance.
      Half of the participants will receive a conditioning painful stimulus following static
      stretching while the other half will rest quietly.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The effect of stretching on joint range of motion is primarily related to changes in the
      tolerance to stretch, but the mechanisms underlying this change are still largely unknown.

      The nervous system has an inbuilt ability to modulate the perceived magnitude of afferent
      noxious stimuli via supraspinally mediated endogenous pain inhibition or facilitation and by
      engaging endogenous mechanisms pain tolerance in healthy individuals is known to increase.
      Thus increasing the tolerance to pain could potentially increase range of motion following
      stretching.

    <intervention_model_description>A sample of convenience was recruited for this cross-sectional study. Participants were randomly assigned to a pain group or a control group using counterbalanced block randomization. Passive knee extension range of motion was measured three consecutive times with five-minute intervals between measurements. Both groups underwent a static stretch protocol consisting of two bouts of thirty-second constant-angle static stretching of the knee flexors with a one-minute rest between bouts. Subjects were instructed to keep the limb relaxed as the lower leg was passively moved towards extension. Following stretching, the post-stretch measurement was performed. Finally, subjects in the pain group were instructed to immerse their non-dominant hand into a container with circulating water at 1˚C to 4˚C and keep it there for 2 minutes. A Biodex system 4 pro dynamometer was used to quantify range of motion and passive resistive torque. Muscle activity was recorded as surface electromyography.</intervention_model_description>
