  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial is an exploratory, single-centre, uncontrolled, open-label, interventional trial of
      up to 19 weeks' duration to investigate flare and remission in subjects with
      moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) treated with cyclosporine A (CsA).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      40 subjects with moderate-to-severe AD will be treated with a 3-week course of high-dose CsA,
      which is a standard-of-care treatment regimen. After 3 weeks, all responders shift to oral
      low-dose CsA treatment (2-2.5 mg/kg/day) until onset of a second flare or until Week 16 (Day
      113).

      In case of a second AD flare, the subjects shift back to oral high-dose CsA treatment (4-5
      mg/kg/day) for 3 weeks.

        Main Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis and history of chronic, moderate-to-severe AD (by the Eichenfield revised
             criteria of Hanifin and Rajka) for at least 3 years before the screening visit.

          -  Subjects who have an AD flare at the start of the trial (EASI score ≥10 at screening
             and ≥16 at the baseline visit).

        Main Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Treatment with allergen immunotherapy within 6 months before the baseline visit.

          -  Treatment with leukotriene inhibitors, systemic glucocorticoids, or other systemic
             treatment for AD (including immunosuppressive treatment, ultraviolet therapy, and
             biologics) within 4 weeks before the baseline visit.

          -  Treatment with topical corticosteroids or topical calcineurin inhibitors within 1 week
             before the baseline visit.

          -  Chronic or acute infection requiring treatment with oral or intravenous antibiotics,
             anti-virals, anti-parasitics, anti-protozoals, or anti-fungals within 4 weeks before
             the screening visit or superficial skin infections within 1 week before the screening
             visit.

          -  History of malignancy within 5 years before the baseline visit, with the following
             exceptions: subjects with a history of completely treated carcinoma in situ of cervix,
             and non-metastatic squamous or basal cell carcinoma of the skin are allowed.

          -  Hypertension (&gt;150/95 mmHg) at the screening visit.

          -  Planned surgical procedure during the length of the subject's participation in this
             trial.

          -  Use of a tanning booth/parlour within 4 weeks before the screening visit.

          -  Pregnant, breastfeeding, or lactating women.
