      Registry of patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing catheter-based ablation of atrial
      fibrillation (pulmonary vein isolation) to determine long-term success rates of
      catheter-based ablation of atrial fibrillation (pulmonary vein isolation) and to evaluate
      factors associated with long-term success of catheter-based ablation of atrial fibrillation
      (pulmonary vein isolation).

      During the catheter-based ablation clinically indicated blood samples are necessary to
      monitor anticoagulation. The excess blood from these analyses and a small amount of blood
      (50ml per patient) will be stored at -80 CÂ° for future scientific analyses in a central
      biobank for long term storage. All biobank issues will be handled in accordance with the
      guidelines published by the Swiss Academy of Medical Sciences (published on www.samw.ch).
