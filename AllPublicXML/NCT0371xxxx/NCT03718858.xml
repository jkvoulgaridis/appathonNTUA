  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled trial to evaluating the impact of interscalene block on
      worsening of sleep disordered breathing in patients undergoing ambulatory shoulder surgery.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sleep disordered Breathing (SDB), closely associated with obesity, is a highly prevalent,
      serious, and often unrecognized breathing disorder resulting from repeated upper airway
      collapse, decreased oxygen levels, and a very high risk of life threatening complications at
      the time of surgery. Current guidelines recommend using regional anesthesia in SDB patients
      to minimize use of strong narcotic medications and/or to avoid general anesthesia entirely.
      It is unclear whether interscalene block used to provide analgesia (pain relief) may actually
      worsen SDB severity, by invariably freezing the phrenic nerve, temporarily paralyzing the
      diaphragm.

      This novel clinical trial will examine whether or not ISB increases the rate of airway
      obstruction during sleep and other dangerous postoperative complications in patients with SDB
      following shoulder surgery.

      Primary Objective: To evaluate the impact of ISB on the oxygen desaturation index (sleep
      apnea severity) in untreated SDB patients undergoing ambulatory shoulder surgery compared to
      patients who do not receive ISB.

      Secondary Objectives: To 1) evaluate the impact of hemidiaphragmatic paresis on impairment in
      pulmonary function; 2) evaluate the impact of impairment in pulmonary function on the oxygen
      desaturation index (ODI); 3) assess the incidence of important perioperative clinical
      outcomes such as hypoxemia, recurrent respiratory events, delayed discharge, and resource
      utilization in SDB patients undergoing ambulatory shoulder surgery compared to patients who
      do not receive ISB; and 4) important analgesia related outcomes such as: time to onset of
      pain, intraoperative and postoperative opioid consumption, hourly and daily VAS pain scores,
      opioid related side effects, patient satisfaction with analgesia, presence/absence of nerve
      block complications.

    <masking_description>On the day of surgery, patients will be randomly assigned (1:1) to one of two groups according to a computer-generated list. The patients, the clinical care team (anesthesiologist providing intraoperative care, nurses, and surgeons), data collectors, outcome adjudicators, and the study statisticians will all remain blinded to randomization and group allocation. The anesthesiologist who will perform the intervention will be aware of group allocation, but the anesthesiologist providing intraoperative care will remain blinded. Situations such as patient refusal at any time of the study, any adverse event or complication necessitating withholding the intervention would result in voluntary un-blinding of study investigators.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Oxygen desaturation index (ODI) change from baseline to night of surgery (N1).</measure>
    <time_frame>Time of measurements will be at baseline before surgery and within 24 hrs of surgery.</time_frame>
    <description>All patients will undergo portable overnight oximetry study at home to record the baseline oxygen desaturation index (ODI, as defined by a 4% drop from baseline, and calculated as events per hr during the recording time), minimum and mean oxygen saturation and lastly, cumulative total recoded time below an oxygen saturation of 90%, CT90). Patients with preoperative ODI more than 10 will be considered at risk of SDB. A change from baseline will be examined, and compared between the two groups.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in amplitude of diaphragmatic excursion with breathing maneuvers, between before and after surgery (measured by ultrasound)</measure>
    <time_frame>Time of measurements will be within 1 hour before surgery, and within 1 hour after surgery. It will take around 10-15 minutes.</time_frame>
    <description>Rate of diaphragmatic function (complete, partial, or none) will be assessed before and after surgery using M-Mode Ultrasound. Assessment will be performed during quiet breathing, sniffing, and deep breathing. After surgery diaphragmatic paresis will be indicated by a flat trace (absence of excursion) with quiet and deep breathing and/or with paradoxical motion. Measurement of amplitude of excursion will be made when partial paresis is observed. Using the sniff maneuver, complete hemi-diaphragmatic paresis (reduction of &gt;75% from baseline) and partial paresis (reduction of 25-75%from baseline) will be recorded. Rate will be assessed in the basal state (ie before regional anesthesia) to establish a baseline, and again in the post-operative period.</description>

    <measure>Change in pulmonary function before and after surgery, as measured by bedside spirometry</measure>
    <time_frame>Time of measurements will be within 1 hour before surgery, and within 1 hour after surgery. It will take around 5-10 minutes.</time_frame>
    <description>Change in pulmonary function tests [Forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), Expiratory reserve volume (ERV) and peak expiratory flow (PEF) ], between before and after surgery will be measured by bedside spirometry</description>

    <description>Under sterile precautions, a high frequency linear array transducer [6-13 MHz (megahertz), Sonosite M-Turbo] probe will be placed in the transverse plane over the interscalene groove to visualize the carotid artery and the C5 and C6 nerve roots of the brachial plexus between the anterior and middle scalene muscles. A 5 cm 22 G insulated needle will then be inserted in line with the US probe in a lateral-to-medial approach until the needle tip is adjacent to the C5 and C6 roots.

The superior trunk will be identified by tracing the C5 and C6 nerve roots caudally towards the supraclavicular fossa on the anterior lateral portion of the neck. A 5 cm 22 G insulated needle will then be inserted in line with the US probe in a lateral-to-medial approach until the needle tip is properly positioned. After negative aspiration for blood, 15 mL ropivacaine 0.5% will be injected in 5 mL aliquots.</description>
