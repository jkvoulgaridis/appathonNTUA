  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Even though broken wrists are of frequent occurrence, the investigators see a lack of
      extensive and well executed international studies to clarify which is the best treatment for
      elderly participants at 65+ years. The Danish Health and Medicines Authority recommend that
      broken wrists are treated with surgery by using plates and screws when certain radiological
      criteria are met. Recent studies show that, apparently, there are no advantages by operating
      rather than treating with plaster when comparing the functional results after one year.
      However, there is a 30 % risk of serious complications occurring after surgery. This study
      will examine the pros and cons that participants at 65+ years with broken wrists experience
      after, by lot, having been treated with either surgery (using plates and screws) or without
      surgery (using plaster for 5 weeks). The purpose of this study is to compare the
      complications and level of functioning between participants treated with surgery and without
      surgery.
