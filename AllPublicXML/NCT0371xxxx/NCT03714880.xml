  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to study the role of mifepristone prior to the placement of cervical
      osmotic dilators to evaluate if the medication helps increase the number of dilators. This
      may help improve safety of dilation and evacuation (D&amp;E) procedures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      No clear guideline currently exists for best practices involving cervical preparation for
      women planning dilation and evacuation at 20 weeks and greater. The investigators plan to
      perform a pilot, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. On day 1, 66
      participants will receive mifepristone 200 mg orally or placebo 18-24 hours prior to osmotic
      dilator (Dilapan-S 4-mm) placement (day 2). On day 3, participants will have a D&amp;E procedure.
      Enrollees will be 18 weeks 0 days to 23 weeks 6 days gestation on the day of the procedure.
      The primary objective is to evaluate the role of adjunctive mifepristone the day prior to
      osmotic dilator placement for dilation and evacuation procedures. The primary outcome will be
      the number of dilators successfully placed. Investigators will compare the number of dilators
      placed between study arms stratified by gestational age. Secondary outcomes include cervical
      dilation at time of procedure, proportion of women requiring mechanical dilation at time of
      surgery, provider impression on ease of procedure and/or difficulty in dilating the cervix
      when clinically required, and overall complications. Complications or adverse events include
      cervical laceration requiring repair, perforations, blood transfusions, ED visits,
      hospitalizations, infection, additional surgical procedures, or extramural deliveries.
