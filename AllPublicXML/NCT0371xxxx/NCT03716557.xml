  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the clinical response to Spinal Cord Stimulation frequency
      parameters: 40Hz, 4000Hz and 10000Hz and explore the brain imaging changes using PET-CT
      scans. The response to these stimulator settings on health related quality of life will also
      be measured using validated questionnaires.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is a treatment option for people suffering with chronic
      neuropathic back and leg pain. Conventionally, patients receiving SCS are provided with tonic
      stimulation parameters, where the frequency of electrical pulses is set at 40-60Hz. The major
      side effect of tonic SCS parameters is the onset of paraesthesia, a tingling or pins and
      needles sensation within the target region, which can cause discomfort for some patients.
      However, newer methods include high-frequency stimulation (HF) which is able to provide
      paraesthesia free stimulation, ultimately providing better patient tolerability. HF
      stimulation is widely offered to patients with SCS as part of routine clinical practice.
      However, the effect on pathways in the brain remains to be characterised. This study
      therefore aims to investigate the clinical response to three frequency parameters 40Hz,
      4000Hz and 10000Hz and also explore the brain imaging changes using PET-CT scans. The
      response to these stimulator settings on health related quality of life will also be measured
      using validated questionnaires.

      20 patients who are deemed suitable for SCS as part of NICE guidelines 159 pathway will be
      recruited for the study. All patients will have a baseline PET-CT scan and undergo first
      stage of SCS where they will be offered tonic 40Hz settings as part of trial stimulation. If
      successful (&gt;50% improvement in pain scores) patients will be offered second stage and
      continue to receive 40Hz stimulation for 4 weeks. After a second PET-CT scan they are
      randomised to receive either 4000Hz or 10000Hz stimulation for 4 more weeks, then cross-over
      treatment for another 4 weeks. PET-CT scans will be performed between each level of
      stimulation and at the end of the study (4 in total).
