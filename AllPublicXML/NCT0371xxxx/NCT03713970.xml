    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to assess the clinical performance (patient satisfaction,
      fracture, shade matching, Marginal adaptation and sensitivity) of laminate veneers made with
      celtra duo press ceramic and IPS e.max press ceramic with incisal wrap design.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ceramic materials are widely used for esthetic restorations because of their physical and
      optical properties that enhance patient satisfaction to dental restorations. several ceramic
      materials are currently available, including the lithium-reinforced glass ceramic like e.max
      press, which stands out for its excellent esthetic appearance and mechanical properties.also
      ZLS (zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate) are a function of its unique micro structure
      (500-700 nm in size, correspond exactly to the wavelength range of natural daylight). The
      presence of 10% zirconia in the glass phase in atomically dissolved form provides high
      strength and ensures safe and long-lasting restorations .The result is a large number of very
      fine-grained lithium silicate crystals, whose high glass content give the material its
      excellent light-optical and mechanical properties.

      Translucency, opalescence, fluorescence and the chameleon effect all benefit, with high edge
      stability and excellent polishability being an added plus.3 Despite the recent introduction
      of improved ceramic materials, patient satisfaction with restoration contour,symmetry,margins
      and shade matching natural teeth with ceramic restorations is still one of the major
      challenges in clinical practice. The determination and interpretation of natural tooth color
      involve the selection and reproduction of ceramic shade and choice of restorative material.
      These factors have had a major influence on the final color of restorative treatments.
      Color-measuring instruments assist in shade analysis, thus minimizing the subjective
      variables of this process. Color readings allow improved determination of the restoration
      shade and better communication with the dental laboratory.4The influences of underlying
      substrate,8-9 luting agent,ceramic thickness and translucency, and restoration type14 on the
      color variation of ceramic restorations have been investigated in in vitro studies. Thus, the
      purpose of this study was to evaluate clinical performance of celtra duo press ceramic and
      IPS e.max press ceramic laminate veneers including patient satisfaction, fracture, shad
      matching, marginal adaptation and sensitivity.

Questions
Are you satisfied with new laminate? Are you satisfied with your laminate color? Have you noticed any color change in your crown till now? Do you feel that your laminate looks natural? Have you suffered from any kind of pain or problem during laminate use? Do you like your laminate alignment? Do you like your general appearance? Do you feel that the laminate is in harmony with the adjacent teeth? Have you experienced gingival or periodontal inflammation around the laminate after its insertion? Has the laminate stability affected through this year?
the participant should be answer yes or no</description>
