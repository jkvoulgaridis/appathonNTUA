  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-centre, open-label, non-randomised, period fixed sequence study designed to
      investigate the PK and safety of Firibastat (QGC001) modified release (MR) prototype tablet
      formulations and compare this to a reference Firibastat (QGC001) immediate release (IR)
      capsule formulation in healthy male subjects.

      It is planned to enrol 12 subjects to receive single oral doses of investigational medicinal
      product (IMP).

  <detailed_description>

      Subjects will be screened for eligibility to participate in the study up to 28 days before
      dosing and for each treatment period they will be admitted to the clinical unit on the
      evening prior to IMP administration (Day -1). On the morning of Day 1, subjects will receive
      IMP in the fasted state (or following a FDA standard high-fat breakfast, if applicable) and
      will remain on site until 48 h post-dose. Between the periods, an interim analysis and review
      of safety and PK data from dosed regimens will be performed in order to determine which
      Firibastat (QGC001) MR prototype tablet formulation and dose to administer in subsequent
      periods. A follow-up phone call will take place 7 to 10 days post-final dose to ensure the
      ongoing wellbeing of the subjects.
