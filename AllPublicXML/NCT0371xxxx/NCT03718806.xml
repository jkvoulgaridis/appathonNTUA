  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, parallel, open-label, randomized, cross-over, single-center study with
      zoliflodacin administered as granules for oral suspension with or without food.

      It is planned to enroll 2 cohorts (Cohorts 1 and 2) of 24 subjects each (48 subjects in
      total), with the target of achieving data in 20 evaluable subjects per cohort. Single doses
      of zoliflodacin will be assessed within each cohort in a two period cross-over design.

      Each subject will receive one of the following regimens per period, depending on cohort, in a
      sequence according to the randomization schedule (per cohort, subjects will be randomized
      immediately before dosing in Period 1), separated by a minimum 4 day washout between each
      period. The actual length of washout period may change pending emerging PK data.

      Cohort 1:

        -  Regimen A: 3 g zoliflodacin oral suspension; oral administration after an overnight fast

        -  Regimen B: 3 g zoliflodacin oral suspension; oral administration with a standardized
           high calorie, high-fat breakfast

      Cohort 2

        -  Regimen C: 4 g zoliflodacin oral suspension; oral administration after an overnight fast

        -  Regimen D: 4 g zoliflodacin oral suspension; oral administration with a standardized
           high calorie, high-fat breakfast
