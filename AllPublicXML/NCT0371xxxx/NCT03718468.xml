  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to demonstrate the immunogenic efficacy of GC FLU Quadrivalent Pre-filled
      Syringe inj. (GC FLU), a quadrivalent influenza virus vaccine, is non-inferior to the active
      control, Fluarix Tetra. This study is designed to be a randomized, open-labelled,
      active-controlled, parallel, phase III study recruiting subjects from multiple study sites.

      Approximately 840 eligible subjects are planned to enroll in order to obtain 800 evaluable (=
      per-protocol) subjects. Subjects will be randomized and assigned to GC FLU or Fluarix Tetra
      (active control, AC) group in 1:1 ratio.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Provision of signed and dated informed consent form

          2. Either gender, aged 20 to 50 years old (inclusive)

          3. Willing and able to comply with all the required study visits and follow-up defined by
             this protocol

          4. Female subject with childbearing potential or male subject with female spouse/partner
             with childbearing potential must agree to use highly effective contraceptives from 15
             days prior to vaccination until 60 days after vaccination. At least two forms of birth
             control must be adopted and one of which must be a barrier method. Acceptable forms
             include:

               -  Established use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception

               -  Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS)

               -  Barrier methods of contraception: condom, or occlusive cap (diaphragm or
                  cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. With previous known or potential exposure to influenza virus within 12 weeks prior to
             vaccination

          2. Received seasonal influenza vaccine (registered or investigational) within 24 weeks
             prior to vaccination

          3. Received any vaccine other than seasonal influenza vaccine within 6 weeks prior to
             vaccination

          5. Administered immunoglobulins and/or other blood products within the 12 weeks prior to
             vaccination

          6. Known or suspected hypersensitivity to any component of vaccines (including egg

         10. With fever (defined as body temperature equal or over to 38 Â°C by any method) on the
             day of vaccination

         11. With ongoing acute diseases or within the past 2 years serious medical conditions
             (e.g. concomitant illness) such as cardiovascular (e.g. New York Heart Association

             alcoholism, drug abuse), medical history, physical findings, or laboratory abnormality
             that in the investigators' opinion could interfere with the results of the trial or
             adversely affect the safety of the subject

         12. Female subject who is lactating or has positive serum or urine pregnancy test at
