  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of bifurcation coronary lesions may be challenging, and the best technique to be
      used in these settings remains to be established. While a single stent strategy is simpler
      and has been often encouraged, a number of studies show that the use of modern stent
      implantation techniques may bring some advantages in terms of target lesion failure during
      longer follow-up. Further, single-stent procedures are not possible at all in some settings,
      for instance when both main and side branch have similar diameters and present both relevant
      disease, particularly when the angle between the vessels is lower than 70Â°. Recent randomized
      data demonstrate the superiority of the technique called double kissing and crush (DK-Crush)
      over provisional stenting in this setting. The DK-Crush technique is however cumbersome,
      time-consuming and requires very experienced operators. The investigators therefore plan to
      undertake a randomized study comparing a novel interventional technique against DK-crush in
      the setting of true bifurcation lesions (Medina lesions type 1,1,1 or 0,1,1).
