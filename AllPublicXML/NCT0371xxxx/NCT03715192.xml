  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to determine how safe and how well tolerated LY3462817 is when
      given intravenously (IV) (into a vein) and subcutaneously (SC) (just under the skin) to
      healthy participants. Blood tests will be done to check how much LY3462817 is in the
      bloodstream and how long the body takes to get rid of it. Each enrolled participant will
      receive 1 dose of LY3462817 or placebo. The study will last about 16 weeks, including
      screening.
