  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain in commonly found in working population. The working population who aged from 15 to 64
      is the largest portion of population in Hong Kong. Also, the prevalence of chronic pain in
      this population group is high. The issue requires special attention. Researches demonstrated
      pain affects a person in a multidimensional way. Pain induces negative effects to both the
      physical and psychological aspects. The levels of depression, anxiety, stress are increased
      and quality of life is decreased in people with chronic pain. They are interrelated to pain.
      As pain induced discomforts, people adopted self-initiated treatments as treatment.
      Pharmacological and non-pharmacological pain management interventions are commonly used.
      Although people used different ways to relieve the pain, they tend to bear the pain to work
      or take sick leave. This contributes to the work loss to the whole society.

      Pain service in Hong Kong is scarce in the public and private sectors. It takes months for a
      pain sufferer to be arranged for a pain clinic follow-up. It is possible for the pain get
      worsen while waiting for the pain service. The pain can be difficult to treat afterwards. As
      self-initiated treatments are welcomed by the pain sufferers, pain education can be focused
      on empowering the pain sufferers on their pain knowledge and self-management techniques. The
      pain self-efficacy can be enhanced. The pain sufferers can be benefited from lowering the
      pain intensity and negative emotions. It can be a solution to develop an online pain
      management programme to ease the service demand.

      Limited studies are found for online pain management programmes to improve the pain
      self-efficacy and self-management techniques. In order to fill the knowledge gap and service
      gap, the present study aims to evaluate an online pain management programme (ePain) in
      improving the self-efficacy, reduction of pain intensity, decreased levels of depression,
      anxiety and stress, and improving quality of life in pain management in adults with chronic
      pain. Participants are randomised to the intervention group or the control group.

      Participants will register in ePain for an individual account. Then they will finish the the
      pre-test questionnaire. They will be randomized to either the intervention group or control
      group. ePain will be accessed by the participants in the intervention group. The control
      group will remain their regular activities. The participants in both groups will need to
      complete the pre-test (Week 1), process evaluation (Week 3), post-assessment (Week 6) and
      follow-up assessment (Week 12). Same questionnaire will be used in the assessments.
      Demographic data will be collected in Week 1. At Week 1, 3, 6 and 12, pain situation and pain
      self-efficacy will be collected. Data of negative emotions and quality of life will be
      collected at Week 1, 6 and 12. The control group will undergo the same assessment as the
      intervention group.

    <masking_description>Self-efficacy theory of behavioral change is adopted to guide the conceptual framework and development of the intervention. It was first introduced by Bandura in 1977. In the theory, self-efficacy would increase when a person participates actively in the activities to gain experience. There are two expectations in the model. The efficacy expectations of the person would contribute to the person's behaviour. The person performs the behaviour and would expect the outcomes and this is outcome expectations. The theory has been discussed for how to apply in health promotion. As the theory integrates self-efficacy and self-regulatory elements, people are benefited from the improved health outcomes which is resulted from the health behaviours.</masking_description>
