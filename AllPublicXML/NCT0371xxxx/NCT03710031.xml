      This is a prospective, longitudinal, observational trial to evaluate quality of life in
      hematopoietic stem cell transplant survivors.

    <textblock>
      Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) survival rates continue to increase as treatment
      protocols improve. However, HSCT survivors face many mental, emotional, and physical
      challenges that threaten quality of life (QOL), which, according to the American Society of
      Clinical Oncology, is the most important treatment outcome next to survival. Psychoneurologic
      symptoms (PNS) significantly diminish QOL after HSCT. PNS often co-occur and may be
      associated with inflammation related to perturbations of the gut microbiota. This project
      will track the interplay among these factors in 50 adult survivors of HSCT to lay the
      groundwork for a targeted dietary self-management intervention to mitigate PN symptoms.This
      is to be achieved by elucidating the complex bio-behavioral mechanisms of distressing
      symptoms in HCT patients such as neurocognitive dysfunction, fatigue, anxiety, depression and
      pain, inflammation (cytokines and C-reactive protein), gut microbiota [(GM) richness and
      diversity] and diet (macronutrients: carbohydrates, fats and proteins).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in plasma levels of inflammatory markers (cytokines and CRP) of individuals post allogeneic HSCT</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Day 30; Day 100</time_frame>
    <description>Cytokines will be analyzed using a multiplex assay by Millipore Company. Compared to the traditional enzyme-linked immunosorbant assays (ELISA), the multiplex is comparable and more sensitive to lower concentration levels of cytokines than the ELISA. One laser identifies a specific bead and another laser identifies the reported antibody associated with the bead-bound cytokine. One hundred beads for each of the 17 cytokines in every sample are assayed and a mean cytokine binding for the sample is determined. The manufacturer reports that the assay accurately measures cytokine values in a range of 1-2500pg/ml. Serum CRP will be measured using the ALPCO's (American Laboratory Products Company) high-sensitivity CRP assay which uses latex particle enhanced immunoturbidimetry for quantitative CRP determination.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in diversity and levels of fecal microbes of individuals post allogeneic HSCT</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Day 30; Day 100</time_frame>
    <description>Fecal microbial DNA will be extracted from between 50-200 mg of fecal material. The 16S ribosomal gene (V4 region) of each sample will be amplified using a barcoding system to allow multiplexing with the Illumina MiSeq system. We will use UNIFRAC algorithm to evaluate the null hypothesis that the structure of the microbial community is insensitive to cGVHD and symptoms of cGVHD. Differences in taxa are implicated by our high throughput sequencing methods will be confirmed by other techniques including culturing (where appropriate) and qPCR with taxa-specific primers.</description>

    <measure>Change in behavioral responses (symptoms) of individuals post allogeneic HSCT</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Day 30; Day 100</time_frame>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health Promoting Lifestyle Profile II (HPLPII)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Day 30; Day 100</time_frame>
    <description>The Health Promoting Lifestyle Profile II (HPLPII) will be used to identify lifestyle choices that may affect relationships and differences between groups. HPLPII measures health promoting behaviors across several dimensions with subscales of health responsibility, physical activity, nutrition, spiritual growth, interpersonal relations and stress management. This is a 52-item summated behavior rating scale using a 4-point response format to measure the frequency of self-reported health-promoting behaviors. It is a well validated toll and takes approximately 10 minutes to complete.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Brief Pain Inventory (BPI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Day 30; Day 100</time_frame>
    <description>Pain will be assessed using the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI). The BPI was created to evaluate two dimensions of pain: 1) the severity and 2) the interference. This tool is well validated with Cronbach's alpha .80-.87 pain severity and .89-.92 for interference.22 The BPI consists of a body diagram to indicate location of pain and a general question asking if pain is present. Four items assess pain intensity or severity and seven item s assess pain interference. Both use an eleven point scale ranging from 0 (no pain or interference) to 10 (worst pain or interference). This instrument takes approximate five minutes to complete.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Day 30; Day 100</time_frame>
    <description>Depressive symptoms will be assessed using the subscale for depression from the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). 23This instrument is used to assess the presence and severity of anxiety and depressive symptoms over a seven day period. The depression subscale is comprised of seven items using a four point scale ranging from 0 (least severe) to 3 (most severe). Cronbach's alpha has been found to be high (.82-.90) for the HADS depression subscale.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Day 30; Day 100</time_frame>
    <description>Fatigue will be assessed using the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI). The BFI is a nine item, eleven point scale that assesses physical, affective, cognitive and social domains in a two dimensions, fatigue intensity and interference. Severity scores are as follows: 1) mild (1-3), 2) moderate (4-6) and 3) severe (7-10). This tool is well establish and validated. The Cronbach's alpha ranged from .95-.96 for individual items and an internal consistency of .96 overall. The questionnaire takes approximately five minutes to complete and a global score can be ascertained by averaging the total score.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS-SF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Day 30; Day 100</time_frame>
    <description>To comprehensively explore symptoms, the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS-SF) will be used to measure multiple dimensions (frequency, severity, and distress) of 32 common cancer symptoms. The Cronbach alpha for the MSAS-SF subscales ranged from .76-.86 and the test-retest correlation coefficients ranged from .86-.94 at one day and one week respectively. The total time to complete this form is approximately 10 minutes. This form allows for patients to identify and quantify &quot;other&quot; symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Bone Marrow Transplantation (FACT-BMT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Day 30; Day 100</time_frame>
    <description>Health related quality of life (HRQOL) will be measured using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- Bone Marrow Transplantation (FACT-BMT). This is a well validated HRQOL measure. This is a 27-item questionnaire asking questions across four domains: physical well-being, social well-being, emotional well-being and functional well-being. This measure takes about 10 minutes to complete.</description>

        Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant (HSCT) Survivors. Survival rates continue to increase as
        treatment protocols improve; by 2030, an estimated half-million HSCT recipients in the
        United States will be long-term survivors. However, HSCT survivors continue to face many
        mental, emotional, and physical challenges that threaten QOL, which, according to the
        American Society of Clinical Oncology, is the most important treatment outcome next to
        survival. Therefore, a prospective, observational design to longitudinally examine these
        factors in 50 adult (at least 18 years of age) survivors of HSCT to lay the groundwork for
        the future development of a targeted dietary self-management intervention to mitigate PN
        symptoms in this growing group of HSCT survivors is being planned.
