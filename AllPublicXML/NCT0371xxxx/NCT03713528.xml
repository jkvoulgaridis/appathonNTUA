      Purpose of Study: In order to improve upon the modest results seen in irrigation and
      debridement for periprosthetic infection and limit the number of surgical procedures
      performed we ask if the use of intraosseous regional administration of antibiotics at the
      time of irrigation and debridement would further improve the results of irrigation
      debridement for prosthetic joint infection.

      Impact Question:

      How will this study benefit the patient? Currently when an I&amp;D fails, the patient needs to
      undergo two more major procedures: 1) implant removal and 2) reimplantation of the
      prosthesis. Since I&amp;D currently fails up to 2/3 of the time, any improvement will decrease
      the number of patients having to go through two procedures to cure their infection.

      Type of Study:

      This is a two-arm, multi-center, randomized, superiority clinical trial.

      Treatment Group &amp; Comparison (Control) Group:

        -  The treatment group includes any patient with an acute perioperative periprosthetic
           infection, or acute hematogenous infection with a gram positive organism sensitive to
           vancomycin and treated with intraoperative intraosseous vancomycin. Additionally,
           patients will be treated with at least 4 weeks of IV antibiotics under guidance of an
           infectious disease specialist, and indefinite antibiotic chronic suppression.

        -  The control group includes any patient with an acute perioperative periprosthetic, or
           acute hematogenous infection with a vancomycin sensitive gram positive organism treated
           with intravenous vancomycin. Additionally, patients will be treated with at least 4
           weeks of IV antibiotics, and indefinite antibiotic chronic suppression under guidance of
           an infectious disease specialist.

        -  Therefore, the only difference between the study groups is the route of administration
           of intraoperative vancomycin.

      Surgical and Antibiotic Administration Technique:

      Initially, all patients will receive standard weight based cefazolin (1 gram for patients &lt;
      80kg, 2 grams for patients between 80-120kg, and 3 grams for patients over 120kg)
      preoperatively. Our protocol for MRSA positive patients is to use cefazolin and vancomycin
      preoperatively. Because irrigation and debridement in patients with gram positive infections
      are frequently done urgently before exact organism identification and sensitivities are
      available it is important to cover the patient broadly with cefazolin and vancomycin
      initially.

      The control group (systemic IV therapy) will receive vancomycin preoperatively (15mg/kg)
      based on actual body weight (maximum 2 grams) IV beginning 60 to 120 minutes preoperatively.
      The interventional group will receive post debridement intraosseous vancomycin as described
      below. In total knee infections a pneumatic tourniquet must be used for the procedure. After
      entering the hip or knee joint the following process is followed:

        1. Fluid is collected in four syringes and placed into two sets of aerobic and anaerobic
           adult blood culture bottles,

        2. Two synovial tissue cultures from different areas of the joint are obtained and sent for
           culture,

        3. If not enough fluid is obtained send an additional tissue culture,

        4. Remaining tissue is sent for final pathologic analysis at the end of the case.

      After obtaining cultures radical synovial debridement is performed debriding the inner
      surface of the entire hip or knee capsule including the posterior capsule of the knee and
      anterior capsule of the hip. Modular parts will be removed, that is the femoral head and
      polyethylene liner in hips and the polyethylene insert for knees.

      Debridement and Irrigation Protocol:

      After a complete synovectomy is performed along with extraction of modular parts any exposed
      metallic parts will be scrubbed with a sterile brush soaked in dilute betadine. A 5-step
      irrigation protocol will then be used for all surgeries:

        1. Pulse lavage with 3 liters of normal saline (NS),

        2. Lavage with 100 cc's of 3% H202 and 100 cc's of sterile water, a 50/50 solution left in
           wound for 2 minutes,

        3. Lavage 3 liters NS,

        4. Lavage with 1 liter of dilute, sterile Betadine (22.5 ml Betadine/liter NS) - left in
           wound for 3 minutes

        5. Pulse lavage with 3 liters of NS

      After debridement and irrigation the interventional group will receive intraosseous
      vancomycin 500mg in 150ml of normal saline. This dose was selected based on the studies of
      Young (10) and Clarke (11) who used this dose in two high risk groups (revision TKA and high
      BMI patients) with no significant side effects or red man syndromes. This solution will be
      prepared by the hospital pharmacy and administered via an EZ-IO intraosseous cannula
      (Teleflex Corp, San Antonio TX: Food and Drug Administration approved). In total knees the
      cannula will be placed in the proximal medial tibia using a starter drill slightly smaller
      than the diameter of the cannula to ensure a press fit just distal to the tibia implant in
      the vicinity of the pes anserine tendons. 75ccs of the vancomycin solution will be injected
      as a bolus. Subsequent to this the remaining 75ccs will be placed in the distal femur just
      proximal to the femoral component evenly split between the medial and lateral femoral
      condyles. In hips the cannula is placed just distal to the femoral component and 75ccs of the
      vancomycin solution is injected as a bolus. The remaining 75ccs is placed into the supra
      acetabular region through the cannula.

      After irrigation and debridement the wound will be closed over a betadine soaked lap sponge
      placed between the components. Contaminated drapes and instruments will be removed and the
      patient will be re-prepped with new drapes. New instruments will be used to insert the new
      modular parts. After opening the wound and prior to inserting new modular parts the wound
      will be irrigated this time with the following regime:

        1. Pulse lavage with 3 liters of normal saline (NS),

        2. Lavage with 100 cc's of 3% H202 and 100 cc's of sterile water, a 50/50 solution left in
           wound for 2 minutes,

        3. Lavage 1 liters NS,

        4. Lavage with 1 liter of dilute, sterile Betadine (22.5 ml Betadine/liter NS) - left in
           wound for 3 minutes

        5. Pulse lavage with 3 liters of NS

      After the modular parts are reinserted the wound is closed with monofilament sutures over
      drains.

      Post-operative treatment will be managed by an infectious disease specialist with at least
      four weeks of intravenous antibiotics followed by indefinite chronic suppression as
      recommended by the Musculoskeletal Infection Society (Table 1). Baseline creatinine will be
      obtained preoperatively and on postop days 1 and 2. Infectious disease consultants will
      monitor peak and trough levels based on the specific antibiotic administered and they will
      adjust dosage as indicated.
