    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of REGN2477+REGN1033 in
      combination on total lean mass, as measured by Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in
      patients with sporadic inclusion body myositis (sIBM).

      The secondary objectives of the study are:

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of REGN2477+REGN1033 on the IBM-Functional Rating Scale
           (IBM-FRS)

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of REGN2477+REGN1033 on the sIBM Physical Functioning
           Assessment (sIFA)

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of REGN2477+REGN1033

        -  To evaluate the effects of REGN2477+REGN1033 on body composition by DXA, including
           appendicular lean mass and total fat mass

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of REGN2477+REGN1033 on measures of muscle performance and
           physical function

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of REGN2477+REGN1033 on patient reported outcome measures
           including the fear of falling, falls and near falls, and health-related quality of life

        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetic(s) (PK) profile of REGN2477+REGN1033, including
           functional REGN2477 and functional REGN1033 concentrations in serum over time

        -  To evaluate the immunogenicity of REGN2477+REGN1033
