  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TDR implants for the lumbar spine are currently most 2- or 3-piece devices with a purely
      mechanical function that provide/restore mobility. Lately interest is growing on
      non-mechanical implants that could possibly provide/restore mobility, but also produce
      counterforces on mobility as in healthy discs. No previous comparison between these two
      concepts has been performed, neither on clinical outcome, neither on specific differences on
      facet-joint load and wear.

      A total of 250 patients are to be enrolled and treated. Inclusion criteria is unbearable pain
      and dysfunction from degenerative disc disease (DDD) that at one or two segments in the lover
      lumbar spine, that has not responded positively from at least one year of conservative
      treatment (that is combination of intense physical training and drugs).

      Patients with DDD below L3 vertebra are divided I three groups:

        1. One segment DDD appropriate for treatment with TDR.

        2. Two segments DDD appropriate for treatment with TDR.

        3. One segment DDD appropriate for treatment with TDR and one segment DDD not appropriate
           for treatment with TDR, that will be treated with anterior fusion (ALIF) at the same
           surgical procedure, called &quot;hybrids&quot;. Within all three groups there will be an equal
           randomization between the two prosthesis types.

      Clinical outcome will be evaluated from questionnaires sent out to patients after 12- and 24
      months and 5- and 10 years after surgery. The questionnaire are the currently used ones from
      the Swedish Spine Registry (SweSpine) including VAS leg/back, EuroQol ,GA and ODI.
      Complications will be registered continuously and facet-joint load/health will be examined
      from flex-ext x-rays at 1 and 2 years. At the 2-year check up a 3D-CT will be performed to
      further evaluate the facet joints and their load under flex-ext.
