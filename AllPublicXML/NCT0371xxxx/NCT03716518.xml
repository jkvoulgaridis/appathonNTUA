  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to:(1) determine the efficacy of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)
      'Tonifying Spleen and Kidney Sequential Regimen' (TSKSR) in improving the completion rate of
      8-cycle CapeOX chemotherapy in patients with stage II (high-risk)&amp; III colon cancer;(2)
      evaluate the efficacy of the TCM-TSKSR on adverse events of CapeOX chemotherapy and it's
      impact on patients' quality of life (QoL).A randomized,double-blinded,placebo-controlled
      clinical trial including seven centers will be conducted in Mainland China.The study will
      enroll patients with stage II (high-risk)&amp; III colon cancer who have completed radical
      surgery and are going to receive CapeOX chemotherapy.All participants will receive
      chemotherapy as prescribed by their treating physicians and be randomly assigned to either
      concurrent use of TCM-TSKSR or placebo.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CapeOX chemotherapy is a combination therapy of Oxaliplatin 130mg/m^2 IV on 1st day and
      Capecitabine 1000mg/m^2 PO twice daily from 1th day to 14th day,21 days for each course of
      treatment.Adverse effects of chemotherapy,such as myelosuppression and gastrointestinal
      reactions,may lead to dose reductions,treatment delays or even discontinuation among cancer
      patients. According to IDEA study,the completion rate of 8-cycle CapeOX chemotherapy in
      colorectal cancer patients is 64%,which means that nearly 4 in 10 patients could not complete
      adjuvant chemotherapy as planned,which may negatively impact patients' survival outcomes.Some
      prior studies have shown that TCM can improve patients' symptom control and QoL during
      adjuvant chemotherapy,which may further improve the completion of adjuvant chemotherapy.
      However,there is a lack of definitive evidence to evaluate the effects of TCM in stage
      II(high-risk)&amp; III colon cancer patients who receive adjuvant chemotherapy after radical
      surgery.The study will be conducted between 2018 and 2021.Four hundred participants will be
      enrolled and randomly assigned to either the experimental group or the control group.
