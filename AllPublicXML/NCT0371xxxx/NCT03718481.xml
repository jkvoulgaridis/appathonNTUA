      A Prospective Cross Sectional Questionnaire Study was conducted to evaluate surgical
      trainees' experiences of the ARCP process in order to identify areas for improvement.

      Background: Surgical trainees in the UK and Ireland undergo rigorous formative and summative
      assessments throughout each placement and appraisal at an Annual Review of Competence
      Progression (ARCP). The ARCP evaluates performance during each training year and determines
      progression to the next year of training. It is critical that the ARCP is a robust and fair
      process. The Association of Surgeons in Training (ASiT) sought to evaluate surgical trainees'
      experiences of the ARCP process in order to identify areas for improvement.

      Methods: A Prospective Cross-Sectional Questionnaire Study was conducted An electronic survey
      was developed and distributed electronically to the trainee membership of ASiT in the UK and
      Republic of Ireland. A 57 point survey examined the specifics of one ARCP cycle as well as
      attitudes to the process in general. Quantitative analysis was performed, along with thematic
      analysis on the free-text comments.

    <description>Experience of preparation, processes and standards. These will be measured on an anonymous, online survey (Survey monkey) and participants will be asked to rate their experiences of the ARCP using a likert scale. Specific experiences will include preparation for Annual Review of Competence and Progression-timing of decision making and value of the process as an educational tool and contribution of traineers, supervisors and the ARCP panel. Examples of questions are Did you feel your progression was fairly assessed? Possible answers include very fair, fair, neutral, not fair, very unfair</description>

    <description>One Annual Review of Competence Progression (ARCP) cycle. In the U.K., doctors, across all specialities, undergo an Annual Review of Competence Progression (ARCP) to evaluate performance during each training year and determine progression to the next year of training. Similar processes exist in the Republic of Ireland. The process and requirements for ARCP in the UK are specified in the Gold Guide, the Reference Guide for Postgraduate Specialty Training [1]. It defines ARCP as a formal process that uses evidence collected by trainees to review and record performance, demonstrate competencies achieved and inform decisions regarding progression in training</description>
