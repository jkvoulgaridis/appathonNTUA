  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TP-3654 is an oral PIM inhibitor. This is a Phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation, safety,
      pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamic study, with a purpose of determining the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of oral TP-3654 in patients with
      advanced solid tumors.

      Primary Objective:

      â€¢ To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of oral
      TP-3654 in patients with advanced solid tumors.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To establish the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of orally administered TP-3654

        -  To observe patients for any evidence of antitumor activity of TP-3654 by objective
           radiographic assessment

        -  To study the pharmacodynamic effects of TP-3654 therapy

        -  To establish the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) for future studies with TP-3654
