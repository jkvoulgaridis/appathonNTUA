  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A study to explore whether rhythmical massage and heart rate variability biofeedback can help
      to reduce pain in women suffering from menstrual pain (dysmenorrhea).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a three-arm randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of rhythmical
      massage and HRV biofeedback in women with primary dysmenorrhea compared to a control group.
      The main focus is on pain intensity during menstruation. Moreover, analgesics intake, SF-12
      mental and physical scores and parameters of a 24h-HRV measurement are assessed before and
      after the three-month intervention.

    <intervention_model_description>Participants are randomized to one of the three groups (rhythmical massage, HRV biofeedback or control). After the three-month intervention period, the controls receive rhythmical massage for ethical and compliance reasons. Assessments are taken before and after the intervention phase. Pain intensity is once more queried three months after the end of the intervention period.</intervention_model_description>
