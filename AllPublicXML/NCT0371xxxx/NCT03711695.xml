  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The iBeat Study is a single-center, prospective, unblinded validation of the
      photoplethysmography (PPG) and tissue oximetry (TO) signal waveforms recorded from a
      wrist-based sensor devices.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the proposed research is to validate PPG and TO signal waveforms recorded from a
      wist-based sensor device, which is worn on one or both arms, during catheter ablation, device
      interrogation, and defibrillation threshold testing (DFT). It is a non-invasive procedure
      that will include placing a wrist-based sensor on subjects who consent participate. Data
      collected from routine clinical care devices used during these procedures (catheter
      ablations, device interrogations, and DFTs) will confirm data collected from the iBeat
      wristwatch.
