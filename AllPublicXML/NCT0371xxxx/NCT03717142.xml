  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of the LUM Imaging
      System in imaging primary and metastatic cancer in the brain. This includes selecting a dose
      to determine the initial efficacy of LUM015 for the molecular imaging of low-grade gliomas,
      glioblastomas and cancer masses that have metastasized to the brain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this feasibility study is to identify an effective dose of LUM015
      for imaging low grade gliomas, glioblastomas and cancer metastases to the brain. The optimal
      dose will be used for future studies. Both normal brain tissue and tumor tissue will be
      imaged and analyzed using the LUM Imaging device. The LUM Imaging System is a combination
      product consisting of the LUM Imaging Device and the imaging agent LUM015.

      Subjects with a possible diagnosis of low grade glioma, glioblastoma and metastases to the
      brain, and scheduled for surgical resection, will be screened, recruited. On day of scheduled
      surgery, the subject will be administered with LUM015 4 ± 2 hours prior to using LUM Imaging
      System during surgery. LUM015 will be administered via peripheral intravenous (IV) injection
      as a single dose between 1.0 - 3.0 mg/kg.

      Before the tumor mass is resected, the LUM Imaging Device will be used to scan images of
      distinct areas of grossly normal appearing brain tissue and, separately, images of distinct
      areas of grossly appearing tumor. Following tumor mass resection, the tumor bed is scanned to
      record in vivo images. The resected tissue will also be imaged ex vivo.

      All subjects will continue to be monitored until hospital discharge and followed through
      their first standard of care post-surgical visit. Subjects with adverse events that are
      determined to be possibly related to the investigational product will continue to be followed
      until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event.
