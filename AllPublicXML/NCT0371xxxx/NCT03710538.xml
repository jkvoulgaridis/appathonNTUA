  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to test the feasibility and effectiveness of a pre-meal snack to reduce
      the postprandial glycemia (PPG) excursion after a breakfast consumption in adult patients
      with cystic fibrosis (CF). The investigators also want to investigate the impact of a
      postprandial exercise to reduce the PPG excursion. An improvement in PPG excursions can
      improve the condition of CF patients primarily by delaying the onset of cystic fibrosis
      related diabetes (CFRD) and / or by reducing the risk of lung function loss.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are proposing a randomized pilot study to explore the impact of a soy
      beverage of carbohydrates and protein early in the morning, to stimulate and initiate
      secretion of Insulin to reduce PPG excursions of the following a lunch in adult patients with
      CF. Investigators will also study the impact of a post meal exercise on the PPG excursion.
      Fourteen participants will be included and will each perform a 4-hour intervention in cross
      over design according to those 4 following experimental conditions:

        1. Consumption of 200ml of water (flavored) + breakfast of 90g of carbohydrates (CHO) for
           men and 80g for women; Sedentary activities throughout the study [condition control]

        2. Consumption of 200ml of soy beverage + 90g of carbohydrate (CHO) breakfast for men and
           80g for women; Sedentary activities throughout the study [snack effect on PPG excursion]

        3. Consumption of 200ml of water (flavored) + breakfast of 90g of carbohydrates (CHO) for
           men and 80g for women + physical activity practice (3min walk at 60% VO2max every 30
           minutes, x5); [exercise effect on the PPG excursion]

        4. Consumption of 200ml of soy beverage + breakfast of 90g of carbohydrate (CHO) breakfast
           for men and 80g for women + physical activity practice (3min walk at 60% VO2max every 30
           minutes, x5). [Combined snack and exercise effect on the PPG excursion] Main result:
           plasma glucose area under the curve. The underlying mechanisms, insulin, incretin
           hormones (GLP-1 and GIP), acceptability and side effects (mealtime hyperglycaemia)
           should also be measured. At the end of this pilot project, the investigators will have
           established a pre-meal snack and/ or postprandial exercise have a positive impact on
           PPG.
