  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Brazil, sertraline is currently available as film coated tablets for oral administration
      containing sertraline hydrochloride equivalent to 50 mg or 100 mg sertraline.

      The sponsor has developed an oral solution formulation containing 20 mg/mL of sertraline,
      which must be diluted with 120 mL of water, ginger ale, lime/lemon soda or orange juice to be
      palatable before use. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the relative bioavailability
      of Zoloft oral solution compared to Zoloft tablets in healthy participants under fasted
      conditions.

             increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product
             administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the
             judgment of the investigator, would make the research subject inappropriate for entry
             into this study.

          -  Research subjects who are investigator site staff members directly involved in the
             conduct of the study and their family members, site staff members otherwise supervised

             their family members, directly involved in the conduct of the study.
