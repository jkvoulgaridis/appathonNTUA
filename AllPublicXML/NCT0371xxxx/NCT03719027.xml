  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) after pulmonary
      embolism (PE) varies widely (0.4% to 8.8%) in the literature. This large variation could be
      due to the inclusion of patients with pre-existing CTEPH revealed on the occasion of a
      recurrence of PE. However, the absence of hemodynamic data when diagnosing PE does not allow
      to distinguish these patients. A prospective multicentric study involving 146 patients showed
      that the majority of patients with CTEPH during follow-up had a pulmonary hypertension
      unknown at the time of PE diagnosis. It is necessary to confirm these results in a broader
      study.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the cumulative incidence of CTEPH after a PE.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The patients selected in this study are patients with an objectively confirmed PE and
      previously included since at least 12 months in one of the studies of the INNOVTE network.

      Patients who are alive at the time of the selection for the PREVA-CTEPH study are contacted
      by phone or by mail for inclusion in the prospective interventional part of the PREVA-CTEPH
      study. Patients who consent to participate to this prospective interventional phase of the
      PREVA-CTEPH study have dyspnea assessment, EKG, and echocardiography to investigate the
      diagnosis of CTEPH. Patients with dyspnea (NYHA &gt;1) and/or a high or intermediate
      echocardiographic probability of pulmonary hypertension (ESC criteria) have a V/Q lung scan,
      a right heart catheterization and a pulmonary angiography to objectively confirm the
      diagnosis of CTEPH according to the current ESC guidelines.

      Retrospective phase: All clinical (dyspnea, signs of right ventricular insufficiency...),
      echocardiographic and imaging (pulmonary angiography, V/Q lung scan) relevant data after the
      diagnosis of index PE are retrieved from the clinical chart of each patients alive at the
      time of the selection for the PREVA-CTEPH study and/or with a diagnosis of CTEPH confirmed
      after the diagnosis of index PE and/or if the patient don't consent to participate to the
      prospective interventional phase.

      For patients died between the inclusion in one of the studies of the INNOVTE network and the
      time of the selection for the PREVA-CTEPH study, the date and the cause of death are
      recorded. The same data of the retrospective phase are retrieved.

      All cases of CTEPH are adjudicated by an independent committee. In this case, initial Imaging
      data (CT pulmonary angiography and echocardiography) performed at the time of index PE
      diagnosis are retrieved for searching previous sign of CTEPH.
