  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the effectiveness of an experimental rehabilitative protocol with specific tasks
      for the improvement of body awareness and the motor scheme in the patient with multiple
      sclerosis (EDSS &lt;2.5).

      Primary outcome: improvement of the interoception (awareness of the body) and of the related
      motor capacity Secondary outcomes: improvement of balance and postural self-correction
      control

      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronically progressive, disabling, autoimmune disease that
      affects the central nervous system causing a wide spectrum of sensory, motor, and
      neuropsychiatric signs and symptoms. In the great part of patients with MS, there is a
      cognitive deficit that can start already in the early stages of the disease. Disability
      related to the disease is usually investigated through the Expanded Disability Status Scale
      (EDSS), however, the scale does not evaluate some very disabling aspects of the disease such
      as diplopia, fatigue and the impact of cognitive disorders.

      The posture and postural self-correction are dependent on the image that anyone have of his
      own body and on the perception of it in the space, both internal and external. In multiple
      sclerosis proprioception and interoception are often altered due to motor and cognitive
      impairment.

      The investigators propose a rehabilitative protocol that combine postural rehabilitation with
      specific visual-spatial tasks, relaxation sessions with self-awareness improvement and
      cognitive rehabilitation.

    <description>The Short Form (12) Health Survey. The 12 questions includes one of two items from each of eight health concepts: Physical Functioning (PF), Role-Physical (RP), Bodily Pain (BP), General Health (GH), Vitality (VT), Social Functioning (SF), Role Emotional (RE) and Mental Health (MH). Two synthetic indices are obtained by a special software, Physical component summary (PCS - 12) score 18.4 - 57.8 and Mental component summary (MCS - 12). score 18.7 - 65.2. Higher values represent a better outcome.</description>

    <description>Trunk Appearance Perception Scale (TAPS). The TAPS includes 3 sets of figures that depict the trunk from 3 viewpoints: looking toward the back, looking toward the head with the patient bending over, and looking toward the front. This last view has two sets of drawings, one for males and one for females. Each drawing is scored from 1 (greatest deformity) to 5 (smallest deformity) and a mean score is obtained by adding the scores for the 3 drawings and dividing by 3. Higher values represent a better outcome.</description>
