  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well a 2-step approach to stem cell transplant works in
      treating participants with blood cancers. Giving chemotherapy and total body irradiation
      before a lymphocyte (white blood cell) and stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of
      cells in the bone marrow including normal blood-forming cells (stem cells) and cancer cells.
      By giving the donor cells in two steps, the dose of lymphocytes given can be tightly
      controlled and they can be made more tolerant to the body. When the healthy lymphocytes and
      stem cells from a donor are infused into the participant, they may help the participant's
      bone marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Sometimes the
      transplanted cells from a donor can make an immune response against the body's normal cells
      called graft versus host disease. Giving tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil may stop this
      from happening.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess whether providing a patient with &quot;5+5&quot; dosing in a 2 step matched related donor
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) increases the percentage of patients who
      achieve full donor chimerism earlier as defined by 98% or greater donor T cell chimerism at
      28 days post HSCT (d+28).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess day (d) +90 chimerism in patients receiving &quot;5+5&quot; dosing. II. To assess post
      HSCT relapse rates in patients receiving &quot;5+5&quot; dosing. III. To assess rates of grade II-IV
      graft versus host disease (GVHD) in patients receiving &quot;5+5&quot; dosing.

      IV. To assess treatment-related mortality (TRM) in patients receiving &quot;5+5&quot; dosing.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Provide signed and dated informed consent form.

          -  Have a hematological malignancy or any type of dyscrasia in which allogeneic HSCT is
             thought to be beneficial.

          -  Have a related donor who is no more than a 1-antigen mismatch at the human leukocyte
             antigen (HLA)-A; B; C; DR loci in the GVHD direction with the patient. (Patients with
             a syngeneic donor may be treated on this therapeutic approach, but their outcomes will
             not be part of the statistical aims of the study.

          -  LVEF (left ventricular end diastolic function) of &gt;= 45%.

          -  DLCO (diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide) &gt;= 50% of predicted
             corrected for hemoglobin.

          -  FEV-1 (forced expiratory volume at 1 second &gt;= 50% of predicted.

          -  Serum bilirubin =&lt; 1.8.

          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) =&lt; 2.5 x upper
             limit of normal.

          -  Creatinine clearance of &gt;= 60 mL/min.

          -  Have a Hematopoietic Cell Transplant Comorbidity Index (HCT-CI) score =&lt; 5 points
             (patients with greater than 5 points will be allowed for trial with approval of the
             principal investigator [PI] and at least 1 co-investigator [co-I] not on the primary
             care team of the patient). This is an adjustment to account for healthy patients who
             meet the spirit of this protocol but have histories that result in higher than HCT-CI
             5 points. An example is a patient with a solid tumor malignancy in their remote
             history (adds 3 points to HCT-CI total) where the treatment for the malignancy
             occurred years to decades before and there has been complete recovery of toxicities.

          -  Have a Karnofsky performance score (KPS) &gt;= 80%.

          -  Women of reproductive potential (defined as women under the age of 50 years still
             menstruating within 2 months of HSCT despite past history of chemotherapy) will be
             counseled to use highly effective contraception including oral, intramuscular (IM), or
             patch contraceptives, intrauterine device (IUD), diaphragm, cervical cap, or
             contraceptive implant. Pharmacological avoidance of pregnancy and suppression of
             menstruation may be instituted during the HSCT inpatient stay.

          -  Men will be asked to abstain from sexual relations during the treatment period of the
             HSCT stay.

          -  DONOR: All donors are selected and screened for their ability to provide adequate
             infection-free apheresis products for the patient in a manner that does not put the
             donor at risk for negative consequences.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive.

          -  Be pregnant or breastfeeding.

          -  Have received alemtuzumab or rabbit antithymocyte globulin (ATG) within 8 weeks or
             horse ATG within 6 weeks of the transplant admission. This exclusion criterion will be
             documented by the absence of these drugs in the medical record.

          -  Patients with evidence of another malignancy, exclusive of a skin cancer that requires
             only local treatment, should not be enrolled on this protocol without the specific
             approval of the PI. If the PI disregards this criterion (example of this is localized
             prostate cancer not yet requiring treatment), the rationale must be documented in the
             study binder). This exclusion criterion will be documented by the absence of these
             drugs in the medical record.
