  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary interstitial fibrosis is complex, and there is no
      specific biomarkers, the treatment effect is not such useful. Currently, it is discovered
      that Chinese medicine treatment may be effective. The investigators select patients with
      idiopathic pulmonary interstitial fibrosis and healthy controls, use metabolomics to study
      the biological characteristics of idiopathic pulmonary interstitial fibrosis, screen
      biomarkers of IPF, and label different TCM syndromes of IPF, explore the biological nature of
      IPF TCM syndromes, find the biological changes that occur during the development and
      progression of IPF and explore the metabolite marker clusters of IPF. Furthermore, the
      results of this study may find its diagnostic significance for IPF and Looking for potential
      targets for future treatment of IPF.
