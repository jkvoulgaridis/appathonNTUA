    <textblock>
      The investigator aims to determine the feasibility of understanding the process of active
      versus chronic calcification using Na-F PET scan and contrast CT scan of the heart.

      The patient cohort will consist of patients diagnosed to have either acute coronary syndrome
      (ACS) (comprising of either unstable angina pectoris or acute myocardial infarction) or
      suspected coronary artery disease (CAD). The PET images will be compared to images obtained
      from standard contrast CT of the coronaries. This study will provide additional insights
      about active versus non-active calcification amongst patients with ACS or suspected CAD.

      Contemporary techniques used to visualize coronary artery calcification include standard
      non-contrast computed tomography (CT) of the coronaries measuring amount of calcium
      deposition in the coronaries, contrast CT and more recently, using sodium-fluoride (Na-F)
      positron emission tomography (PET) to image coronary and valvular calcification. Na-F has
      been shown to accumulate in areas of active calcification where contrast CT of the heart has
      been shown to accumulate in areas of chronic calcification. The investigator aims to
      determine the feasibility of understanding the process of active versus chronic calcification
      using Na-F PET scan and contrast CT scan of the heart.
