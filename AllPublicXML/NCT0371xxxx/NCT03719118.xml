    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled study conducted at five tertiary university hospitals.
      Patients who are 20-80 years old, diagnosed as having Inflammatory Bowel Disease(IBD) and who
      are planned to start thiopurines for the first time for the treatment of IBD are enrolled.
      Patients are assigned to the genotyping group or to the non-genotyping group. The patients
      who carry any heterozygotic variant among the three genes receive 50 mg azathioprine (AZA) or
      25 mg of 6-mercaptopurine, while those who have any homozygotic variant are recommended to
      take other alternative drugs. The patients who do not carry any genetic variant or are
      assigned in non-genotyping group receive the standard dose of thiopurines based on the
      conventional approach.

      Patients in the non-genotyping group receive the standard dose of thiopurines based on the
      conventional approach.
