  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this clinical study researchers want to gain a deeper understanding of treatment
      consistence under real world conditions over the course of 24 months of Aflibercept
      injections into the eye for patients suffering from abnormal growth of new blood vessels
      under the retina (neovascular age-related macular degeneration). The study aims to identify
      potential reasons that may allow classification of non-consistence as patient or physician
      driven. They want to describe treatment effectiveness (how well the treatment works) and
      associations between treatment effectiveness, non-consistence and patient relevant outcomes,
      such as vision specific quality of life and treatment satisfaction.
