    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well rituximab and hyaluronidase human (Rituxan Hycela) works
      in treating participants with stage III-IV melanoma that cannot be removed by surgery who are
      undergoing nivolumab and ipilimumab therapy. Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab and
      hyaluronidase human, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To compare rates for grade 3-4 immune-related adverse event (IRAE)s in the first 6 months
      in patients treated with combination checkpoint blockade (CCB) therapy (anti-CTLA4 and
      anti-PD1) as a part of standard of care for advanced melanoma who are treated with a single
      course of 4 weekly doses of rituximab and hyaluronidase human (Rituxan) therapy versus those
      who are not treated with Rituxan.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability (in terms of Rituxan-related adverse events) in
      patients with melanoma receiving CCB.

      II. To compare objective response rate in patients receiving CCB therapy + Rituxan versus CCB
      therapy alone.

      III. To compare 1 year overall and progression-free survival in patients receiving CCB
      therapy + Rituxan versus CCB therapy alone.

      IV. To compare changes in cluster of differentiation 21lo (CD21lo) B cells in patients
      receiving CCB therapy + Rituxan versus CCB therapy alone.

      V. To compare changes in T cells in patients receiving CCB therapy + Rituxan versus CCB
      therapy alone.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM A: Participants receive standard of care ipilimumab and nivolumab therapy.

      ARM B: Participants receive standard of care ipilimumab and nivolumab therapy. On day 2 of
      each cycle, participants also receive rituximab and hyaluronidase human intravenously (IV) or
      subcutaneously (SC) weekly starting week 1 for 4 doses in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up for 4 weeks.
