  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aim is to monitor, during exercise tests carried out in various conditions, the
      alveolar dead space, by means of continuous transcutaneous measurement of Pt CO2, which would
      be used as a surrogate for arterial PaCO2. Validity of this measurement needs to be assessed
      against arterial sampling (either arterial, or arterialized capillary), especially with
      regards to the lag time required by the CO2 diffusion from the arterial compartment (PaCO2)
      to the cutaneous one (PtCO2), in particular when rapid changes of CO2 might be induced by
      exercise.

      The evaluation will be done in 2 different settings:

        -  intensive care patients, equipped, for their routine clinical care, with an arterial
           line; this allows for a precise timed comparison between PaCO2 and PtCO2 readouts;

        -  routine exercise test, where blood gas evaluation is done essentially by means of
           arterialized earlobe capillary sampling.

      Following assessment of validity of the measurement (and the lag time PaCO2-PtCO2 which might
      be necessary to introduce as a correction), evolution of dead space during excise test will
      be tested in different conditions: Healthy subjects, patients with Chronic Obstructive
      Pulmonary Disease (COPD), chronic heart failure (CHF), hyperventilation, Pulmonary artery
      hypertension (PAH), or interstitial lung disease (ILD)

    <description>Patients in intensive care, equipped, for their routine clinical management, with an arterial catheter blood line, will have a simultaneous determination of PaCO2 and PtCO2:
1) at rest; 2 arterial CO2/PtCO2 determinations will be carried out, 10 minutes apart
2) During the muscular exercise part of their routine rehabilitation program (whatever it might be, limbs active mobilization, walking, etc...) : several arterial /PtCO2 samples will be collected during the first minutes of their muscular routine: 30 sec, 1 minute, 1 ½ minute, 2, 2 ½ , 3, 4, 5 minutes, 10 minutes (end of exercise). This will generate several couples of blood/transcutaneous CO2 determinations</description>
