    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and potential effects on cognition of
      GRF6021, a plasma-derived product, administered as an intravenous (IV) infusion, to subjects
      with Parkinson's disease and cognitive impairment.

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the safety and
      tolerability of GRF6021, a plasma derived product, administered by intravenous (IV) infusion
      to subjects with Parkinson's disease (PD) and cognitive impairment. The study duration for
      the subjects will be approximately 7 months.

    <measure>The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 7 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in the MoCA. The MoCA is a 30-point test, which assess the attention and concentration, executive functions, memory, visuospatial abilities, language abilities, conceptual thinking, calculations, and orientation. A score of 26 and over is considered normal, compared to 22.1 in people with mild cognitive impairment.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to 7 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in the CDR-CCB. The CDR-CCB is an automated cognitive function assessment which will be used to assess: Continuity and Power of Attention, Working Memory, and Episodic Memory.</description>

    <measure>The Movement Disorder Society's Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) 1, 2, 3, and total score.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 7 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in the MDS-UPDRS. The MDS-UPDRS contains 4 subscales: Part 1, Mentation, Behavior, and Mood; Part 2, Activities of Daily Living; Part 3, Motor; Part 4, Complications nonmotor experiences of daily living (13 items), motor experiences of daily living (13 items), motor examination (18 items), and motor complications (six items). The rating for each item is from 0 (normal) to 4 (severe). The total score for each Part is obtained from the sum of the corresponding item scores. For this study, Parts 1-3 will be completed.</description>

    <measure>The Schwab and England Activities of Daily Living (SE-ADL) Scale.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 7 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in the SE-ADL. The SE-ADL evaluates patients' perceptions of global functional capacity and dependence. Scoring is expressed in terms of percentage, in 10 steps from 100 to 0 (100%, normal status; 0%, bedridden with vegetative dysfunction), so that the lower the score, the worse the functional status.</description>

    <measure>The Clinical Impression of Severity Index - PD (CISI-PD).</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 7 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in the PD (CISI-PD). The CISI-PD is a severity index formed by four items (motor signs, disability, motor complications, and cognitive status), rated 0 (not at all) to 6 (very severe or completely disabled). A total score is calculated by summing the item scores.</description>

    <measure>The PD Quality of Life Questionnaire-39 (PDQ-39).</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 7 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in the PDQ-39. The PDQ-39 is a self-administered questionnaire of 39 questions relating to 8 key areas of health and daily activities, including both motor and non-motor symptoms. It is scored on a scale of 0-100 with lower scores indicating better health and high scores indicating more severe symptoms.</description>

    <measure>The Geriatric Depression Scale-15 (GDS-15).</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 7 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in the GDS-15. The GDS-15 is a 15-item yes/no questionnaire of depression in older adults. Each depressive answer is 1 point. The final score is the tally of the number of depressive answers with the following scores indicating depression: 0-4 No depression; 5-10 Suggestive of a mild depression; 11 + Suggestive of severe depression.</description>

    <measure>The digital clock drawing test (dCDT).</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 7 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in the dCDT. The pen-like dCDT device will be used to gather the x-y coordinates that describe the movement of the stylus as it changes its position during the assessment. It also assesses when the stylus or writing device is not exerting pressure on the writing surface.</description>
