  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluate the Smart System of Disease Management（SSDM）to improve the
      treat-to-target(T2T) and the safety of drug in the treatment of rheumatoid(RA). All
      participants will be randomized in the SSDM group and the control group. The patients in the
      SSDM group will use the SSDM every month and the control group will receive the conventional
      therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treat-to-Target (T2T), achieving a DAS28 score lower than 2.6 (remission, Rem) or below 3.2
      (low disease activity, LDA), is the main management strategy recommended by ACR and EULAR.
      The Smart System of Disease Management (SSDM) is an interactive mobile disease management
      tool, including the doctors' and patients' application system. The patients can perform
      self-evaluation, including DAS28, morning stiffness duration (MSD) and HAQ, and input medical
      records (including medication and laboratory test results) through the mobile application.
      The data synchronizes to the mobiles of authorized rheumatologists through cloud data base
      and advices could be delivered.
