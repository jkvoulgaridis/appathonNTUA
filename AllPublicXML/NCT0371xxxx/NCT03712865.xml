  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PROPhecy study aims to detect the presence of atrial fibrillation/flutter in patients who
      have suffered an embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS) using 30 day cardiac
      monitoring.

      We hypothesize that the presence of any of the following features on long-term heart rhythm
      monitoring (holter monitoring) or heart ultrasound (transthoracic echocardiogram), either
      individually or in combination, will have additional predictive value for the detection of
      atrial fibrillation lasting 30 seconds or longer on 30 day holter monitoring:

        -  greater than 100 premature atrial beats in 24 hours

        -  greater than 2 runs of atrial tachycardia (4 or more non-sinus beats) in 24 hours

        -  Left atrial enlargement on transthoracic echocardiogram
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The PROPhecy study uses prolonged cardiac rhythm monitoring to detect atrial
      fibrillation/flutter in patients who have had an embolic stroke within six months, where no
      cause of stroke was found. Following informed consent, an external cardiac rhythm monitor
      will be attached to each participant. Participants will be instructed to wear the device as
      much as possible over the 30 day study period. If atrial fibrillation/flutter is detected
      before 30 days, participants may stop wearing the monitor and will be contacted to discuss
      changing their antithrombotic strategy for stroke secondary prevention as per standard of
      care. Recorded cardiac rhythm data will be transmitted for central interpretation and results
      will be sent to the PI, with copies provided for the patient's stroke neurologist and primary
      care practitioner for clinical continuity of care.

      Participants will be contacted by telephone once per week for the duration of the 30 day
      study period. Following device return patients will be followed for two years and will
      receive telephone follow-ups at 90 days, 1 year, and 2 years.

      The aim of the PROPhecy study is to prospectively validate those features on holter monitor
      and echocardiography identified as predictive of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in patients
      with embolic strokes of undetermined source (ESUS). Our overall goal is to determine whether
      all patients with ESUS should be referred for extended rhythm monitoring, or whether these
      criteria can be used to refer patients more selectively for this more resource-intensive
      diagnostic procedure.

    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Our primary outcome is new detection of atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter lasting 30 seconds or longer after 30 days of cardiac monitoring. Holter and echocardiography reports will be examined for features identified as being significantly associated with a new diagnosis of atrial fibrillation/flutter on univariate analysis in the EMBRACE trial: ((1) &gt;100 premature atrial beats in 24 hours, (2) two or more runs of 4 atrial beats or more in 24 hours, or (3) left atrial volume index &gt;26 mL/m2 on transthoracic echocardiography) will be compared against controls with &quot;benign&quot; holters and echocardiograms (ie. Those with &lt;100 premature atrial beats in 24h, 1 or fewer runs of atrial tachycardia, and lacking left atrial enlargement).</description>

    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical, holter and echocardiography correlates will be compared for those with and without atrial fibrillation/flutter on extended cardiac monitoring. Correlation between the &quot;high-risk&quot; features on holter monitoring and echocardiography identified in the EMBRACE trials (see Primary Outcome Measure description) and our prospective 30-day cardiac monitoring will be completed to assess predictive value of these features detected on cardiac diagnostic testing.</description>

        The study population will include patients age 55 years and older who have had an embolic
        stroke of undetermined source (ESUS). Participants will be recruited from the stroke ward
        at Vancouver General Hospital (VGH) and the Stroke Prevention Clinic at VGH.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 55 or over

          -  Diagnosis of the index event made by a stroke specialist of an acute ischemic stroke
             or TIA (WHO definition) of undetermined etiology occurring within the previous 6
             months (180 days). The event must be either:

               1. An embolic arterial ischemic stroke confirmed by neuroimaging; or,

               2. A clinical transient ischemic attack, defined as involving a focal unilateral
                  motor deficit, speech/language deficit, or hemianopia, with symptom duration &lt;24
                  hours (NOTE: amaurosis fugax/transient monocular blindness, pure sensory spells,
                  isolated vertigo spells, etc. do not qualify for enrolment given the potential
                  for misdiagnosis of such events).

          -  No previous ECG or Holter monitor showing atrial fibrillation (AF) or atrial flutter

          -  Informed consent from patient or legally authorized representative if patient is not

             angiogram or, if GFR &lt;30 mL/min, carotid dopplers) and echocardiography is planned
             within 60 days of the index event. (NOTE: if echocardiogram has already been performed
             within one year prior to study enrolment, it may serve as the baseline echocardiogram
             for study purposes).

             disease, cervicocephalic artery dissection, venous sinus thrombosis, hypercoagulable
             states, or other known cause
