    <textblock>
      Immediate implant placement has the disadvantage of difficulty in obtaining primary
      stability, lack of adequate soft tissue coverage and also the control of the implant position
      is difficult in addition to the cost of the graft. Autogenous bone graft is considered to be
      the golden standard for grafting as it has osteoconductive , osteoinductive and osteogenic
      functions , however it has the problems of donor site morbidity , the need for two surgeries
      as well as post operative swelling and discomfort of the patient , so alternative bone grafts
      as allografts and xenografts, has been introduced.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Allograft bone is obtained from individuals of the same species, derived from human-cadaver
      bone that has been selected and tested to be free of HIV and transmitted diseases. The most
      common allograft used is dematerialized freeze-dried bone allograft (DFDBA), provide type I
      collagen, which comprises most of the organic component of bone. In addition, allograft
      contains BMPs, which stimulate osteoinduction. There are thirteen proteins have been
      identified (BMP1-BMP13) which are osteoinductive compounds and stimulate new bone formation.
      A previous study demonstrated that, a combination of osseous coagulum collected during
      preparation and freeze-dried bone allograft placed at immediate implant insertion and
      loading. Xenografts are one of the most successful and widely used grafting materials
      nowadays as a replacement for autogenous bone grafts. Studies showed that xenografts are very
      successful because of their osteoconductive properties, their denisty which provides
      stabilization to the graft and implant and they supply the necessary minerals for bone
      formation as xenograft don't resorb completely.

    <description>A peritome will be used for atraumatic extraction of remaining roots.
The extraction socket will be evaluated for absence of any fenestration or granulation tissues.
Copious normal saline irrigation and curettage will be performed.
In the study group: Immediate implant insertion following standard manufacturer's recommended surgical protocol followed by grafting the jumping gap with cortico-cancellous allograft (MinerOss®, BioHorizons, USA)
In the control group: Immediate implant insertion following standard manufacturer's recommended surgical protocol followed by grafting the jumping gap with anorganic bovine bone mineral xenograft (Bio-Oss®, Geistlich, USA)</description>
