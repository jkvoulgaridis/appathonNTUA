  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective is to develop a novel system to predict and prevent nocturnal hypoglycemia in
      type 1 diabetic (T1D) patients, focused in patients with multiple daily injections (MDI)
      therapy. The general idea is to make use of previous-day information in the moment when
      patients go to sleep, and then predict if in the next following hours any hypoglycemic event
      will occur. If the system will have predicted any hypoglycemic event in that moment, it is
      expected that it will be able to warn the patient to take some action: such as reduce basal
      insulin dose or to consume a snack before sleep.

      10 patients with T1D for more than five years will be included.

      It is a longitudinal, prospective, interventional study in which every patient will use
      intermittently scanned Continuous Glucose Monitoring (isCGM) and a physical activity tracker
      during 12 weeks. Moreover, during this period, patients will store in a mobile application
      (Freestyle LibreLink) or in a reader information regarding their diabetes management
      activities, such as insulin delivery doses and meal consumption.

    <description>Primary outcome will be sensitivity (SE) and specificity (SP) to predict Level 1 hypoglycemia.
Level 1: a hypoglycemia alert glucose value between 54-70 mg/dL (3.0-3.9 mmol/L) with or without symptoms.
A hypoglycemic event should be defined as follows. Beginning of a CGM event: readings below the threshold for at least 15 min are considered an event. For example, at least 15min, &lt;70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) to define a significant hypoglycemic event. End of a CGM event: readings for 15 min at &gt;70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>

    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>Secondary outcome will be sensitivity (SE) and specificity (SP) to predict Level 2 hypoglycemia1.
Level 2: a glucose level of &lt;54mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L) with or without symptoms. A hypoglycemic event should be defined as follows. Beginning of a CGM event: readings below the threshold for at least 15 min are considered an event. For example, at least 15min, &lt;54 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L) to define a clinically significant hypoglycemic event. End of a CGM event: readings for 15 min at &gt;70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L).
A second hypoglycemic event outcome of prolonged hypoglycemia is considered when CGM levels are &lt; 54 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L) for consecutive 120 min or more.</description>

    <description>Participants will perform CGM during 12 weeks using an isCGM (intermittently scanned Continuous Glucose Monitoring), Freestyle Libre, (Abbott Diabetes Care, Witney, Oxon, UK). Insulin dose (rapid-acting and long acting), carbohydrates and Self-monitoring blood glucose (SMBG) per day will be recorded by the patient in the reader or in the App (LibreLink, Abbott Diabetes Care, Witney, Oxon, UK). Moreover, participants will be instructed to collect data about moderate or high intensity exercise, illness and other disturbances occurring during the study period at home.
Patients will wear a physical exercise tracker (Fitbit Alta HRÂ® wristband (Fitbit, Inc., San Francisco, California, USA)) to track physiological variables such as heart rate, steps, activity level and sleep quality.</description>
