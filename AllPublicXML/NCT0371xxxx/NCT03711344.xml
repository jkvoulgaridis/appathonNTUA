  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This mixed methods study proposes a culturally adapted cognitive behavioural therapy (CA-CBT)
      model for an East Asian demographic in Canada. The client population of East Asian youth who
      have been diagnosed with anxiety and/or depression are the focus of the study. CBT has been
      proven as a very effective form of therapy, and when adapted can promote positive mental
      health outcomes for a growing and increasingly vulnerable population. Developing a culturally
      adapted version of CBT (CA-CBT) for this population adds a practical treatment that improves
      access to culturally relevant care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a major lack of culturally relevant mental health services for East Asian youth in
      Ontario and Canada. Beginning with a participatory/qualitative research approach, common
      themes amongst clients, caregivers, healthcare professionals, and community leaders, will
      divulge basic elements needed to develop a culturally adapted model of cognitive behavioural
      therapy. The information from the adapted model will be taught to participating psychologists
      who will deliver the therapy in a randomized control trial design, with feasibility testing
      of the intervention using a quantitative approach ensuing. Immediate guidelines will then be
      developed for use by therapists working with East Asian youth.

    <intervention_model_description>East Asian youth diagnosed with Anxiety and/or depression will be randomly assigned to either the experimental group (receives the cultural adapted version of cognitive behavioral therapy) or the control group (non-culturally adapted cognitive behavioral therapy).

    <measure>Severity levels of depression and anxiety rated by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Severity levels of depression and anxiety will be rated pre- and post-intervention by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The scale ranges from 0 to 21 for anxiety and 0 to 21 for depression. A score of 0 to 7 for depression and/or anxiety is considered a normal range. A score of 8 to 10 suggests the potential presence of depression and/or anxiety. A score of 11 or more suggests a likely presence of depression and/or anxiety.</description>

    <measure>Severity levels of depression and anxiety rated by the Bradford Somatic Inventory (BSI).</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Severity levels of depression and anxiety will be rated pre- and post-intervention by the Bradford Somatic Inventory (BSI). The Bradford Somatic Inventory uses &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; questions relating to somatic symptoms of anxiety and/or depression. A &quot;yes&quot; response to a question equates to a somatic symptom linked to depression and/or anxiety. The maximum number of &quot;yes&quot; responses is 46 and the minimum is 0. A higher number of &quot;yes&quot; responses suggests a potential increase in the severity of depression and/or anxiety.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction of the culturally adapted Cognitive Behavioral Therapy assessed using the Verona Satisfaction Scale.</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Satisfaction will be measured using the Verona Satisfaction Scale. This scale measures patients satisfaction with health care services. The items are rated by 4 categories labelled: &quot;strongly disagree&quot;, &quot;disagree&quot;, &quot;agree&quot;, and &quot;strongly agree&quot;, on a scale of 1 to 4. A higher sub-scale/domain score indicates better satisfaction. All sub-scales are summed up to compute total/domain score. This scale will be used to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the therapy service and provide guidance for further development.</description>
