  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) is a chronic systemic inflammatory disease, which mainly
      affects the lacrimal and salivary glands, leading to sicca syndrome. pSS has a probable
      autoimmune etiology, with the production of several autoantibodies such as antinuclear
      antibodies (ANA), anti-Ro/SS-A, anti-La/SS-B, rheumatoid factor (RF) and cryoglobulins.
      Recently, our group described a high frequency of antibodies directed to DNase I in the serum
      of pSS patients and these antibodies were associated with the presence of the
      anti-Epstein-Barr (EBV) early antigen diffuse (anti-EA-D). This finding becomes interesting
      considering the recent description of reduction of DNase I activity in the tear of patients
      with xerophthalmia of different causes, which would result in an accumulation of
      extracellular DNA and neutrophilic inflammatory infiltrate on the ocular surface. This
      hypothesis is reinforced by the observation that treatment with DNase I as eye drops results
      in clinical improvement of dry eye. In addition, it has been shown that periodontal disease
      is an aggravating factor of xerostomia in pSS, as it leads to a chronic inflammatory process
      and, consequently, to the destruction of minor salivary glands. Therefore, the objective of
      the present study will be to evaluate the presence of antibodies directed to DNase I in the
      saliva and serum of pSS patients and its possible capacity of inhibition of the enzyme before
      and after treatment of periodontal disease. Such findings will be correlated with the
      presence of periodontal disease, with the glandular and extraglandular manifestations of SSp
      and also with the presence of EBV DNA in the serum and oral lavage of these patients.
