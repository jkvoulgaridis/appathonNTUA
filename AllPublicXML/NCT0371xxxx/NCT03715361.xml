  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to compare parameters obtained per SL-ECG with the values from
      12lead-ECG measurement. Patients who undergo out- or inpatient treatment and who receive a
      12lead-ECG are asked to participate in this examination. Furthermore, 50 patients without
      heart disease should be included (control group).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation is the most common cardiac arrhythmia in Germany. Clinical studies have
      shown that atrial fibrillation is associated with increased morbidity and mortality and
      reduced quality of life. Patients with atrial fibrillation have a three times higher risk of
      heart failure and a four to five times higher risk of ischemic stroke. In addition to these
      risks, atrial fibrillation is often asymptomatic and therefore more difficult to diagnose. It
      is estimated that about one third of all atrial fibrillation patients are asymptomatic.

      For this reason, the study &quot;Opportunistic Screening in Pharmacies for Atrial Fibrillation in
      Seniors&quot; was conducted in Aachen. Within four weeks more than 7000 volunteers could be
      measured in participating pharmacies using a ECG hand-held diagnostic tool. Since the already
      measured subjects only have the SL-ECG measurement of the hand-held diagnostic tool, the aim
      of this substudy is to establish a reference group. In this reference group a 12lead-ECG is
      performed by routine ECG and a SL-ECG measurement by ECG hand-held diagnostic tool. The aim
      of the study is to compare the measured parameters and to optimize the algorithm to evaluate
      the remaining SL-ECGs of the main study.

    <measure>Comparison of the SL-ECG (hand-held diagnostic tool) with the 12lead-ECG (gold standard) to identify and evaluate cardiac arrhythmias.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Month</time_frame>
    <description>The 12lead-ECG and the measurement of the hand-held diagnostic tool, performed by the proband/volunteer after the main examination, are crucial for the examination. The ECG hand-held diagnostic tool measures the heartbeat by analyzing the RR-intervals and gives a direct indication of irregularities through a red light after the measurement. Preliminary analyses showed a very good signal quality of the SL-ECG, therefore the times [s] and amplitudes [mV] of the P-wave, QRS-complex, T-wave, as well as the conduction and excitation shall be compared with each other and evaluated.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Analysis of SL-ECGs and validation of prognostic factors based person-specific data and their medical history.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Month</time_frame>
    <description>The descriptive analysis is performed comprehensively for the entire cohort and separately for people with known and newly discovered atrial fibrillation. The SL-ECG, person-specific data (e.g. age, BMI) and medical history (e.g. cardiovascular diseases, drug intake) are used to validate known prognostic factors and to find new prognostic factors. Continuous variables are summarized by calculating mean, median, standard deviation, quantiles and interquartile distances. For categorial variables, frequencies and percentages are calculated and tabulated. Based on these values, the raw incidence as well as age- and gender-specific incidences of atrial fibrillation can be calculated.</description>
