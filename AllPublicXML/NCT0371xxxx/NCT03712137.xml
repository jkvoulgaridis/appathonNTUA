    <measure>Percentage of subjects who show ≥ 1-point jawline improvement from baseline on the Allergan Loss ofJawline Definition Scale (ALJDS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>The ALJDS is an Investigator assessment of loss of jawline definition measured by a 5-point scale (0=None, 1=Mild, 2=Moderate, 3=Severe, 4=Extreme)</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants who note &quot;Improved&quot; or &quot;Much Improved&quot; in jawline area as Assessed by the Evaluating Investigator using the Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>The Evaluating Investigator (EI) will assess the aesthetic improvement of the nose using the GAIS 5-point scale where: 2=much improved, 1=improved, 0=no change, -1=worse and -2=much worse. The percentage of participants who the Evaluating Investigator assesses as 2=much improved or 1=improved will be reported.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline for FACE-Q™ Satisfaction with lower face and jawline score</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>The subject will assess satisfaction using the 5 items on the Satisfaction of Lower Face and Jawline module of the FACE-Q™ questionnaire measured on a 4-point scale (1=Not at all, 2=A little, 3=Moderately, 4=Extremely), this will be converted to a single score from 0 to 100.</description>
