    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators will compare the efficacy and side effects of two doses of
      norepinephrine bolus (6 mcg and 10 mcg) in management of maternal hypotensive episode after
      subarachnoid block during Cesarean delivery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Maternal hypotension after subarachnoid block is a frequent and deleterious complication
      during cesarean delivery. Although prophylaxis against hypotension using vasopressors had
      become a standard recommendation; the incidence of hypotension is still ∼ 20% . Thus;
      management of maternal hypotension using vasopressor boluses is usually needed .

      The commonly used vasopressors during cesarean delivery are ephedrine, phenylephrine, and
      recently norepinephrine. The use of ephedrine is usually accompanied with maternal
      tachycardia and fetal acidosis. Phenylephrine had been the first line for prevention and
      management of maternal hypotension; however, its use might result in bradycardia and
      decreased maternal cardiac output .

      Norepinephrine is an alpha adrenergic agonist with weak beta adrenergic agonistic activity;
      thus, it does not cause significant cardiac depression as phenylephrine does. Norepinephrine
      was introduced for use during cesarean delivery with promising results . Few previous studies
      investigated the efficacy of Norepinephrine infusion for prevention of maternal hypotension.
      A dose-response study had investigated the best dose of Norepinephrine for prevention of
      maternal hypotension. In the aforementioned dose-response study, a dose of 6 mcg was reported
      as the best dose for prophylaxis against maternal hypotension.

      No studies had investigated the best bolus dose of norepinephrine for management of a
      maternal hypotensive episode. In this study the investigators will investigate the efficacy
      and side effects of two doses of norepinephrine bolus doses (6 mcg and 10 mcg) in management
      of maternal hypotensive episode after subarachnoid block during cesarean delivery.
