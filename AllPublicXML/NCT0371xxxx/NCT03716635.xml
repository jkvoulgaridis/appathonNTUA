      the aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of cryotherapy on postoperative pain in molar
      teeth with irreversible pulpitis and apical periodontitis

  <detailed_description>

      the purpose of the study was to evaluate the effect of 2.5c cold saline irrigation as a final
      irrigant on postoperative pain after single visit root canal treatment of teeth with vital
      pulp and apical periodontitis .thirty patients will be included in the study .the teeth will
      be divided into 2 groups (i.e the control group and the cryotherapy group ) in the
      cryotherapy group ,final irrigation with 2.5c cold saline solution for 5 mins will be
      performed following completion of biomechanical preparation whereas in control group same
      solution stored at room temperature will be used . treatment will be done in a single visit
      then participants will be asked to rate the intensity of postoperative pain using numerical
      rating scale at 6,12,24,48 hrs
