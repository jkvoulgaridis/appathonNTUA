  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endovascular revascularization has revolutionized the field of vascular surgery and has
      become the first-choice treatment for peripheral arteries occlusive disease. However, the
      drawback of this technic is the X-ray exposure for both patients and staff and the iodinated
      contrast injection for the patient.

      One way to reduce both radiation and contrast use is to use advanced imaging techniques
      allowing an overlay of a 3D vascular mask (from a pre-operative CT scan) onto the live X-ray
      image. This has been proven during endovascular aneurysm repair.

      This advanced imaging application is currently available only in the latest expensive hybrid
      operating rooms, requires additional manoeuvre from the operator throughout the procedure,
      and may be X-rays and contrast consuming.

      This trial will examine the clinical benefits based on patient and staff' radiation exposure
      during aorto-iliac revascularisation, of a new software imaging guidance, suitable for any
      theatre including those equipped with mobile C-arm, fully automated and with a radiation free
      overlay registration process.
