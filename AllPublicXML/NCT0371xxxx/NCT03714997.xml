      The goal of this study is to identify the comparative efficacy of high-intensity walking
      training in individuals with chronic, motor incomplete spinal cord injury as compared to
      lower-intensity walking exercise.

      Background/Readiness: The objective of this proposal is to maximize locomotor outcomes of
      patients following incomplete spinal cord injury (iSCI) through identification of
      rehabilitation strategies that maximize recovery. Specific training parameters, such as
      provision of large amounts of stepping, appears to facilitate locomotor function in patients
      with iSCI, although other factors may be critical. In this proposed phase II randomized
      clinical trial, the overarching hypothesis is that the &quot;intensity&quot; of locomotor practice,
      defined as power output and estimated using cardiopulmonary measures, is critical to
      maximizing walking outcomes. Performance of high intensity locomotor training increases the
      cardiovascular and neuromuscular demands, which results in physiological changes that
      facilitate greater locomotor performance in individuals with and without neurological injury.
      There are, however, limited data supporting its utility in patients with iSCI. Recent
      findings suggest a role for high-intensity stepping training in variable contexts, with gains
      in peak locomotor capacity as compared low-intensity variable training. Additional changes in
      cardiopulmonary function and neuromuscular coordination provide a mechanistic rationale for
      the utility of this strategy. Such changes are likely due to increased central (volitional)
      activation, and are in sharp contrast to the long-standing notion that high intensity
      training impairs motor function in neurological injury.

      Despite these data, genotypic variations suggest specific caveats related to high intensity
      training. For example, many patients possess a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variation
      in the brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene that may impact the activity-dependent
      BDNF expression thought to contribute to neuroplasticity underlying improved performance.
      This single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) can influential declarative memory, with recent
      data suggesting a potential impact on motor recovery after neurologic injury. Previous
      studies indicate limited BDNF increases in patients with this SNP during high intensity
      exercise, although the effects of locomotor recovery with repeated high-intensity training is
      unclear Hypothesis/Specific Aims: The primary hypotheses are that high intensity variable
      stepping can markedly improve locomotor performance as well as neuromuscular and
      cardiopulmonary function as compared to lower-intensity training in patients with chronic
      motor iSCI. It is believed that genotypic variations in the ability to synthesis activity
      dependent BDNF may modify the effects of high intensity training. Specific Aim 1: Test if
      high intensity stepping training in variable contexts results in greater locomotor gains as
      compared to lower intensity interventions. Specific Aim 2: Test the effects of these training
      strategies on neuromuscular and cardiopulmonary impairments. Specific Aim 3: Test the effects
      of the presence of the BDNF SNP on locomotor improvements in patients following
      high-intensity activities Study Design: This phase II, stratified, assessor- blinded
      randomized clinical trial will assess the effects 2 months (up to 30 sessions) of high- vs
      low-intensity variable stepping training on ambulatory patients with chronic (&gt; 1year) motor
      iSCI. Participants referred from outpatient therapy settings will undergo evaluation of
      locomotor performance, cardiopulmonary capacity, and neuromuscular coordination and
      impairments prior to and following each training paradigm, with 2-month follow-up
      assessments.

      Clinical Impact: The application of high-intensity locomotor training in the clinical
      rehabilitation of patients with iSCI is extremely limited, despite data regarding the
      potential benefits in neurological intact individuals and patients with stroke. The clinical
      application of high-intensity training represents a simple, readily modified training
      parameter that can be readily implemented, and is in stark contrast to current clinical
      practice and challenge traditional dogma in rehabilitation medicine.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria

          -  Individuals with motor incomplete SCI (AIS C or D) &gt; 12 mo. duration will be recruited
             to participate in the study, with further criteria including anatomical lesions
             between C1-T10..

          -  Participants will be between 18 and 75 years of age (note: while participants &gt; 50 yrs
             with subacute SCI have a reduced probability of functional ambulation 79, participants
             will already be ambulatory with only minimal or no assistance and in the chronic phase
             of rehabilitation, and prediction rules using age will not necessarily apply in this
             study).

          -  All participants must be able to perform walking training with passive range of motion
             within the limits of normal locomotor function, including: 0-30 degrees ankle
             plantarflexion, knee flexion from 0 to 90 degrees, hip flexion to 0-90 degrees.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Participants with body mass &gt; 400 lbs will be excluded, which is the highest limit for
             use of our motorized treadmill and safety harness systems.

          -  Participants will be medically stable with medical clearance to participate, with
             absence of concurrent severe medical illness including: unhealed decubiti, existing
             infection, significant cardiovascular or metabolic disease which limits exercise
             participation, significant osteoporosis (as indicated by history of fractures
             following injury), active heterotrophic ossification in the lower extremities, known
             history of peripheral nerve injury in lower legs, history of traumatic brain injury,
             and history of pulmonary complications that limits exercise capacity, including
             significant obstructive and/or restrictive lung diseases.

          -  Participants who are ventilator-dependent will be excluded secondary to severely
             impaired respiratory capacity.

          -  Participants with substantial orthopedic bracing to stabilize the cervical or thoracic
             vertebral column are not eligible due to safety concerns with harness supported
             ambulation training..

          -  Patients will also be excluded if they are unable to tolerate 10 minutes of standing
             without orthostasis (decrease in blood pressure by 20 mmHg systolic and 10 mmHg
             diastolic); previous experience in the sub-acute population suggests that 10 minutes
             of standing is more than sufficient for tolerating 45 minutes of walking secondary to
             increased activity/muscle pump minimizing risk for orthostasis.

          -  Individuals who are undergoing concurrent physical therapy will be excluded from the
             study population to eliminate confounding effects of additional physical
             interventions, Other therapies, such as occupational or speech therapies, will be
             allowed as prescribed by their physician. Individuals will be allowed and encouraged
             to continue their normal exercise routines during the course of the intervention, with
             activity monitors measuring stepping activity in all participants

          -  Women of childbearing potential will not be excluded, although women who are pregnant
             or who are considering becoming pregnant will be excluded due to the trunk and pelvis
             restraints required for use during locomotion.

          -  All subjects prescribed oral anti-spastic medications will not be excluded, although
             patients with intrathecal baclofen pumps or history of recent (&lt; 3 months) botulinum
             toxin injection in the lower extremities will be excluded due to potential increases
             in weakness interfering with the effects of stepping training performance.

          -  Patients with a known history of autonomic dysreflexia will not be excluded, although
             specific signs and symptoms of all patients with history of injury &gt; T6 anatomical
             level will be closely monitored throughout training.

        Other criteria

          -  Men and women will be recruited for participation in the proposed clinical trial at
             rates consistent with national and local average of gender disparities of SCI (80%
             male, 20% women). Women of childbearing potential will not be excluded, although women
             who are pregnant or who are considering becoming pregnant will be excluded due to the
             trunk and pelvis restraints required for use during locomotion.

          -  Individuals of different ethnicities will be recruited at rates similar to the
             national and local ethnicity rates. Current data since 2005 indicate that of the
             entire population of SCI, 66.1% are Caucasian, 27.1% are African American, 6.6% are of
             Hispanic origin, and 2.0% Asian. These populations closely resemble those at RHI and
             in our previous studies in human SCI.
