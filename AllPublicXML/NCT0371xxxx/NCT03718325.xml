  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently a new form of spinal cord stimulation therapy called burst spinal cord stimulation
      (Burst-SCS) is available to treat chronic pain. The goal of this study is to learn more about
      how Burst-SCS works to reduce chronic pain. The study will examine chronic pain patients who
      have been deemed candidates for Burst-SCS therapy, and who have already been selected to
      receive a temporary externalized trial of Burst-SCS from their own doctors as part of their
      standard clinical care for chronic pain management. During the study, participants will be
      asked to complete a variety of evaluations at certain time points. In addition, there will be
      a randomized, double blind, crossover phase, where the particular effects of Burst-SCS and
      sham SCS will be evaluated. The device used to deliver Burst-SCS and sham SCS is the St. Jude
      Medical Invisible Trial System.

    <masking_description>There will be two research teams. One team will be unblinded (e.g. clinical care provider/company representative, study coordinator) and will perform stimulator programming/adjustment, and the other team will be blinded (e.g. research personnel) and will perform clinical testing and collect study outcome measures.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-implant visit, up to approximately 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>VAS is a horizontal line 100 millimeters (mm) in length with the word &quot;no pain&quot; and &quot;worst possible pain&quot; with a score between 0 (no pain) to a score of 100 (worst possible pain). The participant marks on the line the point that they feel represents their perception of their current state. The score is determined by measuring in millimeters from the left hand with a total range of 0-100 millimeters. Higher VAS values represent more severe pain.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SFMPQ) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-implant visit, up to approximately 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>SFMPQ will be used to describe the quality of pain and has 15 descriptors (11 sensory and 4 affective). Each descriptor is scored by a 4-point intensity scale (0=none to 3=severe) (sensory range 0-45). Three pain scores are derived from the sum of the intensity rank values of the words chosen for sensory, affective and total descriptors. The SFMPQ also includes the Present Pain Intensity (PPI) index (for example (i.e.) the VAS) and an Evaluative Overall Intensity of Total Pain Experience.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in General Pain Disability Index (PDI) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-implant visit, up to approximately 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of pain will be described by using this 6-question survey regarding daily living activity. Range is 0 (0 points, completely able to function) to 10 (10 points, totally unable to function). The higher the number score the greater the disability (due to pain).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-implant visit, up to approximately 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Pain severity is measured and includes 9 questions with scores ranging from 0 to 10 with higher scores indicating more severe pain and greater interference with functioning.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Michigan Body Map (MBM)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to approximately 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Pain spread will be collected by having the participants check all areas of their body as outlined on the body map where they have felt persistent or recurrent pain. If there is no pain, the No chronic pain box will be marked. MBM will be used to assess body areas where chronic pain is experienced, and quantify the degree of widespread body pain in the participant (i.e. pain centralization).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fibromyalgia Survey Questionnaire (FSQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to approximately 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participant is to mark where they have had pain or tenderness on a map of their body (or mark no pain in areas). FSQ in combination with the MBM will be used to assess pain centralization.</description>
