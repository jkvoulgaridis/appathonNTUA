  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study that evaluates the dialysis clearance and pharmacokinetics of
      antibiotics with different protein-bound levels in patients receiving renal replacement
      therapy. Meropenem, vancomycin and ceftriaxone are selected to represent three typical
      protein-bound levels, and the primary dialysis methods being studied are intermittent
      hemodialysis(IHD) and hemodiafiltration(HDF). During and after the dialysis, the drug levels
      in both plasma and spent dialysate are monitored, but no changes are made to therapy. The
      study will provide detailed information on the characteristics of the removal kinetics of the
      three antibiotics during dialysis, and evaluate whether the dosing regimens are the most
      appropriate to achieve therapeutic targets while minimizing the risk of toxicity.

      This prospective, single-center observational study is taken to evaluate the dialysis
      clearance and pharmacokinetics of antibiotics with three different protein-bound levels in
      patients receiving renal replacement therapy. As is known that the plasma protein binding
      rate affects the distribution, metabolism and elimination of the drug in the body, and is
      also an important factor affecting the removal during dialysis, the study selects meropenem,
      vancomycin and ceftriaxone, of which the protein-bound levels are respectively 2%, 55% and
      85%, to represent three typical protein-bound levels. The primary dialysis methods being
      studied are intermittent hemodialysis(IHD) and hemodiafiltration(HDF). The dialysis pattern,
      the antibiotic choice and its dosage for each subject are made on clinical grounds. A total
      of 16 milliliters of blood and 60 milliliters of spent dialysate are collected from each
      subject for each dialysis pattern. The study will provide detailed information on the
      characteristics of the removal kinetics of the three antibiotics during dialysis, and
      evaluate whether the dosing regimens are the most appropriate to achieve therapeutic targets
      while minimizing the risk of toxicity.
