  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adult patients with medically inoperable and operable secondary soft tissue lesion(s) of the
      lung less than 2cm will undergo transbronchial microwave ablation performed by an
      interventional pulmonologist or thoracic surgeon using cone beam CT imaging for probe
      guidance and confirmation on ablation outcome. All treated patients will be followed for one
      year following the ablation procedure for efficacy and safety.

    <measure>Device User Experience Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>Day of ablation (day 0)</time_frame>
    <description>The Device User Experience Survey is an unvalidated, Sponsor-generated questionnaire aimed to increase the Sponsor's understanding of the usability of the NEUWAVE microwave ablation system. The questionnaire asks approximately 30 questions (includes yes/no responses, rating scales, and fill-in-the-blank sections) and is to be completed by the treating physician at the completion of each ablation. A summary of all treating physician responses will be generated at the completion of the study to summarize the overall user experience with the device.</description>

    <time_frame>1 year post-ablation</time_frame>
    <description>The EORTC (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer) QLQ-C30 is a quality of life questionnaire with 13 questions aimed specifically for lung cancer patients. The questionnaire asks patients to rate their responses on a scale from 1-4 (1 being &quot;not at all&quot; and 4 being &quot;very much&quot;).
