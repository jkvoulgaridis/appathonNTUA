  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single arm, multi-center, observational clinical study of the DyeVert
      Plus System. The DyeVert Plus System is an FDA-cleared device designed to reduce contrast
      media volume delivered during angiography and permit real-time contrast media volume
      monitoring.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this observational study is to evaluate the amount of contrast media saved
      using DyeVert Plus in coronary angiographic and/or interventional procedures performed with
      manual injection and evaluate the impact of predetermined thresholds and real-time
      monitoring.

    <description>An adverse event is defined as &quot;any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury, or untoward clinical signs (including abnormal laboratory findings) in subjects, users or other persons, whether or not related to the medical device.&quot; DyeVert Plus System-related adverse events will be collected. Additionally, contrast media-related adverse events, such as acute kidney injury and anaphylactic shock, will be collected.</description>

    <description>The DyeVert Plus System interfaces with standard manifold systems to provide real-time contrast monitoring and reduce the amount of contrast used in catheterization procedures while maintaining fluoroscopic image quality. System components include a disposable, single-use, sterile DyeVert Plus Disposable Kit that contains a Smart Syringe and DyeVert Plus Module, which is connected to a standard manifold and provides fluid pathway resistance modulation via a dedicated diversion valve. The diversion valve self-adjusts to the manual injection pressure to divert some of the contrast media into the reservoir chamber within the module. This diverted volume of contrast media does not enter the patient.</description>
