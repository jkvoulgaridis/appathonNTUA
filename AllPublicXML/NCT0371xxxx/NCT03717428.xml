      Cornell employee's were recruited for a two-year weight gain prevention study. Height and
      weights were taken in our metabolic center. They were randomized into two group. The
      experimental group was given an internet based scale and asked to weigh themselves every
      morning immediately after rising. The other group was asked to return at the end of the study
      when they height and weight will again be measured.

In addition, the intervention in Daily Weighing Group is that they will be given an internet based scale and asked to weigh themselves immediately after rising from bed every morning for the duration of the two year experimental period.</description>
