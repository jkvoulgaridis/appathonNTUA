  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is a pilot study, conducting on 6 healthy women and aiming at defining new biomarkers
      related to wheat bran fermentation. For this, a breakfast, containing 5 biscuits enriched in
      13-C wheat bran (which grown under 13-CO2 enriched atmosphere) is given to the subjects, then
      a following will be realized on 24h with breath, urine, fecal and blood samples. Analysis
      will be performed on these samples in order to determine potential biomarkers of fibers
      consumption to evaluate the metabolic effects of this consumption and to refine the relevance
      of nutritional recommendation regarding fibers for healthy subjects.
