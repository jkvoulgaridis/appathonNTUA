      Over the past decade, experimental data has suggested a complex and bidirectional interaction
      between the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and the central nervous system (CNS), the so-called
      &quot;Gut- Brain axis.&quot; . Changes in the gut microbiota composition may cause alterations in the
      gut barrier function and intestinal permeability, affecting not only GI epithelial cells and
      immune system, but also the ENS including both neurons and glial cells . The bidirectional
      brain-gut-microbiota axis interactions modulate pro- and anti-inflammatory responses. It has
      been suggested that the gut microbiota changes associated with intestinal inflammation may
      contribute to the initiation of α-syn misfolding. There is a growing number of evidence
      confirming that the gut microbiota alterations precede or occur during the course of PD.
      Importantly, some genetic risk factors may play a crucial role in the interactions between
      the brain-gut-microbiota axis with respect to gut inflammation. It has been also shown that
      the methylation status in the SNCA promoter region may affect α-syn expression and the risk
      for PD. Therefore, a potential role of the gut microbiota as an epigenetic factor influencing
      DNA methylation may be speculated. Moreover, genetic variant of the component of innate
      immune system - TREM2 (Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid cells) has been reported to
      be associated with a higher risk for PD. The ε4 allele of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) has been
      shown to increase the risk for dementia in synucleinopathies such as PD. Potentially, ApoE
      genotype, by influencing bile acid secretion, could affect the composition of the gut
      microbiota to favor the development of organisms triggering misfolding. Moreover, three
      single nucleotide polymorphisms in CARD15 gene, known to be associated with Crohn's disease,
      have been also shown to be over-expressed in PD patients, supporting the observation that GI
      inflammation contributes to the pathogenesis of PD.

      -  Normal gut microbiota is essential in preventing colonization of the harmful bacteria by
           competing with them for vital resources such as food and growth factors .

        -  Another way that gut microbiota can enhance the function of the intestinal barrier is
           through protecting and improving epithelial tight junctions.

        -  Infection and disease can also briefly affect natural gut flora composition and
           consequently have harmful effects on the host . Toxins produced by pathogenic
           microorganisms and the focal inflammation created by immune responses to them can
           increase gut permeability.

      Impaired intestinal barrier function and consequent increased gut permeability can lead to
      increased translocation of gut bacteria across the intestinal wall and into the mesenteric
      lymphoid tissue. Furthermore, increased permeability of the gut can also increase the
      translocation of metabolic products such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or neuroactive peptides
      created by the bacteria that can alter the activity of the enteric nervous system (ENS) and
      central nervous system (CNS). Increased exposure of the ENS or mucosal immune cells to
      bacteria can provoke an immune response that can lead to release of inflammatory cytokines
      and activation of the vagus nerve and spinal afferent neurons. Inflammatory cytokines and the
      vagal system in turn can modulate the activity of the CNS and ENS.Neuro/immune-active
      substances derived from the intestinal lumen can penetrate the gut mucosa, be transported by
      blood, cross the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) and affect the CNS. Gut microbiota can influence
      CNS function through their ability to synthesize or mimic a range of host-signaling
      neuroactive molecules, such as acetylcholine (Ach), catecholamines, gamma-aminobutyric acid
      (GABA), histamine, melatonin and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin). 5-HT is crucial in
      the regulation of of peristalsis or modulation of sensation.

      Parkinson's disease (PD) is a multicentric neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the
      accumulation and aggregation of alfa-synuclein (α-syn) in the substantia nigra in the central
      nervous system (CNS) and in other neural structures. The classical motor symptoms like
      bradykinesia, resting tremor, rigidity and late postural instability result from the death of
      dopamine-generating cells in the substantia nigra. There is also a wide spectrum of non-motor
      manifestations involving for example olfactory (loss of smell), gastrointestinal (GI),
      cardiovascular and urogenital systems. It has become evident that the different levels of the
      brain-gut axis including the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and the enteric nervous system
      (ENS) may be affected in PD. Recently, it has been also recognized that the brain-gut axis
      interactions may be essentially influenced by the gut microbiota. On the one hand,
      dysregulation of the brain-gut-microbiota axis in PD may result in GI dysfunction, which is
      present in over 80% of PD subjects . On the other hand, this dysregulation may also
      significantly contribute to the pathogenesis of PD itself, supporting the hypothesis that the
      pathological process is spread from the gut to the brain .

      GUT MICROBIOTA AND PARKINSON'S DISEASE

      Over the past decade, experimental data has suggested a complex and bidirectional interaction
      between the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and the central nervous system (CNS), the so-called
      &quot;Gut- Brain axis.&quot; . Changes in the gut microbiota composition may cause alterations in the
      gut barrier function and intestinal permeability, affecting not only GI epithelial cells and
      immune system, but also the ENS including both neurons and glial cells . The bidirectional
      brain-gut-microbiota axis interactions modulate pro- and anti-inflammatory responses. It has
      been suggested that the gut microbiota changes associated with intestinal inflammation may
      contribute to the initiation of α-syn misfolding. There is a growing number of evidence
      confirming that the gut microbiota alterations precede or occur during the course of PD.
      However, the causal relationship between the microbiota changes and the pathogenesis of PD
      remains unclear.

      The interesting concept of molecular mimicry involving the microbiota in neurodegeneration
      has been also proposed. Indeed, Friedland suggested that bacterial proteins may elicit
      cross-seeded misfolding, inflammation and oxidative stress, and cellular toxicity in
      neurodegeneration, initiating or otherwise influencing the development of PD, Alzheimer's
      disease and other related disorders. Pathways of molecular mimicry processes induced by
      bacterial amyloid may involve TLR2/1, C14, and NFκB among others. Priming of the innate
      immune system by the microbiota (residing in the gut and oral/nasal cavities) may enhance the
      inflammatory response to cerebral amyloids such as α-syn. Trudler et al postulated that
      cerebral amyloid may mimic viral or bacterial infection resulting in glial cell activation
      through TLRs. Specifically, it has been documented that neuroinflammation in PD is associated
      with upregulation of TLR2 signaling and activation of microglia. TLR2, playing an important
      role in the regulation of intestinal barrier integrity, has been also found to activate
      microglial cells in the CNS. It has been suggested that the peripheral immune response
      characterized by the presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-8 in
      the serum induces a disruption of the blood-brain barrier and promotes microglia-mediated
      inflammation and neurotoxicity. In a germ-free animal model, it has been found that the gut
      microbiota influences the blood-brain barrier permeability associated with reduced expression
      of the tight junction proteins in a homological way as it affects the intestinal epithelial
      barrier. Very recently, Sui et al proved that a bidirectional transport of α-syn into and out
      of the brain by the blood-brain barrier is possible and suggested that LPS-induced
      inflammation could increase α-syn uptake by the brain by disrupting the blood-brain barrier.

      In an animal model of PD, peripherally-induced inflammation was shown to induce the
      microglial complement pathway to damage dopaminergic neurons. Several studies have
      demonstrated that pro-inflammatory factors associated with chronic GI diseases induce brain
      inflammation and the death of dopaminergic neurons and could eventually be responsible for
      parkinsonism.

      Importantly, some genetic risk factors may play a crucial role in the interactions between
      the brain-gut-microbiota axis with respect to gut inflammation. It has been also shown that
      the methylation status in the SNCA promoter region may affect α-syn expression and the risk
      for PD. Therefore, a potential role of the gut microbiota as an epigenetic factor influencing
      DNA methylation may be speculated. Moreover, genetic variant of the component of innate
      immune system - TREM2 (Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid cells) has been reported to
      be associated with a higher risk for PD. The ε4 allele of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) has been
      shown to increase the risk for dementia in synucleinopathies such as PD. Potentially, ApoE
      genotype, by influencing bile acid secretion, could affect the composition of the gut
      microbiota to favor the development of organisms triggering misfolding. Moreover, three
      single nucleotide polymorphisms in CARD15 gene, known to be associated with Crohn's disease,
      have been also shown to be over-expressed in PD patients, supporting the observation that GI
      inflammation contributes to the pathogenesis of PD.
