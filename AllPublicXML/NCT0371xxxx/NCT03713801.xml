      The objective of this study is to determine whether metformin (MET) can improve the immune
      response to the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-13) in older adults, and if this effect
      is mediated by the gut microbiota.

      The proposed research projects will provide the necessary pilot data for future, more
      definitive, studies that will evaluate the impact of immunomodulatory therapies, such as MET
      therapy, on the aging immune system. The specific aims are:

      Aim 1. Compare PCV13 vaccine response in elderly adults (â‰¥63 years of age) treated with MET
      vs. placebo. For this study, 50 elderly volunteers will be enrolled and randomly assigned to
      receive MET or placebo. The hypothesis that MET can improve vaccine responsiveness by
      measuring serotype-specific IgG concentrations before and 30 days after PCV13 administration
      will be tested.

      Aim 2. Determine whether the frequencies of immunophenotypes differ between elderly adults
      treated with MET vs. placebo. The mechanisms of MET's effect on the immune system by
      comparing immunophenotypes of MET and placebo groups between baseline and prior to PCV13 and
      between baseline and 30 days after PCV13 administration will be explored.

    <description>The primary outcome will be antibody responses to PCV13. Antibody levels of each of the 13 different serotypes (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F and 23F) will be compared between the pre-treatment values and the post treatment values.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Measure of immunophenotypes</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The distribution of immunophenotypes will be presented descriptively at each time point for each treatment group. To determine which immunophenotypes differed between MET and placebo groups, changes will be determined using within-patient cell count ratios for each measured phenotype between baseline and 6-weeks of study drug treatment and between baseline and the 30 days after PCV13.</description>
