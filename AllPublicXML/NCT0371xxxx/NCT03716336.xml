    <textblock>
      A total of 40 premenopausal women diagnosed clinically as having insulin resistance. Their
      ages ranged from 35 to 45 years old; their body mass index was &gt;30 kg/m2 and They were obese
      women complained of insulin resistance and non diabetic or cardiovascular disease, were
      randomly assigned to group A participated in aerobic &amp; resistive exercise program, and group
      B participated in aerobic exercise and followed prescribed diet restriction program. Both of
      the groups (A&amp;B) followed the treatment program 3 times per weeks for 8 weeks. Assessment of
      the fasting glucose, fasting insulin, and HOMA test of insulin resistance were measured for
      all subjects in both groups (A and B) was carried out before and after the end of the
      treatment program

      Forty obese premenopausal women diagnosed as having insulin resistance were participated in
      this study. They were selected randomly from the out Patient Clinic of Obstetrics at Kasr El
      Ainy University Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University. Their age ranged from 35 -
      45years, their body mass (BMI) were&gt;30kg/m2. Exclusion criteria of the study were as follows:
      Patients having diabetic or cardiovascular disease, Patients with life threatening disorders
      as renal failure and myocardial infarction, Patients with active malignancy and patients with
      severe hemorrhage, hyperthyroidism, acute viral diseases and mental disorders. Participants
      were assigned randomly used sealed envelope into two groups (A&amp;B) equally in number. Group
      (A): (Combined resistive and aerobic exercise group) consisted of 20 women were participated
      in aerobic &amp; resistive exercise program, 3 times per weeks for 8 weeks. Group (B): consisted
      of 20 women were participated in aerobic exercise 3 times per weeks for 8 weeks and followed
      prescribed diet restriction program.
