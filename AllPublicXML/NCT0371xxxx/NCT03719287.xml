  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A multi-center, national prevalence study where: (1) baseline SPIVC therapy complications of
      hospitalized adult patients that meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria of the study and (2)
      the compliance of clinicians to the Hospital's evidence based practice will be measured in
      Brazil.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At each participating research site, select nurse clinicians who are experienced or experts
      in short peripheral I.V. catheter (SPIVC) therapy, will audit medical records and observe the
      SPIVC sites of adult patients in various hospital wards until a minimum total of 300 SPIVC
      sites are audited among 3 Brazilian acute care hospitals. The wards audited will be selected
      by the Investigator and will be audited during a specified time period until at least 100
      SPIVCs are audited. The time to complete the study will depend on the size of the select
      wards, the number of nurse auditors and the number of monitoring visits required.

      There are no treatments. The short peripheral I.V. catheter-related medical devices
      (products) observed during the study are currently approved by Brazil regulatory agencies,
      purchased by the hospital and available to the clinician at the time of the study.

        Adult patients admitted to the wards of the participating acute care hospitals that will be
        audited in the study. To minimize subject selection bias, all subjects will be identified
        and invited to participate in the study consecutively, as the auditor screens the ward on
        the day of the audit.
