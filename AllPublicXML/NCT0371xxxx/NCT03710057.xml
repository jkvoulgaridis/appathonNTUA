  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elevated Heart rate (HR) (â‰¥ 70 bpm) is one of the contributing factors in increasing the
      burden of hospitalization among Heart Failure patient. Ivabradine is a novel, selective and
      specific in inhibiting a Funny current in sinoatrial node Node and approved as an alternative
      therapy for Chronic Heart Failure (CHF) patients. CHF patients when treated with Ivabradine
      reported 39%, and 30% reduction in mortality and hospitalization rate respectively. Patient
      were treated with Ivabradine 5mg twice daily to determine its effect in lowering Heart rate
      and the Quality of Life (QOL) in Chronic Heart Failure patients

      A prospective, post-marketing observational study was conducted in 50 chronic heart failure
      patients with age 30-70yrs of NYHA Class II and prescribed 5 mg Ivabradine twice daily. Heart
      rate was evaluated through ECG &amp; quality of life was measured by a validated questionnaire
      EuroQol-5 Dimension 3 level version (EQ-5D-3L). Baseline demographic includes age, gender,
      height, weight, Body Mass Index, temperature, blood pressure and respiratory rate were
      recorded and patients were followed at week 4 and week 8. Safety and tolerability was
      assessed by adverse drug reaction (ADR) monitoring. Results were analyzed by statistical
      software SPSS version 20.0.

    <description>Quality of Life was determined through validated questionnaire EQ-5D-3L. It also assesses five dimensions of HR quality of life (HRQoL): mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain or discomfort, and anxiety or depression. Each dimension is measured one to three levels i.e 1, 2, 3. Where level 2 &amp; 3 indicates 'problem' and level 1 denotes to 'no problem'.</description>

        The study population was included male or female patients with Chronic Heart Failure (CHF).
        Diagnosis of CHF as per Boston Criteria for Diagnosing Heart failure and the New York Heart
        Association (NYHA) functional class II to III classification and rest on the based on the
        medical judgment of the investigator after review of subject's medical history, results of
        routine screening physical and general examination and routine laboratory investigations.

        Patients' written authorization was used to obtain patients' data. However, patient data
        secrecy was followed by ICH GCP requirements.
