  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research tries to investigate the validity and reliability of eye-tracking technologies
      by using different paradigms (eg. free-view, pro-saccade and anti-saccade) which served as a
      novel way of evaluating suicide risk among affective disorder patients including bipolar and
      unipolar depression. All the participants including health control will be assessed by
      clinical interviewing, self-report assessment, cognitive evaluation and eye-tracking task.

    <description>After completing a demographics form, theBeck Depression Inventory,Beck Anxiety Inventory,Barratt Impulsiveness Scale and Ruminative Response Scale-21, each participant has to go to the eye-tracking room and seats in a height adjustable chair and places their chin in a chin rest which was positioned to make sure all participants' eye are in the same location relative to the camera and the monitor.
There are 18 trials and 2 filler trials in the free-view task, each of which contains 4 pictures on the same screen for 25 seconds. There is also a gap screen between each trial lasting for 2 seconds when participants were asked to fixate in the center of the screen. During the experiment, participants are instructed to watch the screen as naturally as possible, and the initial location of the fixation of each trial and the total dwell time of each emotional images(negative, happy, neutral and suicide-related)and the changes of the pupil size were recorded.</description>

        Participants were recruited from outpatients in psychiatric clinic and clinical
        psychological clinic, and inpatients residing in the mental health hospital.

        Most of the healthy volunteers were recruited from the advertisement posters in community
        and medical college.

        There are two steps for screening. Firstly, each person was asked to complete the BDI (Beck
        Depression Inventory,21-items) to evaluate the depressive symptoms. Individuals with scores
        less than 13 and more than 20 were enrolled for this study.

        Secondly, each individual has to be taken for a structural diagnostic interview
        (MINI-International Neuropsychiatric Interview, M.I.N.I.6.0.) in order to diagnosis current
        disorder and evaluate suicide risk by a psychiatrist who had already clinical consistency
        training.
