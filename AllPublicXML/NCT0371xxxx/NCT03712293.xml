      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of the ExAblate Model 4000 Type 2.0 used
      as a tool to disrupt the BBB in patients with Glioblastoma undergoing standard of care
      therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multisingle-center, single-arm study to establish the safety and
      feasibility of BBB disruption along the periphery of tumor resection cavity using the
      ExAblate Neuro Model 4000 Type 2.0 (220 kHz) system. For this study, patients will be
      eligible to enroll in the study prior to beginning the planned adjuvant TMZ chemotherapy
      phase of treatment. Of note, only patients who are deemed eligible for adjuvant TMZ will be
      eligible for enrollment. This study will enroll up to 20 subjects.

    <intervention_model_description>This study will enroll up to 10 patients who are eligible and recommended for the standard adjuvant phase of TMZ chemotherapy. The goal is for all subjects to undergo ExAblate Type 2.0 BBB disruption procedures on one of the first three days of each TMZ dosing cycle throughout the adjuvant phase (up to 6 cycles).</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The type and severity of adverse events post-procedure will be assessed for overall safety. Safety of the BBBD procedure will be evaluated through patient examination and MRI assessments during the treatment and by their standard of care follow-up MRI scans and clinical visits. The standard of care follow-up MRI scans will be used to continue safety monitoring post-BBBD procedures and after adjuvant TMZ chemotherapy is completed.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient is eligible for adjuvant TMZ treatment based on the current standard of care.

          2. Men or women.

          3. Age between 19 and 80 years, inclusive.

          4. Able and willing to give informed consent.

          5. Grade IV glioma (GBM) confirmed through assessment of surgical specimens by a
             board-certified neuropathologist.

          6. Combined radiation/TMZ treatment is completed based on the prescribed standard of care
             regimen.

          7. Karnofsky rating 70-100 (See Appendix B).

          8. Able to communicate during the ExAblate BBBD procedure.

          9. Able to attend all study visits (i.e., life expectancy of at least 3 months).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The sonication pathway to the tumor involves:

             i. More than 30% of the skull area traversed by the sonication pathway is covered by
             scars, scalp disorders (e.g., eczema), or atrophy of the scalp.

             ii. Clips or other metallic implanted objects in the skull or the brain, except
             shunts.

          2. The subject presents with symptoms and signs of increased intracranial pressure (e.g.,
             headache, nausea, vomiting, lethargy, and papilledema).

          3. Patients with cerebellar or brainstem tumors.

          4. Patient receiving bevacizumab (Avastin) therapy.

          5. Patients receiving treatment with corticosteroid doses greater than dexamethasone 16mg

             stereotactic radiosurgery, laser interstitial thermotherapy, and tumor treatment
             fields therapy. These regimens have been shown to cause contrast enhancement in the

             recurrence [35] [36], [37-39].

         13. History of drug or alcohol use disorder.

         14. Active seizure disorder or epilepsy (seizures despite medical treatment).

         15. Known sensitivity to gadolinium-based contrast agents.

         16. Known sensitivity to DEFINITYÂ® ultrasound contrast agent or perflutren.

             medications known to cause QTc prolongation, or QT prolongation observed on screening
             ECG (QTc &gt; 450 for men and &gt;470 for women).
