  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with opioid use disorder who are stabilized on buprenorphine or methadone will be
      randomly assigned to receive placebo or lofexidine for 5 weeks. At the end of five weeks,
      they will complete a human laboratory stress task and scripted opioid imagery task.
      Throughout the study a CREMA app (Cue Reactivity Ecological Momentary Assessment) will be
      used to monitor stress, craving and use in the natural environment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will complete a screening visit to determine study eligibility. During the first
      week, participants will be asked to abstain from opioid use other than buprenorphine.
      Participants will come to the clinic 3 times that week for urine drug testing. If all 3 tests
      are negative, participants will be randomly assigned to take either lofexidine or placebo
      (inactive medication) two to three times a day for 5 weeks. During this time, participants
      will upload videos of themselves taking their medication. They will come to the clinic 3
      times a week for urine drug screens and to have their vital signs measured. They will also
      participate in &quot;CREMA&quot; sessions (Cue Reactivity Ecologic Momentary Assessment) 2 times a day.
      These sessions include looking at stressful and neutral pictures and rating stress and
      craving. At the end of five weeks, participants will return to the clinic and participate in
      a stress task and a scripted opioid imagery task the following day. For the next five days,
      participants will taper their medication dose. During this time they will continue to come to
      clinic to have their vital signs measured and complete a follow-up visit.

    <description>Lofexidine, sold under the brand name Lucemyra among others, is a medication historically used to treat high blood pressure, but more commonly used to help with the physical symptoms of opioid withdrawal. It is taken by mouth. It is an Î±2A adrenergic receptor agonist.</description>

             antagonists)

          6. Hypotensive individuals with a sitting blood pressure of &lt; 90/50

          7. QTc interval of &gt;440 in males and &gt; 460 in females as the combination of lofexidine
             plus buprenorphine may increase the QTc interval.
