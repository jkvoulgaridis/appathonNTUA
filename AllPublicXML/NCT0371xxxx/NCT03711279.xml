  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of SHR-1210 plus Apatinib versus
      AMD plus IFO in participants with soft tissue sarcoma.

    <textblock>
      In this study, patients are randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive SHR-1210 plus
      Apatinib (SHR-1210 treatment up to 2 years) or ADM plus IFO 6 cycles. Randomisation balances
      patients by ECOG performance status (0 vs 1-2), histological tumour type and chemotherapy
      history. Tumour response is assessed every 6 weeks according to the Response Evaluation
      Criteria in Solid Tumours, version 1.1. Survival is assessed every 2 months until study
      completion. Blood samples are collected for pharmacokinetic and immunogenic analyses. Safety
      is assessed for all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. Adverse
      events and clinical laboratory toxicity are graded according to the National Cancer Institute
      Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0.
