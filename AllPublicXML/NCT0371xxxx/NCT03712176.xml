  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Scientific context: With more than one million cases per year, breast cancer is the most
      common female cancer. All treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy or hormone
      therapy lead to major changes patients' lifestyle. These treatments can lead to a decrease of
      physical activity due to fatigue and also changes in the diet. Sometimes, chemotherapy
      induces nutritional aversions and can cause weight gain that is known to increase the risk of
      recurrence. Cognitive complaints are also frequent, in particular in patients who received
      chemotherapy and can also lead to quality of life's alteration

      Fatigue assessed with prevalence between 70 % and 100 % is usually a part of a series of
      symptoms including anxiety, depression, pain, sleep disturbance, decreased activity level,
      nutritional changes and pre-existent comorbidities. These symptoms can lead to an alteration
      of the quality of life. The chemotherapy involves disturbances at physiological,
      psychological and social levels and eating disorders leading to changes in eating habits
      which can lead to weight loss or weight gain. To limit these deleterious changes in
      lifestyle, increased physical activity, specialized counseling and nutritional monitoring may
      be recommended.

      According to current knowledge there is no prospective study that evaluated different
      lifestyle changes according to different types of patients and the appearance of the
      installation of these symptoms during the patient pathway.

      Research hypothesis: the study hypothesis is that description of the evolution of the quality
      of life and, physical, nutritional and cognitive parameters in a population of patients with
      non-metastatic breast cancer will better characterize these patients in order to propose an
      appropriate and personalized rehabilitation intervention.The investigators propose this
      feasibility study consisting of 2 cohorts of patients according to the adjuvant therapy given
      (+/- chemotherapy) after the primary breast surgery.

    <description>The evolution of the quality of life will be evaluated by the FACT-B questionnaire (Functional Assessment of Breast Cancer Therapy). The FACT-B is a 37-item questionnaire divided into five subscales namely physical, social/family, emotional, functional well-beings, and the additional concerns for breast cancer. Each item is rated on a 5-point Likert scale. The FACT-B total score is the sum of scores of all five subscales.</description>

    <description>Patients will receive self-report questionnaires to evaluate their quality of life, fatigue level, anxiety and depression, cognitive complaint, cognitive efficiency, nutritional quality and food preferences, and sedentary behavior. Patients will also do tests to determine their physical conditions : six-minute walk test (6MWT), 30-s chair-stand test. The intervention will be done at three stages of the patient's care pathway: 1 / before the adjuvant surgery (baseline), 2 / at 6 months after the surgery and chemotherapy 3 / at 7 months after radiotherapy treatment.</description>
