  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized double-blind clinical trial is performed on all recent (within the last 5
      days) NAION patients referred to hospitals affiliated to the Shahid Beheshti University of
      Medical Sciences, Iran. The patients will be equally and randomly assigned into two
      experimental groups and a control group. The first experimental group will receive 1000 units
      of erythropoietin every 12 hours for three days. The second experimental group will receive
      50 mg of oral prednisolone from the onset of the disease for 1 week, with the dose gradually
      reduced within 2 weeks and then discontinued. In addition, the subjects in the second
      experimental group will receive 300 mg of ranitidine daily. The third group will receive
      placebo. Eye examination with color vision, perimetry, and peripapillary optical coherence
      tomography (to measure the thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer) will be performed
      before the intervention, and 1, 3 and 6 months after the intervention. SITA standard visual
      field testing will be done using the Visual Field Analyzer Humphrey 750 Field (Carl Zeiss,
      USA). The thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer will be measured by optical coherence
      tomography (Cirrus Zeiss Cirrus HD-OCT, Carl Zeiss, USA). The q-q plot and Kolmogorov-Smirnov
      tests will be performed to test normal distribution of data. Descriptive statistics including
      frequency, percentages, standard deviation, median and range will be used. Other statistical
      test including ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis, Chi-Square, and Fischer's exact tests will be
      performed. All statistical analyses will be performed in SPSS (version 20) at significance
      level of 0.05.
