    <textblock>
      This trial studies nipple aspirate fluid in detecting breast cancer. Nipple aspirate fluid
      may better detect breast cancer earlier than current methods used for screening such as
      mammograms and breast examinations.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To obtain nipple aspirate fluid (NAF) samples from non-lactating women subjects at least
      40-years-old.

      II. To analyze the samples using a novel protein nanopore-based detection platform to
      evaluate the efficacy of the platform for breast cancer diagnosis through detection of
      biomarkers.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants and healthy volunteers undergo collection of nipple aspirate fluid from both
      breasts.

      After completion of study, participants are followed up at 1 year.

    <description>Nipple aspiration fluid samples will be compared between breast cancer participants and healthy participants. will perform the logistic regression model for each biomarker that shows any difference between the breast cancer patients and healthy individuals. Then we will include multiple biomarkers in one model while controlling for confounders.</description>
