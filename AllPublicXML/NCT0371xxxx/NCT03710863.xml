      This is a multicenter, open-label, single-arm, phase II Study to Evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary Efficacy of intermittent oral dosing of CM082
      tablets in Chinese patients with wAMD. The study will be performed in two different parts,
      dose-escalation phase (Part 1) and dose-expansion phase (Part 2). Subjects will receive CM082
      orally twice daily for two weeks followed by two weeks off in four-week cycles. There are two
      dose levels, 25mg BID and 50mg BID. In part 1, the starting dose of 25mg BID(n=8) will be
      increased by 100% to the maximum dose of 50mg BID(n=8) if the number of patients who
      experience dose-limiting toxicities is less than 2 during the first cycle. In part 2, based
      on the relevant data from the dose escalation study, an expanded enrollment study was
      conducted at a safe and effective dose.Per dose group will enroll 12-24 patients. All
      patients will take CM082 until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The assessment
      of the safety and efficacy will be done every four weeks from 2nd-6th cycle and every 12
      weeks after. Also, single/multiple dose pharmacokinetics in these patients will be studied.
