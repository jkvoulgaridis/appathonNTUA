  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent preclinical studies suggest that combining MEK and MDM2 inhibition synergize to induce
      apoptosis in RAS/BRAF-mutant and TP53 wild-type CRC models. In vitro, in RKO cell lines
      (poorly differentiated colon carcinoma cell line resistant to single agent targeting MDM2 and
      MEK and BRAF inhibition), the MDM2 plus MEK inhibitor combination generated a synergistic
      increase in apoptotic index. In vivo, in mice harboring human RKO colon tumor xenografts the
      combination of MDM2 plus MEK inhibition elicited 93% decreases in tumor volume.

      This trial is to conduct a single-center, Phase 1 dose escalation study of trametinib
      combined with HDM201 (a HDM2 inhibitor) in patients with advanced/metastatic RAS/RAF mutant
      and TP53 wt CRC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial is a Phase I dose escalation study aiming to evaluate the safety of a combined
      treatment associating HDM201 (escalating doses) with Trametinib (fixed dose). This study will
      utilize sequential and adaptive Bayesian design using the method of Time-to-event Continual
      Reassessment Method (CRM) to guide dose escalation and estimate the MTD.
