  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HIV antiretroviral therapy has the potential to dramatically decrease HIV transmission
      worldwide1; yet, a barrier to ending the AIDS epidemic in low-resource settings is the fact
      that healthcare is largely provided by traditional or spiritual healers rather than
      biomedical providers, and there are no strategies in place to identify HIV-infected patients
      among Traditional Healer patients and link them to HIV care. In order to reach the UNAIDS
      90-90-90 benchmarks HIV services must reach marginalized populations in endemic regions, such
      as in southwestern Uganda. Uganda is one of seven sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries
      accounting for 90% of all new HIV infections in this region6. HIV prevalence is 7.3%, with
      ~1.5 million people living with HIV/AIDS and 99,000 new infections in 2014. However, only 50%
      of sexually active Ugandans have ever tested for HIV8. In the project location of
      southwestern Uganda, like much of SSA, the majority of Ugandans utilize Traditional Healers
      (TH), but little is known about Traditional Healer practices or rates of HIV testing (or HIV
      infection) among their clients. Specific aims of this study are to: 1) identify key
      socio-structural factors that frame HIV testing behaviors among Ugandan adults who utilize
      Traditional Healers; 2) investigate acceptability of providing point-of-care HIV testing at
      Traditional Healer practice locations; and 3) develop and pilot a prospective HIV testing
      intervention among Traditional Healer patients to promote earlier diagnosis. Results will be
      used to implement subsequent, large-scale cluster-randomized HIV testing intervention at
      Traditional Healer practice locations. Findings from the proposed study include formative
      data on populations that utilize Traditional Healers in an HIV-endemic region of Uganda, and
      pilot testing of an HIV testing intervention at healer practice locations; these results
      could be applied towards expanding HIV testing in other low-resource, endemic settings.

      This study has three specific aims:

      Specific Aim 1: Identify key socio-structural factors that frame HIV testing behaviors among
      clients of Ugandan TH, using an exploratory sequential, mixed-methods study design. First,
      qualitative interviews with 25-35 purposely-sampled TH clients will characterize the
      care-seeking trajectory, HIV testing behaviors and related stigma, healthcare costs, and HIV
      risks and exposures. Based on these results, a survey will be designed and administered to
      300 Ugandan adults who utilize TH in Mbarara District. This cross-sectional study will
      identify 1) rates of HIV testing among TH clients and 2) variables that independently predict
      HIV testing within the prior 12 months. These data will inform a model of HIV testing
      behavior among TH clients based on the Andersen Model of Healthcare Utilization, and generate
      hypotheses to be tested in Specific Aim 2.

      Specific Aim 2: Characterize acceptability of receiving point-of-care (POC) HIV testing at TH
      locations, using an exploratory sequential, mixed-methods approach. Qualitative interviews
      with 15-25 purposely sampled TH and 15-25 purposely-sampled TH clients will explore attitudes
      and experiences with biomedicine, feasibility and acceptability of delivering POC HIV testing
      at TH locations, and investigate relevant themes emerging from Aim 1. Based on qualitative
      results, a survey will be developed and administered to 175 TH in Mbarara District. This
      cross-sectional study will characterize TH practices relevant to HIV testing, and identify
      characteristics of healers who favorably view the proposed intervention (Specific Aim 3).
      These data will be integrated with results from SA1 to develop an intervention that will
      overcome socio-structural barriers to HIV testing.

      Specific Aim 3: Develop and pilot an HIV testing intervention among TH clients. Integration
      of results from SA1 and SA2 will inform a pilot HIV testing intervention at 10 TH practice
      locations, to be compared with a control group receiving usual TH care. This pilot will offer
      HIV testing at TH practice sites to 250 TH clients. Primary outcome for this study will be
      rates of HIV testing among TH clients. Secondary outcomes will include i) number of new HIV
      diagnoses among TH clients, ii) socio-demographic factors that predict HIV testing, and iii)
      percentage of patients with +HIV POC test who successfully link to HIV care in 3 months.
