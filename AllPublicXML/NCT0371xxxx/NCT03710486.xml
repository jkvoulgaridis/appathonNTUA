    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to describe treatment patterns associated with first-line and
      second line biologic use (vedolizumab or other biologic) and to describe the real-world
      clinical effectiveness of the use (first-line and second line) vedolizumab versus other
      biologics at least 6 months post-treatment initiation.

      This is a retrospective, non-interventional study of participants with CD or UC. The study
      will review the medical charts of participants who have initiated the first or second line
      treatment with vedolizumab or another biologic agent (infliximab, adalimumab, or golimumab
      [UC only]) (index event) during the eligibility period to evaluate the treatment
      effectiveness, treatment patterns, health care utilization and safety of vedolizumab, and to
      provide the real-world treatment landscape with anti-TNF alpha therapies.

      The study will enroll approximately 400 participants, with 200 participants in each treatment
      cohort. All participants will be enrolled into two observational groups:

        -  Cohort 1: Vedolizumab

        -  Cohort 2: Other Biologics

      The data for participants will be collected in two main periods:

        -  Pre-index Event Period: From the data of diagnosis of UC/CD until one day prior to the
           date when vedolizumab or other biologic treatment was initiated during the eligibility
           period.

        -  Post-index Event Period: From the date when vedolizumab or other biologic treatment was
           initiated during the eligibility period until the earliest of 6 months (post-index
           treatment discontinuation, death of participants, lost-to-follow up, or date of chart
           abstraction initiation.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Spain and Portugal. The overall time for data
      collection in the study will be approximately 12 months and the overall duration of the study
      is approximately 24 months.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mayo Score at Month 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Month 6 post-index date</time_frame>
    <description>Mayo score is an instrument designed to measure disease activity of UC. Complete Mayo score consists of 4 sub-scores: stool pattern, most severe rectal bleeding of the day, endoscopic findings and global assessment by physician, each graded from 0 to 3 with higher scores indicating more severe disease. These scores are summed to give a total score range of 0 to 12. Partial Mayo score consists of 3 sub-scores: stool pattern, most severe rectal bleeding of the day, and global assessment by physician, each graded from 0 to 3 with higher scores indicating more severe disease. These scores are summed to give a total score range of 0 to 9. Here, higher scores indicates more severe disease.</description>

    <ipd_description>Takeda makes patient-level, de-identified data sets and associated documents available for all interventional studies after applicable marketing approvals and commercial availability have been received (or program is completely terminated), an opportunity for the primary publication of the research and final report development has been allowed, and other criteria have been met as set forth in Takeda's Data Sharing Policy (see www.TakedaClinicalTrials.com for details). To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias. Once approved, qualified researchers who sign a data sharing agreement are provided access to these data in a secure research environment.</ipd_description>
