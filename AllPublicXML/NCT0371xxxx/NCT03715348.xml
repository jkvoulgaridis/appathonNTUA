  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PROPHESY trial is a single centre pilot trial investigating Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) or
      Prothrombin Complex Concentrate (PCC) treatment for patients who are bleeding during cardiac
      surgery, and who are NOT receiving a vitamin K antagonist agent (e.g. warfarin).

      This pilot study will investigate the feasibility of delivering the different components of
      the trial, so that investigators can determine if it's feasible to move to a future large
      trial that will aim to compare the efficacy and safety of FFP versus PCC in adult patients
      who are actively bleeding during cardiac surgery.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are ~ 30,000 cardiac procedures performed each year in the United Kingdom (UK), and it
      is estimated that ~30% of these cases require plasma transfusion for management of bleeding
      during cardiovascular surgery. Bleeding after cardiac surgery that requires blood transfusion
      is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, resulting in substantial costs to the
      health service.

      There have been no clinical trials that have compared the safety and efficacy of FFP versus
      PCC in cardiac surgery in patients who are bleeding, and who are not on vitamin K
      antagonists. In the UK, FFP transfusion is the standard treatment for management of bleeding:
      however, the use of PCC in this setting is rising, with several observational studies now
      demonstrating that it is safe, and that its administration is associated with reduced blood
      transfusion requirements, albeit no difference in other outcomes. Potential advantages of PCC
      over FFP are: increased concentration of clotting factors leading to faster improvement of
      reversing coagulopathy; improved ease and speed of administration; reduced fluid volume; and
      reduced incidence of immune modulatory side effects.

      While observational studies have suggested that PCC can be safely administered in bleeding
      patients undergoing cardiac surgery, the clinical equipoise and, the lack of high quality
      evidence means that a randomised control trial is required to compare the clinical efficacy
      and safety of both in bleeding patients undergoing cardiac surgery not relating to warfarin.
      Prior to such a trial, the investigators will perform a single-centre pilot study to assess
      if individual components of a large trial are deliverable.
