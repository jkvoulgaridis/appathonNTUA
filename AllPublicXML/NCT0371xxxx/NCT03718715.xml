  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metformin has been used in Sweden since 1957, and it is recommended as first line therapy for
      type 2-diabetes (T2D) in national and international guidelines. However, adverse effects
      involving diarrhea, constipation, bloating, and abdominal pain are common which leads to
      discontinuation of medication or not being able to reach therapeutic doses. Here the
      investigators will perform a prospective study to investigate whether i) participants with
      T2D who experience adverse events following metformin treatment have an altered microbiota at
      baseline compared to participants without adverse events and ii) if the microbiota is altered
      in participants during onset of adverse events. The investigators hypothesis is that adverse
      effects associated with metformin are caused by an altered gut microbiota, either at base
      line or following metformin treatment. The study design is a nested case-cohort study. The
      investigators will recruit 600 patients and expect 200 individuals to have side effects and
      400 without during a 24-month study period. Fecal samples will be collected at baseline, 2
      months, and 4 months or when gastrointestinal symptoms occur. All fecal samples will be
      sequenced by 16s rRNA (ribosomal ribonucleic acid) sequencing to obtain a baseline microbiota
      profile; a subpopulation consisting of homogenous groups of participants will be in
      depth-analyzed using shotgun sequencing. If the hypothesis is confirmed this project may lead
      to bacterial therapies that will allow more patients tolerate metformin.
