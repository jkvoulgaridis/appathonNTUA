  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well dexamethasone, elotuzumab, pomalidomide work in treating
      patients with multiple myeloma that has not responded to previous treatment. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as dexamethasone, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer
      cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from
      spreading. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as elotuzumab, may help the body?s
      immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow
      and spread. Pomalidomide may stop the growth of multiple myeloma by blocking the growth of
      new blood vessels necessary for tumor growth. Giving dexamethasone, elotuzumab, pomalidomide
      may work better in treating patients with multiple myeloma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the overall response rate (ORR) of utilizing elotuzumab, pomalidomide and
      dexamethasone in patients with disease refractory to daratumumab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine percentage of patients achieving complete response (CR) with the elotuzumab
      combination.

      II. To determine progression-free survival (PFS) for treatment with the elotuzumab
      combination.

      III. To determine safety profile for treatment with the elotuzumab combination. IV. To
      determine the overall survival (OS) for patients receiving treatment with the elotuzumab
      combination.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive dexamethasone intravenously (IV) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of courses 1-2 and
      IV on day 1 and orally (PO) on days 8, 15, and 22 of subsequent courses and elotuzumab IV on
      days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of courses 1-2 and day 1 of subsequent courses. Patients also receive
      pomalidomide PO on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months until
      progressive disease, then every 6 months thereafter.
