  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the feasibility of a home blood pressure telemonitoring (HBPTM) system
      in patients with minor stroke or TIA in the past year. The telemonitoring system will consist
      of a blood pressure machine and an online survey to submit blood pressure measurements. The
      investigators want to test whether patients can persistently use the telemonitoring system
      with ease and whether telephone instructions for blood pressure medications from the research
      nurse can be correctly understood. A secondary purpose of this study is to look at the
      effects of telemonitoring in blood pressure and stroke recurrence.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a two-year pilot study (TEC4Home Stroke) to assess the feasibility
      of using home telemonitoring technology in managing hypertension among patients with minor
      stroke/TIA (NIH Stroke Scale Score &lt;5) at the VGH Stroke Prevention Clinic (SPC). The
      Vancouver Stroke Program SPC receives 1200 referrals per year for assessment of patients with
      strokes or TIAs. Of the total number of patients referred to the SPC, 45% were deemed as
      hypertensive patients through any one of: (1) medical history of hypertension, (2) on
      antihypertensive medications or (3) having blood pressure measurements above 140/90 mm Hg
      during their assessment at the clinic.

      This project, which includes baseline assessments of home supports and cognition, will assess
      the specific needs of the post-stroke population in determining feasibility of HBPTM and
      nurse-led hypertension treatment. Previous studies of aggressive hypertensive control
      regimens have shown that it takes approximately six months to consistently achieve target
      pressures (SPRINT, SPS3). Thus in this feasibility study, participants will be monitored for
      6 months using home telemonitoring technology.

    <description>All participants or caregiver involved will be instructed to measure BP per the TEC4Home BP Telemonitoring Protocol. Participants will measure their BP daily, 4x/day, for the first week. After the first week, all weekly BP measurements will be done 3 days/week with 4 measurements a day. All readings must be taken before administration of antihypertensive medications, twice in the morning, 5 minutes apart and twice in the evening, 5 minutes apart.
The TEC4Home telemonitoring nurse will review the BP measurements and contact the participant on a weekly basis until the end of the 6-month monitoring period. The telemonitoring nurse will adjust the antihypertensive medication doses as per the TEC4Home Stroke - Hypertension Management Algorithm.</description>
