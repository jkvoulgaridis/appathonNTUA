  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, it was aimed to compare the effects of three different PEEP levels (0-4, 5-8,
      9-12 cmH2O) on intraabdominal pressure and hemodynamic parameters of patients in intensive
      care unit.

    <textblock>
      Patients between 18-80 years old whom were mechanically ventilated without any spontaneous
      respiratory efforts on supine position were included into the study. Bladder pressure
      measurement as a practical and frequently preferred method was used in order to measure
      intra-abdominal pressure. 100 ml isotonic fluid was given during the measurement. Level of
      symphysis pubis was chosen for zeroing the pressure transducer to measure the intra-abdominal
      pressure.

      Three patient groups, each containing 22 cases, totally 66 patients were planned in this
      study. All patients were mechanically ventilated with various PEEP levels. The patients with
      0-4 cmH2O PEEP levels were named Group 4; the patients with 5-8 cmH2O PEEP levels were named
      Group 8; the patients with 9-12 cmH2O PEEP levels were named Group 12. The levels of
      patients' PEEP levels were arranged by the responsible intensive care physician regarding to
      the patients' clinic.

      Intraabdominal, central venous, arterial blood pressures, pulse rates, peripheric oxygen
      saturation, body temperature, instant fluid balances and amounts of urine (in ml/kg/hour
      unit) of the patients were measured on the 0. 6. 12. 18. and 24. hours and recorded.
