    <textblock>
      This study will provide urine cycles from both pregnant and not pregnant volunteers to
      maintain the SPD sample bank.

      Study volunteers, seeking to conceive will be provided with Clearblue Ovulation product to
      help them pinpoint their most fertile time and aid conception. All volunteers will provide
      daily early morning urine samples throughout the study period and keep a study diary of
      menses and pregnancy test results for 1 menstrual cycle.

      Urine samples will be received in the clinical laboratory and aliquoted into 2.25ml amounts
      at stored at -80˚C until required.

      The study will also gather optional information from volunteers regarding a woman's general
      health and stress levels when trying to conceive. This will be used to study the relationship
      between general health, stress and conception.
