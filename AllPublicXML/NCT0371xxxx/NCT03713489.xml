  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is a syndrome that has recently been recognized as
      encompassing acute deterioration of liver function in patients with pre-existing chronic
      liver disease. It is associated with multi-organ failure and a high risk of short-term
      mortality. Thrombocytopenia is common in ACLF. In addition, the function of platelet is also
      compromised according to our previous data. The aim of this study is to explore whether
      platelet transfusion could reduce the short-term mortality rate of HBV-related ACLF. This is
      a single center, open labeled randomized controlled study. There are two arms. Subjects who
      is assigned to platelet transfusion group will receive both platelet transfusion (9 times/4
      weeks, 1 unit each time) and standard medical treatment. While those in standard medical
      treatment group will receive standard medical treatment only. The major endpoint is 28-day
      transplant-free mortality rate.
