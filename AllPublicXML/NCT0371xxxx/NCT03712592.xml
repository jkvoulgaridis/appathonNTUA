  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The practice of mountain running or &quot;trail&quot; is in full development in France and elsewhere in
      the world. This sporting practice associates specific physiological constraints related in
      particular to the duration of the efforts made (several hours) and to the ground (important
      elevation, technical ground, average altitude). Some studies have allowed the last 10 years
      to initiate the exploration of the physiological consequences of this type of practice,
      especially from a muscular point of view. However, some important questions remain to be
      clarified such as the impact of these sports events on fatigue and muscle recovery,
      cardiovascular, energy and water balance disturbances caused, induced sleep changes and the
      kinetics of recovery of the various parameters. . These elements remain in particular to be
      studied in very different racing contexts as currently developed by the organizers, namely
      race in one stage from long to very long distances (40 to 160 km) and race in stages (4 days,
      4 x 40 km) as encountered in the Grenoble UT4M race (Ultra Tour des 4 Massifs).

    <description>Each visit will include a series of neuromuscular, cardiovascular, blood glucose and body composition evaluations will be performed. The subjects will provide some information about their muscular pain and their food and water intake.
Finally, for the study of sleep that only concerns participants in the 4x40 km race, a home sleep registration banner will be given to each participant of the event step by step at the arrival of each stage in order to study sleep the next night as well as 2 nights after the arrival of the last stage.</description>
