  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PATH for PWS is a study to help researchers better understand serious medical events in PWS
      over a 4-year period, as well as evaluate how PWS-related behaviors change over time. The
      data from this study is intended to inform the development and clinical trial design of
      potential new treatments.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Every 6 months, participants or their caregivers will be asked to update online surveys about
      medical problems and serious medical events, as well as provide information about conditions
      and behaviors often associated with PWS such as hyperphagia. Because this is an observational
      study, no study drug will be provided and no visits to a doctor or clinic are required.
