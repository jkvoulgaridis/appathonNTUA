    <textblock>
      An international, multicenter, open-label, 2 cohort, non-comparative, pivotal study
      evaluating the efficacy of tipifarnib in HRAS mutant HNSCC (AIM-HN). The first cohort will
      assess the objective response rate (ORR) of tipifarnib in subjects with HNSCC with HRAS
      mutations. The second study cohort, SEQ-HN, is an observational sub-study and includes 2
      types of patients: (1) the historical record of first line therapy in subjects with HRAS
      mutant HNSCC participating in Cohort 1 in whom first line outcome data are available and (2)
      matched control HNSCC patients in whom HRAS mutations were not identified (wild type HRAS
      HNSCC) and who consent to provide first line outcome data and additional follow up.

      KO-TIP-007 is an international, multicenter, open-label, 2 cohort, non-comparative, pivotal
      study evaluating the efficacy of tipifarnib in HRAS mutant HNSCC (AIM-HN) and the impact of
      HRAS mutations on response to first line systemic therapies for HNSCC (SEQ-HN). KO-TIP-007
      has 2 study cohorts. The first study cohort, named AIM-HN, includes HNSCC subjects with HRAS
      mutations. AIM-HN subjects will receive treatment with tipifarnib and the outcome of this
      cohort will be evaluated for ORR by an independent review facility.

      The second study cohort, SEQ-HN, is an observational sub-study and includes 2 types of
      patients: (1) the historical record of first line therapy in AIM-HN (HRAS mutant HNSCC)
      subjects in whom first line outcome data are available and (2) matched control HNSCC patients
      in whom HRAS mutations were not identified (wild type HRAS HNSCC) and who consent to provide
      first line outcome data and additional follow up.

      HNSCC patients in whom HRAS mutations are identified and who meet eligibility criteria will
      be offered participation in AIM-HN. HNSCC patients in whom HRAS mutations are not identified
      may participate in SEQ-HN only. These patients will be followed and the comparison of
      outcomes of HRAS mutant and HRAS wild type HNSCC will address the exploratory objective to
      determine the effect of HRAS mutation on the ORR of first line systemic therapy in patients
      with recurrent/metastatic HNSCC. Outcome data from subsequent lines of therapy will be
      collected.
