      A Randomized, Open-Label, Cross-Over Study to Assess Nicotine Uptake and Subjective Measures
      with Use of JUUL 5% Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS) Compared to Usual Brand
      Combustible Cigarettes, a Comparator E-Cigarette, and Nicotine Gum in Healthy Adult Smokers

      E-cigarettes may be an acceptable alternative to traditional cigarette smoking. In utilizing
      vaporization rather than combustion, the generation and inhaltion of smoke and carbon
      monoxide (CO) may be reduced or avoided. JUUL has developed several nicotine based liquid
      blends for use in e-cigarettes. This study will assess nicotine uptake during a 10-puff
      controlled and a 5-minute ad libitum use of four JUUL 5% electronic nicotine delivery systems
      (ENDS) relative to usual brand (UB) combustible cigarettes, a comparator electronic cigarette
      (e-cigarette), and nicotine gum.
