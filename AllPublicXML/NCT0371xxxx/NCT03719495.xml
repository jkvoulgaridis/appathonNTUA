  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to learn about the effects that standard of care
      endocrine therapies have on the immune system's response to cancer by looking at the number
      and types of immune cells present and how they function in women with early stage estrogen
      receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will enroll mainly subjects with estrogen receptor positive breast cancer that have
      completed surgery and radiation therapy to remove the tumor(s) and have not yet started
      standard treatment endocrine therapy. There is one group of subjects who have not been
      diagnosed with cancer. The information learned from this study will help doctors understand
      more about how the immune system responds to endocrine therapy for early stage breast cancer
      in people who are estrogen receptor positive with the goal of developing improved therapies
      that harness the immune system.
