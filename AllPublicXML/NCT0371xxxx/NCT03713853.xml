  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Management of acetabular (hip) fractures in the geriatric population can be very challenging
      because of pre-existing medical comorbidities, pre-existing osteoporosis and increased risk
      of mortality.

      The two most common treatment options for acetabular fractures are either surgical fixation
      using plates and screws to hold the fractured pieces in the correct position until the
      fracture has healed or surgical fixation in addition to a total hip replacement.

      Surgical fixation requires prolonged immobilization of the affected limb (typically around
      6-12 weeks post-operatively), which can lead to disability and other complications. Such
      patients, especially those who are frail and cognitively impaired, are unable to adhere to
      the immobilization restrictions, leading to an increased risk of fixation failure.

      Patients who underwent open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) of an acetabular fracture were
      reported to have about 25 times greater incidence of hip replacement compared with general
      population matched controls.

      Additionally, performing a subsequent hip replacement after a previous surgical fixation
      (ORIF) of an acetabular fracture, especially in the elderly population, can present a number
      of technical difficulties including; difficult dissection due to previous incision(s) and
      scarring, dealing with retained hardware, bony deficiency and the possibility of infected
      hardware.

      The aim of the study is to perform a large cohort study to assess pain and physical function
      in patients 60 years and older who have sustained an acetabular fracture.

      This is a multicentre observational cohort study, involving academic institutions affiliated
      with the Canadian Orthopaedic Trauma Society (COTS).

      The study aims to compare two surgical treatments of acetabular fractures in patients 60
      years of age and older. Patients who consent to participate will be included in the study and
      followed up as per standard of care up to 24 months after surgery. Participants will be
      treated for their acetabular fracture with either acute primary total hip arthroplasty (THA)
      together with open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) in the same surgery or ORIF alone as
      per surgeon discretion.

      After surgery, patients will be assessed using patient-reported outcomes oxford hip score,
      which is a valid, reliable, responsive measure of pain and function during short-term and
      long-term follow-up for hip osteoarthritis and THA.

      The European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D), will be used to assess the patient's
      quality of life and health status. The questionnaire is short and easy to use and shows good
      responsiveness in orthopaedic patients who undergo a hip replacement.

      Timed Up &amp; Go Test (TUG) measures functional mobility (in seconds), and is a well-validated
      predictor of mobility and falls in patients who undergo orthopaedic surgery and hip
      replacement.

      All patients will be followed as per standard of care for their follow up visits at 6 weeks,
      3, 6, 12 and 24 months.

    <description>Oxford Hip Score is a short 12-item patient-reported outcome specifically designed and developed to assess function and pain during short-term and long-term follow-up for hip osteoarthritis and hip replacement surgery. It is valid, reliable, reproducible, and sensitive to clinically important changes. An increase in score indicate better joint function. A score between 40-48 indicates satisfactory joint function.</description>

    <time_frame>Test will be completed at 3, 6,12 and 24-months follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>TUG is a simple test used to assess a person's mobility (in seconds) and requires both static and dynamic balance. A line is placed on the floor 3 meters away from a chair where patient will be sitting.
When instructed to &quot;GO&quot; patient will stand, walk to a line on the floor at his/her regular pace, turn around and walk back to the chair and sit down.
The longer it takes for subject to complete the test, higher is the risk of fall and lower is the its functional mobility.
Reference values are:
60-69 years old = 8.1 seconds; 70-79 years old = 9.2 seconds; 80-99 years old = 11.3 seconds. Over 14 seconds is associate with high risk of fall</description>
