  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with first or second recurrence of GBM will be treated with stereotactic injection
      of the oncolytic virus DNX-2440.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After inclusion in the trial, stereotactic biopsy will be performed. In the same surgery, the
      experimental agent will be injected also by stereotactic system, in a different part of the
      lesion, in a region considered viable tumor, using a cannula especially designed for virus
      injection.

      Follow-up will include clinical visits and MRI No other treatment for the tumor will be used
      until progression is documented. iRANO criteria and volumetric measurement of the tumor will
      be used.

      Any further treatment after progression will be at the criteria of the treating physician

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients willing and able to give informed consent.

          2. Patient must be, in the investigator opinion, able to comply with all the protocol
             procedures.

          3. Age ≥18

          4. Negative pregnant test in case of fertile women*

          5. Patients with diagnosis of first or second recurrence of Glioblastoma or any of its
             variants (Gliosarcoma, Giant cell Glioblastoma or epithelioid Glioblastoma) based on
             histopathology at first diagnosis and clinical and radiological follow-up. Recurrences
             within the radiation field will be considered if there is confirmed growing of the
             lesion in two MRI, or occur at least 12 weeks after completion of radiotherapy, or if
             there is clear histopathological confirmation of tumor recurrence. This limitation
             does not apply for recurrences occurring outside the radiation field

          6. A single measurable lesion bigger than 10 mm in two perpendicular diameters,
             considered appropriate for safe stereotactic biopsy and virus injection without
             entering the ventricle.

          7. No other chemotherapy or immunotherapy for the tumor in the four weeks previous to the
             inclusion

          8. Karnofsky Performance Status ≥ 70 before inclusion.

          9. Must have adequate renal, bone marrow and liver function.

         10. Steroid-free or requiring stable doses of a maximum of 2mg dexamethasone /day or
             equivalent in the previous two weeks.

               -  A woman is considered fertile, following menarche and until becoming
                  post-menopausal unless permanently sterile. Permanent sterilisation methods
                  include hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy and bilateral oophorectomy. A
                  postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative
                  medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the
                  postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a post-menopausal state in women not
                  using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy. However, in the
                  absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Severe infections or intercurrent medical conditions including, but not limited to,
             severe renal, hepatic, heart or bone marrow failure, that, on investigator´s criteria,
             do not allow the inclusion. Patients must be afebrile at baseline [i.e., &lt; 38 degrees
             (C)].

          2. Patients with an enhancing lesion bigger than 25cc, including necrotic tumor portions
             encircled inside the enhancing areas.

          3. Subjects with immunodeficiency, autoimmune conditions or active hepatitis.

          4. Any medical or psychological condition that might interfere with the subject's ability
             to participate or give informed consent or would compromise the patient's ability to
             tolerate therapy or any disease that will obscure toxicity or dangerously alter drug
             metabolism.

          5. Current diagnosis of other cancer except in situ cervical cancer, basal or squamous
             cell carcinoma of the skin. Patients with a history of another cancer remain eligible
             if they are cancer free for at least three years.

          6. Pregnant or breast-feeding females will be excluded, due to the risk for the fetal
             development of a recombinant virus containing genes related to cellular growth and
             differentiation.

          7. Severe bone marrow hypoplasia.

          8. AST and/or ALT &gt; 4 times over upper normal laboratory level

          9. Neutrophils &lt; 1.5 x 109/L

         10. Thrombocytes ≤ 100 x 109/L

         11. Hemoglobin &lt; 9g/dl

         12. Multiple lesions, extensive ill-defined diffuse lesions, or lesions considered risky
             for stereotactic injection of virus, like periventricular lesions.

         13. Patients with Li-Fraumeni Syndrome or with a known germ line deficit in the
             retinoblastoma gene or its related pathways.

         14. Biologic/immunotherapy (e.g., IL-2, IL-12, interferon) within 4 weeks of DNX-2440
             administration.

         15. Vaccination of any kind within 4 weeks prior to DNX-2440 administration.

         16. Inability to undergo MRI examination for any reason.
