      This study is made up of two phases: a Translational Lead-In Phase and a Phase II. These two
      phases serve different functions. The translational lead-in phase is designed to test the
      drug on a small number of patients in efforts to gain information on two research questions:

        -  If M6620 has an anti-cancer effect on participants

        -  If M6620 research findings that were discovered in laboratory studies are also found in
           human research studies.

      Phase II is a much larger study to determine if M6620 has an anti-cancer effect in different
      groups of patients.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved M6620 as a treatment for any
      disease.

      ATR is an enzyme in cells that is responsible for multiple functions including repairing
      damaged DNA, helping cells that are stressed during the DNA copying process, and working to
      maintain the ends of chromosomes. In cancer cells, active ATR enzymes protect the cancer by
      helping the cells repair damage, stay alive, and maintain health. M6620 is a drug designed to
      inhibit the ATR enzyme. Inhibiting ATR may block how cancers repair their naturally damaged
      DNA, handle cancer cell stress, and maintain cancer cell life and health. Administration of
      M6620 may therefore assist in the slowing of growth or destruction of some cancers.

      In this research study, the investigators are...

        -  Gathering initial data on the anti-cancer activity of M6620 when given alone to
           participants within selected cancer populations

        -  Determining if there are changes in the biological components in the participant's body
           that may be associated with damaged DNA repair

             participants ≥ 16 years of age, Lansky ≥ 50% for participants &lt; 16 years of age

          -  Participants must have archival tissue available for analysis

        All Participants:

          -  If any participant could enroll to more than one cohort based on mutational status,
             the cohort enrollment decision will be discussed with the overall principal
             investigator. For example, if a participant has both an ATM mutation and an FBXW7
             mutation and thus could enroll to either Cohort 2 or Cohort 4A, the decision of which
             cohort to enroll to will be made in conjunction with the overall principal
             investigator. The decision as to which cohort the participant should be enrolled on
             must be made prior to the initiation of study treatment.

          -  Participants must have RECIST 1.1 measurable disease.

          -  Participants must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

        All Participants:

          -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mcL

          -  Platelets ≥ 100,000/mcL

          -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) for age

        Adult Participants (Age ≥ 18 years):

          -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤ 2.5 × institutional ULN; OR

               -  5 × institutional ULN if liver metastases are present

          -  Serum or plasma creatinine ≤ 1.5 × institutional ULN, OR

          -  Creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min by Cockcroft-Gault equation for participants with
             creatinine levels above 1.5 × institutional ULN

        Pediatric Participants (Age &lt; 18 years):

          -  ALT (SGPT) ≤ 3 × institutional (ULN)

             -for the purposes of this study, the ULN for SGPT will be defined as 45 U/L.

          -  Serum or plasma creatinine Participants 13 - 15 years: males ≤ 1.5 mg/dL, females

             ≤ 1.4 mg/dL, participants 16 - 17 years: males ≤ 1.7 mg/dL, females ≤ 1.4 mg/dL; OR

          -  Creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 by Schwartz formula for participants with
             creatinine levels above the limits described above

               -  The effects of M6620 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason
                  and because anti-cancer agents are known to be teratogenic, women of
                  child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
                  (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry
                  and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or
                  suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study,
                  she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on
                  this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study,
                  for the duration of study participation, and 6 months after completion of M6620
                  administration.

               -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent
                  document (or parent or legally authorized representative, if minor).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants who have had chemotherapy, immune therapy, other investigational therapy,
             major surgery, or radiotherapy within 3 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin
             C) prior to entering the study, or participants who have not recovered to ≤ Grade 1 or
             baseline from therapies administered more than 3 weeks prior (with the exceptions of
             1. Alopecia and peripheral neuropathies which may be ≤ Grade 2 at study entry and 2.
             Laboratory abnormalities that are not listed in 3.1 and that are not considered
             clinically meaningful [e.g. decreased lymphocyte count, electrolyte abnormalities]

          -  Participants who have received oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) within 5
             half-lives of study entry.

          -  Participants who have previously received treatment with an ATR inhibitor, including
             but not limited to M6620 (VX-970).

          -  Participants with known untreated brain metastases should be excluded from this
             clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop
             progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic
             and other adverse events. Participants with a history of brain metastases that have
             been treated, no longer require corticosteroids, and have been stable on imaging for
             at least one month following the end of treatment are permitted.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to M6620.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because M6620 is an agent with the
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the
             mother with M6620, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with
             M6620.

          -  Known HIV-positive participants are ineligible because of the increased risk of lethal
