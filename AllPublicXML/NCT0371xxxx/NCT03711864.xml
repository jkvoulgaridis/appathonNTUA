  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with multiple myeloma with recurrent or refractory BCMA, car-t cell infusion was
      performed after screening, blood collection and pretreatment. Starting dose for 5 x 10 ^ 5 /
      kg, 1 x 10 ^ 6 doses sequentially. If dose-limiting toxicity is not observed in 3 patients in
      a dose group, the next dose group test can be performed; If more than 2/3 of patients (2
      cases, included) in a dose group had DLT, dose-escalation was not performed. If 1 case of DLT
      (1/3) appears in the first 3 patients of a dose group, 3 patients need to be added to the
      dose group (at this time, there are 6 patients in the group).

      patients (with or without) or 2 of the 6 patients (with or without), no further dose
      escalation is allowed. Researchers and bidders to form drug safety monitoring committee
      (SRC), every dose group of subjects to complete the DLT observation period, after summarizing
      the security of this dose group, determine the test of the next dose, subjects such as draw
      up the highest dose group safety tolerance, SRC to decide whether to continue to increase the
      dose group of research, finally according to have obtained all the safety and efficacy of
      dose group information to determine the recommended dose (RP2D).Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT)
