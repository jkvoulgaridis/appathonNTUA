  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, a pragmatic, open labelled, multi-center randomized controlled trial will be
      conducted. The study population are stage II and IIIA NSCLC patients undergoing R0 resection
      and will be scheduled for adjuvant chemotherapy. Potentially eligible patients will be
      screened by the research clinicians and requested to complete and sign a consent form before
      enrolment. Eligible patients who consent to participate will be randomly assigned to the
      intervention group (patients receive conventional treatment and Shenlingcao oral liquid) and
      the control group (patients only receive conventional treatment) designed dynamic stratified
      block randomized algorithm via a central randomization system for clinical research using 1:1
      ratio.

      The intervention and control group will be enrolled before the first chemoradiation.
      Non-allelic follow-up will be conducted in this study and terminated when the last enrolled
      patient follow up to 24 months. Prospectively collected information from patients, including
      baseline, chemoradiation, use of Shenlingcao Oral Liquid and the other complementary drugs,
      and various outcome measures (the questionnaire of EORTC QLQ, death, tumor recurrence, tumor
      metastasis, and chemotherapy-induced side effects of the blood system, etc.). Follow-up
      points included: Baseline (before giving chemotherapy), 2-3 days after each chemotherapy
      cycle, and 6,12,18,24,30,36 months after enrollment.

    <time_frame>2-3 days after the fourth chemotherapy cycle</time_frame>
    <description>We investigated the long-term quality of life of postoperative lung cancer patients, utilizing the disease-specific European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC-QLQ) C30 to assess the quality of life among these patients. The EORTC QLQ-C30 is composed of 9 multi-item scales including 5 functional scales, 3 symptom scales, a global quality-of-life scale, and 6 single-item symptom measures. All the items are scored on a scale of 0 to 100, with a high score on a functional or the global quality-of-life scale representing a high level of functioning or quality of life and a high score on a symptom scale representing a high level of symptoms.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Remission of hematological toxicity caused by chemotherapeutic drugs</measure>
    <time_frame>2-3 days after the fourth chemotherapy cycle</time_frame>
    <description>Remission of hematological toxicity caused by chemotherapeutic drugs, using WHO grading of acute and subacute toxicity. Hematological toxicity is observed from four hematological indicators, including hemoglobin, white blood cells, granulocytes and platelets. A 5-grade system of severity levels is recommended for general use: grades 0-4 . The higher the level, the greater the toxic reaction. The most severe of the four indicators is the patient's hematological toxicity level.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disease-free survival</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months after enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Disease-free survival (DFS) refers to the time from the operation to the time that there is evidence of tumor recurrence / metastasis or any cause of death (the DFS of lost follow-up patients is the last follow-up time). The tumor recurrence / metastasis needs to be diagnosed based on imaging or pathological evidence.</description>
