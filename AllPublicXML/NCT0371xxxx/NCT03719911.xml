      Participants diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes receive personal coaching from a Certified
      Diabetic Educator (CDE) over a six-month period. The coaching program is enhanced by
      integrating a participant-facing mobile application with the coaching platform. Blood glucose
      test results automatically populate the coaching platform, providing the CDE with information
      that may better support their coaching efforts.

      The participants complete Diabetes Self Management Education (DSME) learning modules for the
      first 7-12 weeks. Following completion of the modules, the coach continues to provide support
      to the participant until 24 weeks after the participant's enrollment.
