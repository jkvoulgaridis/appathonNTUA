  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of a mindfulness-based training app
      ('REM Volver a Casa') versus a regular, presence-based program (MBSR) on the reduction of
      anxiety and other factors related to the physician-patient relationship, in healthcare grade
      students.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Healthcare students suffer from higher levels of anxiety and depression than the general
      population. It compromises not only their mental health, but also the quality of care
      provided. Aptitudes such as empathy and self-compassion are essential to improve this deficit
      and overcome the well-known burnout syndrome.

      Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program has proven to be an effective intervention
      for lowering stress in numerous studies. However, this intervention asks for a significant
      degree of personal involvement, thus the number of dropouts is often reported as a problem.
      New technologies might allow users to adapt training to their personal schedules.

      The present randomized trial aims to compare the efficacy of a mindfulness-based training
      delivered through a mobile application ('REM Volver a Casa'), a presence-based program
      (MBSR), and a control group in healthcare grade students.

    <intervention_model_description>Randomized, prospective, controlled and single-blind trial of 16 weeks. Students of Medicine, Nutrition, Psychology and Nursing are randomly assigned to the app group, the presential-based MBSR program or a waiting list. Three evaluations take place: pre-intervention, at 8 weeks (post-intervention) and at 16 weeks.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Post-intervention changes in State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) for each of the arms. It is a self-administered questionnaire which includes two subscales assessing state and trait anxiety. Each of them consists of 20 Likert items ranging 0-3. Lower values mean better outcomes.</description>

    <description>Post-intervention changes in State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory (STAXI) for each of the arms.

    <description>Post-intervention changes in Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) for each of the arms. FFMQ, by Baer, Smith, Hopkins, Krietemeyer and Toney (2006): 39 items that evaluate five facets on which the mindfulness ability is based: observe, describe, act with conscience, equanimity and not reactivity. Each item is scored according to a Likert scale that ranges from 1 (never) to 5 (very often). It has a high internal consistency, as well as a high predictive validity of the aspects that conform the Mindfulness construct (Baer, 2006). Validated in Spanish (Cebolla et al., 2012 ).</description>

    <description>Pre-intervention measure through the 0-100% Expectancy of Improvement Scale, derived from Credibility / Expectancy Questionnaire (CEQ, Devilly &amp; Borkovec), which has proven to be a reliable predictor of results in multiple studies and populations. The CEQ questionnaire is the measure of credibility / expectations most used in research in psychotherapy. The scale is graduated in 10 options, corresponding higher score to greater expectation of improvement.</description>

It has been previously used in medical students showing evidence of criterion validity with other measures. The questionnaire includes 13 reasons for participation in the intervention, in which the participant must score from 0 to 7 on a Likert scale if each statement is true for their case.</description>

    <description>The program aims to train the ability of the mind to focus attention on the present moment without judging, accepting the experience. REM is an application available for Android and iOs. It proposes a guided training through 8 stages. They contain video recordings with explanations about the fundamentals of mindfulness, audio recordings that guide practices of mindfulness, as well as suggestions to bring it into everyday life. They can be used whenever it suits the user. The app counts the progress of each participant, as well as the mood changes according to a distress scale before and after performing a formal practice. The app has been designed following the international recommendations for the development of apps (MARS guide).</description>

    <description>The program aims to train the ability of the mind to focus attention on the present moment without judging, accepting the experience. MBSR is a program developed at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center in the 1970s by Professor Jon Kabat-Zinn. MBSR uses a combination of mindfulness meditation, body awareness, and yoga to help people become more mindful. In recent years, meditation has been the subject of clinical research, that suggests it may have beneficial effects, including stress reduction, relaxation, and improvements to quality of life. While MBSR has its roots in spiritual teachings, the program itself is secular. The session is delivered to a small group of people by a certified instructor during two and a half hours, every week.</description>
