    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators investigate the muscle contraction according to posture
      change in patients with forward neck posture syndrome which was not revealed by 8 channel
      surface electromyography and provide accurate evaluation of forward neck posture syndrome in
      comparison with normal group and to be used as basic research data for the development of 8
      channel electric stimulation therapy device.
