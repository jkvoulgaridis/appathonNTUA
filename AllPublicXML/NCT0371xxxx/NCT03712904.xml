  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well stereotactic body radiation therapy and aflibercept work
      in treating patients with uveal melanoma. Stereotactic body radiation therapy is a
      specialized radiation therapy that sends x-rays directly to the tumor using smaller doses
      over several days and may cause less damage to normal tissue. Aflibercept may stop the growth
      of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving stereotactic
      body radiation therapy followed by aflibercept may work better in treating patients with
      uveal melanoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the percentage of patients able to successfully complete their prescribed
      treatment of radiation and intravitreal ziv-aflibercept (aflibercept) injection (IAI) with an
      acceptable level of toxicity.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess for reduction in the incidence of 2-year rates of radiation maculopathy,
      radiation papillopathy, functional vision preservation, radiation glaucoma, and to assess
      2-year local control and progression-free survival.
