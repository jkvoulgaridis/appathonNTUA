  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain is the leading cause of disability worldwide affecting just under 28 million
      people in the UK. Chronic pain conditions require a biopsychosocial rather than a biomedical
      model of care. Biomedical management lacks evidence of effectiveness but also has the
      potential to exacerbate the condition by raising fears and anxiety about potential
      pathological abnormalities.

      Healthcare professionals often hold negative beliefs about people with chronic pain and view
      the condition within a biomedical framework. These negative attitudes can be observed at the
      pre-registration training stage of the health professionals' career. Thus, the
      pre-registration phase is an important point where an individual's understanding of, and
      beliefs about, pain and people with pain may be shaped for the future. The need for improved
      and better education of healthcare professionals to support best practice for low back pain
      with the aim of integrating professionals' management of low back pain and fostering
      innovation in practice is well recognised. This study seeks to quantify the benefits of pain
      education in knowledge, attitudes and beliefs. The findings may encourage other
      pre-registration institutions to deliver pain education in a more directed way and
      simultaneously support the International Association for the Study of Pain's (IASP) proposed
      integration pain education into existing curriculum.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 2011 Briggs et al described pain education at undergraduate level for healthcare
      professionals as 'woefully inadequate'. Pain Neurophysiology Education (PNE) can improve
      undergraduates' pain understanding/management, however previous RCTs used single discipline
      groups and immediate follow-up. Investigation of the effectiveness of this education on
      students across the multi-professional team with medium-to-long-term follow-up will provide
      important new information on the generalisability of existing data and whether or not any
      changes in pain understanding/management are maintained over time.

      This study aims to contribute to the development of neuromusculoskeletal physiotherapy by
      identifying whether or not this education, which aims to up skill healthcare professionals of
      the future, is effective and can change their behaviours in practice to enhance patient care
      in chronic pain management. PNE has been shown to be useful in patient care in conjunction
      with other treatment methods. If this intervention is successful in altering pain attitudes
      and knowledge in keeping with modern science then students may feel more confident and able
      to manage pain post qualification. The findings of this study will support or refute the
      addition of PNE into healthcare professional undergraduate programmes.
