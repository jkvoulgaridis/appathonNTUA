  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test whether measuring the circadian clock during treatment of delayed
      sleep-wake phase disorder results in greater improvements in sleep compared to estimating the
      circadian clock.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized, controlled, parallel double-blind 4-week trial of 0.5 mgs of
      exogenous melatonin timed to either 3 h before actual dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) based
      on in-home measurement (M-DLMO, n = 25) or 3 h before DLMO estimated at 2 h before average
      sleep onset time based on actigraphy and sleep diary (E-DLMO, n = 25) in adult participants
      with delayed sleep-wake phase disorder. All participants will receive melatonin 0.5 mgs.
      Outcomes include change in DLMO, subjective and objective sleep parameters, and daytime
      symptoms.

    <measure>Change from Baseline Score on Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 Scale at 4 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>After 4 weeks of melatonin therapy</time_frame>
