  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine if providing coffee to patients who self-identify as
      coffee drinkers postoperatively will decrease the length of stay in the post-anesthesia care
      unit (PACU).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Decreasing the length of stay in PACU for surgical patient is a pertinent outcome. The
      shorter length of stay can achieve higher patient engagement scores, while simultaneously
      increasing the productivity of the unit. This is achieved by making more beds available for
      new patients coming from the operating room (OR). One thought was that coffee would benefit
      the investigator's patients experience through a number of pathways. Initially, the stimulant
      effect of coffee would create a more alert patient. A more alert patient is more likely to
      comprehend home care instruction and be ready for discharge earlier. Coffee is often used as
      a remedy for morning sickness. Ideally the act of drinking coffee or even smelling the coffee
      may decrease the occurrence of Post-Operative Nausea and Vomiting (PONV) in investigator's
      patient population. Finally, patients frequently state that the inability to drink their
      morning coffee is often more difficult than not being able to eat prior to surgery. By
      allowing those to drink coffee in PACU this would make the patient feel that they are being
      cared for on an emotional level, in addition to a physical level.

    <description>Patients will receive coffee in a Styrofoam cup at a temperature of 125 degree Fahrenheit or less. Coffee will be offered to the patient in the PACU once the patient's gag reflex has been restored following their procedure. Volume of estimated coffee consumption will be measured using a sample scale (with a maximum of 300mL of coffee offered)</description>
