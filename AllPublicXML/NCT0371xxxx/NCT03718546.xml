      To compare donors to their non-donor counterparts and healthy controls as well as to generate
      trajectory classes based on longitudinal patterns of donor HRQoL and identify predictors of
      poor donor HRQoL.

      There is limited data to show the effects that donation has on pediatric donors to their
      siblings. There is widespread agreement that it is critical to investigate the medical and
      psychosocial aspects of sibling pediatric HSC donation for multiple reasons including (a) the
      vulnerability of the pediatric population undergoing donation, (b) increasing use of
      pediatric HSC donation as a therapeutic option,1,7,8,9 (c) evidence that ~20% of pediatric
      HSC donors experience clinically important HRQoL deficits,7 and (d) the impact that improved
      understanding of factors predicting poor HRQoL will have on our ability to develop guidelines
      and/or interventions for assisting at-risk donors/families. The proposed study will help to
      compare donors to their non-donor counterparts and healthy controls as well as to generate
      trajectory classes based on longitudinal patterns of donor HRQoL and identify predictors of
      poor donor HRQoL.

    <description>To longitudinally and quantitatively describe the HRQoL of a diverse nation-wide cohort of sibling pediatric HSC donors and to compare their HRQoL to that of (1) healthy non-donor sibling from the same family, (2) siblings of children with similar diseases who receive alternate treatments (e.g., unrelated cord blood transplants), and (3) healthy age, gender, and race/ethnicity-matched controls.</description>

    <description>To determine which donor characteristics (e.g., demographic, psychosocial, and donation-related), recipient characteristics (e.g., recipient disease, transplant complications and outcomes), family characteristics (e.g., composition, cohesiveness, stress), and transplant center characteristics (e.g., presence of a donor advocate) most strongly predict membership in trajectory classes with poor HRQoL among donors.</description>

          -  Participants must fall into one of the following categories:

               -  Donor between the age of 5 and 17 who is donating to a sibling

               -  Parent/caregiver of study participating donor

               -  Recipient sibling aged 5 to 17 of study participating donor

               -  Any of the donor's non-donor/non-recipient siblings between 5 and 17

               -  Any child between 5 and 17 with a brother or sister (also between 5 and 17)
                  receiving a transplant from an unrelated source

          -  Be willing and able to provide signed informed consent:

               -  Adults must give consent for their children's and, if applicable, their own
                  participation

               -  Assent will be obtained in accordance with guidelines at the participant's
                  transplant institution

          -  Recipient must consent to the CIBMTR research database

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  For families with pediatric donors aged 5 to 17, at minimum, the donor child and/or
             one parent must consent/assent to participation. If that minimum is not met, the
             family will be excluded

          -  Donor or non-donor siblings who do not live in the same household as the recipient at
