    <description>the NovaCross is a guidewire positioning and support micro-catheter for improving chronic total occlusion (CTO) crossability. The NovaCross gains its supportive characteristics through the use of a unique operator-controlled Nitinol scaffold and an extandable segment, both at its distal tip.</description>
