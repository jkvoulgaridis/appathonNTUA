  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to assess tolerability and safety of a personalized neo-antigen
      vaccine containing up to 15 peptides derived from somatic mutation of the individual
      patient's cancer, with CAF09b as adjuvant. The vaccine formulation will be administered in
      combination with an approved anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 inhibitor to patients with advanced
      solid tumors. The endpoint is the characterization of adverse events (AE) assessed by CTCAE
      4.0.

      The secondary objective is feasibility to manufacture a personalized neo-antigen vaccine
      within 6 weeks of enrolment with the PIONEER pipeline, and to evaluate the immune response
      before, during and after treatment with the personalized neo-antigen vaccine. The endpoint is
      to evaluate the induction of adaptive immune responses to the personalized neo-antigen
      vaccine measured by functional assays and peptide-MHC multimer stainings.

      The tertiary objective is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of the treatment. The endpoints
      will be objective responses (OR), progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancer immunotherapy has shown the ability to improve the survival of patients with multiple
      types of advanced cancers. The human immune system can recognize the products of somatic
      genetic alterations in tumors, or neo-antigens, which are not expressed on normal cells.
      These neoantigens are an attractive immune target because their selective expression on
      tumors can minimize immune tolerance as well as the risk of side effects such as autoimmune
      reaction.

      Although neoantigens are ideal targets for cancer immunotherapies, most neoantigens arise
      from unique mutations and are not shared between individual patients. Thus,
      neoantigen-directed immunotherapy will need to be personalized. Novel technical advances in
      next-generation sequencing allow fast and systematic prediction of cancer neoantigens for
      each individual patient. Initial attempts of therapeutic cancer vaccination targeting
      individual neo-antigens have proven non-toxic and met their immunological endpoints.

      In this study investigators will use the proprietary platform PIONEER for fast and accurate
      identification of a neo-antigen vaccine tailored to each individual patient. The vaccine,
      based on 5-15 peptides derived from a patient's tumor individual neo-antigens, will be
      formulated with a novel adjuvant to strengthen CD8+ T cell immunity to cancer. Immune
      checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-1 or PD-L1 will be administered both before, during and
      after vaccination to unleash the activity of vaccine-induced immune responses.

                  prior to the performance of any study-related procedures that are not considered
                  part of standard of care.

               2. Consent for tumor biopsy samples. i. Subject must consent and will be required to
                  undergo a MANDATORY pre-treatment biopsy; therefore, subjects must have a lesion

             at least 4 months with one anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 agent in the
             metastatic/unresectable setting, without unequivocal objective response or disease
             progression, and who qualify for continued treatment with the same agent, who accept a
             second biopsy.
