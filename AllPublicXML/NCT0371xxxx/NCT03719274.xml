  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although physiologic gingival hyperpigmentation is not a pathologic condition, it is
      considered one of the main esthetic problems in dentistry. It was found that the attached
      gingiva is the most frequently pigmented intraoral tissues followed by the papillary gingiva
      and the alveolar mucosa

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In addition to all of the previously mentioned actions of vitamin C, it was found to be
      involved in depigmentation due to several factors that not only depend on its direct effect
      on melanin and melanocytes but also due to the overall effect on the applied tissues. Melanin
      is one of the main reservoir for ROS, copper and calcium in the tissue cells . Once vitamin C
      is introduced to the target tissue, it binds efficiently to melanin due to the ROS, calcium
      and copper content which causes intracellular deficiency of these items and the inability of
      the cells to produce melanin. Calcium deficiency causes failure of melanocytes to perform
      cellular adhesion to keratinocytes as calcium is essential to form cadherins . Adhesion to
      keratinocytes is important stimulator to melanocytes in order to produce melanin, format
      dendrites and transfer the produced melanin to neighboring cells . Shortage of the
      intercellular copper limits the formation of tyrosin, tyrosinase enzyme and peroxidase enzyme
      which in turn stops the melanin production .

      Therefore, the aim of the present study is to compare the clinical efficiency of the
      non-surgical intraepidermal injection of vitamin C in comparison to the gold standard
      surgical technique (scalpel technique) for gingival depigmentation.
