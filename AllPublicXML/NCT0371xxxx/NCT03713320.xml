  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this clinical trial is to study the efficacy and safety of cobomarsen
      (also known as MRG-106) for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), mycosis
      fungoides (MF) subtype. Cobomarsen is designed to inhibit the activity of a molecule called
      miR-155 that may be important to the growth and survival of MF cancer cells. The study will
      compare the effects of cobomarsen to vorinostat, a drug that has been approved for the
      treatment of CTCL in the United States and several other countries.

      Participants in the clinical trial will be randomly assigned to receive either weekly doses
      of cobomarsen by injection into a vein or daily oral doses of vorinostat. Participants will
      continue on their assigned treatment as long as there is no evidence of progression of their
      cancer. The effects of treatment will be measured based on changes in skin lesion severity,
      as well as the length of time that the subject's disease remains stable or improved, without
      evidence of disease progression. The safety and tolerability of cobomarsen will be assessed
      based on the frequency and severity of observed side effects.

      Participants assigned to receive vorinostat who experience progression of their disease
      during their participation in this study may have the option to be treated with cobomarsen in
      an open-label, crossover arm of the same study if they meet the entry criteria for that part
      of the study.

      Study Design:

      Subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either cobomarsen or vorinostat.
      Approximately 126 subjects (63 per arm) are expected to be enrolled. Cobomarsen will be
      administered in the clinic by 2-hr intravenous infusion on Days 1, 3, 5 and 8, and weekly
      thereafter. Vorinostat will be dispensed to study subjects and taken as a daily oral dose
      according to the manufacturer's labeled dosing instructions. Treatment will continue until
      the subject becomes intolerant, develops clinically significant side effects, progresses, or
      the trial is terminated. An interim analysis will be conducted after approximately 40
      subjects have been followed for a minimum of approximately 6 months. Enrollment will be
      suspended until the completion of the interim analysis.

    <description>Based on the modified Severity Weighted Assessment Tool (mSWAT) which measures skin disease severity based on the percentage of skin within each body region with patches, plaques, or tumors. Total scores are calculated by adding the total percent for each category of lesion (patch, plaque, or tumor) and multiplying by a weighting factor. Weighted subtotals are added together to obtain the total score. Lower scores indicate a lower degree of skin disease severity.</description>
