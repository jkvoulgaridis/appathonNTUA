    <textblock>
      FDA approved drugs to treat patients with relapsed or refractory anaplastic large cell
      lymphoma (ALCL) has a median progression free survival of 20 months. Majority of patients
      relapse in 2 years. This study will evaluate overall response rate of next generation ALK
      inhibitor brigatinib in ALK positive ALCL patients by overcoming mechanisms of resistance to
      ALK inhibitors on cancer patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although patients with ALK+ anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), a type of peripheral
      T-cell lymphoma (PTCL), are considered to have a favorable prognosis, relapse is not uncommon
      if multiple International Prognostic Index (IPI) risk factors, age ≥ 40, and beta-2
      microglobulin ≥ 3 mg/L are present at diagnosis. For patients older than 40 years at
      diagnosis and beta-2 microglobulin ≥ 3 mg/L, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall
      survival (OS) is less than 50% at 2.5 years when treated with standard anthracycline-based
      induction therapy. Patients with ALK+ ALCL with 3 or more IPI risk factors have a 5-year PFS
      rate of only 20% to 30%. In total, approximately 40 to 65% of patients with ALCL develop
      recurrent disease after front-line chemotherapy and at relapse, the disease is historically
      resistant to conventional chemotherapy.

      Current FDA approved for treatment of relapsed or refractory PTCLs have a median PFS of 20
      months and majority of patients relapse within 2 years. Despite ALK tyrosine kinase being an
      attractive target for management of relapsed or refractory ALK+ ALCL, ALK gene rearrangement
      makes cancer resistant to first and 2nd generation ALK inhibitors. Brigatinib is a next
      generation inhibitor with broad activity aganst a broad spetrum of resistant ALK mutants.
      Brigatinib has been shown to overcome mechanisms associated with resistane to 1st and 2nd
      generation ALK inhibitors. It is approved as 2nd line of treament in non small cell lung
      cancer patients. and is being tested in patients with relapsed or refractory ALK-positive
      ALCL.

             treatment with the exception of non-melanomatous skin cancer, or any cancer that in
             the judgment of the investigator has been treated with curative intent and will not
             interfere with the study treatment plan and response assessment.

             Note: If a patient has worsening neurological symptoms or signs due to CNS metastasis,
             the patient needs to complete local therapy and be neurologically stable (with no
             requirement for an increasing dose of corticosteroids or use of anticonvulsants) for 7
             days prior to enrollment.

          5. History of allergic reactions attributed to other ALK inhibitors

          6. History of interstitial pneumonitis or drug-related pneumonitis

          7. Impaired gastrointestinal function that may affect oral absorption of brigatinib

             hepatitis B or C viral load)

          9. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements. Physician's discretion may be exercised to determine eligibility
             for patients with psychiatric illness/social situations.
