    <measure>Improvement in quality of life measured by change from baseline in Psychological General Well-Being scale</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, week 28 and week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The Psychological General Well-Being scale is a self-administered validated psychometric instrument that measures a person's emotional well-being. It is specifically designed to be suitable for assessing psychological well being in the general medical population as opposed to a psychiatric population. The 22 questions of the PGWB can be further divided into 6 domains: anxiety, depressed mood, positive well being, self-control, general health, and vitality. The PGWB is graded on a Likert scale, which is commonly used in psychometric questionnaires where the answers range from strongly agree to strongly disagree with gradations in between. Total scores range from 0 to 110, with higher scores indicating better psychological well being. This instrument has been validated and used in many countries on large samples of the general population and on various subsets of medical patients.</description>
