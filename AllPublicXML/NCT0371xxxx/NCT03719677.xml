  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Using a pilot 2-arm randomized controlled trial, investigators will implement an intervention
      that is personalized, low burden (the majority of interactions are telephone coaching
      sessions), and delivered during the initial survivorship transition.

      To determine the feasibility and preliminary effects of the intervention 48
      community-dwelling rural breast cancer survivors (BCS) (ages 40 and older) will be randomly
      assigned to receive either the intervention or enhanced usual care. The 22-week intervention
      consists of three home-based face-to-face consultations with the therapist, 10 biweekly habit
      tele phone coaching sessions, and the use of implementation intentions, environmental
      modifications, and tailored text messages to support physical activity and dietary habit
      formation and address unmet needs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the present study is to determine the feasibility of a manual, theory based,
      occupational therapist delivered, preventative intervention to increase habit development
      (HD) of healthy dietary and physical activity behaviors, and reduce metabolic syndrome (MetS)
      among high-risk, rural breast cancer survivors (BCS). Using a pilot 2-arm randomized
      controlled trial, investigators will implement an intervention that is personalized, low
      burden (the majority of interactions are telephone coaching sessions), and delivered during
      the initial survivorship transition. To determine the feasibility and preliminary effects of
      the intervention 48 community-dwelling rural BCS (ages 40 and older) will be randomly
      assigned to receive either the intervention or enhanced usual care. The 22-week intervention
      consists of three home-based face-to-face consultations with the therapist, 10 biweekly habit
      telephone coaching sessions, and the use of implementation intentions, environmental
      modifications, and tailored text messages to support physical activity and dietary habit
      formation and address unmet needs. Feasibility metrics will be collected throughout the
      intervention and the following behavioral and clinical outcome measures will be collected at
      baseline and post intervention (week 25): habit development (operationalized as behavioral
      automaticity), MetS, dietary quality, physical activity engagement, self-reported unmet
      needs, and quality of life. Investigators hypothesize that the intervention will be feasible
      to implement and satisfactory to participants. The one specific aim is:

      Aim 1. To determine the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention for rural BCS.
      Investigators will evaluate trial randomization, recruitment, trial engagement and retention
      rates, treatment satisfaction, and the feasibility of the data collection processes for the
      primary behavioral measures of HD and the primary clinical measures of MetS as well as the
      secondary measures of improved dietary quality, physical activity engagement, physical and
      social functioning, self-reported unmet needs, and quality of life.

    <description>Treatment includes occupational therapy evaluation and consultation to address any deficits in physical function, safety, social participation and/or life roles. After the occupational therapy evaluation, the therapist delivers education on physical activity and dietary recommendations and habit development techniques, and uses behavioral skills training to develop habit plans, as well as prompts/cues, environmental modifications, and reminder text messages to reinforce engagement in the plan. The intervention is delivered through 3 face to face sessions, 9 tele coaching calls, and text messages.</description>
