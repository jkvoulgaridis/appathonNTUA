  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Introduction: Recent studies have suggested that trimetazidine may help reduce myocardial
      damage following percutaneous coronary intervention. However, the evaluation of the potential
      of this medication in the reduction of myocardial damage in patients with diabetes mellitus
      and unstable angina, in a prospective and randomized way, has not yet been described.
      Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the use of
      trimetazidine versus placebo in patients with diabetes mellitus and unstable angina
      undergoing coronary stent angioplasty. Methodology: For this, a unicentric, randomized,
      double blind and prospective study will be performed in a comparative manner. Hospital data
      (test results, medical outcomes, drug dose, complications) of patients will be analyzed for
      safety and effectiveness. Myocardial damage will be measured by means of ultrasensitive
      Troponin dosages. Expected results: The use of trimetazidine reduces myocardial damage in
      patients with diabetes mellitus and unstable angina undergoing coronary stent angioplasty.
