  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tenalisib has been evaluated as an investigational new drug in number of early clinical
      studies in patients with relapsed/refractory hematological malignancies and demonstrated
      acceptable safety and promising efficacy in these patients. Since these advanced
      relapsed/refractory patients have limited therapeutic options, it is reasonable to continue
      Tenalisib in responding patients post completion of their participation in previous clinical
      studies.
