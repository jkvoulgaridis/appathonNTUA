    <textblock>
      Patients having a planned open surgery of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms and enrolled in
      the study will be randomized the day of the surgery in 2 groups:

        -  Arm 1 : Patients with aortic clamping with pre-conditioning

        -  Arm 2 : Patients with aortic clamping without pre-conditioning Patients will be then
           followed, during 60 days after surgery.
