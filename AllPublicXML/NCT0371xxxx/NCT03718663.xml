  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain sensitization has been associated with pain severity in people with knee osteoarthritis
      (KOA) and a neuropathic pain component has been identified in up to 30% of KOA patients. In
      addition, exercise-induced hypoalgesia (EIH), a measure of descending pain control, has
      previously been found dysfunctional in a subgroup of people with painful KOA and has also
      been utilized as a predictive factor for pain progression following total knee replacement.

      Measures of pain sensitization have been used prognostic to identify responders to treatment
      but EIH as a prognostic tool for Physiotherapy-guided Evidence-based Exercise Therapy (PEET)
      has not been investigated. The primary aim of this explorative study is to investigate if EIH
      assessed pre-PEET was associated with changes in pain, disability and PainDETECT (PDQ) score
      post-PEET. The secondary aim is to investigate if PEET changes EIH and PDQ score in patients
      with painful KOA.

      Part 2:

      Cross-sectional studies indicate, that daily level of activity influence the effectivity of
      the EIH mechanims, while pain patients (e.g. KOA patients) can have normal of dysfunctional
      EIH. It has not been investigated if EIH changes after prolonged exercise in healthy
      subjects. The aim of this secord part of the study, is to investigate if EIH changes after
      6-9 weeks of intensive military training in healthy subjects
