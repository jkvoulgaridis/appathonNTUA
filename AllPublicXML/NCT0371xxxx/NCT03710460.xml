  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity has increased to alarming levels in the world. Currently it is estimated that it
      occurs in a third of the world's population and it is expected that by 2030, 20% of the
      world's adult population will suffer from obesity and 38% will be overweight, and it is
      important to highlight that Mexico is among the first in obesity in adults and children.

      Obesity leads to the development of diseases such as diabetes mellitus type 2, dyslipidemias,
      metabolic syndrome, heart problems, among others.

      The treatment for obesity in the first instance are changes in lifestyle, changes in diet and
      exercise that have shown, in most patients, have little long-term adherence. There are also
      drugs that promote weight loss by modifying the appetite or absorption of macronutrients.

      Dapagliflozin plus metformin XR is a medicine composed with an oral antidiabetic of the group
      of inhibitors of SGLT2 that has shown to have significant side effects in the weight
      reduction and visceral adiposity in people with obesity and in patients with diabetes
      mellitus type 2, it is also composed with metformin which also has effects on weight loss in
      people with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus.

      For these reasons, evaluating this compound drug in people with obesity could provide high
      impact information as a complement for the treatment of this condition when compared to the
      effects produced by monotherapies.

      A double-blind, randomized clinical trial of three pharmacological groups in 33 patients with
      a diagnosis of grade 1 obesity in accordance with the World Health Organization (WHO) without
      treatment.

      They will be assigned randomly three groups of 11 patients, each one will receive 10 mg of
      dapaglizflozin (Forxiga, Astra Zeneca), 1000 mg of metformin XR or 10/1000 mg of
      dapagliflozin plus metformin XR, one time per day before having break-fast during 12 weeks.

      The body weight, body mass index (BMI), adiposity %, visceral adiposity, fat mass, lean mass,
      waist circunference,waist-hip index, arterial pressure, and laboratory parameters as a
      glucose, triglicerides, cholesterol, High density lipoprotein (c-HDL), low density
      lipoprotein (c-LDL), uric acid, creatinin, C reactive protein, adiponectin and interleukin
      10, leptin and TNF-∝will be measures.

      This protocol is already approved by the local ethics committee and written informed consent
      it's going to be obtained from all volunteers.

      Statistical analysis will be presented through measures of central tendency and dispersion,
      average and deviation standard for quantitative variables; frequencies and percentages for
      variable qualitative. Qualitative variables will be analyzed by X2, will be used for
      differences inter-group Kruskal-Wallis Test and Wilcoxon Test for the within-groups
      differences. It will be considered statistical significance p ≤0.05.
