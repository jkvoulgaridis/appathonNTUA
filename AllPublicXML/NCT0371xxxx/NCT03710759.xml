      Quasi experimental study with duration will be of 6 month, data will be collected from Fauji
      Foundation Hospital, Rawalpindi. Sample size was calculated from open epi tool (2017) was
      n=60. Non probability convenient type of sampling technique is used. Children suffering from
      pneumonia between the ages 5-15 years with class III &amp; IV on pneumonia severity index. Both
      genders are included under study. Patients on 2nd &amp; 3rd generation anti-biotic therapy for
      pneumonia are included in the study. Children with musculoskeletal disorders, neuromuscular
      disorders, cardiovascular co-morbidities and children with diagnosed lobular pneumonia will
      be excluded. Self-structured questionnaire will be used which includes the demographics,
      Pneumonia Severity Index, type of Assistive Breathing devices/ Litre of Oxygen support,
      Vitals, Atrial blood gases(ABG's), Chest X rays and Pediatric Early Warning Sign-Respiratory
      system.

    <textblock>
      Pneumonia is the number one infectious killer of children under age 5 globally, according to
      a WHO report year 2015, about 9,35,002 children die of pneumonia every year. In the same
      report it is stated that Pakistan ranks at third among 15 countries contributing to the
      global burden of child pneumonia. Pneumonia is basically an infection in one or both lungs.
      It can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi. Bacterial pneumonia is the most common type
      in infants however in children RSV (Respiratory Syncytial Virus) is most common cause of
      Viral Pneumonia. Regarding the pathophysiology of Pneumonia, there is an inflammation in the
      air sacs of lungs, which are called alveoli, resultantly the alveoli are filled with fluid or
      pus, making it difficult for the patient to breathe. In order to clear the airways assistive
      techniques are used besides standard airway management. Autogenic drainage (AD) is an airway
      clearance technique which utilizes controlled breathing at different lung volumes in order to
      loosen, mobilize and move secretions in three stages towards the larger central airways.One
      of the modified form of Autogenic Drainage is Assisted Autogenic Drainage (AAD) which is
      based upon the principles of Autogenic Drainage and is used in infants and younger patient
      groups. This technique is performed by placing the hands on the child's chest, the therapist
      manually increases the expiratory flow in order to achieve the different lung volume
      breathing.

      The chapter 07: vol 1 of book &quot;Physiotherapy Intervention&quot; states that the aim of AAD is to
      achieve an optimal expiratory flow progressively through all generations of bronchi without
      causing dynamic airway collapse. James B. Fink et.al conducted a study in 2007 on &quot; Forced
      expiratory technique, directed cough and autogenic drainage&quot; and sates that these techniques
      in combined manner are effective in producing significant results.The direct method of chest
      percussion was first described by Auenbrugger as reported by the European Respiratory
      Journal, later it was used globally. The Chochrane Library published a research review on
      Chest physiotherapy for pneumonia in children in 2012, stating that Autogenic drainage is
      effective in treating CF. L.Corten conducted a research in March 2017 on &quot; The use of
      assisted autogenic drainage in children with acute and chronic respiratory disease&quot; in
      population of South Africa which states that AAD is of significance importance while treating
      chronic respiratory diseases however the efficacy in direct effect on acute respiratory
      diseases is not studied before.Eb. langenderfer et.al in 1998 conducted a study on the topic
      of &quot;Alternatives to percussion and postural drainage: A review of mucus clearance therapies:
      AD, PD, PEP, Flutter valve, Intrapulmonary percussive ventilation and HFCC with Thira vest.&quot;
      Since late 1990's work has continuously been done on chronic respiratory diseases like Cystic
      Fibrosis in relation with Autogenic Drainage however regarding Assisted Autogenic Drainage in
      children suffering from Pneumonia, there is not much work done according to my knowledge. A
      study conducted in March 2017 in population of South Africa which states that AAD is of
      significance importance while treating chronic respiratory diseases however the efficacy in
      direct effect on acute respiratory diseases is not studied before. This study will be going
      to add Evidence Based Treatment in the practice of Cardiopulmonary Rehabilitation and could
      be effective treatment of Pneumonia in Children population through Assisted Autogenic
      Drainage technique of chest clearance. It will be helpful in treating children suffering from
      Pneumonia by adding literature using an evidence based Chest Physical therapy treatment.

      According to the consort guidelines of the assessment of manuscript the only limitation found
      in the parent study was that the study title included both infants and young children however
      only infants were actually recruited in the study. The objective of my current study is to
      determine the effects of Assisted Autogenic Drainage in children with pneumonia.

    <description>Autogenic drainage (AD) is a breathing technique that uses controlled breathing and least amount of coughing to clear secretions from your chest. It involves you hearing and feeling your secretions as you breathe out and controlling the urge to cough until secretions are high up and easily cleared with little effort.</description>
