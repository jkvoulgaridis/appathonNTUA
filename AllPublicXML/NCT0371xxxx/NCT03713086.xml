  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rabies infection is a disease that is caused by a virus and which is transmitted in many
      countries by rabid animals (dogs, monkeys, bats, etc.) through bites, scratches or licking of
      wounds. In most cases, humans die from it once the disease has broken out.

      CV7202 is a new vaccine which has not yet been studied in humans and does not consist of
      virus protein. Instead, the &quot;building block&quot; for the protein in the form of a so-called
      messenger RNA (mRNA) will be used. All living organisms have mRNA in their body. mRNA is the
      carrier of the information that the cells require to form proteins. In this study, mRNA that
      carries the information for the formation of the rabies virus protein called RABV-G will be
      injected into the muscle. Following the vaccination, the vaccinated individual's own cells
      will produce the RABV-G protein. The immune system recognizes the protein and an immune
      response is triggered.

      This clinical study will assess the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of CV7202
      mRNA-rabies vaccine in healthy adults.

         11. Evidence of current alcohol or drug abuse.

         12. History of any neurological disorders or seizures including Guillain-Barré syndrome

         13. Foreseeable non-compliance with protocol as judged by the investigator.

         14. For females: Pregnancy or lactation.

         15. History of any life-threatening anaphylactic reactions.

         16. Subjects with impaired coagulation or any bleeding disorder in whom an i.m. injection
             or a blood draw is contraindicated.

         17. Known relatives of site research staff working on this trial.
