  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background of the study: The combination of daratumumab with VRd is anticipated to further
      improve response rates in patients and may lead to improved long-term outcomes in newly
      diagnosed patients with multiple myeloma. Given this potential, and based upon the initial
      safety and efficacy observed in the ongoing Phase 2 Study MMY2004, as well as continued
      positive results with daratumumab in various disease settings and combination regimens, this
      Phase 3 study is designed to demonstrate improved outcomes for patients treated with
      daratumumab+VRd. The Phase 3 study will utilize the subcutaneous (SC) formulation of
      daratumumab instead of the IV formulation utilized in the Phase 2 study, which may limit
      additional toxicity to patients treated with the quadruplet regimen.

These include five functional scales (Physical, Role, Cognitive, Emotional, and Social Functioning), three symptom scales (Fatigue, Pain, and Nausea/Vomiting), a Global Health Status/ Quality-of-Life (QoL) scale, and six single items (Constipation, Diarrhea, Insomnia, Dyspnea, Appetite Loss, and Financial Difficulties). The scores ranges from 0-100, a high score for functional scales and for Global Health Status/QoL represent better functioning ability or Health-Related Quality-of-Life (HRQoL), whereas a high score for symptom scales and single items represents significant symptomatology.</description>

             systemic amyloidosis, POEMS, active systemic infection, uncontrolled diabetes, acute
             diffuse infiltrative pulmonary disease) that is likely to interfere with the study
             procedures or results, or that in the opinion of the investigator, would constitute a

                  unstable angina, congestive heart failure, New York Heart Association Class
                  III-IV)

               2. uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia or clinically significant electrocardiogram (ECG)
                  abnormalities

               3. screening 12-lead ECG showing a baseline QT interval &gt;470 msec

               4. left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt;40% for subjects age 65-70 years old

         12. Received a strong CYP3A4 inducer within 5 half-lives prior to randomization

         13. Allergy, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to boron or mannitol, corticosteroids,

             lenalidomide.

         14. Not able to comply with the study protocol (eg, because of alcoholism, drug
             dependency, or psychological disorder). Subject has any condition for which, in the
             opinion of the investigator, participation would not be in the best interest of the

         15. Pregnant, or breast-feeding, or planning to become pregnant while enrolled in this
             study or within 3 months after the last dose of any component of the treatment

             from surgery, or has surgery planned during the time the subject is expected to
             participate in the study. Kyphoplasty or Vertebroplasty is not considered major
             surgery.

         17. Received an investigational drug (including investigational vaccines) or used an
             invasive investigational medical device within 4 weeks before randomization or is

         18. Contraindications to the use of any components of the backbone treatment regimens, per
             local prescribing information.

         19. Gastrointestinal disease that may significantly alter the absorption of oral drugs

         20. Vaccination with live attenuated vaccines within 4 weeks of first study agent
             administration

         21. Unable or unwilling to undergo antithrombotic prophylactic treatment.
