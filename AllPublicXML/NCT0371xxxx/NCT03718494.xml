  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess effects of menopausal hormone therapy and normal aging on cognitive performance and
      imaging markers of brain structure in women approximately thirteen years after enrolling in
      the KEEPS trial. KEEPS participants were randomized to oral or transdermal estrogen
      treatments or placebo within three years of menopause. This is a follow up study of these
      women approximately thirteen years after randomization (9 years after study completion.) No
      treatments are given as part of this study; any current hormonal treatments are by choice and
      prescribed by the participant's personal physician.

  <detailed_description>

      The objectives are to assess the long-term risks and benefits of menopausal hormone therapy
      (mHT) on Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiology, cerebrovascular, cognitive, and mood
      health in women treated with transdermal 17β-estradiol (tE2) or oCEE compared to placebo
      within three years of menopause, which is considered to be the &quot;critical window&quot; for mHT.

      The Primary Objective is to determine the differences in Alzheimer's Disease biomarkers ,
      cerebrovascular lesion load and brain structure in postmenopausal women who were treated with
      one of two mHTs vs. placebo after 13 years post-randomization and 9 years after the end of
      mHT administration phase.

      This project is proposed as a continuation to the Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention Study
      (KEEPS), a nationwide, multi-center, randomized blinded study of mHT in recently menopausal
      women.

      The current investigation will include assessments conducted within a six-week interval over
      2- 3 visits, Participants will be on study for up to 3 months while completing medical
      assessment, questionnaires, blood work, neurocognitive studies, ECG, brain MRI, brain PET.

    <description>Participants will receive an intravenous bolus injection of approximately 370 MBq (10 mCi) of 18F- AV-1451. PET/CT image acquisition will include a low dose CT and then a 20-minute PET acquisition starting at 80 minutes after injection of 18F-T807 and will be performed as 4, 5-minute frames that will then be summed into one static frame. Serial frames will allow for adjustment in the case of patient motion.</description>

    <description>Each participant will be injected with 10 mCi of 18F-Florbetapir (target dose 370 MBq, range 296 - 444 MBq). After a 25-minute uptake period, the patient will be positioned on the scanner bed with instructions to remain motionless. A helical CT image will be obtained at 50 minutes after injection of 18F-Florbetapir, followed by a 10-minute PET acquisition consisting of two 5-minute dynamic frames.</description>
