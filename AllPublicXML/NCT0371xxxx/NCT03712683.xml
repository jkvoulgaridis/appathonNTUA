    <textblock>
      Subclinical hypothyroidism(SCH) is the elevated thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) with normal
      free Thyroxine levels and it is a mild or compensated form of primary hypothyroidism. It has
      been suggested that SCH is more prevalent in infertile women (especially in women with
      ovulatory disorders.Various rates of SCH was reported in infertile women in different
      populations

      Despite well-established recommendations on screening and treatment of overt hypothyroid in
      infertile women, there is a controversy regard the treatment of SCH in infertile women .

      There are few published data on the prevalence of SCH and the outcome of treatment of SCH in
      infertile women, many were conducted during IVF cycles . Moreover there are inconsistent
      results in these studies being authors advised to treat SCH before IVF and some other
      articles find out no any benefit regarding treatment with Thyroxine in SCH
