      The study will test the safety and performance of the Cardiovalve transfemoral mitral valve
      replacement system in treating patients with severe mitral regurgitation who are at high risk
      for open chest surgery. The system is comprised of comprised of: 1) an Implant; 2) a Delivery
      System (DS); and 3) Accessories that are required for the implantation procedure. the
      procedure is performed under general anesthesia.

      procedure is performed under general anesthesia, and the participants will be followed-up at
      discharge, 1- 3-, 6-, 12- and 24-months post-procedure, in order to check the system
      functionality and effect on their cardiology status.
