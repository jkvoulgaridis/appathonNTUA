  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite major technological advances, management of type one diabetes mellitus (T1D) remains
      suboptimal, putting millions of people at risk for immediate and long-term complications.
      After meals, a mismatch between carbohydrate absorption rate and insulin action typically
      leads to alternating periods of hyper- and hypoglycemia. A conceptually promising approach to
      control both problems is dietary carbohydrate restriction to reduce postprandial blood
      glucose changes and insulin needs. In a prior survey study, the investigators documented
      exceptional glycemic control (HbA1c 5.67%) and low acute complication rates among 316
      children and adults with T1D consuming a very-low-carbohydrate diet.

      To test the feasibility of this approach, the investigators will conduct a
      randomized-controlled feeding study involving 32 adults and adolescents with T1D.
      Participants will be randomized to receive a very low carbohydrate vs. standard carbohydrate
      diet. Participants will be in the study for 12 weeks and receive all their meals by meal
      delivery.They will share continuous glucose monitoring data with the study team and be in
      close communication to adjust insulin doses as needed. All participants will have a screening
      visit, an individual or group education session, and 7 study visits with fasting blood draws
      to evaluate diabetes control and metabolic health. Two of the visits will also comprise
      additional metabolic studies to assess glucagon response and brain function during
      hypoglycemia by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Participants will have IV catheters placed
      and receive IV insulin to drop blood glucose levels to 50 mg/dl for up to 30 minutes. The
      primary outcome will be HbA1C change from baseline. Secondary outcomes include detailed
      measures of glycemic variability, metabolic health, and quality of life.
