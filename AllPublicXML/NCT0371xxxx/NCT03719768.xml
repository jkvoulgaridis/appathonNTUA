             have recovered from the acute effects of radiation therapy or surgery prior to study
             treatment, have discontinued corticosteroid treatment for these metastases for at
             least 4 weeks and are neurologically stable. Short courses of corticosteroids are

          -  OTHER PERSISTING TOXICITIES: &quot;Persisting toxicity related to prior therapy (NCI CTCAE
             v. 5.0 Grade &gt; 1); however, alopecia, sensory neuropathy Grade ≤ 2, or other Grade ≤ 2
             not constituting a safety risk based on investigator's judgment are acceptable.

          -  Other severe acute or chronic medical conditions, including immune colitis,
             inflammatory bowel disease, immune pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis or psychiatric
             conditions including recent (within the past year) or active suicidal ideation or
             behavior; or laboratory abnormalities that may increase the risk associated with study
             participation or study treatment administration or may interfere with the
             interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make
             the patient inappropriate for entry into this study.

          -  Bisphosphonate or denosumab treatment is not allowed unless it has been initiated more
             than 14 days prior to receiving the first administration of study treatment.
