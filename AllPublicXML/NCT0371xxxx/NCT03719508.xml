    <textblock>
      Preoperative malnutrition in surgical patients is an established risk factor of
      peri-operative morbidity and mortality, post-operative complications, infections and
      increased length of hospital stay. The reported prevalence of malnutrition in
      gastrointestinal (GI) and major abdominal surgery patients ranges from 30% to 50%. For these
      reasons it is important to recognize malnourished patients before surgery in order to provide
      the most appropriate preoperative nutritional therapy which will in turn improve nutritional
      status and reduce postoperative complications and length of hospital stay.

      The aim of the present study was to compare the prognostic power of different screening tools
      for post - op complications. This was a prospective observational cohort study, performed in
      patients scheduled for an abdominal operation in the Second Department of Surgery,
      Evangelismos General Hospital in Athens, Greece. All patients were screened at admission and
      before operation. Data were collected in a special form by the dietician and the surgeon,
      with the use of screening tools and the local Electronic Medical Record System called
      &quot;Emrora&quot;. Patients were followed up after surgery until discharge by the surgeon who recorded
      any complication or case of death in a new form.
