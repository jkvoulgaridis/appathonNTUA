      The purpose of this study is to validate the user interface of a pediatric power mobility
      device by establishing that the product is safe and effective use for the intended users. The
      human factors validation study will be conducted in children with mobility impairments as
      categorised by Hays (1987) in the age range of 6 months to 36 months under realistic use
      conditions.The study is an open label, un-blinded, non-randomized study which consists of one
      visit.

    <description>The tasks in this Human factors validation test, that will be performed by the users are: charge battery and disconnect it, adjust seat and table height, adjust the speed, place the child in device, adjust cushion and other support. The summary of identified errors, captured through observation and interview, will be counted and define the primary outcome</description>

             categorized by Hays (1987)

          -  Adequate trunk and head control to remain upright in the device, including regain head
             control

          -  Adequate hand/ arm (distal) control to reach for objects in front of them

        Secondary users:

          -  Signed informed consent

          -  Physiotherapist/Occupational Therapist or parent/guardian of the child included in the
             test

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Primary users:

               -  Weight &gt;16 kg/35 Ibs

               -  Length &gt;100 cm/39 In

               -  Children that lack head control in such a severe manner that they cannot regain
                  control if it is lost

               -  Children who do not show awareness of or respond to toys, objects, sounds and/or
                  people in their environment

               -  Any other reason, if in the opinion of the investigator, the individual user is
                  not appropriate, or suitable for participation in the test.

        Secondary users:

          -  Hearing/vision loss or limited cognitive skills impacting the ability to take
             instructions and perform the tasks of the test

          -  Ability to understand oral and written English as product labelling will in this Human
             Factor validation test only be available in English

          -  Any other reason, if in the opinion of the investigator, the individual user is not
             appropriate, or suitable for participation in the test
