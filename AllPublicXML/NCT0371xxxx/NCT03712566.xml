  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is prospective research study which will include patients with recurrent or metastatic
      squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, esophagus and anal canal starting on first-line
      platinum based chemotherapy or any line of immunotherapy treatment.This study aims to
      characterize the dynamic changes in genomic, epigenetic, immune profiling and imaging data
      during treatment with systemic therapy. Patients will have archived tumor samples requested
      as well as blood samples collected at up to four time points to analyze these changes.
      Imaging data will be derived from patients' routine CT scans before and after treatment.
