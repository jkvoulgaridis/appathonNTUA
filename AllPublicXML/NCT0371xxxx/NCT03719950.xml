  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) with a overall prevalence of 5.3% is one of
      the most common neurobehavioral disorders in children. In the foreign literature, many
      studies bring to light in children and adolescents the negative impact of ADHD on overall
      quality of life. Some of these studies were able to identify the fact that the higher the age
      of ADHD children or adolescents, the lower the quality of life. Currently, to our knowledge,
      only a few European studies have demonstrated the negative impact of ADHD on the quality of
      life of children and adolescents. In addition, these studies used only questionnaires
      intended for parents and not for children or adolescents.

      During a regular follow-up consultation with their referent child psychiatrist, adolescents
      accompanied by at least one of their parents will be informed of the modalities of our study.
      A newsletter will be delivered to parents and one to the adolescent. If neither the
      adolescent nor the parents is opposed to participate, the child psychiatrist will register
      the patient on the list of study participants. He will also fill out a medico-social
      information sheet about the adolescent as to summarize the data in the medical record. At the
      end of this consultation, in the waiting room, adolescents will answer questionnaires
      KIDSCREEN-27 and MSPSS; their parents will complete the CBCL questionnaire. These
      questionnaires will be handed to the secretary who will put them back in the patient's
      record. The KIDSCREEN-27, MSPSS and CBCL questionnaires as well as the medico-social
      information sheet will be source documents. The principal investigator or one of the
      associates investigators will complete the case report form from these source documents. For
      this purpose the data will be entered anonymously into a data entry software on a computer
      server secured by the Centre Psychothérapique de Nancy (CPN). Then, anonymous data from the
      software will be forwarded to Dr. Epstein of the Clinical Investigation Center for
      statistical analysis. The study will begin when the favourable opinion of the Ethical
      Research Comittees will be obtained and the study will last one year.
