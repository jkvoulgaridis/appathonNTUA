  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed project will address this evidence-to-practice gap by evaluating the effect of
      practice facilitation (PF) of the intervention implementation fidelity (primary outcome) and
      clinical measures at 12 months (secondary outcomes).

      Advancing Medication Adherence for Latinx with Hypertension through a Team-based Care
      Approach (ALTA) evaluates the effectiveness of using a quality improvement method called
      practice facilitation (PF) to implement our evidence-based systems-level intervention for
      improving medication adherence and blood pressure control.

      The ALTA intervention focuses on identifying Latinx patients with uncontrolled hypertension
      who are non-adherent to their antihypertensive medication, referring them to health coaches,
      coaching patients on medication adherence and self-management, care planning, and monitoring
      patients to improve patient outcomes.

    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Implementation fidelity will be defined as the degree to which ALTA was delivered, as intended. A mixed methods approach will be used to assess the five core domains of implementation fidelity: (1) adherence to the program protocol; (2) dose of the program delivered; (3) quality of program delivery; (4) participant responsiveness; and (5) program differentiation.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Blood Pressure (BP) control</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>First, BP control, will be defined as SBP &lt;140 and DBP &lt;90 mmHg.121 BP control will be assessed using the mean of the last two measurements recorded in the electronic health record (EHR) during each of the pre-intervention and post-intervention study periods (baseline and 12 months). We will also examine the proportion of patients with BP control &lt;130/80 mmHg in exploratory analyses to provide preliminary data on BP control rates of hypertensive Latino patients when considering the new guidelines. We will also explore mean change in systolic and diastolic BP based on the mean of the last two recorded BP readings in the EHR during the pre- and post-intervention periods.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Medication adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Will be assessed via pharmacy refills obtained from prescription orders in the clinic EHR using the proportion of days covered (PDC) metric, calculated as the total number of days covered by the medication.</description>

    <arm_group_type>No Intervention</arm_group_type>
    <description>Using a stepped wedge design, all practice sites begin as part of the Usual Care (UC) control condition and will receive standard hypertension management that is part of the current clinic procedure. No practice facilitation will occur at this time.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <intervention>
    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>ALTA</intervention_name>
    <description>The study will involve each site starting with the usual care phase, followed by a period of 6 months during which practice facilitators will conduct the pre-implementation evaluation (e.g., workflow analysis, environmental scan), refine the practice facilitation strategies that will be used in the implementation phase, and train staff in the Advancing Medication Adherence for Latinos with Hypertension through a Team-based Care Approach (ALTA) intervention model. ALTA is an efficacious systems-level intervention designed to help patients improve their ability to take their high blood pressure medications and control their blood pressure. Practices and the Project ALTA team will work together to implement the ALTA model into routine care to improve blood pressure control and medication adherence in Latinx patients.</description>
