  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interventions that address criminogenic risk factors, such as Thinking for a Change (T4C),
      are not used with prisoners with serious mental illness (SMI) because of the neurocognitive
      and social impairments associated with SMI. This study examines the effectiveness of T4C with
      a modified delivery system designed specifically to address the unique needs of persons with
      SMI in prison, including improving impulsivity, criminal attitudes, and interpersonal problem
      solving (treatment targets) and levels of aggression, and the amount of behavioral
      infractions and time spent in administrative segregation in prison (outcomes).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Interventions are urgently needed to improve the delivery and impact of mental health
      services for persons with serious mental illnesses (SMI) in prison. Treatments addressing the
      symptoms of mental illness form a critical component of the continuum of services needed by
      prisoners with SMI. However, a growing body of literature shows that mental health treatments
      need to be combined with treatments that directly address criminogenic risk factors (i.e.,
      those factors most closely associated with criminal activities). Despite promising evidence,
      interventions that address criminogenic risk factors, such as Thinking for a Change (T4C),
      are not used with prisoners with SMI because of the neurocognitive and social impairments
      associated with SMI. This study examines the effectiveness of T4C with a modified delivery
      system designed specifically to address the unique needs of persons with SMI in prison. This
      small-scale randomized controlled trail (RCT) explores the potential effectiveness of T4C-SMI
      towards improving impulsivity, criminal attitudes, and interpersonal problem solving
      (treatment targets) and levels of aggression, and the amount of behavioral infractions and
      time spent in administrative segregation in prison (outcomes). The study will also examine
      whether the treatment targets for T4C-SMI mediate the intervention's impact on outcomes.

      The long-term goal is to grow the evidence-base for interventions with the capacity to
      improve prison and community-reentry outcomes for persons with SMI. This study will provide
      the data needed to implement a rigorous RCT in a future study and supports NIMH's mission to
      develop innovative interventions in mental health services.

    <description>T4C-SMI entails a 25-session, manualized intervention that is delivered in a closed-group format at least twice a week over a three-month period. The intervention curriculum includes three modules: nine sessions on social skills training, five sessions on cognitive restructuring activities, and ten sessions on problem-solving methods. Participants assigned to T4C-SMI receive this intervention in addition to any other prison mental health services that they are otherwise eligible to receive during their incarceration.</description>
