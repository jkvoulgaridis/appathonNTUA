  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the utility of chitosan for reduction of blood or tissue levels of
      AGEs in patients with prostate cancer who are clinically stable on androgen-deprivation
      therapy.

      The overall goal of this study is to identify a safe dose of the metabolic supplement,
      Chitosan that can help reduce AGE (advanced glycation endproducts) levels in patients with
      prostate cancer. Chitosan is a naturally occurring substance found in shellfish. This study
      will be using Chitosan prepared from the shells of cold-water shrimp. Chitosan is approved by
      the FDA for use in wound dressings and has been used in published clinical trials for weight
      loss but is not approved for the purposes of this study. AGEs are a type of metabolite, or
      substance, found in food and produced in the body. The researchers helping conduct this study
      have found a potential link between AGE levels and cancer. Participation in this study will
      require three study visits over the course of about 3 months. During these visits subjects
      will be asked to provide blood and stool samples as well as complete surveys about their
      quality of life.

        Inclusion:

          1. Confirmation of adenocarcinoma of the prostate that is documented by one of the
             following: pathology report or clinic note with documented history of prostate cancer.

          2. Subjects must be receiving ADT with a GnRH agonist or antagonist, with or without an
             anti-androgen or testosterone sythesis inhibitor. The current testosterone level must
             be documented to be &lt;50ng/dL at enrollment. Subjects whose ADT is interrupted may
             enroll or continue on study as long as the testosterone is documented to remain
             &lt;50ng/dL for the entire duration of study participation. Subjects who have undergone
             orchiectomy are also eligible.

          3. Subjects must have adequate hematologic, renal, and hepatic function at baseline, as
             follows:
