  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial aims to assess the efficacy and tolerability of Magnetic Seizure Therapy (MST) and
      two different forms of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in sustaining response during and
      after a course of continuation treatment.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will involve a parallel-group clinical trial with three treatment arms conducted at
      the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) in Toronto, ON, Parkwood Institute of St.
      Joseph's Healthcare in London, ON and University of British Columbia (UBC) Hospital in
      Vancouver, BC. It will include participants who are classified as responders or remitters in
      the CREST-MST (NCT03191058) trial, the CORRECT-BD (NCT03641300) trial and individuals
      responding to bitemporal ECT after participating in either of the above trials, who qualify
      for a continuation course of convulsive therapy to prevent relapse of depression. Individuals
      blinded to their acute course of treatment will continue to receive the convulsive therapy to
      which they responded in in a blinded fashion. Continuation treatments will be scheduled
      according to a modified version of the Symptom-Titrated Algorithm-based Longitudinal ECT
      (STABLE) algorithm. STABLE includes an initial four week period of ECT delivered on a fixed
      schedule (once or twice per week), and then transitions to a symptom-driven schedule whereby
      ECT is delivered between zero and two times per week based on the patient's weekly Hamilton
      Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD-24) outcomes during weeks five to 24.

      Further, this trial will also include non-responders to MST or right unilateral ultrabrief
      pulse ECT (RUL-UB ECT) from CREST-MST or CORRECT-BD, who are switched to bitemporal ECT based
      on their clinical indication. They will receive bitemporal ECT on an acute basis, i.e. 2 - 3
      times per week. If their symptoms respond or remit with bitemporal ECT, they will also be
      offered a continuation course of bitemporal ECT as part of this trial and will be followed in
      the same manner as those receiving MST or RUL-UB ECT.

The investigators plan to enroll up to 105 participants to ensure 70 participants receive a complete course of continuation therapy following MST, RUL-UB ECT, or bitemporal ECT and anticipate enrolling up to 60 participants who will receive an acute course of bitemporal ECT as part of our secondary exploratory outcome over 48 months.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (24-item version):
This scale is used to quantify the severity of symptoms of depression
Scale range: 0-76 (total score)
Lower scores indicate lower severity of depressive symptoms (i.e., better outcome)
Higher scores indicate higher severity of depressive symptoms (i.e., worse outcome)
Non-inferiority trials such as this proposed study specify a non-inferiority margin, with a tolerance of 3.9 points denoting equivalence between the two treatments when the efficacy of MST can be concluded to be not more than 3.9 points on the HRSD-24 at the endpoint of treatment.</description>

    <description>MST treatment will be administered using the MagPro MST with a Cool TwinCoil over the frontal cortex in the midline position using 100 Hz stimulation. Seizure threshold will have been determined during the first treatment session following a standard established protocol in the context of CREST-MST or CORRECT-BD. Treatment in the continuation phase will be administered at the same stimulus dose as the last treatment in acute phase.
This will be performed under the effect of anesthesia. The treatment procedure is approximately 10 minutes, followed by a recovery period of approximately 30 minutes.</description>
