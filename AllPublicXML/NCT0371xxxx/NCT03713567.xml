    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate, through clinical, microbiological and
      immunological tests, the changes during the experimental gingivitis and mucositis model,
      between teeth and implants, and between patients with a history of aggressive periodontitis
      and healthy individuals.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate, through clinical, microbiological and
      immunological tests, the changes during the experimental gingivitis and mucositis model,
      between teeth and implants, and between patients with a history of aggressive periodontitis
      and healthy individuals. 20 patients will be include, 10 healthy and 10 with a history of
      aggressive periodontitis. All patients must present the same type of implant and abutments,
      with prostheses in function for more than 6 months. They should also have a tooth located in
      the contralateral hemi-arch in a similar position, allowing a comparison with the implant.
      They will be submitted to the plaque-induced inflammation by suspension of oral hygiene only
      in the tested areas (tooth / implant), protected by a personalized stent made of plastic,
      according to the experimental gingivitis and mucositis model of 21 days of duration.

    <description>According to the method of Löe &amp; Silness (1963) without the bleeding in the component of prueba.Measure at each visit 0 - absence of inflammation;
- Light inflammation - slight color change and little alteration in gingival texture;
- Moderate inflammation - moderate texture change, redness, edema, hypertrophy.
- Severe inflammation - redness, hypertrophy.</description>

    <measure>Changes of Plaque Index in five different periods</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 7 days, 14 days, 21 days, 42 days</time_frame>
    <description>0 - Absence of plaque
- A thin layer of plaque adhered to the free gingival margin and adjacent to the dental surface. The plaque can be seen in situ only after the use of an evidentiary solution or through the passage of the periodontal probe through the dental surface.
- Moderate accumulation in the periodontal pocket, dental surface or gingival margin, seen with the naked eye.
- Abundance of plaque in the periodontal pocket and / or on the dental surface and gingival margin.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Aged ≥ 18 years,

          -  History of aggressive periodontitis diagnosed according to the Armitage classification
             (1999) and verified by the dental chart and time of radiographic bone emission, being
             in periodontal maintenance for a little more than 6 months (Test group).

          -  Presence of teeth and implants (unitary prostheses) in the mouth; in a similar and
             counter-lateral position in the arch. The implants are the same system, including
             protective and dimensions.

          -  Probing Depth &lt;5mm, in the interest sites.

          -  Plaque Index ≤ 20% (Silness &amp; Löe, 1964),

          -  Healthy patients

          -  Signature of free and informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Probing Depth&gt; 5mm, in the interest sites.

          -  History of bone loss by peri-implantitis in the implant test.

          -  Smoking;

          -  Pregnancy;

          -  Presence of systemic disorders (diabetes, hypertension, heart disease or any other
             condition that could contraindicate periodontal surgery);

          -  Use of medications (immunosuppressants, phenytoin or anything else that might affect
             mucosal healing and repair);
