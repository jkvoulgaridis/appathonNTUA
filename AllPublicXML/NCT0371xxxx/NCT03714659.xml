  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The menisci of the knee are essential fibro-cartilaginous structures that contribute in
      static weight bearing, distributing compressive forces during joint movement, joint
      lubrication, joint stabilization, and proprioception. The menisci are commonly torn,
      interfering with these vital functions, with an estimated mean annual incidence as high as
      60-70 per 100,000 knee injuries. When torn, the odds of developing future osteoarthritis
      within 2 years of follow-up can be as high as 5.92. The management of meniscal tears remains
      a challenge given the poor intrinsic healing capacity of tears occurring in the inner,
      avascular, portion of the meniscus where direct surgical repair techniques are commonly
      unsuccessful. Autologous adipose tissue injection has recently emerged as a promising new
      treatment for joint pain and soft tissue injury. Adipose can be used to provide cushioning
      and filling of structural defects and has been shown to have an abundance of bioactive
      elements and regenerative perivascular cells (pericytes).The aim of this study is to explore
      the potential of Lipogems® micro-fragmented adipose tissue as a meaningful treatment option
      for meniscus tears. Patients treated with MFAT with intra-meniscal injections under
      continuous ultrasound guidance are expected to report clinically meaningful improvements in
      knee pain and knee function after one year. Knee pain and function will be measured using a
      numerical pain scale (NPS) and the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Scale (KOOS).

      This is a prospective pilot study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of autologous, micro
      fragmented adipose tissue (Lipogems®) injection under continuous ultrasound guidance for knee
      pain secondary to meniscal tear(s). 20 subjects will be enrolled who present for evaluation
      and treatment of knee pain with associated meniscal tear despite prior conservative
      management. Failure of conservative management was defined as persistent pain despite the use
      of anti-inflammatory or other medications for pain, physical therapy, corticosteroid
      injections, or hyaluronic acid injections. This also included patients who were told that
      they were a candidate for arthroscopic surgery by an orthopedic surgeon due to failure of
      conservative measures. Micro-fragmented adipose tissue will be obtained by using a minimal
      manipulation technique in a closed system (Lipogems®), without the addition of enzymes or any
      additives. 1-2 mLs of micro-fragmented adipose tissue will be injected directly into
      visualized meniscal tears using continues ultrasound guidance. The remaining injectate will
      be administer into the knee joint by lateral suprapatellar approach. Post-injection
      guidelines including weight bearing restrictions--non-weightbearing with crutches for one
      week, then weight bearing as tolerated for simple daily activities--refraining from running
      and jumping activities and refraining from repetitive flexion beyond 90 degrees for 4 weeks
      total. If there was no significant pain, swelling, joint-line tenderness, and near full range
      of motion, unrestricted activities were allowed at the 6-8-week time-frame. Complications of
      both the harvest and injection sites were recorded via questionnaire at 1 and 4-week
      follow-up. Subjects were seen for initial follow-up at 4 weeks. They then completed surveys
      at 3, 6, and 12 months, including the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Scale (KOOS)
      subscales and the numerical pain scale (NPS). The NPS is one of the most common measures of
      pain intensity and is used frequently in both research and clinical practice. The scale is a
      well validated and reliable for determining change in pain over time. Pain is rated on an
      11-point scale, 0-10, with 0 representing &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 representing &quot;worst imaginable
      pain&quot;. It is well suited to this study given ease of administration in person or in online
      survey format. The minimum clinically important difference (MCID) for patients with knee pain
      secondary to osteoarthritis has been established as 2. The KOOS is also widely used in
      research and clinical practice, including in large-scale databases and registries. It is
      intended to be used in the setting of knee pain or injury that can result in post-traumatic
      osteoarthritis including meniscus tears. It can be used over short and long-term intervals
      and to asses change over time. It consists of 5 subscales; Pain, other Symptoms, Function in
      daily living (ADL), Function in Sport and recreation (Sport/Rec) and knee related Quality of
      life (QOL). The re-test reliability has also been well established in patients with knee
      injuries and the MCID has been established as 8-10.

    <description>Lipogems is a closed-loop system designed to break up adipose tissue into micro-fragmented adipose tissue without additives; therefore, meeting FDA requirements for minimal manipulation. A small volume of adipose tissue is harvested from the abdomen, thigh, or other location. The lipoaspirate is fed into the device through a reduction filter, and is then cleansed of blood and oil residues using a sterile saline solution. This fat-saline solution is then shaken for 30 seconds in a device containing stainless steel ball bearings, which further fragments and washes the lipoaspirate. Once the tissue is purified and fragmented, it is collected in 10cc sterile syringes and subsequently injected into the meniscus and knee joint.</description>

            <description>Group will receive a single injection of autologous, micro-fragmented adipose tissue into the torn meniscus and knee joint. The group will then be followed for one year, filling out pain and function questionnaires.
Lipogems: Lipogems is a closed-loop system designed to break up adipose tissue into micro-fragmented adipose tissue without additives; therefore, meeting FDA requirements for minimal manipulation. A small volume of adipose tissue is harvested from the abdomen, thigh, or other location. The lipoaspirate is fed into the device through a reduction filter, and is then cleansed of blood and oil residues using a sterile saline solution. This fat-saline solution is then shaken for 30 seconds in a device containing stainless steel ball bearings, which further fragments and washes the lipoaspirate. Once the tissue is purified and fragmented, it is collected in 10cc sterile syringes and subsequently injected into the meniscus and knee joint.</description>

          <title>Change in Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score</title>
          <description>A scale with five subdomains that aim to capture pain, symptoms, functional limitations, and effects on quality of life caused by (in this study) meniscal injury. Each subdomain is measured from 0 (complete impairment) to 100 (no impairment). A higher score indicates less pain or better function.</description>
