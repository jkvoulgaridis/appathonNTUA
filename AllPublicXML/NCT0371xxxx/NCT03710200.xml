  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Wheat is one of the most important crop for humans and it represents a source of multiple
      nutrients, dietary fiber and bioactive compounds, especially if consumed as wholegrain.
      Several studies have suggested that Triticum heritage varieties could present a healthier and
      better nutritional profile than modern wheats, by providing more vitamins, minerals and
      nutraceutical compounds. Although the effect of ancient grain consumption have been partially
      investigated in both animal and human studies, the potential impact of Triticum heritage
      varieties compared to modern ones on post-prandial glucose metabolism is still unclear. Thus,
      the aim of the study was to evaluate the impact on post-prandial glycaemia and insulinemia of
      different types of breads formulated with flours derived from mix of heritage varieties
      belonging to the Triticum genus selected and cultivated in specific areas of Emilia Romagna
      region, compared to breads made with conventional/modern wheat flours.

    <textblock>
      Cereal grain based products constitute a major part of the daily diet, and wheat is the most
      important crop for humans representing a source of multiple nutrients, dietary fiber and
      bioactive compounds, especially if consumed as wholegrain. Depending on its physical and
      chemicals properties, such as structure of grains, granular size of semolina, quantity and
      quality of fiber and phytochemicals, amylose/amylopectin ratio, wheat may vehicle protective
      effects on human health. After the Green Revolution, most of wheat species grown are hybrids,
      which derive from ancient wheat over the last 100 to 150 years. The main results of this
      revolution were the development of modern varieties characterized by higher yield, a reduced
      susceptibility to disease and insects, an increase tolerance to environmental stresses, a
      homogeneous maturation and a better gluten quality, compared to ancient wheat. At the same
      time, a decrease in genetic variability as well as a gradual depletion of the nutritional and
      nutraceutical properties of the wheat occurred. However, over the last years, the increase of
      diet-related chronic disease led to the nutritional improvement of wheat for ameliorating its
      health potential. Nowadays, the higher value of whole grains than refined grains is
      recognized, while the nutritional effects of ancient versus modern grains is still
      controversial. Generally, ancient species are higher in vitamins, such as folate, niacin and
      vitamin B6, as well as in minerals such as calcium, iron, magnesium and phosphor compared to
      modern species, however evidence linked to their real health in vivo effects is still
      lacking. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to evaluate the nutritional profile of
      eight breads made with ancient (Triticum heritage varieties) or modern grains on the plasma
      response of glucose and insulin.
