  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of the proposed study is to compare the effectiveness of universal school
      based screening for adolescent major depressive disorder to the current school process of
      targeted screening based on concerning behavior.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of annual major depressive disorder (MDD) episodes has increased by greater
      than 50% from 2008 to 2015 among US adolescents. Paralleling the rise in MDD, suicide is now
      the 2nd leading cause of adolescent deaths. Despite the US Preventive Services Task Force
      (USPSTF) 2009 endorsement of universal screening for adolescent MDD in primary care, MDD
      screening occurs in less than 2% of office visits.

      The primary goal of the proposed study is to compare the effectiveness of universal versus
      targeted adolescent MDD screening in a school setting. Universal screening was chosen to be
      conducted in schools because, compared to medical settings; schools are more likely to
      regularly engage with adolescents.

      The hypothesis is that universal school-based screening with the validated Patient Health
      Questionnaire (PHQ) will result in increased rates of MDD screening, identification and
      treatment engagement. The Penn State team brings a breadth of experience in pediatrics,
      community-engaged research, adolescent health, psychiatry and engagement with minority
      populations.

    <time_frame>up to 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Universal 1) Adolescents with PHQ-9 score &gt;10 (screen Sept-Mar of the school year) or who at any point in the year exhibit behavior concerning for MDD prompting a SAP triage request, 2) Adolescents identified with MDD by SAP triage, and 3) Adolescents who successfully engage with at least one SAP recommendation.
Prior Sept-Nov screening adjusted per school preference.
Targeted
1) Adolescents with behavior concerning for MDD prompting a SAP triage request, 2) Adolescents identified with MDD by SAP triage, and 3) Adolescents who successfully engage with at least one SAP recommendation
Concern for MDD based on a primary or secondary potentially MDD related SAP &quot;incoming referral reason&quot;
SAP triage is not diagnostic, so MDD identified based on recommendations for MDD related school or community services (e.g. mental health treatment services)

    <description>Students randomized to the targeted screening arm will complete their routine school-based health screenings. Students will be followed through the academic year for referrals to the Student Assistance Program (SAP). SAP currently exists in all Pennsylvania (PA) schools and functions like a triage service. If a student exhibits behavior concerning for MDD (raised by any contact, e.g. teachers, nurse, parent, peer, or even self-referral), SAP will triage the student and based on the initial assessment provide recommendations for school or community-based services.</description>

    <description>Students randomized to the universal screening arm will complete the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) during the academic year. This screening tool includes nine close-ended questions with a scoring system ranging from 0 to 27. Scores &gt;10 are considered a &quot;positive&quot; screen. Students with a positive PHQ-9 result will then proceed to SAP triage as per the current process for those referred via the targeted screening arm.</description>

    <intervention_name>Universal Screening Arm</intervention_name>
    <description>Students with PHQ-9 score &gt;10, corresponding to a positive MDD screen, will proceed through the same SAP triage process as students referred by traditional means.
SAP triage will determine MDD identification. As SAP triage is not diagnostic, MDD identification is based on SAP recommendations for MDD related school or community services.
Treatment engagement will be tracked per current SAP processes.
To immediately identify and address suicidal intent, the survey will flag a positive response to PHQ-9 question 9 in real time. A suicidal student would proceed directly to management through the school crisis plan.
Students in the intervention arm will also be tracked for behavior concerning for MDD at any point in the school year prompting SAP triage referral.</description>
