  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Outcomes after kidney transplantation have been significantly enhanced with the advances made
      in immunosuppressive therapies. Tacrolimus is currently marketed as an extended-release
      once-daily formulation dosing option for patients, decreasing pill burden and possibly
      decreasing adverse effects. Some transplant recipients have been shown to have higher dosage
      requirements. According to the literature, this can be linked to genetic disparities in the
      metabolism of tacrolimus.. This potential complication, where differences on specific genes
      alters metabolism of tacrolimus, can increase difficulty in getting to a therapeutic drug
      level for immunosuppresants and is one large factor that contributes to the fact that kidney
      transplant survival rates differ between patients. Due to the enhanced bioavailability of
      Meltdose formulation once-daily extended-release tacrolimus, its de novo use in recent
      research and practice has been shown to expedite achievement of target tacrolimus trough
      concentrations. De novo use of once-daily tacrolimus formulations is understudied. Through a
      prospective investigational study, we aim to determine the optimal strategy for de novo
      dosing of once-daily extended release tacrolimus (MeltDose formulation) for kidney transplant
      recipients at Temple University Hospital.

      Patients will be identified when an organ from live or deceased donor becomes available for
      kidney transplant. Prior to receiving their kidney transplant, subjects will be screened for
      inclusion/exclusion criteria on the day of transplantation. During the pre-operative
      preparation for transplant, patients will be consented for surgery and consented for the
      study at the same time if they volunteer to be included. The transplant surgeon performing
      the transplant operation will be responsible for screening the patients for inclusion and
      exclusion criteria as well as obtaining informed consent. Patients will need to provide
      informed consent to be included in the study, and will receive a copy of their consent. Each
      potential participant will be approached by the transplant surgeon and informed of all
      information pertinent to the study prior to providing consent. No advertisements for
      recruitment will be performed and no compensation will be provided for participation.

      This study is a single center prospective observational study conducted at Temple University
      Hospital (TUH). All participants will be consented for all procedures involved in this study.
      This study will utilize the QUEST questionnaire (attached) to evaluate the severity of
      tremors at 1 month. Data to be collected includes tacrolimus trough levels, study drug
      dosing, hemoglobin A1c, incidence and severity of tremors, potassium, glomerular filtration
      rate, and rejection episodes.

      Day 0 Study drug (tacrolimus) initiated at 0.13/mg/kg/day for all patients (the day of
      initiation decided per transplant surgeon discretion)

      Day 0-4 Inpatient laboratory parameters checked every 24 hours (serum creatinine, tacrolimus
      level, glomerular filtration rate, potassium, blood glucose)

      Day 4-30 Outpatient laboratory parameters checked three times weekly on Monday, Wednesday,
      and Friday (serum creatinine, tacrolimus level, glomerular filtration rate, potassium, blood
      glucose)

      Day 30 visit (within 5 days) Draw tacrolimus trough levels, serum creatinine, estimated
      glomerular filtration rate, serum potassium, and blood glucose. Complete tremor questionnaire
      with participant.

      During or prior to Day 30 visit Oral swab performed to be analyzed for testing of metabolic
      enzymatic activity (This will be performed to determine ability of the patient to metabolize
      tacrolimus)
