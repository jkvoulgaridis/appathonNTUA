        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy adult male subjects between 20-45 years of age.

          2. Body weight within 80-120% of ideal body weight.

             * Ideal body weight (kg) = [height (cm) - 80] *0.7 for male subjects

          3. Acceptable medical history and physical examination including:

               -  no particular clinically significant abnormalities in chest x-ray and
                  electrocardiogram results within six months prior to study drug dosing.

               -  no particular clinical significance in general disease history within two months
                  prior to study drug dosing.

          4. Acceptable biochemistry determinations (within normal limits or considered by the
             investigator or physician to be of no clinical significance) within two months prior
             to study drug dosing, which includes Serum Glutamic Oxaloacetic Transaminase (SGOT,
             same as AST), Serum Glutamic Pyruvic Transaminase (SGPT, same as ALT),
             Gamma-Glutamyl-Transpeptidase (Î³-GT), alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, albumin,
             glucose, Blood Urea Nitrogen(BUN), uric acid, creatinine, total cholesterol and
             triglyceride (TG).

          5. Acceptable hematology (within normal limits or considered by the investigator or
             physician to be of no clinical significance) within two months prior to study drug
             dosing, which includes hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell count, white blood cell
             count with differentials and platelets.

          6. Acceptable urinalysis (within normal limits or considered by the investigator or
             physician to be of no clinical significance) within two months prior to study drug
             dosing, which includes power of hydrogen (pH), blood, glucose, ketones, bilirubin and
             protein.

          7. Male subjects willing to use a condom during any sexual contact with females of
             reproductive potential for up to 10 weeks after study drug dosing.

          8. Have signed the written informed consent to participate in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. A clinically significant disorder involving the cardiovascular, respiratory, hepatic,
             renal, gastrointestinal, immunologic, hematologic, endocrine or neurologic system(s)
             or psychiatric disease (as determined by the investigator).

          2. A clinically significant illness or surgery within four weeks prior to study drug
             dosing (as determined by the investigator).

          3. History of gastrointestinal obstruction, inflammatory bowel disease, gallbladder
             disease, pancreas disorder over last two years or history of gastrointestinal tract
             surgery over last five years.

          4. History of kidney disease or urination problem over last two years deemed by the
             investigator to be clinically significant.

          5. Known or suspected history of drug abuse within lifetime as judged by the
             investigator.

          6. History of alcohol addiction or abuse within last five years as judged by the
             investigator.

          7. History of allergic response(s) to pregabalin or any other related drugs.

          8. Evidence of chronic or acute infectious diseases.

          9. Positive results for serum hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis C antibody
             (HCVAb), or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

         10. Taking any drug known to induce or inhibit hepatic drug metabolism within four weeks
             prior to study drug dosing. Examples of inducers include: piperidines, carbamazepine,
             dexamethasone and rifampin. Examples of inhibitors include: cimetidine,
             diphenhydramine, fluvastatin, methadone and ranitidine.

         11. Taking any prescription medications within four weeks or any nonprescription
             medications (excluding flu vaccination) within two weeks prior to study drug dosing.

         12. Use of any investigational drug within four weeks prior to study drug dosing.

         13. Donating more than 250 mL of blood within two months prior to study drug dosing or
             donating plasma (e.g. plasmapheresis) within two weeks prior to study drug dosing.

         14. Any other medical reason as determined by the investigator.
