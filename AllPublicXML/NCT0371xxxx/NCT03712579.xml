  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiometabolic disorders are a leading cause of death worldwide. Replacing saturated fatty
      acids (SFA) with unsaturated fatty acids is recommended as a way of lowering cardiometabolic
      disease risk.

      Consuming a diet rich in SFA may lead to a greater metabolic-inflammatory response in white
      adipose tissue during the fasting state, when compared to eating a diet rich in
      monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA). Since individuals spend most of the day in the fed (or
      postprandial) state, it is important to see how different types of dietary fatty acids affect
      postprandial white adipose tissue and systemic metabolic-inflammatory responses.

      This study will investigate the effect of a SFA-rich meal on markers of white adipose tissue
      and systemic metabolic-inflammation, compared to a MUFA-rich meal in overweight adults. In a
      randomised, single blind controlled, cross-over manner participants will consume either a
      SFA- or MUFA-rich meal and sequential blood and white adipose tissue samples will be
      collected before and until 6 hours postprandially.
