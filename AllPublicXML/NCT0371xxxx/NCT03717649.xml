  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study to measure the ability of a 'fenestrated' venous line cannula to reduce the negative
      line pressure seen with kinetic-assist active venous drainage (KAVD) in a standard
      miniaturised cardiopulmonary bypass circuit and thereby increase the flow characteristics of
      the bypass pump.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To investigate whether a new venous drainage pipe (cannula) which has three sets of drainage
      holes (three-stage) compared with the standard two-stage cannula, or a three-stage which also
      has additional windows (fenestrations), can improve the drainage of blood into the circuit,
      reducing the negative pressure produced and increase the blood flow delivered to the patient.
      Patients who consent to participate will be randomly assigned to one of three types of venous
      cannula:

        1. Standard venous cannulation with a two-stage venous cannula

        2. The three-stage cannula (91437C, Medtronic)

        3. The fenestrated three-stage cannula (MC2X, Medtronic)
