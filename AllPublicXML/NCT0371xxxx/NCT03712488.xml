      The investigator's goals in this study are to assess :

        1. Differential expression of CD200 by using flow cytometric immune-phenotyping in broad
           range of patients with B-chronic lymphoproliferative disorders (B-CLPD)

        2. Role of CD200 in diagnosis , classification and potential value in differential
           diagnosis

        3. CD200 expression level at different anatomic sites

      B-Chronic lymphoproliferative disorders (B-CLPDs) are heterogeneous group of disorders with
      variable clinical presentations and outcomes. They are classified into : chronic lymphocytic
      leukaemia (CLL), B‐cell prolymphocytic leukaemia (B‐PLL), hairy cell leukaemia (HCL), and
      mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), marginal zone lymphoma (MZL), follicular lymphoma (FL) and
      lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma/WaldenstrÖm macroglobulinaemia (LPL/WM) in leukaemia phase.

      Characterization of CLPDs by immunophenotyping (IPT) has become an important and widely used
      method in hematology. Immunophenotyping is indispensable for the diagnosis of B-CLPDs through
      recognition of restricted light chain expression and characteristic phenotypes of separate
      entities.

      Immunophenotypic characterization of lymphoid neoplasms is important for diagnosis,
      sub-classification, and staging and can also play a role in monitoring minimal residual
      disease. However, the differential diagnosis may be difficult to resolve in some cases, for
      example, between B-cell neoplasms with full or partial CD5 expression.

      CD200 has recently been identified as a potentially useful antigen for flow cytometric
      immunophenotyping of lymphoid neoplasms, particularly those of the B lineage.

      CD200 belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily and is composed of a light chain-like
      structure with two extracellular variable- and constant-like domains followed by a
      transmembrane segment and a cytoplasmic tail.5 CD200 is expressed by various cell types,
      including B cells, a subset of T cells (including activated T cells), thymocytes, endothelial
      cells, and neurons .

      CD200 generates an immunosuppressive signal by binding to its cognate receptor, CD200
      receptor 1 (CD200R1) , which is expressed specifically in granulocytes and monocytes and in a
      subset of T cells. CD200 appears to play a role in the regulation of antitumor activity and
      these findings are the basis for ongoing clinical trials using anti-CD200 therapy for chronic
      lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)
