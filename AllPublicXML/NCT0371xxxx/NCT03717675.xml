  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will include up to 60 eligible male and female subjects. The purpose of this trial
      is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the NovaCross™ micro-catheter when used to
      facilitate crossing of Chronic Total Occlusion (CTO) lesions in coronary arteries. The
      procedure will be conducted on consenting patients diagnosed with a CTO in a coronary vessel
      that requires revascularization after a previously failed attempt to cross or refractory to
      10 minutes of conventional guidewire attempt. This study is an extension study of Nitiloop's
      Pivotal study.

    <description>The NovaCross™ micro catheter is a guidewire positioning and support micro catheter for improving chronic total occlusion (CTO) crossability. The NovaCross™ gains its supportive characteristics through the use of a unique operator-controlled Nitinol scaffold and an extendable segment. Investigators will use the NovaCross Micro catheter during a standard of care catheterization of patients diagnosed with coronary total occlusion.</description>
