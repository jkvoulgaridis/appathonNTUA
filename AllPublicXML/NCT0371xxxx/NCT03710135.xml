    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the Investing in Fatherhood: New Pathways program of Child
      Development Resources (CDR), a Healthy Marriage and Responsible Fatherhood (HMRF) grantee.
      The program will deliver parenting education, relationship skills training, job preparedness
      and financial planning, and case management support. This research will consist of a
      descriptive process and program evaluation study, with research questions focusing on
      recruitment and retention and short-term participant outcomes.

      This study will address three research questions:

        1. Which recruitment strategies are the most successful for participation? CDR will work to
           expand recruitment efforts and encourage greater participation through a number of
           strategies, such as offering various incentives and hosting classes in other spaces
           (e.g. churches, restaurants, clinics). This study will examine which methods are the
           most effective.

        2. Which engagement/retention strategies are the most successful? Current fatherhood
           services staff at CDR have expressed difficulty in getting fathers to participate on a
           regular and steady basis in fatherhood services. CDR will explore several strategies for
           increased retention and this study will evaluate these strategies.

        3. Do fathers who participate in the program earlier in their fatherhood experience (e.g.
           when their oldest child is under five years of age) report better outcomes than fathers
           who begin receiving fatherhood services later? CDR has extensive knowledge working
           specifically with young children and families in early intervention programs. In early
           childhood development, many studies have shown that the highest return on investment
           comes from early intervention, from birth through age five. The hypothesis is that this
           principle holds true in responsible fatherhood programming as well.
