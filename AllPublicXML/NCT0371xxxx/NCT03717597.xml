  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This intervention is designed to promote enhanced use of compensation strategies including
      calendar and task list use, and organization systems, as well as increased engagement with
      brain health activities including physical exercise, cognitive activities, and stress
      reduction.

      The purpose of this study is to test the feasibility and efficacy of a 10-week
      multi-dimensional intervention for older adults with subjective cognitive concerns (SCC). The
      goal of this intervention is to enhance compensation skills related to everyday executive and
      everyday memory functions through training in the systematic use of a calendar system, goal
      setting and task list system, and organizational strategies within the context of the
      individual's daily life. This multidimensional intervention program also targets engagement
      in healthy lifestyle activities (physical exercise, intellectual stimulation, positive
      emotional functioning) to further promote brain health and functional resilience.
      Importantly, both treatment components work synergistically as the use of compensation
      strategies assists in building healthy activities into daily routines (e.g., scheduling
      exercise into one's calendar and putting it on a task list).

    <time_frame>baseline and 6 months follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Measured using the Everyday Cognition (ECog) scale, a self-rated questionnaire of cognitively-based everyday abilities. The ECog comprises of 39 items on which the participant's current level of everyday functioning is compared to 10 years earlier. Items are rated on a four-point scale: 1= better or no change compared to 10 years earlier; 4= consistently much worse. Higher scores indicate greater functional limitations.</description>

    <description>Participants will complete an initial assessment within 2 weeks prior to starting the course or during the first class. The course will include 10 sessions conducted on a weekly basis. Following completion of the course, participants will again complete another assessment during the last class or within 2 weeks of course completion. Participants may be invited to complete assessments at 3- and 6-months following course completion.</description>

    <description>Subjects will attend a series of 2 hour classes, once a week for 10 weeks. Topics discussed in group sessions will cover compensation strategies (e.g., calendar, goal setting and task lists, functional zones) and brain health behaviors (e.g., exercise, cognitive activity, stress reduction and mindfulness).
Subjects may be asked to wear an actigraphy monitor (that looks like a wrist watch) and/or heart rate sensor that is designed to collect information regarding physical activity.</description>
