    <textblock>
      This study examines tenofovir (TFV) drug concentrations in adults one day after taking a
      single dose of Truvada® - a pill used to prevent and treat HIV infection. The results of this
      study will be used to improve the (efficacy/accuracy) of a white coat adherence (WCA)
      detection test - a blood test that can be used to indicate medication adherence. Participants
      will receive one dose of Truvada®, and provide 2 total samples of blood.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To establish the plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) concentrations of TFV
      and TFV diphosphate (TFV-DP), respectively, following a single oral dose of Truvada® [300 mg
      tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) in fixed dose combination with emtricitabine (FTC)], the
      same formulation used for HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), and in prior benchmarking
      adherence studies (HPTN 066). This will be compared to steady-state TFV and TFV-DP
      concentrations to more robustly differentiate single dose concentrations from steady-state
      concentrations.

      This is part of a larger project to determine the frequency of white coat adherence in
      several clinical studies where doses are not observed. For purposes of diagnosing WCA with
      TDF, the investigators define WCA quantitatively as taking a single dose of TDF preceded by
      no doses in the prior week. The investigators will compare TFV and TFV-DP concentrations
      following an observed single oral dose of TDF/FTC to steady-state concentrations of TFV and
      TFV-DP after daily dosing under observation.

      The study plan involves a screening visit to assess eligibility, followed by two study
      visits. Visit one involves pre-dose blood testing, followed by a single dose of Truvada.
      Visit two occurs 24-hours after visit one, and involves collection of a final post-dose blood
      sample. Blood will be assessed for tenofovir and tenofovir analyte concentrations.
