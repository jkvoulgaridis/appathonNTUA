  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled phase III, multicenter study is designed
      to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SHR-1316 in combination with carboplatin plus (+)
      etoposide compared with treatment with placebo + carboplatin + etoposide in
      chemotherapy-naive participants with ES-SCLC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either SHR-1316 + carboplatin +
      etoposide or placebo + carboplatin + etoposide for 4-6 cycles in the induction phase followed
      by maintenance with SHR-1316 or placebo until progressive disease (PD) as assessed by the
      investigator using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1).
      Treatment can be continued until persistent radiographic PD or or unacceptable toxicity.
