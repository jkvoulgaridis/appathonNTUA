  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled clinical trial is to
      investigate if melatonin can protect against acute radiation dermatitis in patients with
      early breast cancer receiving radiation therapy, and whether this has an impact on the
      patients' quality of life.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded clinical pivotal trial.
      Patients will be allocated in a ratio of 1:1 to the melatonin or placebo group. Patients will
      be stratified according to the type of surgery (lumpectomy or mastectomy). Randomization will
      be performed in blocks of randomized sizes. The study will be performed in the Department of
      Oncology, Rigshospitalet, Denmark.

      Eligible patients with early breast cancer receive adjuvant radiation therapy over 15 to 30
      daily fractions (5 fractions per week) of ionizing megavoltage photon radiation to a total of
      40 - 60 Gy within 3-5 weeks according to the guidelines of the Danish Breast Cancer
      Cooperative Group. In this study, the patients will administer approximately 1 g of cream
      containing melatonin (25 mg/g) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (150 mg/g) or a placebo cream
      topically twice daily on the irradiated skin area. The patients are scheduled to do this
      every day from the first to the last fraction of radiation therapy, including the days where
      they do not receive radiation therapy. The investigators have chosen placebo as the
      comparator due to it being safe and the most reasonable method of evaluating any effects of
      the intervention. On days where the patients receive radiation, the melatonin/DMSO or placebo
      cream will be applied no less than 2 hours prior to radiation. Throughout the study, the
      patients will meet with an investigator once weekly who will monitor compliance and assess
      outcomes.

    <description>Erythema has previously been evaluated by a validated method using software analysis (Image J, version 1.45S, National Institute of health, USA) of digital photos [32]. A &quot;color space converter&quot; function will be used to convert the clinical photos into grayscale in the software analysis. Erythema will be quantified by pixel color analyses where all white colored pixels represent erythema. An a*-value will represent degree of erythema (high a*-values represent a high degree of erythema).</description>
