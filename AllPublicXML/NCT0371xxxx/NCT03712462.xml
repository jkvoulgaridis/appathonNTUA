    <description>The Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire measures eating pathology. The EDE-Q yields four subscale scores: Restraint, Eating Concern, Shape Concern, and Weight Concern. The possible score range for each subscale is 0 to 6. The total score may also be reported (determined by averaging the subscale scores); the score range for the total score is also 0 to 6. For subscale scores and total score, higher scores indicate more severe pathology. The restraint sub-scale of the EDE-Q will be used to assess utilization of skills related to reducing dietary restraint.
