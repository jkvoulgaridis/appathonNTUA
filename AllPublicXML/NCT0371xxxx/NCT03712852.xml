    <textblock>
      Gingival thickness plays a key role not only in the etiology but also in the treatment of
      gingival recessions. a thin marginal tissue lining the hard periodontal tissues seems to be
      one of the main risk factor for the onset of gingival recession ; more recently, authors
      reported that as the gingival thickness decreases, the gingival recession severity increases
      . When gingival inflammation occurs, if the tissue is thin the consequent destruction can
      quickly produce a gingival recession (GR) .

      when treating a gingival recession, the clinician should aim not only to completely cover the
      exposed root surface but also to prevent a future recession recurrence Currently, CAF
      associated with graft is considered as the gold standard for exposed root coverage; this
      technique has demonstrated high rates in gingival recession reduction and positive
      predictability in obtaining complete root coverage . However, some disadvantages about this
      surgical approach can be easily highlighted: patients experience more discomfort, longer
      chair-time it's necessary and a second wound area is created . On the other hand, CAF
      procedure alone does not require a second surgical site, with better post-operative course,
      also reducing the surgical time. However, long term-studies report lower probability of
      complete root coverage when using the CAF technique without a simultaneous increase of the
      gingival thickness as compared to CAF+graft treatment.

      In this scenario, The Platelet rich fibrin (PRF) could be a valuable alternative treatment of
      gingival defects. It's a platelet concentrate, obtained by a fast and simple procedure that
      does not require anticoagulant and bovine thrombin . It can also be categorized as a live
      tissue thanks to platelets, leukocytes, growth factors and stem cells trapped in a
      polymerized fibrin mesh. PRF is used in various fields of regenerative medicine; It promotes
      stabilization and revascularization of the flaps, contributes to soft tissue wound healing
      and reduces post-operative discomfort.

      The purpose of this clinical study will be to determine if the combination of platelet rich
      fibrine membrane with a modified coronally advanced flap (MCAF) improved the gingival biotype
      compared to CAF + graft or CAF alone.

      This prospective, randomized and controlled clinical trial compares three modalities of
      treatment of Miller's class I-II recession: CAF with PRF versus CAF with Sub-epithelial
      tissue graft (SCTG) versus CAF. From each patient a single recession on a single tooth
      located in the upper arches will be selected, in patients with multiple gingival defects will
      be included the deepest one. Clinical parameters will be evaluated at base-line and after 1
      year.

      The protocol is approved by the &quot;G. D'Annunzio&quot; University Ethical Committee. This study is
      in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki of 1975. Sixty patients (twenty-seven women),
      aged from 18 to 47 years old, (mean 32.4 ± 5.0 years) will be recruited from the Unit of
      Periodontology, Department of Medical, Oral and Biotechnological Sciences, &quot;G. D'Annunzio&quot;
      University of Chieti-Pescara, Italy. All the volunteer candidates sign a written informed
      consent.

      Custom made computer-generated table provides the randomly allocation of experimental unit in
      the two groups.

      To conceal allocation, opaque envelopes containing the treatment of the specific subject will
      be assigned to the specific patient and were opened during surgery, immediately before making
      clinical measurements.

      At baseline and 1 year after surgery, the following clinical measurements will be recorded on
      the mid-buccal point of exposed root surface: Gingival thickness (GT) will be determined at a
      mid-buccal location about 1 mm apical to the pocket depth (PD) level with a #15 endodontic
      reamer with a silicon disk stop. The soft tissue will be gently pierced at a 90° angle, until
      hard tissue will be felt. Once the silicon disk will be in contact with the soft tissue
      surface, it will be fixed by a drop of cyanoacrylate adhesive. After the careful removal of
      the reamer, the distance between the reamer tip and the stop will be measured with a calliper
      accurate to the nearest 0.1 mm. The other measurements will be taken with a periodontal probe
      and will be recorded to the nearest millimetre as follows: Gingival recession (GR) will be
      measured as the distance from the cement-enamel junction (CEJ) to the mid-buccal point of the
      gingival margin. PD and Clinical attachment level (CAL) will be measured as the distance
      between the bottom of the pocket and the gingival margin and CEJ, respectively. Keratinized
      tissue (KT) will be recorded from the mid-buccal point of the gingival margin to the
      mucogingival junction.

      All clinical parameters will be measured by the same two investigators (LR and MS). To avoid
      a calibration probing bias, 60 recession defects will be measured twice within 72 hours. When
      90% of the measurements of Gingival thickness will be within 0.3 mm and within 0.5 mm for
      measurements of GR , calibration will be successfully accepted.

      Blood samples will be collected in four 10-ml tubes without anticoagulant and promptly
      centrifuged at 3,000 revolutions per minute for 10 minutes. The acellular plasma formed in
      the upper layer will be washed out. The clot, positioned in the middle of the vial, will be
      cut off from the lower red corpuscles part. The clot will be pressed through a calibrated
      compression system into the PRF box, regular thickness membranes of 0,5 mm will be obtained.
      Each PRF clot will be folded onto itself in order to double the thickness from 0,5mm to 1 mm,
      the folded membrane will be transferred on a sterile gauze.

      SCTG will be taken from the opposite palate area of gingival defect. The incision will be
      made from the distal side of the maxillary canine to the mesial side of the first molar and
      staying off two millimetres from the marginal gingiva. The thickness of the harvested graft
      will be programmed to be pair of 1 mm, so the donor area will be measured with a probe to
      ensure a palatal thickness major of 3 mm. The graft will be collected with a single incision
      technique and it will be measured and adjusted to 1 mm by measuring with a standard caliper.

      Exposed and intrasulcular root surface will be accurately scaled using curets. A modified
      coronally advanced flap technique (MCAF) will be used to treat the recession defect.. The ﬂap
      will be elevated as follows: an intrasulcular incision will be performed around the selected
      tooth, the incision moves on contiguous papillae area, avoiding the gingival margin of
      adjacent teeth. From each side, from coronal to apical, an oblique incision will be carried
      out. A split-full-split dissection will be undertaken until the CEJ could be passively cover
      by the flap. Both papillae will be de-epithelialized. The PRFs and the SCTGs will be placed
      over the exposed root surface of the Test group and Control 1 group respectively. The
      gingival defect will be fully lined by grafts that mildly cover the neighbouring sub-papillae
      areas. The grafts will be fixed applying suture to the periosteum below. In each group, ﬂap
      will be coronally positioned and sutured over the enamel in a tension-free position.

      Postoperative discomfort will be limited with ibuprofen 600 mg as needed. Tooth brushing in
      the surgical area will be forbidden for 3 weeks and patients just rinse with 0.12%
      chlorhexidine for 1 minute two times a day for 3 weeks. Sutures will be removed after 2
      weeks. After the third week patients will be instructed to an ultra-soft manual toothbrush
      for 2 months. All patients will be recalled for prophylaxis weekly for the first month, every
      3 months over the first year postoperatively, and every 6 months thereafter.
