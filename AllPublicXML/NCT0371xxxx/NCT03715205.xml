    <textblock>
      This study has been designed to evaluate the safety of pembrolizumab in participants in India
      with unresectable or metastatic melanoma and participants with non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC) who are either untreated (programmed cell death ligand 1 [PD-L1] ≥50%) or have
      experienced disease progression after a platinum-containing systemic therapy (PD-L1 ≥1%).
