      This study, BC-819-18-204, is a Phase 2, open-label, monotherapy, single-arm, multicenter
      clinical trial of BC-819 (inodiftagene vixteplasmid) in patients with NMIBC adequately
      treated with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) whose disease is BCG unresponsive according to
      the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BC-819 (inodiftagene vixteplasmid) is a recombinant DNA plasmid that directs the expression
      of a potent toxin specifically in malignant cells but not in normal tissue. It has been
      designed to exploit the established biology of the H19 gene, which is upregulated and
      expressed at high levels only in malignant cells, to produce bacterial diphtheria toxin only
      in bladder cancer tissue. BC-819 is administered directly into the bladder to enable maximal
      topical exposure to target bladder cancer cells.
