  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to establish whether viewing and discussing patients' electronic
      communication (texts, emails, Facebook direct messaging, etc) impacts clinical care and
      decision making across the lifespan.

      This study explores the usefulness and effectiveness of including electronic communication as
      part of standard clinical care. Participants will provide information and content from their
      electronic media to research assistants during in person interviews. Research assistants will
      then give clinicians the information collected, so the clinicians can incorporate the data
      into the session as they see fit. Therapists will retain full clinical discretion of how they
      continue to conduct their therapy sessions, and the investigators will measure whether
      clinicians and patients believed use of electronic communication impacted the session content
      and procedure.

    <measure>Therapeutic Alliance</measure>
    <time_frame>After 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will use the Working Alliance Inventory - Short Revised (WAI-SR) scale to assess whether use of electronic media will lead to participants reporting an enhanced working alliance. The working alliance inventory is a 12 item measure of the client's/patient's perception of how comfortable they believe their alliance with their therapist is. Each item is rated on a scale of 1-5, and measures how frequently participants believe criteria has been achieved. A score of 1 typically represents that the specific item has been achieved least frequently and a sore of 5 indicates that the specific item is achieved at every session. The items are then summed up to compute a total score.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Outcome - Improvement in scores of depression</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 4 weeks, for 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will use the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (OHQ-9) to assess changes in patient's/client's symptoms of depression. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 is a 9 item questionnaire used to screen for symptoms of major depression. It is self-administered by participants. Items are scored on a scale of 0-3 with total scores ranging from 0-27. Higher scores indicate more severe depressive symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Outcome - Improvement in scores of anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 4 weeks, for 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will use the General Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) to assess changes in patient's/client's symptoms of anxiety. The Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale is a 7-item questionnaire used to screen symptoms of anxiety disorders. It is self-administered by the participant. The 7 items are scored on a 0-3 scale, and total scores range from 0-21. Higher scores indicate more severe anxiety symptoms.</description>
