  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-surgical biliary strictures are common especially after cholecystectomy. Standard
      treatment involves the performance of multiple procedures over a 1 year period at least using
      several plastic stents to achieve permanent dilatation of these strictures.

      Metallic stents have the theoretical benefit of absence of need of multiple sessions.

      These strictures however are frequently very close to the hilum and thus previously
      considered a contraindication for insertion of metallic stents for the fear of occlusion of
      the contralateral ducts. Metallic stent migration is also a frequent problem.

      The use of a metallic stent that is short and completely intraductal, in theory, should
      reduce the risk of stent migration.

      This is a randomized controlled trial comparing the efficacy and safety of a short metallic
      intraductal stent to the conventional treatment which is multiple plastic stents. In cases
      with a stricture reaching or close to the hilum a technique is used to avoid obstruction of
      the contralateral ducts which is insertion of a 7 French plastic stent alongside the metallic
      stent.

    <description>All procedures will be performed under propofol sedation. Strictures will be identified by cholangiography and then dilated by a dilating balloon (diameter 6-10mm). A 10 French plastic stent will be inserted bypassing the level of the stricture.
Stent replacement and the addition of further stents will be planned after 3 months from the initial procedure and every 3 months until stricture resolution occurs with a maximum of four procedures. Balloon dilatation with a 6-10 mm balloon will be used in each session before stent insertion.</description>

    <description>All procedures will be performed under propofol sedation. Strictures will be identified by cholangiography and then dilated by a dilating balloon (diameter 6-10mm). A 4-6cm fully covered expandable metallic stent (Kaffes stent, Taewoong medical, Seoul, Korea) will then be deployed at the level of the stricture. In cases close to the hepatic hilum where the deployment of the stent is expected to reach one duct and possibly block another duct, a 7 Fr stent will be inserted prior to deployment of the metallic stent in the contralateral duct..
- Stent will be extracted endoscopically after 6 months.</description>
