      A quasi-experimental trail will be used to test the effects of a learned resourcefulness
      intervention program on the learned resourcefulness, caregiver burden, quality of life for
      older family caregivers. Through the use of convenience sampling strategy, one teaching
      medical hospital with approximately 104 older family caregivers in southern Taiwan will be
      recruited and simple randomly assigned based on teaching medical hospital to a Learned
      resourcefulness intervention program experimental group or a wait-list control group.
      Participants in the experimental group will receive the learned resourcefulness intervention
      program led by researcher, one time per week, 50 minutes for one week, 10 minutes for these
      weeks; participants in the wait-list control group will continue to receive their home care
      service. One pre-test and two post-tests, all participants will assessed for learned
      resourcefulness, caregiver burden, quality of life at baseline, and at 5 and 9 weeks of the
      study.
