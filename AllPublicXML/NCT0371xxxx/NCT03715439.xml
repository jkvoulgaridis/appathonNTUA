    <measure>success rates of the implants</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Success is graded in three qualities, depending on the extent and results of performed examinations.
Grade 1.
Absence of mobility is checked by individual stability testing of the unattached implant.
Radiographic evaluation of each implant reveals not more than 1.0 mm of marginal bone loss during the first year of loading, followed by not more than 0.2 mm resorption per year.
Severe soft tissue infections, persistent pain, paresthesia, discomfort, etc.
Grade 2.
Radiographic evaluation
Severe soft tissue infections, persistent pain, paresthesia, discomfort, etc, are absent.
Grade 3.
Radiographic evaluation. Peri-implant pathosis, such as a peri-implant radiolucency is absent.
Severe soft tissue infections, persistent pain, paresthesia, discomfort, etc, are absent.</description>

    <measure>Patient satisfaction with single-tooth implant treatment measured with the Oral health impact profile-14 questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The questionnaire was divided into seven domains, containing two questions each, resulting in a total of 14 questions. The domains were functional limitation physical disability, physical pain, psychological disability, psychological discomfort, social disability and handicap. The overall OHIP-14 score is the mean of the 14 questions. The questions pertained to seven domains and were averaged on a scale of 0-4, with 0 defined as &quot;never&quot; a problem and 4 defined as &quot;very often&quot; a problem.</description>
