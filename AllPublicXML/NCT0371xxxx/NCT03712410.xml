  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hospice care is conceptualized as quality compassionate care for people facing a
      life-limiting illness, with services that cover clinical care, pain management, and emotional
      and spiritual support tailored to patients' and families' needs and preferences. Family
      members, spouses, friends or others who assume the unpaid or informal caregiving role are
      essential to the delivery of hospice services; however, stress and caregiver burden can
      negatively affect caregivers' morbidity and mortality. The emotional needs of individuals
      caring for dying persons at home are not well attended, and interventions aiming to provide
      support to hospice caregivers are notably lacking. The investigator team recently completed a
      study with 514 hospice caregivers to test a problem-solving therapy (PST) intervention
      tailored specifically for the hospice setting, entitled PISCES (Problem-solving Intervention
      to Support Caregivers in End of Life care Settings). The findings demonstrate that the PISCES
      intervention when delivered face to face was effective leading to statistically significant
      decrease in anxiety and increase in quality of life when compared to the other groups (video
      group and attention control). An additional lesson learned from that RCT study was that
      caregivers wanted to focus not only on specific problems or challenges, but also on
      recognizing the positive aspects of caregiving. This approach of positive reappraisal has
      been found to enhance problem solving interventions in other settings. The specific aims of
      this new study are: 1) to compare the effectiveness of the PISCES intervention when delivered
      face to face and when delivered in a hybrid platform (with the first session in person and
      remaining sessions via video) to hospice caregivers; 2) to compare the effectiveness of the
      PISCES intervention to the refined PISCES intervention (PISCESplus) that integrates positive
      reappraisal elements; 3) to assess caregivers' perceptions of and satisfaction with the
      PISCESplus intervention; and 4) to conduct a cost analysis of the three intervention groups.

    <description>Family caregivers will receive three sessions of the PISCES intervention in person. The agenda for the first face to face visit for caregivers (suggested timeline 5-7 days after hospice admission) includes an explanation of the purpose of the visit/call. During the first session, the interventionist works on steps one and two of the ADAPT model, namely &quot;Attitude&quot; and &quot;Defining the Problem and Setting Realistic Goals.&quot; During the second visit (suggested timeline 11-13 days after hospice admission) the interventionist covers steps three and four of the ADAPT model. Step three encourages caregivers in being creative and generating alternative solutions. Step four focuses on predicting the consequences and developing a solution plan. The third visit (suggested timeline 16-18 days after hospice admission) focuses on step five, namely trying out the solution plan and determining if it works.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Group 2 (PISCES delivered in a hybrid format)</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>In this group, participants will receive the PISCES intervention in three sessions; however, the first session will be delivered face to face and the other two via video. The three intervention sessions will be scheduled with a suggested timeline between days 5 and 18 of the hospice admission. The first session will take place in person (suggested timeline 5-7 days after hospice admission). After the first session where the in-person encounter will allow for the establishment of rapport between the interventionist and the caregiver, the second session (suggested timeline 11-13 days after hospice admission) and the third session (suggested timeline 16-18 days after hospice admissions) will be conducted via live videoconferencing. If the caregiver already has access to a computer and Internet, they will utilize the videoconferencing solution. If videoconferencing is not feasible, the sessions will be delivered over the regular phone.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Group 3 (PISCESplus)</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>PISCESplus is meant to be an enhanced version of the PISCES intervention including the original problem solving therapy modules with the addition of positive reappraisal elements. The suggested timeline for the first session which will be in person is 5-7 days after hospice admission. At the end of the first session, the interventionist will ask the caregiver to take the time to think about and identify some positive aspects of caregiving.
At the end of the second session (which is scheduled to take place via video approx. 11-13 days after admission) the interventionist will ask the caregiver to go over the benefits or positive aspects of caregiving that they had identified and ask them to comment as to why they perceive these as positive or beneficial.
The third session will also take place via video.</description>
