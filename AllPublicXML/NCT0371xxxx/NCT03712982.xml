  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infertility affects approximately one in seven couples, and it can be a devastating diagnosis
      and difficult experience for couples to endure. Ellen Langer, Ph.D., Director of the Langer
      Lab at Harvard, has spent several decades demonstrating evidence supporting a mind-body
      approach to improve wellbeing and overall functioning. Specifically, she asserts that
      Mindfulness in its most basic sense - paying attention in the moment - is enough to create
      both perceived (e.g., self-reported) and real (e.g., objective testing) change. Langer and
      her colleague, for example, demonstrated that &quot;Trait mindfulness predicted the well-being of
      expecting mothers and better neonatal outcomes. Mindfulness training resulted in better
      health for the expecting mother&quot;. In this study, Mindfulness training refers to &quot;attention to
      sensation variability.&quot; Such interventions are cost effective, minimally invasive, less
      time-consuming for practitioners and participants and generally easy to learn.

      Langer and her colleague's study refers to pregnancy. Infertility is unlike pregnancy in its
      exact clinical diagnosis. Nevertheless, similar to pregnancy, infertility is considered a
      clinical condition affecting the body, in this case the reproductive system. Therefore, based
      on the results of studies like Langer and her colleague's, that used participants with
      clinical conditions affecting the reproductive system, the investigators propose similar
      mindfulness intervention (attention to sensation variability) research with infertile
      individuals. However, the investigators intend to extend our examination to also include a
      treatment group with the partners of the infertile individuals, as little, if any research,
      has attempted to do so previously. The investigators hypothesize that state mindfulness
      (groups exposed to mindfulness intervention) will improve wellbeing in the infertile patient
      and her partner and that trait mindfulness will predict ability to become pregnant.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Couples who have been trying to conceive for at least a year, have attended at least one
      doctor's appointment with an infertility/fertility specialist and have been advised by their
      physician to undergo their first IVF cycle will be recruited for this study.

      Participants (couples) will be randomly assigned (assignment determined immediately following
      recruitment by a member of our research team), if eligible to one of four of five
      experimental conditions, which are described below. Assignment will occur on a 1:2:2:2:1
      basis, such that for every two couples assigned to Conditions 2, 3 and 4 (mindfulness
      conditions) one couple will be assigned to Conditions 1 and 5 (control conditions). Couples
      will be told that we are interested in exploring if practicing mindful attention during the
      IVF process may improve patient and partner wellbeing during and following their first IVF
      cycle. All participants will be instructed to complete study measures, at three different
      points in time, via an online link.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient and Partner Wellbeing - Langer Mindfulness Scale (LMS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 8 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>4 subscales, each ranging from 1-7, with 1 being 'Strongly Disagree' and 7 being 'Strongly Agree'. Subscales are 'Flexibility' (includes 4 items); 'Novelty Seeking' (6 items); 'Novelty Producing' (6 items); 'Engagement' (5 items). 7 items are reverse scored. To determine overall Mindfulness score, sum all items (items 1-21).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient and Partner Wellbeing - Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 8 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Scale consists of a number of words that describe different feelings and emotions. Participants indicate to what extent they have a particular way in the past few hours. The scale ranges from 1 (Very slightly or not at all) to 5 (extremely).
Individuals decide which of the 20 questions are positive and which are negative. Scores are then added for the 10 positive words and separately for the 10 negative words. The scores generated will vary along the scale of 10 - 50, with lower scores indicating low (positive or negative) affect and higher scores indicating high (positive or negative) affect.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient and Partner Wellbeing - Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>A 10-item scale that measures global self-worth by measuring both positive and negative feelings about the self. The scale is believed to be unidimensional. All items are answered using a 4-point Likert scale format ranging from 1 (strongly agree) to 4 (strongly disagree).
Scoring: Items 2, 5, 6, 8, 9 are reverse scored. Scores are then summed for all ten items on a continuous scale. Higher scores indicate higher self-esteem.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient and Partner Wellbeing - Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 3 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>A 5-item scale designed to measure global cognitive judgments of one's life satisfaction. Participants indicate how much they agree or disagree with each of the 5 items using a 7-point scale that ranges from 1 (strongly disagree) to 1 (strongly agree).
Scoring : Scoring should be kept continuous (scores are summed up on each item).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient and Partner Wellbeing - Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The following questions ask about one's feelings and thoughts during the past month. In each question, individuals are asked how often they felt or thought a certain way.
Scoring: Each item is rated on a 5-point scale ranging from (0) never to (4) almost always. Positively worded items are reverse scored, and the ratings are summed, with higher scores indicating more perceived stress. PSS-10 scores are obtained by reversing the scores on the four positive items: For example, 0=4, 1=3, 2=2, etc. and then summing across all 10 items. Items 4, 5, 7, and 8 are the positively stated items.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient and Partner Wellbeing - Couples Satisfaction Index (CSI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 11 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>A 32-item scale designed to measure one's satisfaction in a relationship. The scale has a variety of items with different response scales and formats.
Question Scoring:
1: 0 (Extremely Unhappy) to 6 (Perfect); 2-4: 0 (Always Disagree) to 5 (Always Agree); 5: 0 (Never) to 5 (All the time); 6: 0 (All the time) to 5 (Never); 7-18: 0 (Not at all True) to 5 (Completely True); 19-22: 0 (Not at All) to 5 (Completely); 23: 0 (Worse than all others [extremely bad]) to 5 (Better than all others [extremely good]); 24-25: 0 (Never) - 5 (More Often); 26: 0 (Boring) to 5 (Interesting); 27: 0 (Bad) to 5 (Good); 28: 0 (Empty) to 5 (Full); 29: 0 (Lonely) to 5 (Friendly); 30: 0 (Fragile) to Sturdy (5); 31: 0 (Discouraging) to 5 (Hopeful); 32: 0 (Miserable) to 5 (Enjoyable).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient and Partner Wellbeing - Tolerance of Ambiguity Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The instrument consists of 16 items on a scale ranging from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 7 (Strongly Agree).
High scores indicate a greater intolerance for ambiguity. To score the instrument, the even-numbered items must be reverse-scored. Three subscales can also be computed to reveal the major source of intolerance of ambiguity - novelty (N), complexity (c), or insolubility (I).
Having intolerance of ambiguity means that an individual tends to perceive situations as threatening rather than promising. Lack of information or uncertainty, for example, would make such a person uncomfortable. Ambiguity arises from three main sources: novelty, complexity and insolubility.</description>
