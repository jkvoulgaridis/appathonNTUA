  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to compare the impact of concurrent high-intensity interval
      training (HIIT) and whole-body electromyostimulation exercise (WB-EMS) or low-volume
      conventional strength training (CST) on the cardiometabolic risk profile, overall physical
      fitness (cardiorespiratory fitness and muscular strength), body composition, inflammatory
      markers and subjective health outcomes after a 12-week intervention trial in overweight
      individuals at increased cardiometabolic risk. Furthermore, this study aims to investigate
      the influence of intra-session exercise order on all outcomes.
