      Clinical assessment of a new optical element for presbyopia compensation - the Light Sword
      Lens.

    <textblock>
      Healthy dominant eyes of presbyopes were examined for visual performance. The examination was
      performed in the ophthalmic trial frame, which included assessment of 3 trials: reference
      (with lens for distance correction); stenopeic (distance correction with a pinhole ϕ=1,25 mm)
      and Light Sword Lens (distance correction with a Light Sword Lens). In each trial, visual
      acuity was assessed in 7 tasks for defocus from 0.2D to 3.0D while contrast sensitivity in 2
      tasks for defocus 0.3D and 2.5D.

    <description>Examination for visual performance in 3 trials: reference (with lens for distance correction); stenopeic (distance correction with a pinhole ϕ=1,25 mm) and Light Sword Lens (distance correction with a Light Sword Lens). In each trial, visual acuity assessment in 7 tasks for defocus from 0.2D to 3.0D.
The degree of homogeneity through defocus was determined. Reference and stenopeic trials were compared to Light Sword Lens results.
Statistical analysis: Friedman analysis of variance, Nemenyi post-hoc, Wilcoxon tests , p-value &lt; 0.05 is considered significant.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  emmetropic or hyperopic eyes with a spherical error of maximum +1.75D and astigmatism
             of ≤ 0.5D.

          -  Corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) had to be better than 0.1 logMAR (20/25) and
             at the same time contrast sensitivity (CS) could not be less than 1.9 logCS.
             -Uncorrected near visual acuity was required to be worse than 0.4 logMAR (20/50), as a
             proof of presbyopia.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  any history of ophthalmic surgeries

          -  evidence of serious ocular or brain pathologies affecting visual acuity (VA)

          -  clinically active inflammation.
