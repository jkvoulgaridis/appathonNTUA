  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safe use and evaluate the efficacy/performance
      of DAV132 in hospitalized patients at high risk for Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and
      who receive fluoroquinolones (FQs) for the treatment of acute infections or for prophylaxis
      of febrile neutropenia.

      Da Volterra develops DAV132, a novel therapeutic option preserving the intestinal microbiota,
      to prevent potentially life-threatening conditions such as CDI or emergence of
      antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Prevention of CDI remains critical unmet need, especially for
      patients at high risk of developing such infection.
