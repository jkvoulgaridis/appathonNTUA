    <textblock>
      Akinesia is one of the most prominent symptom in Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients. It
      typically consists in a inability to initiate voluntary movement, and it affects patients'
      quality of life. This study aims at exploring the influence of Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS)
      in the quality of motor control, and particularly of voluntary movement initiation, and its
      neural correlates. They will be evaluated using behavioral and motor tasks together with
      Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) and electrophysiology (EMG and EEG).
