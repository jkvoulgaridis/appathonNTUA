  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to examine some aspects of health in the special youth care. In this
      case it concerns the mental, social and physical and sporting health of the young people in
      the community institution De Kempen, Campus de Hutten. To examine these aspects of health,
      questionnaires will be used and participants will be asked to wear a SenseWear bracelet
      during their PE lessons. It is a pilot study that explores and tests the way in which certain
      things are best investigated in this setting. It examines how the practical side of such
      research should be carried out. It will also be investigated which obstacles, weaknesses and
      errors can be encountered when conducting such an investigation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research is a quantitative cross-sectional study. Questionnaires will be taken from
      participants to measure mental, social and physical health. In addition, Sensewear bracelets
      will be used during the PE lessons of the participants to collect data (MET's and number of
      steps).

      Three short questionnaires will be taken from the boys which measure the mental, social and
      physical health. Completing these questionnaires will take no longer than 10 minutes in
      total. The questionnaires will be filled in once by each participating individual at the
      start of the PE lesson.

      During the PE class, the participants will receive a Sensewear bracelet in which the number
      of METs and the number of steps during the effort are measured. A distinction will also be
      made between the various sports during the PE lesson. Each participant will have to wear the
      Sensewear bracelet once during a single PE lesson.

      It is an open research in which the participants are fully informed. The participants can
      voluntarily choose whether or not to participate in the study. The quantitative data
      collected from the questionnaires and Sensewear bracelets will then be used for de-finitive
      interpretation and decision making.

    <measure>The level of physical health in special youth care by using a questionnaire: The Physical Activity Questionnaire for Adolescents</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>Use of a questionnaire (The Physical Activity Questionnaire for Adolescents) to assess physical health: there are 9 items in this questionnaire but only the first 8 items are used to calculate the total score. For the score of the first item you take the average of all the activities. On the other items the scores are between 1 and 5. To calculate the total score for this questionnaire, you have to calculate the average for all the 8 items. The final score is between 1 and 5 with 1 indicates low physical activity and 5 indicates high physical activity.</description>

    <measure>The level of mental health in special youth care by using a questionnaire: the Mental Health Inventory 5</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>Use of a questionnaire (Mental Health Inventory 5) to assess mental health: this questionnaire uses 5 questions to assess mental health. The score on each question is between 0 and 5. To calculate the total score of this questionnaire you have to add the scores of all the 5 questions and multiply by 4. The minimum sum score of a person is equal to 0 and the maximum score is equal to 100. The lower the score, the worse the psychological health of the person</description>

    <measure>The level of social health in special youth care by using a questionnaire: the Social Functioning Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>Use of a questionnaire (the Social Functioning Questionnaire) to assess social health: The questionnaire consists of 8 items with 4 answer options each. The score of each item is between 0 and 3. The final score of the SFQ is calculated by adding the score of all items. The total score is then between 0 and 24, with a higher score indicating poorer social functioning.</description>
