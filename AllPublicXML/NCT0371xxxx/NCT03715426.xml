  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study utilizes implementation science principles to culturally adapt a pre-existing
      web-based application (WebApp) for use with college students. The ADAPT-ITT process will be
      utilized to adapt the WebApp to a diverse (race, ethnicity, gender/sexual identity) college
      population with a focus on life skills and holistic self-care as reinforcement to currently
      available primary prevention programming available to incoming students. The study hypothesis
      is that the adapted WebApp will be usable, acceptable, and students will be willing to use it
      as a reinforcement to current university primary prevention programming. The study team will
      also monitor retention of participants over the academic year. This is a repeat pilot test to
      evaluate changes implemented to the WebApp after the initial pilot during the 2017-2018
      academic year.

    <measure>Usability of the MKit WebApp as Assessed by the 10-item System Usability Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>1-month</time_frame>
    <description>Usability of the MKit WebApp will be measured using the 10-item System Usability Scale. Participants in the experimental group will complete the System Usability Scale, which is a 10 item questionnaire with responses that are rated from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree) regarding use of the MKit WebApp. To get a final score: 1) First, one is subtracted from the score of the odd items; 2) Second, the responses are subtracted from 5 for the even-numbered items; 3) Then the responses are summed and multiplied by 2.5 to get a range of 0-100. A score above 68 is considered above average for perceived usability.</description>

    <time_frame>1-Month</time_frame>
    <description>The 5-item System Acceptability Scale (investigator created) will be used to evaluate the acceptability of the WebApp in the intervention group only. An investigator-created acceptability scale with 5-items will be used to measure acceptability. Four items are scored from 1 (Strongly Agree/Very Likely) to 5 (Strongly Disagree/Very Unlikely) and will be reverse coded. One item assesses the frequency of use of the WebApp from 1 (Never) to 5 (Multiple times a week). All five items will be summed for a total score. Scores range from 5-25, with higher scores indicating greater acceptability.</description>

    <description>The 10-item Sexual Experiences Survey will be used to measure participants' experiences of sexual violence victimization. The revised Sexual Experiences Survey - Short Form Victimization includes 10 items that are used to assess the frequency of seven victimization behaviors and then uses three questions to explore the sex of the perpetrator and if the participant believes they were raped. We will be items 1-7 to assess the number of times an individual has experienced victimization over the last 1 month from 0 to 3+ times. The results will be scored as a percentage of participants who have experienced each individual behavior and the percentage who report that they have experienced a rape.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Participants were recruited from the mandatory primary prevention program, Relationship Remix, offered to all incoming students at the University of Michigan. We specifically recruited from October 21, 2018 - November 11, 2018 from Alice Lloyd Residence Hall (control) and Couzens and Fletcher Residence Halls (intervention).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>In the MKit WebApp Intervention group, 1 potential participant did not complete the baseline survey. In the Standard of Care group, 4 potential participants did not complete the baseline survey. All of these potential participants were therefore not considered enrolled for the purposes of outcome analyses.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Usability of the MKit WebApp as Assessed by the 10-item System Usability Scale</title>
        <description>Usability of the MKit WebApp will be measured using the 10-item System Usability Scale. Participants in the experimental group will complete the System Usability Scale, which is a 10 item questionnaire with responses that are rated from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree) regarding use of the MKit WebApp. To get a final score: 1) First, one is subtracted from the score of the odd items; 2) Second, the responses are subtracted from 5 for the even-numbered items; 3) Then the responses are summed and multiplied by 2.5 to get a range of 0-100. A score above 68 is considered above average for perceived usability.</description>

        <description>The 5-item System Acceptability Scale (investigator created) will be used to evaluate the acceptability of the WebApp in the intervention group only. An investigator-created acceptability scale with 5-items will be used to measure acceptability. Four items are scored from 1 (Strongly Agree/Very Likely) to 5 (Strongly Disagree/Very Unlikely) and will be reverse coded. One item assesses the frequency of use of the WebApp from 1 (Never) to 5 (Multiple times a week). All five items will be summed for a total score. Scores range from 5-25, with higher scores indicating greater acceptability.</description>

          <title>4-Months Sexual Victimization as Assessed by the 10-item Sexual Experience Survey</title>
          <description>The 10-item Sexual Experiences Survey will be used to measure participants' experiences of sexual violence victimization. The revised Sexual Experiences Survey - Short Form Victimization includes 10 items that are used to assess the frequency of seven victimization behaviors and then uses three questions to explore the sex of the perpetrator and if the participant believes they were raped. We will be items 1-7 to assess the number of times an individual has experienced victimization over the last 5 months from 0 to 3+ times. The results will be scored as a percentage of participants who have experienced each individual behavior and the percentage who report that they have experienced a rape.</description>

          <title>1-Month Sexual Violence Perpetration as Assessed by the 10-item Sexual Experience Survey</title>
          <description>The 10-item Sexual Experiences Survey will be used to measure participants' experiences of sexual violence perpetration. The revised Sexual Experiences Survey - Short Form Perpetration includes seven items that are used to assess the frequency of perpetration of sexual violence behaviors and three questions that explore the sex of the victims and if the individual believes they have perpetrated a rape. We will be using these to assess the number of times an individual has perpetrated sexual violence over the last 1 month from 0 to 3+ times. The results will be scored as a percentage of participants who have perpetrated each individual behavior and the percentage who believe they have perpetrated a rape.</description>

        <title>Self-Efficacy of Protective Behaviors Related to Sexual and Intimate Partner Violence as Assessed by 15 Investigator Created Items</title>
        <description>Self-efficacy of protective behaviors related to sexual and intimate partner violence will be assessed using a questionnaire developed by the investigators. Participants will complete a 15 item questionnaire with responses ranging from 1 (not at all confident) to 7 (very confident) related to confidence in ability to handle situations related to sexual and intimate partner violence. The total score for each participant can range from 15 (not at all confident in any of the behaviors) to 105 (very confident in all behaviors).</description>

        <title>1-Month Intimate Partner Violence Attitude Scale</title>
        <description>Seventeen questions from the Intimate Partner Violence Attitude Scale - Revised will be used to assess for participant's attitudes related to intimate partner violence. Possible responses are on a Likert-scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) with some items requiring reverse coding. Potential sum scores range from 17 to 85 with higher scores indicating a more favorable attitude towards intimate partner violence behaviors.</description>
