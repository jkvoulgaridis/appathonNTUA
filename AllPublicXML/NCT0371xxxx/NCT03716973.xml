  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will look into the effectiveness of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) in reducing
      chronic neuropathic pain in patients who have not had previous spinal surgery. This will be
      assessed by comparing the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) questionnaire responses before and
      after the SCS intervention.

      We will also investigate the effect of HD frequency parameters on the improvement of quality
      of life, sleep and any adverse events following the spinal cord stimulation.

    <textblock>
      Traditionally, spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has been used for patients with chronic
      neuropathic pain following back surgery (a condition known as Failed Back Surgery Syndrome
      (FBSS)). Although the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) also
      recommends SCS for chronic neuropathic pain without previous back surgery, clinical outcome
      data is much needed in this patient group. Conventionally, patients receiving SCS are
      provided with tonic stimulation settings (where they feel tingling and paraesthesia); however
      newer methods include high-density stimulation (HD) that provides higher energy allowing the
      voltage to be reduced to subthreshold parameters, hence minimizing the tingling and
      paraesthesia. HD stimulation is widely offered to patients with SCS as part of routine
      clinical practice, although no known studies have yet investigated HD settings in patients
      with neuropathic pain without previous spinal surgery. Therefore, the purpose of this study
      is to determine the effectiveness of HD settings in patients without previous spinal surgery
      undergoing SCS. 20 patients without previous spinal surgery who are deemed suitable for SCS
      as part of NICE guidelines 159 pathway will be recruited for the study.

      All patients have a trial of SCS where they will be offered HD settings. If successful (&gt;50%
      improvement in pain scores) they will be offered permanent implant. Those patients whose pain
      does not improve with HD settings will be further offered conventional tonic stimulation for
      one more week. Those patients who do not respond to both tonic and HD settings will be
      excluded and will not have permanent implant. This will also allow us to investigate the
      patient's preference between the HD neurostimulator settings and conventional tonic settings.
      We will also investigate the response to these stimulator settings on health related quality
      of life. Patients will complete quality of life questionnaires at Baseline, 1-month, 3-months
      and 12-months post-implant.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -  Male and female patients between 18-75 years of age who have lumbar radiculopathy who
             have not undergone any spinal surgery.

          -  Patients with intractable neuropathic pain due to undergo Percutaneous Spinal Cord
             Stimulation as part of their standard treatment for lumbar neuropathic pain as per
             NICE HTA guidance 159 at Barts Health NHS Hospitals. The decision would be made by the
             multidisciplinary team by reviewing the history, MRI scans and patient choice.

          -  Patients who have given their written informed consent.

          -  Female patients of childbearing potential must be using adequate contraception (i.e.
             using oral or IM contraception or an IUCD) and must have a negative urine pregnancy
             test.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with diabetes or any underlying neurological condition.

          -  Patients known to have a condition that in the investigator's judgement precludes
             participation in the study.

             device in the 30 days preceding study entry.
