  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Different physical form of apples had a significant effect on satiety and blood sugar levels
      which was shown in a 1977 study by Haber and his team (Haber et al.1977).It was suggested
      that , this effect was due to processing of the apples which modified the bioavailability of
      carbohydrate and fiber content.However this was not enough to explain the mechanistic effect
      of the apples. Within the last decade, the role of magenetic resonance imaging has been very
      promising in understanding gastrointestinal function and physiology. Recent MRI studies have
      measured changes in gastrointestinal volumes due to the effect of fermentable carbohydrates.

      Apple contains fermentable carbohydrates or FODMAPs. They are known to be poorly absorbed in
      the small and exert an osmotic effect by increasing markedly small bowel water content in the
      intestinal lumen as demonstrated in imaging studies.(Murray et al 2014 and Placidi et al
      2012). A reduction of FODMAPs in the diet of IBS sufferers has been found to alleviate
      functional gut symptoms demonstrated in several randomised controlled trials.

      In order to fully understand the 1977 Haber study, the investigators would like to repeat the
      study using modern MRI methods in healthy volunteers and measure the volume changes in the
      stomach, small bowel and colon. In addition appetite and symptoms would also be investigated
      after ingesting each test meal.

      18 healthy volunteers will participate in this 3-way crossover study. They will attend one
      morning for each study, with the studies separated by approximately 1 week. We will measure
      breath hydrogen before the test meal, and after that approximately every hour for the next 5
      h. We will also scan the subjects at baseline, immediately after the test meal and then
      approximately every hour for 5 hours postprandially. Subjects will be scanned on a research
      dedicated 1.5T MRI scanner. At baseline and every time the subjects come out of the MRI
      scanner we will ask them to rate their feelings of fullness, hunger and appetite as well
      their gastrointestinal symptoms on 100mm VAS scales. The subjects will be fed three types of
      Pink Lady apples test meals: whole apple, apple puree and apple juice. The apples will be
      sourced from supermarkets. The apple juice and apple puree will be prepared for this study by
      Campden BRI, a world famous food science research institute in Chipping Campden, UK. Each
      test meal will approximately provide 46g of available carbohydrate; 180kcal
