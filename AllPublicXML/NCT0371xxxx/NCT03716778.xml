  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As part of the regular rehabilitation program for chronic heart failure (CHF) patients, the
      addition of dynamic eccentric endurance (ECC) exercise sessions to the conventional
      concentric cycling program (CON) would enable greater gains in functional capacity that the
      CON alone. Furthermore, in the case of severe heart failure, results of conventional exercise
      rehabilitation remains limited on account of the poor physical fitness and deconditioning.
      Dynamic ECC has been shown to enhance muscle mass and improve muscle strength in subjects
      with functional limitations comparable to those in CHF, but to date reports on effects on
      muscle endurance and overall functional capacity remain scarce or non-existent.

      Investigator hypothesize that a combination of these two types of training will allow both an
      improvement in strength and oxidative muscle capacities. These benefits must be objectified
      at the level of the walking distance covered in 6 min (6-WT).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigator hypothesize that the combination of CON and ECC forms of endurance exercise will
      potentiate peripheral muscle and cardio-circulatory adaptations. All sessions, regardless of
      the modality, will be performed at the same percentage of the concentric peakVO2. Sessions
      performed in ECC mode will induce a mechanical overload. The ECC training of such intensity
      and duration seemingly having little or no effect on mitochondrial muscle adaptations, the
      maintenance of conventional training will allow stimulation of the aerobic endurance
      component. A synergistic effect is expected from the combination of the two modalities; the
      muscle strength gain induced by ECC allowing to sustained greater cycling workloads yet
      compatible with the cardio-circulatory capabilities of patients with CHF and more
      specifically their exercise cardiac output adjustment.

      Investigator chose to assess the extent of benefits through functional capacity tests
      reflecting adaptation of both the aerobic (endurance capacity) and anaerobic (muscle
      strength) components of adaptive response, namely, 1) 6 min. walk test (6-WT), 2) time up and
      go test (TUGT), 3) quadriceps isometric muscular strength (IMS) and gait speed test.

      The study is a prospective, open, controlled and randomized study in two parallel groups
      carried out in a single center. Patients will be included in the study if: i) they are
      referred to the cardiac rehabilitation center for the 5-week training program, ii) they meet
      the inclusion criteria and iii) they provide their signed consent.

      Patients will be followed for 5 weeks, the duration of the cardiac rehabilitation program.
      They will benefit from the standard evaluation of any CHF patient referred for rehabilitation
      including an initial 12-lead ECG, a trans-thoracic cardiac ultrasound assessment and a
      cycling exercise stress test with gas exchange analysis and non-invasive measurement of
      cardiac output using a bio-impedance device. A standard biological blood analysis will be
      performed for NFS-platelets, blood electrolytes, CRP, NTproBNP, nutritional status with
      albumin and pre-albumin.

      All subjects will perform 5 exercise sessions per week on a cycle ergometer. As per
      randomization outcome, the &quot;intervention&quot; group will perform three of the five weekly
      sessions in ECC mode (the other two in CON) while the control group will perform the five
      weekly sessions in CON mode.

      The intensity of the cycling will be the same in both groups as determined from the initial
      cycling incremental test targeted to correspond to the VO2 associated with the ventilatory
      threshold.

    <description>ECC cycling will be conducted using a commercially available ECC motor-driven ergometer. Intensity and duration are progressively increased during the first five sessions in order to minimize the extent of exercise-induced muscle soreness.
The subjects will perform five sessions of endurance training on cycle ergometer per week. Each session lasting 30 minutes will be achieved at an intensity corresponding to the pre-determined CON ventilatory threshold. In the ECC group, 3 sessions of ECC (Monday, Wednesday and Friday) and two session of concentric (Tuesday and Thursday) cycling will be carried out each week. In the control group CON all sessions will be achieved using the traditional pedaling mode.</description>
