  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preeclampsia is globally responsible for tens of thousands of maternal and neonatal deaths
      each year. Currently, there are no medical therapies to halt disease progression and
      expectant management and delivery remain the mainstay of treatment. An important step in the
      pathogenesis of preeclampsia is a poor placental invasion and the subsequent release of the
      anti-angiogenic factors soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFlt-1) and soluble endoglin
      (sEng)into the maternal circulation. Given metformin and esomeprazole successfully mitigate
      key pathogenic features of preeclampsia, the investigator will study whether combining
      low-doses of metformin and esomeprazole may be additive or synergistic (or neither) in
      reducing sFlt-1 and sEng secretion, and mitigating endothelial dysfunction, compared to
      placebo.

      This is a randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled intervention trial investigating
      preeclampsia, defined according to the International Society for the Study of Hypertension in
      Pregnancy (ISSHP). The population of interest involves pregnant women diagnosed with
      pre-eclampsia at a gestational age between 28 and 32 weeks at Aswan university hospital will
      be invited to participate. To be enrolled, the treating team needs to have determined after
      their initial assessment that delivery is unlikely to be required within 48 h. A starting
      point of 28 weeks has been chosen as this would be the earliest gestation that Aswan
      university hospital to be viable and are suitable to be offered expectant management The
      intervention involves randomization to oral esomeprazole tablets40 mg plus metformin tablets
      1000 mg or identical placebo tablets from recruitment until delivery. Randomization is
      achieved using computational random allocation, and both participants and researchers will be
      blinded to the intervention given.
