  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      DFNA9 (Deafness Autosomal Dominant 9) is an autosomal dominant hereditary hearing loss which
      is associated with vestibular deterioration. The most recent genotype-phenotype correlation
      studies have been conducted more than 15 years ago. Meanwhile, emerging and valuable
      vestibular tests have been added to the vestibular test battery. These tests were not
      available at the time of the correlation studies. The aim of this study is to carry out a
      prospective cross-sectional study on symptomatic and presymptomatic affected carriers of the
      Pro51Ser (P51S) Coagulation Factor C Homology (COCH) mutation in order to correlate
      vestibular data using the complete vestibular test battery with the known data on hearing and
      vestibular function in relation to age.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Systematic review of the genotype-phenotype correlation studies in P51S carriers has shown an
      underrepresentation of presymptomatic affected subjects and the calculation of vestibular
      deterioration were based on just one vestibular parameter, whereas the combined evaluation of
      a complete vestibular test battery, covering the complete vestibular sensitivity range and
      all labyrinthine compartments separately, is nowadays considered standard practice in
      determining more accurate assessment of the vestibular function.

      For this reason, a prospective cross-sectional study on pre- as well as symptomatic DFNA9
      patients carrying the Pro51Ser (P51S) mutation in COCH gene is being carried out, in order to
      gain more realistic data on vestibular dysfunction, consisting of pure tone audiometry and a
      comprehensive vestibular test battery, including electro- or videonystagmography (VNG), C-
      and O-Vestibular-evoked myogenic potential (VEMP) tests, video Head Impulse Test (vHIT) and
      questionnaires (DHI (Dizziness handicap Index), oscillopsia questionnaire (OS), Quality of
      Life Questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L), activities-specific balance confidence (ABC) scale.

Oscillopsia was defined as a &quot;sensation that the visual environment is moving when it's not.&quot; The 9-item questionnaire investigates oscillopsia frequency in different situations encountered in daily life. Each item was scored 1 (never), 2 (seldom), 3 (sometimes), 4 (often), or 5 (always). Scores were averaged to provide an oscillopsia severity score ranging from 1 to 5. A mean score higher than 3 is considered to indicate moderate to extreme oscillopsia severity.</description>
