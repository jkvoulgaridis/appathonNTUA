      The correlation of circulating serum miR-125ba and miR-146a expression and clinical response
      to green tea therapy were analysed in RA patients.Clinical response to green tea therapy for
      24 weeks was calculated from DAS28 scores. Whereas , a decrease of 1.2 points or above in
      DAS28 scores at 24 weeks of treatment compared with baseline was defined as clinical response
      according to the EULAR response criteria.A ready-made solutions containing the primers and
      probes for human miR-146a and miR-125ba (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and real-time
      RT-PCR was estimated using an ABI 7300 system (Applied Bio systems).

      1. participants: A total of 100 subjects (aged 18-65 years) who were diagnosed as RA with
           moderate to severe activity at the division of rheumatology and clinical immunology at
           Mansoura University were evaluated in this study.

        2. patients were evaluated for therapeutic response at baseline and 12, and 24 weeks of
           green tea therapy. All patients with RA were subjected for estimation of ESR, CRP,
           disease activity score in 28 joints (DAS28), patient's global assessment (PGA), and
           health assessment questionnaire damage index (HAQ-DI) at each visits (0 week, 12 weeks,
           and 24 weeks).

        3. Pain intensity was assessed by using a standard VAS of 100 mm previously validated to
           chronic and acute pains.

        4. Clinical response to green tea therapy for 24 weeks was calculated from DAS28 scores.

        5. human miR-146a and miR-125ba were isolated and subjected to RT-PCR analysis

    <description>It will be assessed using disease activity score -28 (DAS28) and pre-validated health assessment questionnaire damage index (HAQ-DI). For DAS28 score, the number of swelling joints count (SJC) (0-28) and tender joints count (TJC) (0-28) in all patients were examined and DAS28 scores were calculated . DAS28 values &gt; 2.6 and ≤ 3.2 was considered as low RA disease activity, values &gt; 3.2 and ≤ 5.1 was considered as moderate disease activity and those &gt; 5.1 was considered as high disease activity. In case of HAQ-DI, score calculation involves answering of eight domains(dressing, rising, eating, walking, hygiene, grip, reach and usual activities) with four point likert scale . SDAI values &gt; 3.3 and ≤11 was considered as low RA disease activity, values &gt; 11 and ≤ 26 was considered as moderate disease activity and those &gt; 26 was considered as high disease activity</description>

    <description>It will be assessed using the visual analogue scale (VAS). The patients were asked to mark on the VAS scale of 0-10 cm according to their global assessment of pain. The physician marked on the VAS of 0-10 cm according to the physician global assessment. Patients with higher VAS scores were considered with greater pain intensity.</description>
