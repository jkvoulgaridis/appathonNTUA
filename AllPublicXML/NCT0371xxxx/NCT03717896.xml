  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to determine if administration
      of intravenous thiamine will lead to quicker resolution of acidosis in patients admitted to
      the hospital with diabetic ketoacidosis. The investigators will secondarily investigate
      whether thiamine improves cellular oxygen consumption, shortens intensive care unit (ICU) and
      hospital stay or decreases hospital resource utilization.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thiamine (vitamin B1) is a water-soluble vitamin that plays a key role in aerobic glucose
      metabolism. Thiamine is a cofactor of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), an enzyme that must be
      activated for entry into the Krebs Cycle for aerobic metabolism. PDH activity is reduced in
      thiamine deficient states, resulting in a shift in pyruvate metabolism to the anaerobic
      pathway. This leads to increased lactate production and acidosis. Thiamine loss in the urine,
      with consequent thiamine deficiency, is not uncommon in diabetes. The investigators'
      preliminary studies have found that thiamine deficiency in occurs in as many as 39% of
      patients with DKA, and that thiamine levels are inversely associated with lactate and
      acidosis. The investigator hypothesizes that treating DKA patients with intravenous thiamine
      will lead to faster resolution of acidosis and improved aerobic metabolism. The
      investigator's secondary hypothesis is that thiamine treatment will shorten stays in the ICU
      and hospital and lead to utilization of fewer hospital resources.

      In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, patients admitted to the hospital
      with DKA who are enrolled in the study will be randomized to either intravenous thiamine
      (200mg in 0.9% saline) twice daily for two days or an identical volume of 0.9% saline on the
      same schedule. The investigator's primary outcome is change in bicarbonate over the 24 hours
      following enrollment, with measurements at 0, 6, 12, 18, 24 hours, using a linear
      mixed-effects model. Secondarily, patients will be stratified by Type I and Type II DM.
      Additionally, a pre-planned sub-analysis of thiamine deficient subjects will be performed.

    <description>Oxygen consumption by circulating mononuclear cells is an index of whole body oxidative glucose metabolism. It also reflects whole body thiamine status due to the critical cofactor role of thiamine in oxidative metabolism. Mononuclear cell oxygen consumption will be assessed by the investigators when the patient is admitted into the study and again after 24 hours to determine if there is a difference between the two groups.</description>
