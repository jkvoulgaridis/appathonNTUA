  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The nature of trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is fluctuating and patients can experience periods of
      complete remission of pain as well as periods with excessive pain. TN is often triggered by
      innocuous intra- and extraoral stimuli such as chewing. Since the first-line prophylactic
      drugs, i.e. carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine, are administered orally, medical treatment of TN
      can be problematic in periods of exacerbation. In cases of severe exacerbation, patients
      oftentimes become dehydrated and anorectic as eating and drinking will evoke pain. Treatment
      with drugs administered intravenously is needed in such situations. Phenytoin was the first
      drug to be used for TN but it is rarely used as long-time preventative because of frequent
      side-effects associated with long-term use. However, phenytoin has the advantage over other
      drugs, that it can be administered also intravenously as fosphenytoin (the prodrug of
      phenytoin).

      By clinical experience the efficacy is very good. However, evidence of the treatment is
      lacking as only case reports including a total of 5 patients described the effects and side
      effects with pain relief lasting two days. By providing solid observational evidence, the
      treatment can be considered for incorporation in local and international treatment
      guidelines.

      The aim of the study is to test the hypothesis that fosphenytoin loading reduces TN pain with
      at least 50 % in 80% of patients with trigeminal neuralgia experiencing exacerbation of TN
      pain.

      The study is a descriptive prospective observational pilot study with 3 months followup
      period.
