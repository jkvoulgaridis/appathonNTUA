    <textblock>
      Preeclampsia, one of the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, remains a leading cause of
      maternal death worldwide, with the majority of deaths occurring in developing countries.
      Preeclampsia is a multi-organ syndrome of pregnancy that manifests after 20 weeks' gestation
      with new-onset hypertension alongside maternal end-organ dysfunction and/or fetal growth
      restriction. Importantly, preeclampsia poses serious health risks for the baby, implicated in
      12% of cases of fetal growth restriction, and is a known antecedent in up to 19% of preterm
      births. There is currently no effective treatment for preeclampsia except delivery of the
      baby, and as such, it remains a significant burden of disease for both mothers and their
      babies worldwide. Screening for women at risk of preeclampsia is an important part of
      antenatal care. Once women are identified as high risk, they can be targeted for more
      intensive antenatal surveillance and prophylactic interventions. Most current strategies for
      risk assessment are based on obstetric and medical history and clinical examination. However,
      there is surprisingly little reliable evidence on the actual risk associated with individual
      factors and how they might interact. Risk factors with a particularly high association with
      preeclampsia (more than one in ten risks) include maternal diabetes, chronic hypertension,
      and renal disease. Thrombophilia and autoimmune disease have a strong association with severe
      early-onset preeclampsia. Obstetric factors associated with high risk are multiple
      pregnancies, history of preeclampsia in a previous pregnancy especially if severe or early
      onset, and a current hydropic pregnancy. Other factors linked with preeclampsia but
      associated with a somewhat lower risk include first pregnancies, age less than 20 or more
      than 35 years, a family history of preeclampsia, and obesity. Proton pump inhibitors such as
      esomeprazole have long-term safety data about the treatment of gastric reflux in pregnancy.
      In vitro studies show proton pump inhibitors decrease soluble fems like tyrosine kinase -1
      (sFlt-1) and soluble endoglin and improve markers of endothelial dysfunction . while
      esomeprazole reduces blood pressure in a preeclampsia transgenic mouse model that
      overexpresses sFlt-1.

      This is a randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled intervention trial investigating
      preeclampsia, defined according to the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE). The
      population of interest involves women attending the study hospital for antenatal care and
      delivery with a risk for developing preeclampsia. The intervention involves randomization to
      oral esomeprazole tablets40 mg or identical placebo tablet from recruitment until delivery.
      Randomization is achieved using computational random allocation, and both participants and
      researchers will be blinded to the intervention given. Calculation of the sample size
      considers that the incidence of preeclampsia is 10% in the population of interest. To detect
      a 50% reduction in incidence (with 80% power, two-sided p &lt; 0.05), 450 women are required in
      each group with a 1:1 ratio.
