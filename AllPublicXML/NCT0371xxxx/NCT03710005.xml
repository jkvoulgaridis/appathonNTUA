    <description>The Quality of Life Survey is a patient-reported outcome measure divided into two parts. The first part of the Quality of Life questionnaire/survey will include 4 questions in which patients will be asked to evaluate their individual levels of knee problems (knee difficulty, knee confidence, and lifestyle modifications). Answers will be reported on a 5 point likert scale, in which higher scores indicate more severity, and lower scores indicate less severity. The second part of the questionnaire will include 6 categories (discomfort, mobility, self-care, anxiety, performance of activities, and sleeping). There will be 3 statements per category in which the patient is asked to indicate which statement best describes their current health. The questionnaire is scored by adding up the scores of each item to compute a total score.</description>

    <measure>Measured change in pain: VAS</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Visual Analog scale is a patient-reported outcome measure. It will be presented numerically as an 11 point scale that will ask the patient to rate the severity of their pain on a scale form 0 to 10, which 10 being the most pain imaginable and 0 being the least (no pain). The numerical value will be reported based on the patient's response. The mean pain scores of each intervention group will be calculated.</description>
