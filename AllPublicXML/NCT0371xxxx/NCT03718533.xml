  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this phase II open-label, single-arm 36-week clinical trial is to evaluate the
      effect of eltrombopag in patients with poor graft function (PGF) after
      allogeneic-hematopoietic stem cells transplantation (allo-HSCT).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of eltrombopag for poor graft
      function on overall hematologic response (partial and complete), as determined by platelet,
      hemoglobin and neutrophil counts by 16 weeks after the initiation of eltrombopag.
