      This research study is studying an intervention as a possible treatment for pancreatic
      cancer.

      In this research study, the investigators are researching how well IORT during surgery works
      in treating pancreatic cancer after 3-6 months of chemotherapy and external radiation
      therapy. IORT works by delivering radiation therapy to the tumor while reducing the amount of
      healthy tissue exposed to the radiation therapy. The investigators believe that the
      administration of IORT after 3-6 months of chemotherapy will help to stop the cancer cells
      from growing.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved IORT for this specific
      disease but it has been approved for other uses.

    <measure>Median Progression Free Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival is defined as the time from the date of IORT until the first evidence of local progression or distant metastasis (determined by imaging or biopsy) or death, and is censored at date of last follow-up when applicable.</description>

    <description>Local control is the absence of local failure, defined as evidence of growth or regrowth of the primary tumor and/or extension to regional lymph nodes that meets criteria for progressive disease beyond that present in pre-IORT imaging studies.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age â‰¥ 18 years

          -  ECOG Performance Status 0-1

          -  Previous completion of at least three (3) months of EITHER gemcitabine plus
             nab-paclitaxel OR FOLFIRINOX (5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, irinotecan and leucovorin)

          -  Previous completion of either stereotactic-body radiation therapy (SBRT) (minimum 24
             Gy) or external beam irradiation (EBRT) (minimum 45 Gy)

          -  Participation in any investigational drug study within 4 weeks preceding the start of
             study treatment is PERMITTED.

          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must use appropriate method(s) of
             contraception. WOCBP should use an adequate method to avoid pregnancy for 5 months
             after IORT.

          -  Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must use any contraceptive method with a
             failure rate of less than 1% per year. Men receiving nivolumab and who are sexually
             active with WOCBP will be instructed to adhere to contraception for a period of 7
             months after IORT. Women who are not of childbearing potential, i.e., who are
             postmenopausal or surgically sterile as well as azoospermic men do not require
             contraception.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence of disease progression or distant metastases.

          -  Pregnant or lactating women

          -  Treatment for other invasive carcinomas within the last five years who are at greater
             than 5% risk of recurrence at time of eligibility screening. Carcinoma in-situ and
             basal cell carcinoma/ squamous cell carcinoma of the skin are allowed.

          -  Major surgery, excluding laparoscopy, within 4 weeks of the start of study treatment,
             without complete recovery

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  An active infection requiring systemic therapy

          -  Other serious medical conditions that the investigator feels might compromise study
             participation
