  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare a newly developed filling composite to a current filling composite system. Two
      restorations will be placed in each subject, one using system A and one using system B. The
      first system listed in the randomization pair will be placed on first tooth (#4-#13), and the
      second system on 2nd tooth (#4-#13). The same three researchers will be responsible for
      placement of all the restorations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this (12-month; 36-month; and possible 60-month) randomized controlled clinical
      trial is to evaluate and compare the esthetic outcomes and patient satisfaction of a
      simplified newly developed dental composite system (system A)for the esthetic region to a
      nanohybrid composite system (Filtek Supreme Ultra-system B) placed in class III, IV and V
      lesions. Even though dental composite systems have been used extensively for the anterior
      region, clinicians face challenges with shade selection and longevity of the material over
      the years. This new system has been developed to improve the esthetic outcomes and patient
      satisfaction by enhancing the blending capability of the material.

      Dental composite systems have been used for 50 years as state of art materials to restore the
      anterior region. Significant development has occurred regarding the composition and structure
      of dental composites, improving the longevity of these restorations; however, clinicians are
      faced with the challenge of selecting the most adequate shade and restorative technique to
      reproduce missing tooth structure.

      Depending on the size of the cavity preparation, a single layer of material or multiple
      layers might be needed to reproduce dentin and enamel. Different dental composite systems
      offer multiple body, dentin, and enamel shades. Therefore, clinicians are faced with the
      challenge of recreating nature using this material. Different devices, such as
      spectrophotometers have been introduced on the market for shade selection. However, one of
      the most important aspects when placing anterior composites is the esthetic outcome based on
      the patient's assessment. Therefore, this study will evaluate the esthetic outcomes of a
      simplified and a conventional dental composite system based on the provider's and patient's
      assessment.

The random sequence will be individually placed in opaque, consecutively numbered and sealed envelopes, which should be opened by the operator immediately before the intervention.</masking_description>
