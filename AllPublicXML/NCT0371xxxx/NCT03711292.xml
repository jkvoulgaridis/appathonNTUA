      Stepped wedge behavioral intervention clinical trial looking at the impact of an antibiotic
      stewardship intervention on provider prescribing behavior for acute respiratory infections
      (ARIs), where the intervention is administered at the emergency department or urgent care
      center site level, using a cluster randomization process. Thus, every site and every provider
      are eligible to be exposed to the stewardship intervention, the cluster randomized stepped
      wedge process simply randomizes when they will be exposed. The overall study hypothesis is
      that providers will prescribe fewer unnecessary antibiotics to patients with ARIs after the
      intervention.

  <detailed_description>

      Hypothesis: The primary hypothesis is that acute care ambulatory settings randomized to
      receive behavioral economic stewardship interventions will have decreased antibiotic
      prescribing rates for non-antibiotic appropriate ARIs, compared to contemporaneous antibiotic
      prescribing rates for non-antibiotic appropriate ARIs among control practices. This
      hypothesis will be evaluated in a linear mixed effects model will be used to estimate and
      test the group effect using group and time as fixed effects and practice site and provider as
      random effects. The interaction between time and group will be included to estimate and test
      the different group effect over time.

      Design: The investigators will conduct a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial of acute care
      ambulatory visits to emergency departments and urgent care centers in a predominantly
      non-academic public hospital system. Clustering (by site) helps prevent treatment
      contamination between individual clinicians within the same site. The stepped wedge design
      will allow studying the effects of a complex intervention rolled out through a system over
      time, as often happens in the real-world, where State and Federal public health as well as
      site-based organization quality improvement interventions may be occurring at different
      times.

      Treatment Assignment Procedures: For the 12-month intervention period, in a stepped-wedge
      fashion, sites will be exposed to a site-adapted multifaceted stewardship intervention
      consistent with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) core elements for outpatient
      antimicrobial stewardship: commitment, action, monitoring, reporting and education, and also
      included a behavioral component that used individualized audit and feedback, peer comparison,
      and public commitment, in addition to standard patient and clinician education on antibiotic
      prescribing for antibiotic nonresponsive ARIs.

    <description>The primary outcome measure is the rate of antibiotic prescribing for non-antibiotic-appropriate acute respiratory infections or in other words, acute respiratory infections that are presumed to be viral in nature. The International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 codes for primary outcomes are defined in detail in the clinical trials protocol document. These outcomes are computable clinical quality measures from the electronic health record. These are widely used in medicine to evaluate quality improvement and reliability and validity are generally supported.
Visits are excluded from the primary analysis when: 1) patients have certain medical co-morbidities that make ARI guidelines less likely to apply, 2) patients had concomitant visit diagnoses indicating a non-ARI possible bacterial infection, or 3) patients had concomitant visit diagnoses indicating potentially antibiotic appropriate ARI diagnoses or other ARI diagnoses suggestive of a bacterial infection.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Diagnostic drift</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Throughout the course of the study, the investigators will also be monitoring &quot;diagnostic drift&quot; that may result in provider shifting diagnosis to avoid guideline conflicts that might trigger poor performance reports. An auditing program will measure diagnostic deviation from each clinician's historical rates of diagnosing acute respiratory infections.</description>
