    <textblock>
      The purpose of this is study is to evaluate the long term safety of DCCR (diazoxide choline
      controlled release tablets) in children and adults with Prader-Willi syndrome. After
      completion of 1 year in this study, subjects will have the option to continue treatment for
      up to 2 additional years.

    <measure>Hyperphagia Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Hyperphagia-related behaviors will be assessed by the hyperphagia questionnaire for clinical trials (HQ-CT), an instrument designed to measure symptoms of food related preoccupations and behaviors. The HQ-CT consists of nine items with responses ranging from 0-4 (best to worst). Scores from 9 items will be summed for a possible total score range of 0âˆ’36.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I)</measure>
    <time_frame>at Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>CGI-I is a single statement designed to assess the Investigator's overall perception of change in the subject's condition across the course of the clinical trial. The Investigator provides a response to &quot;Compared to the subject's condition at enrollment, the subject's condition is:&quot; by rating the subject's behavior using a 7-point response scale (best to worst).</description>

    <description>The Caregiver GI-C is a single statement designed to assess the caregiver's overall perception of change in the subject across the course of the clinical trial. The caregiver provides a response to &quot;Please choose the response below that best describes the overall change in the person's PWS since they started taking the study medication&quot; using a 7-point graded response scale (best to worst).</description>
