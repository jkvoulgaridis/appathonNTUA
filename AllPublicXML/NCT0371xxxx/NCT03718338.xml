  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial studies the mechanisms of metabolic and hormone action on plaque formation in
      brain and carotid vessels in participants with prostate adenocarcinoma. Studying the
      biomarkers in the laboratory may help doctors know the impact of androgen deprivation on
      metabolic, brain and cardiovascular endpoints.
