  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brain metastases occurs in up to 50% of patients with EGFR mutant NSCLC. Leptomeningeal
      disease is a subset of patients with brain metastases for which there remains an unmet need.
      This trial aims to evaluate the role of two dosing schedules of afatinib in management of
      leptomeningeal disease in EGFR mutant NSCLC, specifically to determine Central Nervous System
      (CNS) penetration of afatinib, as well as clinical activity. Patients will start on daily
      dosing initially followed by pulsed intermittent dosing should we observe no clinical
      activity. A secondary objective is to identify the resistance spectrum in leptomeningeal
      disease. It is anticipated that optimal dosing schedule of afatinib e.g. pulsed dosing may
      improve CNS disease control.
