      Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study to evaluate the administration of
      CN-105 in patients with supratentorial intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Patients will be
      evaluated for eligibility within 12 hours of symptom onset. Eligible participants (30 active
      participants and 30 control participants) will receive CN-105 or placebo administered
      intravenously (IV) for a 30-minute infusion every 6 hours for up to a maximum of 3 days (13
      doses) or until discharge (if earlier than 3 days). Participants will be monitored daily
      throughout the Treatment phase of the study (up to a maximum of 5 days) and will receive
      standard-of-care treatment for the duration of the study. Additional protocol assessments
      will be required during the Treatment phase as outlined in Section 7.5. After discharge from
      the hospital, participants will enter a 3-month Follow-up phase, with a clinic visit at 30
      days and a follow-up telephone interview with telephone-validated mRS at 90 days after first
      dose of study agent.

      Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study to evaluate the administration of
      CN-105 in patients with supratentorial intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Patients will be
      evaluated for eligibility within 12 hours of symptom onset. Eligible participants (30 active
      participants and 30 control participants) will receive CN-105 or placebo administered
      intravenously (IV) for a 30-minute infusion every 6 hours for up to a maximum of 3 days (13
      doses) or until discharge (if earlier than 3 days). Participants will be monitored daily
      throughout the Treatment phase of the study (up to a maximum of 5 days) and will receive
      standard-of-care treatment for the duration of the study. Additional protocol assessments
      will be required during the Treatment phase as outlined in Section 7.5. After discharge from
      the hospital, participants will enter a 3-month Follow-up phase, with a clinic visit at 30
      days and a follow-up telephone interview with telephone-validated mRS at 90 days after first
      dose of study agent.

      The study is not powered to test any specific hypothesis in regard to safety and will instead
      use descriptive methods to describe the experience of the study cohort with respect to
      adverse and serious adverse events (SAEs), as well as the occurrence of several pre-specified
      events of interest. The secondary objective of this study will be met by comparing the
      modified Rankin score (mRS) at 30 days between participants treated with CN-105 with placebo
      controlled participants The mRS at 30 days will be compared between treated and control
      participants using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Exploratory analyses include comparison of
      treated and control participants for radiographic cerebral edema and hematoma volume and
      expansion and biological markers of inflammation.

      Primary: To assess safety of CN-105 administration in primary ICH.

      Secondary: To evaluate whether the administration of CN-105 improves 30-day mortality and
      functional outcomes by comparing participants treated with CN-105 with placebo controlled
      participants.

      Exploratory:

        -  To investigate feasibility of Day 0, 1, 2, and 5 non-contrast head computed tomography
           (CT) as a radiographic surrogate to evaluate progression of perihematomal edema

        -  To investigate feasibility of using serial biochemical markers of neuroinflammation and
           neuronal injury as a surrogate measure of perihematomal edema and clinical outcome in
           the setting of spontaneous ICH.Primary:

        -  Number and severity of AEs throughout the duration of the study

        -  Number and severity of SAEs throughout the duration of the study

        -  In-hospital, 30-day, and 90-day mortality

        -  Treatment-related mortality

        -  In-hospital neurological deterioration, defined as an increase of National Institutes of
           Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), &gt; 2 from baseline and/or decrease of &gt; 2 of Glasgow Coma
           Scale (GCS), persisting more than 24 hours, and unrelated to sedation

        -  Incidence of cerebritis, meningitis, ventriculitis

        -  Incidence of systemic infection

        -  Incidence of hematoma extension Secondary:.

        -  30- and 90-day mRS

        -  Need for intracranial hypertension management

        -  NIHSS score, Glasgow Coma Scale, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Stroke Impact Scale-16,
           and Barthel Index assessment at hospital discharge and 30 days after ICH

        -  Discharge disposition

      Exploratory:

        -  Day 0, 1, 2, 5 non-contrast head CT as a radiographic surrogate to evaluate progression
           of perihematomal edema

        -  Biochemical surrogates of brain injury, including plasma concentrations of S100B, glial
           fibrillary acidic protein, metalloproteinase-3 and -9, C-reactive protein, D-dimer,
           brain natriuretic peptide, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and vascular
           endothelial growth factor, assessed daily for 5 days after ICH or until discharge
           (concentration time area under the curve assessed for each biomarker)

    <description>The study drug, CN-105, will be administered at 1.0 mg/kg every 6 + 2 hours. The calculated volumes of study agent will be removed from the vials and transferred to 250 mL of normal saline (0.9% sodium chloride injection, USP). The recorded weight at baseline will be used to determine the appropriate amount of CN-105 drug product to administer. Each dose of CN-105 or placebo will be administered as a slow IV bolus over 30 minutes.</description>

             representative (LAR).

          2. Stated willingness to comply with all study procedures and availability for the
             duration of the study.

          3. Is male or female, age 30 to 80 years, inclusive.

          4. Has a confirmed diagnosis of spontaneous supratentorial ICH.

          5. Able to receive first dose of study drug ≤ 12 hours after onset of ICH symptoms, such
             as alteration in level of consciousness, severe headache, nausea, vomiting, seizure,
             and/or focal neurological deficits, or last-known well time.

          6. Has an interpretable and measurable diagnostic CT scan.

          7. Has a GCS score ≥ 5 on presentation (Appendix D)

          8. Has a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score ≥ 4 (Appendix C).

          9. Has systolic BP (SBP) &lt; 200 mm Hg at enrollment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        1Known pregnancy and lactation 2.Has a temperature greater than 38.5°C at Screening. 3.ICH
        known to result from trauma. 4.Evidence of infratentorial hemorrhage (any involvement of
        the midbrain or lower brainstem as demonstrated by radiograph or complete third nerve
        palsy) severely limiting the recovery potential of the patient in the opinion of the
        investigator.

        5.Evidence of primary intraventricular hemorrhage deemed to be at high risk for obstructive
        hydrocephalus, in the opinion of the investigator or evidence of extra-axial (i.e.,
        subarachnoid or subdural) extension of hemorrhage severely limiting the recovery potential
        of the patient in the opinion of the investigator.

        6.Radiographic evidence of underlying tumor. 7.Known unstable mass or active radiographic
        evidence and symptoms of herniation syndromes severely limiting the recovery potential of
        the patient in the opinion of the investigator.

        8.Known ruptured aneurysm, arteriovenous malformation, or vascular anomaly. 9.Has a
        platelet count &lt; 100,000/mL. 10.Has an international normalized ratio (INR) &gt; 1.5 or
        irreversible coagulopathy either due to medical condition or detected before screening.

        11.Is taking new oral anticoagulants (NOACS) or low molecular weight heparin at the time of
        ICH onset 12.In the opinion of the investigator is unstable and would benefit from
        supportive care rather than supportive care plus CN-105.

        13. In the opinion of the investigator has any contraindication to the planned study
        assessments, including CT and MRI.

        14.Any condition which could interfere with, or the treatment for which might interfere
        with, the conduct of the study or which, in the opinion of the investigator, unacceptably
        increases the individual's risk by participating in the study.

        15.Concomitant enrollment in another interventional study.
