  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single arm, multicenter phase 2 study. The study is to evaluate the
      activity of a combination therapy with nal-IRI (PEP02, MM-398, Onivyde®) plus 5-FU and
      leucovorin in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of head &amp; neck and esophagus failed to
      platinum-based treatment in prior chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy. The primary endpoint is
      to assess the objective tumor response rate (ORR). Eligible patients will be enrolled to
      receive combination therapy of nal-IRI plus 5-FU and Leucovorin on day 1, every 2 weeks.
      Every 2 weeks will be counted as one cycle. Treatment will continue until disease
      progression, unacceptable toxicity or other condition meeting the discontinuation criteria.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, multicenter, uncontrolled, open-labeled, and one-arm study. Eligible
      patients will be treated with combination therapy of nal-IRI 80 mg/m2 for 90 minutes,
      leucovorin 400 mg/m2 for 30 minutes and 5-FU 2400 mg/m2 for 46 hours in sequence at day 1,
      every 14 days counted as one cycle. Modification of treatment dose is allowed according to
      the toxicities occurred in the previous treatment cycle. Patients will be treated until
      disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or other condition meeting the treatment
      discontinuation criteria.

      Tumor response will be assessed according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
      version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1) every 6 weeks.

      Adverse events (AEs) will be evaluated according to the National Cancer Institute's Common
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0 (CTCAE v5.0).

      Tumor marker response of SCC antigen will be evaluated by the change of serum SCC antigen
      level every 6 weeks. Tumor marker response is defined as a decrease of SCC antigen after
      treatment in relation to the pretreatment level.

      Patients sign additional consent to participate in the pharmacogenetic and serum biomarker
      evaluation will be required to have extra blood samplings at the study entry and every 6
      weeks thereafter for up to the maximum 4 times.

      A follow-up visit is required approximately 30 days after treatment discontinuation. Overall
      survival status will be followed by clinic visit or by phone every 3 months until death or
      the maximum of 3 years, whichever occurs first.
