  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of conducting a study of oral
      risperidone followed by paliperidone palmitate for once monthly (PP1M) and paliperidone
      palmitate for every 3 months (PP3M) in rwandan healthcare facilities with mental healthcare
      capabilities.

    <measure>Clinician Satisfaction as Assessed by Clinician Satisfaction Rating Scale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 46</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinician Satisfaction Rating is a 4-item scale. Two items use a Likert scale with a six-point range from 0 (definitively not) to 6 (definitely) and two items are multiple-choice (example, &quot;select all that apply&quot;). The scale will be used to assess the acceptability and/or burden for the provider associated with the study including treatment with long-acting injectables (LAIs).</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Who Met Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI)-MINI Screen and Module K Criteria</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 46</time_frame>
    <description>The MINI-Screen is a structured and standardized diagnostic interview used to determine the most common psychiatric disorders according to axis I diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders-fourth edition text revision (DSM-IV-TR) and the international classification of diseases and related health problems (ICD-10). The MINI-screen will be administered to participants for preselection by a qualified psychiatric professional. If this step is passed, then Module K of MINI will be applied by a medical doctor (preferably a psychiatrist) or a psychologist in order to confirm the diagnosis of schizophrenia and to determine if there are other psychiatric conditions present. Number of participants who met MINI criteria will be assessed.</description>

    <description>The ITA-Plus scale is a single Likert scale question with a range of 0 indicates definitely not attending to 6 indicates definitely attending that will be used to estimate the likelihood of completing the study or attending the next visit to provides qualitative feedback on why completion/attendance may not occur. Number of participants intended to complete/attend next visit will be assessed.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 46</time_frame>
    <description>SDS will be used to assess the functioning of participants with schizophrenia. It has participant-reported outcome measure and 5 item questionnaire used for assessment of functional impairment and associated disability. First three items assess disruption of 1 work/school, 2 social life, 3 family life/home responsibilities using a 0 (no impairment) - 10 (most severe impairment). Score for first 3 items are summed to create total score of 0-30 where higher score indicates greater impairment and a negative change in score indicates improvement.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) as a Measure of Safety</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 46</time_frame>
    <description>Safety will be assessed by AEs along with concomitant medications, past medical history, and demographics of participants who will participate in this study. An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant administered a medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product. An adverse event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the medication. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product, whether or not related to that medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product.</description>

It is a 15-item Likert scale covering questions to describe participants condition like if they have kept the body neat and clean, difficulty in completing routine tasks, talked to themselves etc with answers on a point range of 0 (Never) to 5 (All the time). It uses 7-day recall period. Both the participant and caregiver participant will complete this scale.</description>
