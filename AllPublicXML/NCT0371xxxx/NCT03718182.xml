  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are around 115,000 people in the United Kingdom suffering with Crohn's Disease (CD). CD
      can cause inflammation and ulcers to develop anywhere within the gut. Symptoms of the disease
      include diarrhoea, abdominal pain and nutritional problems including vitamin D deficiency.
      Around half of people with CD are likely to have vitamin D deficiency. Research has shown
      that treating vitamin D deficiency in people with CD might help to improve the symptoms of
      the disease. However, there are no clear guidelines on how to detect or treat vitamin D
      deficiency in people with CD.

      There will be two parts to the planned research involving three hospitals in Birmingham. Part
      1 is a vitamin D screening study, where adults will be asked to have a finger-prick blood
      test to check their vitamin D levels. They will complete short diet and lifestyle
      questionnaires. Adults found to have vitamin D deficiency in part 1 may be invited to join
      part 2 of the research. Part 2 is a vitamin D supplementation study where participants will
      be given a daily vitamin D capsule to take by mouth for 6 months. They will be randomly
      allocated to 2 different groups with each group receiving a different dose of vitamin D.
      Participants will have blood tests at the start, after 3 months and after 6 months. They will
      complete quality of life questionnaires at the start and after 6 months. The last appointment
      will be a final follow up appointment after 9 months.

      This research is important to help determine:

        -  Which dose of vitamin D is most effective at treating vitamin D deficiency in people
           with CD

        -  If symptoms of CD improve when vitamin D deficiency is treated.

    <intervention_model_description>D-CODE is a two part trial entailing two vitamin D screening studies (winter and summer) and an interventional feasibility study.
The vitamin D screening studies will take place during the winter and summer months to determine the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in patients with CD throughout the seasons.
In the intervention/feasibility stage D-CODE is an exploratory study for an open label, multi-site, superiority randomised controlled trial. Participants will be randomised to one of two parallel arms (A or B)</intervention_model_description>
