  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rugby players are often exposed to destabilisation of the upper cervical spine.This kind of
      trauma may lead to dramatic injuries, due to lesion of spinal cord.

      CerviStab© is a device which evaluate the bio-mechanical and neuromuscular behavior of the
      upper cervical spine in rugby situation.

      The aim of this study, is to evaluate the dynamic stabilization of the upper cervical spine
      in reaction to unexpected impact.
