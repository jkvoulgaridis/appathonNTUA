      Participants with gastrointestinal stromal tumors(GIST) were divided into favorable and
      unfavorable sites according to the anatomical site of the tumor, and this study aims to
      validate the overall postoperative morbidity and mortality rates between favorable site
      receiving laparoscopic resection of GIST and that of unfavorable site under the currently
      standard surgical therapy.

    <description>Definition of recurrence and recurrence date The following situations are regarded as &quot;recurrence&quot;
Recurrence identified by any one image examination (X-ray, ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, etc.) and, if there are a variety of imaging examinations, results without contradiction determined &quot;recurrence&quot;. The earliest date that the recurrence is found is defined as the &quot;recurrence date&quot;.
For cases that lack the use of imaging or a pathological diagnosis, the date of diagnosing the occurrence of clinical recurrence based on clinical history and physical examination is defined as the &quot;recurrence date&quot;.
For cases without imaging or clinical diagnosis but with a cytology or tissue biopsy pathological diagnosis of recurrence, the earliest date confirmed by cytology or biopsy pathology is considered the &quot;recurrence date&quot;.
A rise in carcinoembryonic antigen or other associated tumor markers alone could not be diagnosed as a relapse.</description>

Incidence of postoperative major complications: The standard for postoperative major complications refers to the short-term complications according to the Clavien-dindo grade, IIIA level and above for serious complications, and when multiple complications occur simultaneously, the highest ranked complication is the subject.
. Postoperative complications are divided into short-term complications after surgery and long-term complications after surgery. (3)Short-term is defined as within 30 days of surgery or the first discharge if the hospital stay is &gt; 30 days.
(4)Long-term is defined as the period from 30 days or more after the operation or the period between first discharge (the hospital days after surgery &gt;30 days) and 3 years after the operation.</description>

Short-term is defined as within 30 days of surgery or the first discharge if the hospital stay is &gt; 30 days.
Long-term is defined as the period from 30 days or more after the operation or the period between first discharge (the hospital days after surgery &gt;30 days) and 3 years after the operation.
Postoperative mortality: patients whose death was identified according to documented intraoperative observation items, including patients who die within 30 days after surgery (including the 30th day) regardless of the causality between death and surgery, and patients who die more than 30 days after surgery.</description>
