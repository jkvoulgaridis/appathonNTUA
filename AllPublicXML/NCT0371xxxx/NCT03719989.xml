    <textblock>
      This phase II clinical trial aims at evaluating the efficacy and safety of azacitidine
      followed by rituximab-GDP immunochemotherapy in patients with relapsed/refractory diffuse
      large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Patients who were treated with from 1 to 4 lines of prior
      therapies for relapsed/refractory DLBCL wee eligible. azacitidine will be treated one week
      prior to conventional rituximab-gemcitabine, dexamethasone, cisplatin (R-GDP)
      immunochemotherapy. Patients will be treated every 21 days as one cycle, and up to 6 cycles.
      The primary endpoint of this study is objective response rate according to the Lugano
      response criteria for non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and secondary endpoints are safety, complete
      response, progression-free survival, and overall survival.

      This phase II clinical trial aims at evaluating the efficacy and safety of azacitidine
      followed by rituximab-GDP immunochemotherapy in patients with relapsed/refractory diffuse
      large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). This study is designed with the expectation of correction of
      aberrant hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes by preceding use of low dose azacitidine
      thereby re-sensitizing chemosensitivity of tumor cells. Patients who were treated with from 1
      to 4 lines of prior therapies for relapsed/refractory DLBCL wee eligible. Planned initial
      doses of the current regimen are as follows;

      azacitidine S.C 25 mg/m2 D1,2,3,4,5 rituximab I.V. 375 mg/m2 D8 gemcitabine I.V. 1,000 mg/m2,
      D8,15 dexamethasone I.V. or P.O. 40 mg D8,9,10,11 cisplatin 70 mg/m2 I.V. D8

      Patients will be treated every 21 days as one cycle, and up to 6 cycles of treatment will be
      conducted. Especially, first 3~6 patients will be regarded as 'lead-in safety cohort' and
      their safety will be reviewed by an independent data and safety monitoring board (DSMB). The
      primary endpoint of this study is objective response rate according to the Lugano response
      criteria for non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and secondary endpoints are safety, complete response,
      progression-free survival, and overall survival.
