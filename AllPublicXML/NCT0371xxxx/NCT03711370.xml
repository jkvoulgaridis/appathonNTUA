  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the proposed research is to conduct an intervention study that will assess
      the effect of feeding mode (clear versus opaque bottle) on the quality and outcome of infant
      feeding interactions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of the proposed pilot/feasibility study is to evaluate a home- and
      family-based intervention to increase formula-feeding mothers' responsiveness to infant
      satiety cues and moderate formula-feeding infants' rates of weight gain over a 12-week
      period. Specifically, the investigators propose to provide mothers with opaque, weighted
      bottles (instead of conventional, clear bottles) with which to feed their infants; based on
      preliminary studies, it is hypothesized that removal of mothers' abilities to assess the
      amount the infant consumes during a feeding will facilitate abilities to feed in response to
      infant satiation cues.

      For the proposed research, exclusively formula-feeding mothers with &lt;8-week-old infants will
      be randomized to use weighted, opaque bottles (intervention or opaque group) or to use clear
      bottles (control or clear group). The investigators will conduct home-based assessments at
      the beginning and end of the 12-week study period during which mothers will be video-recorded
      feeding their infants using clear or opaque bottles. Two interim assessments will be
      conducted (after 2 and 6 weeks) to assess feeding adequacy and fidelity to the intervention.
      During feeding observations, infant intake will be assessed via bottle weight. Video-records
      will be later coded for maternal responsiveness to infant cues using the Nursing Child
      Assessment Parent-Child Interaction Feeding Scale (NCAFS). It is hypothesized that mothers in
      the opaque group will feed their infants less and show greater increases in their levels of
      responsiveness to infant cues compared to mothers in the clear group. Infants' weight and
      length will be measured at the beginning and end of the 12-week study; weight-for-length
      z-scores (WLZ) will be calculated using the WHO Growth Standards. It is hypothesized that WLZ
      change will be significantly lower for infants in the opaque compared to the clear group. The
      feasibility of the intervention will also be explored by collecting and analyzing objective
      and subjective data related to the extent to which mothers use and like the bottles, and
      whether characteristics of mothers or infants moderate intervention effects. The proposed
      feasibility study is a critical step toward understanding mothers' acceptance and use of
      opaque bottles compared to conventional, clear bottles, and the potential for opaque bottles
      to improve the outcome of feeding interactions in home-based settings.

    <intervention_model_description>All participants will be randomly assigned to either the opaque bottle group or the clear bottle group. Mothers will be asked to use their assigned bottle type to feed their infant for a full 12-week period. A pre-test will be given before the 12-week period as well as a post-test after the 12-week period. During these tests, we will observe each mother using the clear bottle to feed her infant on one visit and the opaque bottle on another visit. The order of these conditions will be randomized and counterbalanced.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>12-week period</time_frame>
    <description>For both opaque and clear bottle-feedings, infant intake will be assessed by weighing the infant's bottle before and after each feeding observation using a top-loading balance (SP601 Scout Pro Portable Balance, Ohaus, New Jersey, USA). The type of nipple used will be noted and the nipple flow rate will be controlled for in all analyses.</description>

    <measure>Maternal sensitivity to infant cues</measure>
    <time_frame>12-week period</time_frame>
    <description>Mother and infant behavior during each feeding will be coded using the Nursing Child Assessment Parent-Child Interaction - Feeding Scale (NCAFS). This scale contains six subscales, four of which describe maternal attributes (Sensitivity to Cues, Response to Child's Distress, Social-Emotional Growth Fostering, and Cognitive Growth Fostering) and two of which describe infant attributes (Clarity of Cues and Responsiveness to Caregiver). The proposed analysis will focus on the Sensitivity to Cues subscale, which measures the degree to which the mother is able to understand and respond to her child's cues. This scale provides a global measure of how sensitive the mother is to the infant's needs during the feeding interaction. Possible score range is 0-16, which is derived from summing together maternal scores for each of the 16 subscale items. Higher scores indicate greater sensitivity to infant cues.</description>

    <measure>Infant weight-for-length change trajectories</measure>

    <description>Infants' weight and length will be assessed during home-based assessments by trained research assistants. Infant weight and height will be measured in triplicate using a portable infant scale/infantometer (models 334 and 233; Seca, Hamburg, Germany). To minimize bias, infants will always be weighed and measured while only wearing a clean diaper and prior to the observed feeding. The World Health Organization (WHO) Anthro software version 3.0.1 (http://www.who.int/childgrowth/en/) will be used to calculate age- and sex-specific weight-for-length z-scores (WLZ) based on the WHO growth standards.</description>

A study-specific Harpenden caliper will be used for all measurements and skinfold thickness will be determined for four locations: iliac crest, triceps, subscapular, and thigh.</description>
