  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of this study is to determine whether Serratus Anterior Plane (SAP) blockade
      provides improved pain relief after rib fractures compared to epidural administration of
      local anaesthetic. The investigators aim to show that SAP catheters (SAPC) can be placed in
      more situations and are less operator-dependent then thoracic epidural anaesthesia (TEA).
      This reduces the waiting time required to achieve satisfactory analgesia in the patient.
      Optimal analgesia allows early respiratory physiotherapy and reduction in the complications
      of multiple rib fractures.

      Pain from rib fractures is severe. The sensory nerves of the thoracic wall lie in the SAP and
      a single ultrasound-guided injection of local anaesthetic spreads widely and provides useful
      post-injury analgesia for several hours. If a catheter is left in the SAP, the nerve blockade
      can be maintained for several days.

      Rib Fracture pain is traditionally treated with oral/ intravenous analgesics or TEA. Opiate
      analgesia via patient controlled analgesia (PCA) can work very well but it is associated with
      excessive sedation, constipation, nausea and vomiting. Continuous TEA is generally regarded
      as the gold standard but it demands monitoring by adequately trained ward staff and is
      commonly associated with high failure rates and increased risk of complications. SAPC has
      also been used when TEA and PCA were not desirable.

      The primary outcome will be the amount of morphine analgesia required by the patient.
      Secondary outcomes will be pain scores (at rest and on movement), the side effects of
      morphine, complications of TEA/ SAPC, respiratory function changes and a quality of recovery
      assessment.

      The control group will have an epidural block and catheter placed. The treatment group will
      have SAP blocks and catheters placed under ultrasound guidance. Both blocks will be tested to
      ensure good pain relief. To avoid potential confounding effects, oral painkillers will adhere
      strictly to the study protocol.

    <measure>intravenous morphine use via a patient controlled pump</measure>
    <time_frame>72 hours</time_frame>
    <description>This will be measured as the total amount (in milligrams) of intravenous morphine used via a patient controlled pump in 72 hours.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>static and dynamic pain scores measurements</measure>
    <time_frame>72 hours</time_frame>
    <description>This will be measured using a visual analogue scale from 0(no pain) to 10(unbearable pain). The measurement will be done whilst the patient is at rest and again on movement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>side effects/ complications of interventions</measure>
    <time_frame>72 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The side effects and complications of either a thoracic epidural or serratus anterior plane block will be recorded. This includes failure to establish the block and/or catheter, decreased blood pressure, neurological sequelae, nausea and vomiting and itching.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>spirometry</measure>
    <time_frame>72 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Spirometry will be undertaken at the bedside and the tidal volumes will be recorded 3 times and the average taken of the 3 measurements.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>quality of recovery assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>72 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The quality of recovery (QoR) will be assessed using the QoR40. The QoR-40 is a 40-item questionnaire that provides a global score and subscores across five dimensions: patient support, comfort, emotions, physical independence, and pain.</description>
