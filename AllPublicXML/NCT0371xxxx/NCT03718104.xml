  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center prospective comparative cohort study examining the safety, efficacy,
      pharmacokinetics, and pharmacogenomics of naltrexone for pregnant women with opioid use
      disorder. Pregnancy, delivery, and maternal and infant outcomes to 12 months post-delivery
      will be examined and compared with a cohort treated with buprenorphine/naloxone.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fifty pregnant women stabilized pre-pregnancy on oral or extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX)
      and 50 comparison women on buprenorphine/naloxone (BPH) from Boston Medical Center and the
      University of North Carolina will be enrolled in this multi-center prospective comparative
      cohort study. The specific aims of this project are: 1) Safety and Efficacy: To compare
      maternal outcomes (safety, relapse, retention in care), fetal outcomes (growth, fetal
      distress), and infant outcomes (neonatal abstinence syndrome, growth, neurodevelopment)
      during pregnancy until 12 months post- delivery; An exploratory part of this aim is to
      collect safety and efficacy data on women receiving NTX for alcohol use disorder (AUD). We
      will collect maternal, fetal and infant outcomes related to prenatal alcohol exposure. 2)
      Pharmacokinetics: To determine the pharmacokinetics of NTX in pregnant and postpartum women;
      3) Genetics and Epigenetics: To examine the association between genetic variants and
      epigenetic modification in the mu-opioid receptor (OPRM1) gene, as well as global DNA
      methylation changes after treatment with NTX and BPH within the mother, placenta, and infant;
      and 4) Breast milk: To measure breast milk concentrations of NTX and corresponding infant
      relative dose to determine safety for lactating women.

    <description>The biophysical profile uses electronic fetal heart rate monitoring to examine the fetus. There are five components measured during the biophysical examination (fetal breathing movements, gross body movement, fetal tone, amninotic fluid volume and whether the NST is reactive or nonreactive. A score of 2 points is given for each component The points are then added for a possible maximum score of 10. The test is continued until all criteria are met or 30 minutes have elapsed. HIgher scores are more favorable.</description>

    <measure>Diagnosis of Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From birth to 30 days</time_frame>
    <description>NAS diagnosis will be based on opioid withdrawal signs and symptoms in the infant after delivery as assessed by NAS withdrawal scores (either the Finnegan score or the via the ESC (Eat, Sleep, Console) assessment tool. The Finnegan scale assesses 21 of the most common signs of neonatal drug withdrawal syndrome and is scored on the basis of pathological significance and severity of the adverse symptoms, which sometimes requires pharmacological treatment. Measurements are performed every 4 hours, typically with 2-3 consecutive scores that are equal to or greater than 8, or 1-2 scores of 12 or greater, pharmacologic treatment for withdrawal is started. For the ESC assessment, clinicians assess whether or not the infant has poor feeding, is unable to sleep for at least 1 hour after feeding, and is consolable (rating of 1-3) due to symptoms of opioid withdrawal. Poor feeding, sleeping, or consolability triggers a huddle and possible start of pharmacologic treatment.</description>
