  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with metabolic syndrome are known to possess chronic low-level inflammation.
      Furthermore, such individuals are at risk of developing atherosclerosis in coronary and other
      vascular beds. In particular, subjects with metabolic syndrome, prediabetes and type II
      diabetes mellitus were shown to possess vascular inflammation in carotid atherosclerosis as
      demonstrated using FDG-PET. In the current pilot proposal, the investigators wish to study
      the impact of 3-month probiotic supplementation on vascular and systemic inflammation in
      subjects with metabolic syndrome in the context of a randomized, placebo-controlled, pilot
      trial.

             depending on the recently published ethnic-based variations (14), triglycerides &gt; 1.70
             mmol/l, decreased HDL-cholesterol (&lt; 1.0 mmol/l in men and &lt; 1.3 mmol/l in women),
