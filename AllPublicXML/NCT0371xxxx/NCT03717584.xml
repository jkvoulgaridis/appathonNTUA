  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Premature infants are at risk for a variety of diseases, the investigators would like to
      learn more about why some premature babies are at higher risk and some are protected from
      these diseases.

      Scientists at UC Davis and other universities have developed new ways to measure the bacteria
      and a large number of small molecules in specimens of infant blood, urine, stomach fluid and
      poop and in mother's milk. These discoveries allow us to consider questions that were
      impossible to answer before these new techniques were developed. One such question is whether
      the bacteria in the poop of a premature baby can help us predict the baby's risk for
      developing infection or a common and serious disease of premature infants called necrotizing
      enterocolitis. A second question is whether the DNA of a premature baby (obtained from saliva
      with a q-tip) can predict higher risk for diseases of premature babies.

      Samples from eligible infants will be collected and stored for future comparisons. These
      samples include stool specimens from a messy diaper twice weekly, urine samples from cotton
      balls in the diaper once weekly, a small sample of stomach fluid once a week just prior to a
      feeding obtained through the feeding tube, a sample of mom's milk once a week, left-over
      blood from lab draws, and a sample of saliva on one occasion.

      The analysis of key specimens from this cohort will allow us to study the impact of the
      bacteria in the intestines on outcomes like growth and common diseases of premature infants.
