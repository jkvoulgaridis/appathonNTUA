    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter single arm phase II clinical trial. All eligible patients will receive:

      Carboplatin (AUC 5) i.v. day 1 plus pemetrexed (500 mg/m2) i.v. day 1 plus atezolizumab 1200
      mg i.v. day 1 plus bevacizumab 15 mg/kg i.v. day 1 every 3 weeks for up to 4 cycles.

      Patients with non-PD after 4 cycles will be permitted to continue with maintenance therapy
      with pemetrexed plus atezolizumab plus bevacizumab every 3 weeks until the time of disease
      progression or intolerable toxicities.

    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this study is that the addition of Atezolizumab (an anti-PD-L1 antibody),
      to the combination of Carboplatin plus Pemetrexed plus Bevacizumab, a vascular endothelial
      growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor, for the treatment of patients with stage IV non-squamous,
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) will improve progression free survival (PFS) compared with
      a historical control of carboplatin plus pemetrexed plus bevacizumab.

          -  For women of childbearing potential: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from
             heterosexual intercourse) or use two non-hormonal methods of contraception, including
             at least one method with a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year, during the treatment period

                  is chosen contraception method.

               -  A barrier method may be used as the second contraceptive method. The reliability
                  of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the
                  clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic
                  abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods)
                  and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.

          -  Contraception method must begin starting from the time of informed consent until 120
             days after treatment discontinuation.

          -  For men: Agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use
             a condom, and agreement to refrain from donating sperm, as defined below:

          -  With female partners of childbearing potential or pregnant female partners, men must
             remain abstinent or use a condom during the treatment period and for 120 days after
             the last dose of study treatment to avoid exposing the embryo. Men must refrain from
             donating sperm during this same period.

          -  The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration
             of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic
             abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and
             withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.

          -  As determined by the enrolling physician or protocol designee, ability of the subject
             to understand and comply with study procedures for the entire length of the study

             presence of hepatitis B core antibody [HBcAb] and absence of HBsAg), the patient is
             only eligible if they are negative for HBV DNA.

          -  Active tuberculosis

          -  Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the subject's
             participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating Investigator.

             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

          -  Has known interstitial lung disease or history of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis,
             organizing pneumonia (e.g., bronchiolitis obliterans), drug-induced pneumonitis, or
             idiopathic pneumonitis, or evidence of active pneumonitis on screening chest computed
             tomography (CT) scan; history of radiation pneumonitis in the radiation field
             (fibrosis) is permitted. Lymphangitic spread of the NSCLC is not exclusionary.
