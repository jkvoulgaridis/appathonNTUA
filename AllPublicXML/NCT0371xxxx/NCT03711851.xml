  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain has a significant impact on the physical and emotional functioning of those
      living with this condition. It is now recognized that Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)
      is an effective treatment in managing chronic pain; however, several barriers limit its
      accessibility. Therefore, self-help versions of ACT are promising because they offer a
      cost-effective treatment option that usually require little support from a therapist, and can
      be widely accessed.

      The current study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of predominantly self-help ACT
      interventions (web-based and bibliotherapy programs) in comparison to an education
      intervention among adults living with chronic pain.

      The current study was a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with two experimental groups and an
      active control group. The first experimental group received access to an internet platform
      with videos, interactive content and exercises based on ACT. The second experimental group
      received a copy of a self-help book based on ACT for chronic pain and had access to this
      book's website which includes audio mindfulness exercises. The third group consisted of an
      active control group, in which participants received pamphlet style pdf documents of
      education for pain (without any ACT components) as well as related practical exercises.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a web-based ACT intervention program with
      minimal therapeutic contact, compared to an ACT-based bibliotherapy and a pain education
      program (active control group) among adults with chronic pain. Participants were randomly
      assigned to each group. We hypothesized that:

        1. both ACT interventions would lead to significant reductions in pain-related disability
           (primary variable), greater than the control group (education), and that the web-based
           program would lead to greater reductions in disability than the bibliotherapy group;

        2. both ACT interventions would lead to significant improvements in quality of life
           (secondary variable), greater than the control group (education), and that the web-based
           program would lead to greater improvements in quality of life than the bibliotherapy
           group;

        3. both ACT interventions would lead to significant reductions in anxiety and depressive
           symptoms (secondary variables), greater than the control group (education), and that the
           web-based program would lead to greater reductions in anxiety and depressive symptoms
           than the bibliotherapy group;

        4. Improvements on primary (pain-related disability) and secondary variables (quality of
           life, anxiety/depressive symptoms) for the ACT groups will be maintained at 3 and 6
           months and will remain superior to the control group (education);

        5. Participants from both ACT groups would have a positive impressions of change following
           the intervention (as measured by the PGIC scale).

             -  Some of the questionnaires described in the following section were administered and
                will be subject to subsequent analyses examining patient trajectories of change and
                profiles of patients who respond well or not to these treatment modalities.

    <description>The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) evaluates the severity and interference of pain in daily activities (Cleeland &amp; Ryan, 1994; Tyler et al., 2002; French version: Poundja et al., 2007). The instrument consists of 10 items rated on a Likert scale ranging from 0 = does not interfere to 10 = interferes completely, and participants are asked to rate the degree to which pain interfered with various activities in the past week (e.g., social activities, work, mood, etc.). Higher scores represent higher levels of pain interference. This questionnaire has shown good reliability across a variety of populations (e.g. French speaking fibromyalgia patients; Bourgault et al., 2015). The BPI is extensively used in chronic pain research, has strong psychometric properties and is recommended as an outcome in clinical trials of patients with chronic pain (Dworkin et al., 2005). The French version has shown to have good internal consistency (Poundja et al., 2007).</description>

    <description>The Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS; Zigmond &amp; Snaith, 1983; French version: Bocéréan &amp; Dupret, 2014) is a 14-item questionnaire which evaluates psychological distress according to two 7-item subscales measuring anxiety and depressive symptoms in non-psychiatric hospital contexts. Items are scored on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 0 to 3. An example of items is &quot;I feel tense or wound up&quot;. A higher score reflects a higher level of anxiety or depression.</description>

    <description>The World Health Organization Quality of Life-Brief (WHOQOL-BRIEF; WHOQOL; Group, 1998) is a self-reported measure of 26 items assessing quality of life in terms of physical and psychological health, social relationships and social functioning. Items are rated from 1 = very poor to 5 = very good, with higher scores reflect higher quality of life. This instrument has demonstrated good levels of internal consistency for its subscales (α = .66 to α = .80) and adequate test-retest reliability (r = .75). The French version of the instrument offers high internal consistency (Baumann, Erpelding, Régat, Collin, &amp; Briançon, 2010).</description>

    <description>The Multidimensional Psychological Flexibility Inventory (MPFI; Rolffs, Rogge &amp; Wilson, 2016) is a 24 item scale that measures psychological flexibility and inflexibility processes. Items are rated on a six-point Likert scale ranging from 1 = never true to 6 = always true. This tool provides 12 distinct dimensions of flexibility or psychological influence.</description>

    <description>The Chronic Pain Acceptance Questionnaire (CPAQ-8; Fish et al., 2010; Scott et al., 2013 ) is an 8-item version of the Chronic Pain Acceptance Questionnaire (McCracken et al., 2004). This measure is comprised of two subscales: activity engagement and pain willingness. Specific items include, &quot;I am getting on with the business of living no matter what my level of pain is&quot; and &quot;Keeping my pain level under control takes first priority whenever I am doing something&quot;. Items are scored on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 0 = never true to 6 = always true. Scores for the pain willingness subscale are reversed before calculating a total score so that higher total scores reflect greater levels of pain acceptance. The CPAQ has been used frequently in research and the short version has good psychometric properties (Fish et al., 2010).</description>

    <description>The French-Canadian Chronic Pain Self-Efficacy Scale (Lacasse et al., 2015; Lorig et al., 1996) is a 6-item scale that measures an individual's confidence in his/her ability to manage chronic pain in general and pain-related symptoms. Items are rated on a 10-point Likert scale ranging from 1 = not at all confident to 10 = entirely confident. A higher score reflects greater chronic pain self-efficacy. This scale has good psychometric properties (Lacasse et al., 2015).</description>

    <description>The Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC; Guy, 1976) is a 5-item tool evaluates the level of change perceived by the participant regarding his/her pain, physical functioning, quality of life and psychological well-being over the last three months.25 The statements are evaluated according to a 7-point Likert scale (e.g.: &quot;Over the last 3 months, your functioning 0) has deteriorated considerably; 3) has remain unchanged or 6) has improved considerably&quot;). A fifth item evaluates pain relief over the last 3 months and is measured according to an ordinal scale ranging from 0 (no relief) to 100 (total relief). Although it is widely used in clinical trials on CP, the validity of this scale has not been officially evaluated (Ferguson &amp; Scheman, 2009) but its use is indicated by the IMMPACT expert group.</description>

    <time_frame>Weekly changes from baseline (week 0), throughout treatment (Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), and after treatment (week 10)</time_frame>
    <description>In addition to pretreatment, posttreatment, and three and six-month follow-up assessments, participants were asked to answer 7 items assessing the three main axis of the ACT psychological flexibility model (&quot;open&quot;, &quot;aware&quot; and &quot;active&quot;; Hayes et al., 2011) as well as four outcome variables (pain-related disability, anxiety, depression, and quality of life). The three items assessing ACT processes have been used in previous research (Scott et al., 2017) and were translated in French and slightly modified for the present study. More specifically, the original English version of items refers to the last three days, whereas we modified the questions to refer to the past seven days since measures were intended to be completed weekly. All items were rated on a Likert scale ranging from 0 (Never) to 6 (Always).</description>
