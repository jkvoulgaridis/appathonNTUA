      This study evaluates if imaginal exposure therapy can decrease symptoms of eating disorders
      and anxiety, and test an online format of IE to maximize its ability to reach as many
      individuals with eating disorders as possible. All participants will complete four imaginal
      exposure sessions and will complete questionnaires prior to receiving this treatment, as well
      as complete follow up questionnaires at 1-month, 6-month, and 12-month.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eating disorders (EDs) are tenacious mental disorders that are difficult to treat. EDs are
      often accompanied by anxiety disorders, which exacerbate the problem. Better ED treatments
      are imperative, and it is likely that targeting comorbid conditions, such as anxiety, will
      facilitate ED treatments.

      Imaginal exposure is used in anxiety disorders to face fears that are not accessible or
      practical to address via in-vivo exposures. For example, a patient with PTSD cannot
      re-experience her trauma in real life, but she can imagine the past trauma and experience the
      subsequent anxiety. For patients with AN, catastrophic outcomes such as abandonment or
      immediate fatness are similarly impossible to recreate as in-vivo exposures. Patients cannot
      become fat solely for the purpose of the exposure, but they can imagine what it would be like
      to become fat. The investigators are unaware of any literature using imaginal exposure
      therapy to induce fears of fatness and conducted a case study to test whether imaginal
      exposure could, firstly, induce fears of fatness and then promote reduction in anxiety and
      eating disorder symptoms. In this case study, the investigators found that imaginal exposure
      therapy was effective at reducing anxiety and eating disorder behaviors. Imaginal exposure
      therapy (IE) has been shown to be an extremely effective treatment for Post-Traumatic Stress
      Disorder. IE has also been shown to be effective for the treatment of eating disorders using
      case studies. However, IE has not been systematically applied to the eating disorders. The
      purpose of this study is to test if 1) imaginal exposure therapy can decrease symptoms of
      eating disorders and anxiety, and 2) test an online format of IE to maximize its ability to
      reach as many individuals with eating disorders as possible.
