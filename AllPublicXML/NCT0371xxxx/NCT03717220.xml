    <textblock>
      Reconstruction of soft-tissue defects in multiple digits poses a significant challenge. This
      article reports simultaneous reconstruction of multiple small-to-moderate soft-tissue defects
      using regional dorsal digital island flaps and evaluated the efficacy of their application in
      such complex situation. A retrospective study will be conducted with 26 patients who had
      multiple-digit soft-tissue defects treated with regional dorsal digital island flaps. At the
      final follow-up, we will evaluate the efficacy of their application in such complex
      situation.

      For the recipient where sensory restoration is important, sensation of the flaps is assessed
      using static two-point discrimination (2PD) and Semmes-Weinstein monofilament (SWM) testing
      at final follow-up. The cold intolerance of the injured finger is measured using the
      self-administered Cold Intolerance Severity Score questionnaire that was rated into mild,
      moderate, severe, and extreme (0-25, 26-50, 51-75 and 76-100). The pain of the injured finger
      is given subjectively by the patient using a grading system that included grade 1, none;
      grade 2, mild, no interference with daily activities; grade 3, moderate, patient works but
      has some limitation in use of the hand because of pain; and grade 4, severe, cannot work or
      use hand. To sum up, patients report their satisfaction with functional recovery of the
      injured finger according to the Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire that was based on a
      5-point response scale.
