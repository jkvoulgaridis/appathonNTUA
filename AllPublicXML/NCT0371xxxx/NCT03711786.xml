  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct an implementation science research study that will compare two
      different implementation strategies to facilitate ongoing Ministry of Health efforts to scale
      up depression treatment within non-communicable diseases clinics, as well as assessing
      clinic-related factors that will influence uptake.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This implementation science research study will integrate depression treatment into 10
      non-communicable diseases (NCD) clinics in Malawi. Clinics will be randomized 1:1 to one of
      two implementation strategies: a basic strategy involving an internal coordinator, and an
      enhanced strategy combining the internal coordinator with an external quality assurance
      monitoring and supervision team. From each clinic, 116 patients with elevated depressive
      symptoms (defined as a Patient Health Questionnaire score &gt;= 5) will be enrolled into an
      observational cohort, for a total sample of 1,160 patients over a two-year period; follow-up
      will extend an additional 12 months. The investigators will assess key implementation and
      effectiveness outcomes comparing the two implementation strategies. The investigators will
      also assess clinic characteristics that may influence uptake and fidelity.

    <description>Fidelity in depression treatment initiation. Confirmed depression is defined as having a PHQ-9 total score of 5 or above and having a final determination from the treating clinician that the patient is appropriate for depression treatment.</description>

    <time_frame>Three months post enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Depressive severity is determined using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). The PHQ-9 is a self-reported questionnaire measuring depressive symptoms.This is a nine item measure with a response score for each item on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). Thus, the total score ranges from 0 to 27; with 0-4 being minimum indicating no depressive symptoms, 5-9 mild depression, 10-14 moderate depression, 15-19 moderately severe depression, 20-27 severe depression. Depression remission is defined as a score &lt;5.</description>

    <measure>Probability that each NCD patient's NCD is well controlled at 3 months.</measure>
    <time_frame>Three months post enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Hypertension is measured by research assistants at each study visit while fasting blood glucose is measured as part of routine clinical care and will be abstracted. Well-controlled NCD will be defined for hypertension patients as systolic blood pressure &lt;140 mmHg AND diastolic blood pressure &lt;90 mmHg, and for diabetes patients as fasting blood glucose &lt;130 mg/dl, following the Malawi Clinical Guidelines for the Management of NCDs.</description>

    <description>The basic implementation package will involve identifying an internal coordinator who is one of the full-time on-site providers at the clinic. The internal coordinator provides mentoring to peers and support to leadership in implementing the treatment program and aligning it with clinic priorities.</description>

    <description>The enhanced implementation package will combine the internal coordinator with an external quality assurance committee. This committee will complete quarterly audits at the facility to evaluate compliance with the depression treatment protocol as well as providing high-level support in implementing the treatment program through clinical expertise and limited on-site presence.</description>
