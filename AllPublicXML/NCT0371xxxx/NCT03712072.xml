  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of this study is to identify abnormal functional and anatomical brain
      reorganization associated with hand, foot, and shoulder function in children (0-18 years old)
      with cerebral palsy (CP) due to periventricular white matter injury (PV-WMI) or brachial
      plexus birth palsy (BPBP) using a multi-modal neuroimaging approach.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-interventional study designed to assess changes in the sensorimotor cortex of
      children with CP as a result of PV-WMI and children with BPBP that combines multiple
      neuroimaging techniques to better visualize the resulting brain reorganization. The study
      design will be a mixed 3 (group: CP, BPBP, TD) x 2 (hemisphere: more affected, less affected)
      analysis of variance (ANOVA), with group being a between-subject factor and hemisphere a
      within-subjects factor.

      The research study plans to recruit and test 30 children with CP due to PV-WMI, 30 children
      with BPBP, and 30 aged-matched and typically developing (TD) children aged from 0 to 18 years
      old.

      Data from the participants will be collected over the course of four visits: (i) the
      recording session for the MEG, (ii) the recording session for the EEG, (iii) the MRI scanning
      session, and (iv) the TMS session. TD, CP, and BPBP subjects will be asked to commit to these
      visits.

      The MEG session will last ~3 hours with the actual measurements lasting ~60 minutes, the EEG
      session will last ~2 hours with the actual measurements lasting ~60 minutes, the MRI visit
      will last ~1 hour with the actual acquisition scan timing lasting ~30 minutes, and the TMS
      visit will last ~1 and a half hours with the actual acquisition time lasting ~45 minutes.
      Depending on the participant, the behavioral tests may be administered during any of the
      visits that the child is most comfortable and able to perform them.

    <description>The purpose of the device is to measure magnetic fields produced by an individual's brain and provide information on the location of the source of the fields. Participants between the ages of 0-3 years of old whose head can fit in the MEG helmet will be the patient population used for the BabyMEG. The device will be used in this study to learn more about the somatosensory and motor networks of children who have cerebral palsy and compare their brain signals to healthy children.</description>

    <description>The device will be used for motor mapping. Motor threshold is operationally defined as minimum machine output necessary to elicit a response from the abductor pollicis brevis right (APB), contralateral to the stimulated hemisphere, of 50 microvolts, on &gt;50% of trials. Upper limb motor mapping is conducted at 110% abductor pollicis brevis motor threshold in each hemisphere, or at 100% machine output (MO). Lower limb motor mapping is conducted at a fixed machine output corresponding to the magnitude sufficient to elicit reliable tibialis anterior (TA) motor evoked potentials (MEPs). Single pulse TMS is performed while motor evoked potentials are recorded bilaterally from the APB, deltoid, and TA using surface electromyography (EMG).</description>
