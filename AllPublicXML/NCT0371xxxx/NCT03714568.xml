    <description>Tmax was defined as the time required to reach maximum observed plasma concentration. The plasma samples were analyzed for TQ-A3326 using a validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric assay.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Plasma Half-life (T-half)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-dose, 0.25hour, 0.5hour, 1hour, 1.5hour, 2hour, 3hour, 4hour, 6hour, 8hour, 12hour, 24hour, 48hour, 72hour, 96hour, 120hour post-dosing on Day 1.</time_frame>
    <description>Plasma half-life was defined as the time required for one half of the total amount of administered drug eliminated from the body. The plasma samples were analyzed for TQ-A3326 using a validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric assay.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Apparent Total Body Clearance (CLT/F)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-dose, 0.25hour, 0.5hour, 1hour, 1.5hour, 2hour, 3hour, 4hour, 6hour, 8hour, 12hour, 24hour, 48hour, 72hour, 96hour, 120hour post-dosing on Day 1.</time_frame>
    <description>Apparent total body clearance (CLT/F) was calculated as Dose/AUC(INF), where CLT was the clearance of the drug and F was the absolute oral bioavailability.
