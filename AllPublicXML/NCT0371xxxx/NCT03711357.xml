  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized clinical trial that evaluates the effect of using 980nm diode laser intracanal
      irradiation on postoperative pain and root canal disinfection in endodontic retreatment cases
      with chronic periapical lesions
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The endodontic retreatment procedures will be carried out for the participants, then 980nm
      Diode laser will be used to disinfect root canals. The researcher will then take
      microbiological samples of the root canals, to determine count and type of microorganisms in
      root canals. The subject will be asked to determine his level of pain at 7 days after
      endodontic retreatment procedures in a visual analogue scale (VAS), and to determine number
      of analgesic tablets needed to relieve his pain in the given charts. The subject will then
      return to the clinic 7 days later to bring back his charts. The researcher then will take
      another microbiological sample of the root canals, and complete the endodontic retreatment
      procedures.
