  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) is a common presenting complaint affecting approximately 15-40 % of
      women aged 18-50 in western countries and 5-43% of women in most developing countries. It is
      debilitating and has a large socio- economic impact, with a 45%reduction in work
      productivity, and a 15% increase in absence from work in women with the condition. Botulinum
      neurotoxin type A (BoNTA) has been suggested to improve pain in muscle spasm, its role in CPP
      secondary to pelvic floor spasm has gained increasing interest. However, clinicians do not
      have a diagnosis tool to evaluate the CPP and the BoNTA treatment results.

      Design and develop an efficient and simple tool for the diagnosis and detection of pelvic
      floor muscle (PFM) dysfunction based on superficial electromyography (EMG) and perform 25 EMG
      registrations sessions in healthy patients and 25 EMG sessions in patients diagnoses with PFM
      that will be treated with BoNTA to and study the EMG signal before and after BoNTA
      administration.

    <measure>Visual Analog Scale for Pain (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 - 12 - 24</time_frame>
    <description>The visual analogue scale or visual analog scale (VAS) is a psychometric response scale which can be used in questionnaires. It is a measurement instrument for subjective characteristics or attitudes that cannot be directly measured. When responding to a VAS item, respondents specify their level of agreement to a statement by indicating a position along a continuous line between two end-points.</description>

    <measure>SF-12</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 - 12 - 24</time_frame>
    <description>Although Short Form (SF)-12 × 2® has been extensively studied and used as a valid measure of health-related quality of life in a variety of population groups, no systematic studies have described the reliability of the measure in patients with behavioral conditions or serious mental illness (SMI).</description>

    <measure>Index of Female Sexual Function (IFSF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 - 12 - 24</time_frame>
    <description>The Index of Female Sexual Function (IFSF) is a brief questionnaire measure of sexual functioning in women. It was developed for the specific purpose of assessing domains of sexual functioning (e.g. sexual arousal, orgasm, satisfaction, pain) in clinical trials.</description>

    <measure>The Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 - 12 - 24</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I) is a global index that may be used to rate the response of a condition to a therapy (transition scale). It is a simple, direct, easy to use scale that is intuitively understandable to clinicians</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Clinical Global Impressions Scale (CGI-I)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 - 12 - 24</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinical Global Impressions scale (CGI) consists of three different global measures: Severity of illness: (CGI-S); Global Improvement (CGI-I); Efficacy index The CGI-I score generally tracks with the CGI-S such that improvement in one follows the other; CGI-S and CGI-I scores can occasionally be dissociated</description>
