  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of our study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of NALIRI plus 5FU versus
      paclitaxel as a second-line therapy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic ESCC who
      had failed to cisplatin- or oxaliplatin-based first-line chemotherapy.

      The hypotheses are as follows:

      H0: the percentage of patients alive at 9 months of 40% is not useful. H1: the percentage of
      patients alive at 9 months of 60% is expected.
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>

      Principal objective:

      • To evaluate the survival of patients at 9 months

      Secondary objectives:

        -  Progression-free survival (PFS) (clinical and/or radiological)

        -  Overall survival (OS)

        -  Best response rate during treatment according to RECIST 1.1 criteria (according to the
           investigator and the centralised review committee)

        -  Toxicity (NCI CTC 4.0)

        -  Quality of life (QLQ-C30 and OES18 questionnaires of the EORTC)

      Arm A (experimental arm): Nal IRI plus LV5-FU (D1=D28) Nal-IRI: 80 mg/m² intravenous over 90
      minutes Followed by intravenous folinic acid 400 mg/m² over 30 minutes or L-folinic acid: 200
      mg/m² over 30 minutes And then 5-FU 2,400 mg/m² over 46 hours on D1 to D14 Patients known to
      be homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele who are to be randomized to the Nal-IRI/5-FU Arm
      receive the first cycle of therapy with a reduced dose of Nal IRI of 60 mg/m2. If the patient
      does not present any toxicity related to the medicinal product after the first administration
      of Nal IRI, the dose can be increased to 80 mg/m2 starting with cycle 2.

      Arm B (control arm): PACLITAXEL (D1=D28) Paclitaxel: 80 mg/m² at D1, D8 and D15

      Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio using the minimisation technique. Randomisation
      will be stratified based on the following factors:

        -  Centre

        -  WHO performance status: 0/1 versus 2

      An analysis of circulating tumour DNA (using genetic mutations, in particular, TP53, and DNA
      methylation analyses) will be performed before the 1st cycle of treatment and at D28, in
      order to look for factors predictive of response to treatment (decrease in unbound DNA).

    <intervention_model_description>All initial characteristics will be described in the overall population and by treatment arm. Evaluation criteria related to efficacy and safety will be described by treatment arm. Initial characteristics of best response and toxicities will be evaluated using usual statistics: for quantitative variables: mean, standard deviation, median, interquartile interval and range and for qualitative variables: frequencies and percentages.
For the primary evaluation end point, a one-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) will be calculated in the experimental arm.</intervention_model_description>
