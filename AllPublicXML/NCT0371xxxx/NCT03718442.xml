  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the qualitative severity and depth of dissection
      devices' associated thermal artifact in breast lumpectomy shaved margins between the use of
      electrocautery and low thermal energy dissection, PhotonBlade.

      The investigators hypothesize that the use of PhotonBlade would result in a significantly
      lower qualitative severity and a shorter depth of thermal artifact in breast lumpectomies
      shaved margins, when compared to electrocautery devices.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      When performing lumpectomy, surgeons have used electrocautery devices as dissecting tools.
      However, those devices use high thermal energy that might impact the margin cellular
      architecture and as such the quality of margin assessment by the pathologist. Moreover,
      recently, modern low thermal energy dissection devices have been introduced to the market.
      However, the impact of those devices on reducing the thermal injury/artifact on surgical
      margin has not been well investigated. 4,5 While Ruidaz et al. 2011 data suggest that using
      the traditional electrosurgical device in place of the low thermal-injury device results in
      48% of the close margin samples being negatively converted to false-positive, and in 11%
      converting from close to false-negative, there is still a need for more studies to further
      characterize the utility of those devices. 6 PhotonBlade (Invuity, San Francisco, CA, USA)
      has been approved by United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). PhotonBlade is a
      dynamic precision illuminator with enhanced energy delivery dissection device. The dynamic
      precision illumination is a thermally cool illumination technology that allows a uniformal
      illumination without glare or shadow. 7 The enhanced energy delivery technology allows low
      thermal spread, surgeon controlled edge temperature, and wet field use.7 As such,
      PhontonBlade allows better blade control for achieving adequate visualization, hemostasis,
      with a minimum collateral damage to the surgical margin tissue. The use of PhotonBlade
      demonstrated the least penetrating thermal tissue damage/spread when compared to other modern
      dissection devices (Valleylab Pencil, Valleylab EDGE Coated Pencil, PlasmaBlade 3.0S and
      PlasmaBlade 4.0).8

    <description>Women who are 18 years or older, have Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or invasive breast-conserving surgery, have not had previous chest radiotherapy. 20 patients who meet above study population criteria will be enrolled in this study.Shaved margins for each lumpectomy site will be excised with either Bovie (3 sides) or PhotonBlade (3 sides) for each patient. The effect of PhotonBlade vs Bovie on pathology assessment of lumpectomy shaved surgical margins will be compared.</description>

    <description>For each enrolled patient, six shaved margins will be obtained (superior, inferior, medial, lateral, anterior, and posterior). For each patient, electrocautery will be used to obtain 3 of the shaved margins, and PhotonBlade to obtain the other 3 shaved margins. Once the lumpectomy site shaved margins have been obtained, the shaved surgical margins will be evaluated by a pathologist whom is blinded in regards to the dissection device that was used for each margin. The pathologist will be evaluating each shaved margin and reporting the outcomes (qualitative severity and depth of thermal artifact)</description>
