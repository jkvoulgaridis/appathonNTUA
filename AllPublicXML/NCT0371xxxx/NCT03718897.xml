      The purpose of this study is to investigate genetic mutations affecting prognosis using whole
      genome sequencing in patients with biliary tract cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recently, as genome technology such as next-generation sequencing has progressed, precision
      medicine using genetic analysis in lung cancer, colorectal cancer, and melanoma has been
      actively studied. The need for such precision medicine is also increasing in biliary tract
      cancer patients. Although whole genome sequencing is relatively costly, it is known to
      provide more accurate information than other methods such as exome analysis and RNA
      sequencing in identifying promoter mutations, regulatory regions, and structural variants.
      Pancreatic cancer and melanoma have been studied by whole genome sequencing, but there is no
      previous study using whole genome sequencing method in biliary tract cancer.

        During the study period, all patients who were diagnosed with biliary tract cancer via
        endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatogram at Seoul National University Hospital will be
        enrolled. The investigators will perform whole genome sequencing of biopsy specimens from
        patients with biliary tract cancer and analyze the gene mutations associated with patient
        survival. And additionally, the presence or absence of blood circulating tumor DNA and
        associated gene mutation will be analyzed.
