  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phonak Hearing Systems pass through different development and study stages. At an early
      stage, feasibility studies are conducted to investigate new algorithms, features and
      functions in an isolated manner. If the benefit is proven, their performance is then
      investigated regarding interdependency between all available algorithms, features and
      functions running in parallel in a hearing aid (pivotal/pre-validation studies) and, as a
      result, they get optimized. Afterwards, and prior to product launch, the Phonak Hearing
      Systems undergo a final quality control in terms of clinical trials. This is a pre-validation
      study, investigating optimized algorithms, features, functions and wearing comfort. This will
      be a clinical investigation which will be conducted mono centric at Sonova AG Headquarters
      based in Stäfa (Switzerland).

    <textblock>
      In this study a comparison with two CE-labeled Phonak Receiver-in-the-canal (RIC) devices is
      done. The experimental device and the active comparator will be compared regarding Sound
      Quality perception and speech intelligibility in Quiet and in Noise. The experimental device
      contains direct connectivity functionality which will be investigated in terms of streamed
      Audio quality, streaming stability and Usability preferences of functions and Features which
      are related to direct connectivity. The active comparator device does not contain direct
      streaming functionality. This will be a clinical investigation which will be conducted mono
      centric at Sonova AG Headquarters based in Stäfa (Switzerland).

    <description>The Primary Outcome measure of this study is the comparison of the default Hearing aid Fitting (first fit) in regard of the subjective acceptance rating between the experimental device and the active comparator (non-inferiority test design). The first fit acceptance will be measured via subjective satisfaction rating of different dimensions concerning sound quality perception and loudness perception (Scale of satisfaction rating ranging from 0% to 100%).</description>

    <description>Another Outcome measure of this study is the Evaluation of speech understanding in noise of the experimental device and the active comparator. Speech understanding in noise will be evaluated with an objective and validated test procedure, the Outcome measure will be the Signal-to-noise ration (SNR) in dB.</description>

    <measure>Evaluation of Speech intelligibility in quiet</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Another Outcome measure of this study is the Evaluation of speech understanding in quiet of the experimental device and the active comparator. Speech understanding in quiet will be evaluated with an objective and validated test procedure, the Outcome measure will be the speech intelligibility in % at certain Levels of loudness.</description>

    <measure>Evaluation of the Bluetooth stability (experimental device only)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Another outcome measure of this study is the investigation of bluetooth stability of the experimental device in terms of connection losses and interruptions. The bluetooth stability will be measured via interview and questionnaires during and after a home trial for the experimental device only. The active comparator device does not have Bluetooth Technology.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluation of Usability preferences (experimental device only)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Another Outcome measure is the qualitative rating of user preferences when using direct connectivity Technology in Terms of streaming an audio signal from an external device with Bluetooth Technology to the experimental device. The user preferences will investigated via rating scales client on a questionnaire during a home trial period</description>
