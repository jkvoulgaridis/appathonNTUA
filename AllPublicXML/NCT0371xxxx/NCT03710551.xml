    <textblock>
      Double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial. The purpose of this study is to evaluate
      the stool composition and GI tolerance of 140 healthy, term infants fed with an infant
      formula with a new fat blend plus L. reuteri vs a standard infant formula. All enrolled
      infants will participate in the trial for approximately 71 days.

    <time_frame>Study Day 57, corresponding to infant age of 78-85 days</time_frame>
    <description>3-day Gastrointestinal (GI) Symptom and Behavior Diary, a parent-reported symptom diary to record stool consistency and stool frequency over the 3 consecutive days.
A validated 5-point pictorial representation of the consistency of the stool for infants ≤1 year (1=watery, 2=runny, 3=mushy soft, 4=formed, 5=hard) will be provided in the stool diary for parent(s)/LAR to visually assess the infants' stools.
Stool consistency will be compared between formula groups The baseline stool consistency value will also be included in the model as a covariate.
the percentage of stools in each category (watery, runny, mushy soft, formed, or hard) will be calculated by visit for each infant and then will be summarized using the appropriate descriptive statistics. Figures composed of a series of histograms will be produced for each 3-day stool diary period.</description>

    <measure>GI Tolerance</measure>
    <time_frame>which corresponds to infant age of 21-28, 43-50, and 78-85 days.</time_frame>
    <description>Infant Gastrointestinal Symptom Questionnaire (IGSQ)
Overall GI symptom burden will be measured with the IGSQ-13 questionnaire. The IGSQ-13 is an interviewer-administered questionnaire which measures how well the infant tolerates his/her feedings from the parent's/caregiver's perspective. The questionnaire is composed of 13 questions, categorized into 5 symptom domains of stooling, vomiting/spitting-up, crying, fuzziness, and flatulence and summed to calculate an index score.</description>
