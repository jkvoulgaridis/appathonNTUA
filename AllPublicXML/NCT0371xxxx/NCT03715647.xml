    <textblock>
      Introduction: Electrical Impedance Tomography (TIE) consists of an equipment that enables the
      visualization / quantification in real time of the regional distribution of ventilation and
      pulmonary perfusion, as well as of ventilatory mechanics. Used on the edge of the bed, it is
      easy to move, non-invasive, allowing a momentary or continuous assessment, guiding the
      conduct in a safe and precise way through the electrical impedance technology. It is
      important to note that, in addition to ensuring the efficacy of the patient's behavior, the
      TIE supports the most diverse types of studies to be performed. These include those based on
      the effectiveness of the use of the method in the most diverse pulmonary dysfunctions, in the
      adjustment of the mechanical ventilation and in the average time of hospitalization.
      Objective: To evaluate the pulmonary function of patients in invasive mechanical ventilation
      through SIT. Method: This research was carried out in compliance with the National Health
      Council's Guidelines for Research Involving Human Beings (466/12). The study was a
      prospective longitudinal clinical-experimental type in which all patients (occasional
      sampling) used mechanical ventilation and were hospitalized in the Adult Intensive Care Unit
      (ICU) of the Santa Casa de Misericórdia Foundation of Pará, and they developed sepsis with
      pulmonary repercussions; (DEHG) / HELLP Syndrome and Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome
      (ARDS) and who met the inclusion criteria were evaluated and monitored with TIE to perform
      ventilatory therapy according to the research objectives. The research was carried out in the
      city of Belém, in the state of Pará, in the adult ICU of the FSCMP. As inclusion criterion,
      the patient should be in the FSCMP adult Intensive Care Unit (ICU), under mechanical invasive
      ventilation, previously authorized by the family through the Informed Consent Form to
      participate in the study.

      A prospective longitudinal clinical-experimental study was carried out in which 30 postpartum
      / postpartum women who developed complications of their clinical condition, needing support
      by invasive mechanical ventilation, development of sepsis with pulmonary repercussion,
      Specific Pregnancy Disease ( SDP), HELLP syndrome or ARDS were evaluated and monitored with
      Electrical Impedance Tomography for conduction of ventilatory therapy. In order to obtain the
      images and quantification of the regional ventilatory distribution, two tapes with 16
      electrodes were connected by means of an adhesive tape, one for each band, around the thorax
      and aligned in a plane corresponding to a cross section with emission of an electric current
      imperceptible and harmless to the patient, generating, according to the pulmonary dynamics, a
      variation of electrical impedance, consequently a gradient of electrical resistivity. A flow
      sensor positioned between the endotracheal tube and the &quot;Y&quot; of the ventilator circuit,
      responsible for capturing ventilatory mechanic information, and a reference cable positioned
      by an electrocardiographic monitoring electrode, in the abdominal region or in the region
      from the shoulders. The data were sent simultaneously to a system (computer) with specific
      softwear in order to measure and quantify the regional distribution of pulmonary ventilation
      and perfusion, as well as its correlation in patients under mechanical ventilation. All
      experimental values were presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD). The study was of the
      experimental type, and the descriptive statistic was used to characterize the sample.
      Statistical analysis was performed with GraphPad Prism 5.0. The P value &lt;0.05 was considered
      statistically significant. The results were placed in spreadsheets and graphs created with
      GraphPad Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, California, USA).

    <description>For the delimitation of the information collection of postpartum women submitted to invasive mechanical ventilation for having evolved with HELLP syndrome, sepsis or respiratory distress syndrome, and ventilatory data were collected from the data sheet of the Electrical Impedance Tomography, containing data from the regional distribution of (Cst) of the respiratory system, final expiratory positive pressure (PEEP) and Platelet Pressure (Pplatô), as well as ventilatory parameters data: Ventilatory mode and mode, PEEP, VT, Inspiratory Time (I), Inspired Fraction of Oxygen (FiO2), Sensitivity (Sens.), Of hospitalized patients in the period of collections. After a retrospective survey of the sample, data were collected from patients who were in the Intensive Care Unit, while they were on invasive mechanical ventilation and monitored by Electrical Impedance Tomography.</description>
