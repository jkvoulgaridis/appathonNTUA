  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying whether participants and their doctors are willing to
      determine post-surgery treatment on the basis of response to pre-surgery treatment, and
      studying blood and tissue collected from participants treated with a combination of drugs as
      a treatment for breast cancer.

      The names study drugs involved in this study are:

        -  Paclitaxel (also called Taxol)

        -  Trastuzumab (also called Herceptin)

        -  Pertuzumab (also called Perjeta)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Pilot Study, which means investigators are looking at the
      feasibility of a new approach for deciding the optimal medical treatment for this type of
      breast cancer. The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved paclitaxel,
      trastuzumab, and pertuzumab as part of a pre-operative treatment option for this disease.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether participants and their doctors are willing
      to accept a treatment recommendation for post-operative chemotherapy, on the basis of the
      participant's response to pre-operative treatment with paclitaxel, trastuzumab, and
      pertuzumab.

      In addition, the investigators are evaluating how the body's immune system works with
      paclitaxel, trastuzumab, and pertuzumab to kill cancer cells. For this reason, the
      investigators will collect samples of the participant's breast tumor and samples of the
      participant's blood over time to understand the reaction of the immune system to the
      participant's tumor.
