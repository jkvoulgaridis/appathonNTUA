    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the accuracy of a new concussion system at detecting concussions.
      The investigators will be evaluating the degree to which data collected with the device
      agrees with a physician's determination of a concussion. The system captures an
      electroencephalograph (EEG) potential when a light is flashed into the eyes of an individual.
      The device is not FDA approved, but it is a non-significant risk device. The device is a
      non-invasive, non-interventional sensor. It will not replace the opinion of the physician in
      diagnosing a concussion.

      This study will test the EEG based concussion system on 200 individuals, Participants will be
      made up of individuals who are seeking medical consultation at the Play Safe Concussion
      Clinic (10 Union Square E, New York, NY 10003) or at Mount Sinai Hospital (1468 Madison Ave,
      New York, NY 10029) after experiencing a head trauma. The Play Safe Clinic treats patients
      who reach out to Mount Sinai Physicians via the Play Safe telephone number: 212 241 2221. The
      doctors who see patients these locations will be involved in conducting this research. In
      addition to the standard-of-care clinical assessments, participants will also receive an
      evaluation from the concussion based system.

      When a subject experiences a head trauma, the subject will be evaluated for a concussion by
      both the standard-of-care clinical assessments. The treating physician will provide all
      necessary standard-of-care evaluations and diagnostic procedures needed to properly diagnose
      and treat each patient and by the new concussion system. Participants will then return to
      either the Concussion Clinic or Mount Sinai 2, 4, 7, 14 and 28 days after the day of their
      initial head injury to complete the routine follow-up sessions with their treating physician
      and to complete additional evaluations with the EEG based concussion system. The researchers
      will also collect data from healthy, age-matched controls in order to collect a database of
      healthy responses to the technology.

      To determine how accurate the new concussion system is at detecting concussions, the research
      team will compare the diagnostic results from the device to the diagnostic results of the
      doctor's assessments. The goal of this study is to develop a device that can give sound
      advice as to whether an individual should seek medical attention for a possible concussion
      following a head injury.
