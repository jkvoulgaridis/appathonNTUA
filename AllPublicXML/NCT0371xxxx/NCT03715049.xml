  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Objective 1: To evaluate the effect and histologic (cellular) changes associated with varying
      energy and density settings of the Fraxel Repair Laser to determine an optimal dose response.

      Objective 2: To evaluate the clinical response associated with variable energy and density
      settings of fraxel laser treatment in the upper lip. Overall assessment of clinical outcome
      and safety will be based clinic visits and evaluation of pre- and post- procedural photos.
      The subject's assessment of satisfaction will be characterized using a non-parametric
      assessment scale at each follow-up period.

      This is a multi-site, non-randomized, non-controlled investigator initiated study designed to
      follow a total of 30 qualified and consenting subjects treated with one Fraxel Repair
      treatment in the course of clinical practice.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the lip wrinkles from baseline to 1 month</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure of effectiveness will be a paired comparison of baseline to 1, 3, and 6 month follow-up ratings for wrinkles using a Merz Aesthetic Lip Line score (0 none 1-4). Safety will be defined as an absence of hypopigmentary changes and by a restoration of hyperpigmentary changes to mild or less at 1 month. Photographs of treated skin at follow-up visits will be compared to baseline to document the healing time course and may be used for blinded scoring evaluations (0-9 scales) of wrinkles, skin texture and color changes. The investigator will grade the epidermal response including side effects and adverse events using the 0 to 10 grading scale.</description>

    <description>Using the energy and density settings within the FDA approved limits (5-40mJ at 30-100% density) that were narrowed down by the pre-clinical portion of the study, and analysis of abdominal and facial tissue treated in Objective 1, up to thirty (30) subjects will be recruited and treated one (1) time in the perioral region of the upper lip and followed for 6 months (study design below). The acute effects of the laser application will be determined by subjective analysis using the wrinkle severity scores.</description>

    <intervention_name>Fraxel Laser Treatment</intervention_name>
    <description>The device to be used in this study is a FDA approved device [510(k) approval] used for aesthetic dermatological procedures. The Fraxel Repair laser system utilizes a sealed off, all metal carbon dioxide gas tube that is radio frequency (RF) excited and air cooled, emitting light at a wavelength of 10.6 μm with programmable pulse duration and frequency. The Fraxel Repair laser has a continuous motion (rolling) optical tracking system. The Fraxel system consists of a treatment component and an internal control component. The treatment component consists of the laser delivery handpiece. A computer with a touch screen keyboard to enter subjects' information also provides controls for the fractionated delivery of the 10.6 μm beam.</description>

             after treatments.

          -  Subjects have undergone dermatological procedures (e.g., laser or light treatments)
