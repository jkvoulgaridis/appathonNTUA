  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this Phase I study is to access the safety and tolerability of SHR-1701
      at different dose levels. It is hoped to find out the recommended dose for Phase II/III.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open-label trial in patients with metastatic or locally advanced solid
      tumor. There are three parts of the study: a dose-escalation part, a dose-expansion part, and
      a clinical expansion part. Dose escalation part is a standard &quot;3+3&quot; cohort design, for which
      3 or 6 subjects will be enrolled at each dose level depending on the occurrence of
      dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). Dose-expansion means that at least 10 subjects (included
      subjects of the dose-escalation part) will be selected in 2 - 3 dose levels to focus on the
      pharmacokinetics (PK) / pharmacodynamic (PD) features. After determination of the recommended
      dose for Phase II (RP2D), clinical expansion will be opened. Many more subjects will be
      invited to take part in the study and received the study drug at the RP2D. Additional purpose
      of the study is to find out whether the study drug has anti-tumor effects.
