  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is developing and evaluating a new pain management app for cancer
      patients (STAMP).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to develop the STAMP app (Smartphone Technology to Alleviate
      Malignant Pain). This app will be used by patients with advanced cancer to track symptoms and
      receive tailored symptom management advice. This project will involve 5 specific activities:

        1. Activity 1 - Content Development (working groups)

        2. Activity 2 - Programming and testing of app algorithms

        3. Activity 3 - User acceptability testing

        4. Activity 4 - Pilot testing

        5. Activity 5 - Patient Qualitative Interviews

      Activities 1 and 2 will involve the development of the content and functionalities for the
      STAMP app. Activity 3 (the user acceptability testing phase of the project) will be conducted
      to identify and address any problems with the developed tool. User acceptability testing will
      involve interviews and focus groups with patients and providers who have been shown the app.
      The information gathered from these interviews and groups will be used to improve the
      application before it undergoes pilot testing. Activity 4 (pilot testing) will be conducted
      to demonstrate the utilization and efficacy of the STAMP app among patients with chronic
      cancer pain and their cancer care providers. Activity 5 (patient qualitative interviews) will
      be conducted with patients to learn more about their experiences with a cancer diagnosis and
      chronic pain management.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Patients' responses to a usability/acceptability survey as assessed by the Acceptability E-scale (Activity 3 ONLY)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day (UAT will take place as a one-time user feedback session)</time_frame>
    <description>Patients that take part in UAT will complete a validated usability survey (the Acceptability e-Scale) adapted from Tarimian et al. Participants will also respond to open-ended questions about the app. The Acceptability e-Scale includes 6 items: 1) How easy was the app to use?; 2) How much did you enjoy using the app?; 3) How helpful to you was this app in describing your symptoms and QOL?; 4) How would you rate your overall satisfaction with this app?; 5) Was the amount of time it took to complete this app acceptable?; 6) How understandable were the questions? All items offer 5 response options (on a Likert scale of 1 to 5). A response of 1 indicates a negative and a response of 5 indicates a positive evaluation of the app. A score of 3 indicates a neutral response. UAT will occur until no new themes emerge, and the average usability score exceeds 4 (out of 5 on a 5-point Likert scale) for all responses.</description>

    <description>Activity 3 (User acceptability testing):
Patients will utilize the STAMP app in an observed setting.
Patients will complete a validated usability survey
A series of 6 patients will be video-recorded as they are asked to &quot;think aloud&quot; for 30 minutes as they use STAMP
Laboratory UAT will be conducted within the DFCI HCC communications laboratory, among (1) patients using opioids for chronic cancer pain, and (2) oncology providers</description>

    <description>Activity 4 (pilot testing):
Participants will utilize the STAMP app for 8-weeks.
STAMP will prompt patients to complete thrice weekly comprehensive pain assessments
will also encourage patients to submit frequent &quot;on-demand&quot; pain ratings - particularly during the first days/weeks of opioid initiation/titration
The nurse will review PRO's in the STAMP portal and call patients to discuss symptoms, self-management challenges, assist patients in problem-solving, and offer medical advice
The nurse will monitor the STAMP dashboard daily (Mon-Fri), review clinical alerts, contact patients for symptom problems, and confer with oncologists as needed</description>
