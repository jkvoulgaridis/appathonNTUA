      This study compares the effect of individualized vs standard blood pressure management on
      postoperative myocardial injury in high-risk patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery by
      measuring the hs-cTnT levels. Continuous norepinephrine infusion is used to target a mean
      pressure of greater than 65mmHg and a systolic pressure less than 160mmHg in the standardized
      group while the target is 20% within the ward blood pressure in the individualized group. The
      pre- and postoperative hs-cTnT levels to detect myocardial injury are compared between the
      two groups.

      Managing the blood pressure preoperatively is important in high-risk patients because
      hypotension can lead to perioperative myocardial injury. It has been reported that a systolic
      pressure of less than 50-55mmHg or greater than 40% decrease can lead to cardiac
      complications. The mechanism of hypotension leading to postoperative myocardial injury is due
      to hypoperfusion and ischemic reperfusion injury.

      In this randomized controlled study, the blood pressure for participants in the standardized
      group is maintained as follows: mean blood pressure greater than 65mmHg and systolic blood
      pressure less than 160mmHg. The individualized group participants' blood pressure is
      maintained at a target of 20% within the preoperative ward blood pressure. Anesthesia and
      intraoperative management are the same in both groups to target a bispectral index level of
      50. In order to quantitatively measure the myocardial injury, high sensitive cardiac troponin
      T (hs-cTnT) will be measured pre- and postoperatively. A level greater than 14ng/dl has been
      reported to be associated with myocardial injury and mortality. The objective of this study
      is to show that the standardized protocol of maintaining a mean pressure greater than 65mmHg
      is non inferior to the individualized management in terms of postoperative myocardial injury.
