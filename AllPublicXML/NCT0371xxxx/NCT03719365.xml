  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Assisted ventilation represents, nowadays, the preferred ventilation mode in clinical
      practice.It has been shown that assisted ventilation modes improve ventilation/perfusion
      matching, descrease risk of Ventilator induced lung injury and muscle atrophy and have less
      influence on haemodynamic function.

      However, PSV (Pressure Support Ventilation) is not free from complications: it may worsen or
      cause lung injuries by increasing alveolar and intrathoracic negative pressure and by loosing
      control on Tidal Volume (Vt). Indeed, it has been demonstrated that Vt is the main factor
      related to VILI.

      It has been shown that lower Vt and higher PEEP can improve clinical outcome only if
      associated with a simultaneous reduction in Driving Pressure. Increase in Driving Pressure
      resulted strongly associated with negative outcomes, especially if higher than 15 cm H2O.

      PSV is currently the most used assisted ventilation mode. NAVA (Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory
      Assist) is a ventilation mode in which the diaphragmatic electrical activity (EAdi) is used
      as a trigger to start a mechanical breath, applying positive pressure during patient's
      inspiration. Diaphragmatic electrical activity (EAdi) can be detected by a particular
      nasogastric tube (EAdi catheter). EAdi is the currently available signal closest to the
      neural breathing centers, which can estimate the patient's respiratory drive, if phrenic
      nerves are not damaged. It has been demonstrated that NAVA ventilation can reduce the
      incidence of patient-ventilator asynchronies, because the delivery of the support and the
      cycling between inspiration and expiration are completely controlled by the patient.

      However, although PSV and NAVA have been widely compared in many investigations, up to now
      there are no studies about driving pressure variation during these two modalities of
      mechanical assisted ventilation. The aim of this study is to measure changes in driving
      pressure at different levels of ventilatory assistance in PSV and NAVA ventilation modes.

      Secondary end points are respiratory mechanics indices and patient/ventilator related
      asynchrony evaluation and comparison.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Any patient who is already on an assisted mode of ventilation and displays triggering efforts
      will be enrolled in the study and will be submitted to 3 ventilation trials, in PSV and NAVA
      ventilation modes; each trial will last 20 minutes. Every trial will be performed in a
      randomized order, based on random computer generated sequences.

      During the first trial, PSV will be set in order to obtain a Vt between 6 and 8 ml/kg;this
      support level will be defined as PSV100. Subsequently, the corresponding NAVA level (NAVA
      100) will be determined using a dedicated ventilator function (NAVA Preview) which is able to
      estimate NAVA level in order to deliver an equivalent inspiratory peak pressure (Paw peak)
      compared to that obtained during PSV mode. Afterwards, pressure support level of assistance
      of PSV100 and NAVA100 will be firstly increased (PSV150 and NAVA150) during the second trial
      and then decreased during the third trial (PSV50 and NAVA150) by 50% from basal value.

      During the study period, PEEP and FiO2 will be kept equal to the values in use before patient
      enrollment. End-inspiration and end-expiration pauses will be performed at the end of each
      trial by pressing the dedicated button on the ventilator control panel. Airway pressure and
      flow will be recorded.

      Patients, as usual, clinical practice, will be sedated at different levels and this could
      compromise their content of consciousness.

      At the beginning of each trial, an endotracheal tube suction will be done. Last 5 minutes of
      each trial will be recorded and stored in a computer for subsequent statistical analysis.
      Respiratory mechanical indices (airway pressure, tidal volume, flow) and electric
      diaphragmatic activity will be recorded by a dedicated software called NAVA- tracker. At the
      end of each trial an arterial blood gas analysis (ABGs) will be performed to evaluate PaCO2,
      PH and blood oxygenation (PaO2). at the end of each trial, an ultrasound evaluation of
      diaphragm will be performed.
