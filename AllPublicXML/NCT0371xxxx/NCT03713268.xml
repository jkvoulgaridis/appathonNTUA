  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall five-year goals of the project are to develop novel technology to provide
      actionable new information through provision of live volumetric imaging during surgery,
      improving surgical practice and outcomes. The investigators believe this technology will
      enable novel ophthalmic and other microsurgeries not possible due to current limitations in
      surgical visualization.

    <description>Adult subjects with normal, ocular health will be enrolled to evaluate and obtain multiple images from the microscope integrated optical coherence tomography system for reproducibility testing in humans, provide feedback to engineers, and verify that the system functions to produce high quality images of the desired areas of the eye after ex vivo development before surgical use.
Each healthy subject will be imaged by the MIOCT system. There will be no surgery or intervention on these healthy volunteer subjects. We anticipate that a portion of the volunteer subjects would have repeat imaging (e.g. for reproducibility testing).</description>

    <description>This is translational study in which subjects will either be imaged with a microscope integrated optical coherence tomography (MIOCT) system or they will use MIOCT during surgical procedures. OCT systems are optical imaging technology that allow non-contact imaging of the microanatomy of the retina, cornea, optic nerve head and retinal blood vessels. The MIOCT has been integrated into the surgical microscope used in retinal and anterior segment surgeries so it does not touch the eye. Unlike visible light from many examination devices, the infrared OCT beam is barely visible to the human eye as it sweeps across the retina. Thus the patient is not disturbed by the light.</description>

        262 subjects enrolled in 3 groups as follows:

          1. Healthy Controls: 50 subjects

          2. Surgeons as research subjects performing randomized testing in wet lab: 22 subjects

          3. Surgical patients as research subjects for application to ocular vitreoretinal and
             anterior segment surgery: 190 subjects

    <sampling_method>Probability Sample</sampling_method>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy controls: Healthy eyes without known disease: refractive error including
             myopia and non-significant cataract is allowed. For selected testing pseudophakia is
             allowed.

          2. Surgeons as research subjects: Adult (≥18 years old)

          3. Surgical patients (vitreoretinal surgery): Patients undergoing examination under
             anesthesia or surgery for vitreoretinal diseases

          4. Surgical patients (anterior segment surgery-glaucoma, ocular surface or strabismus
             requiring extraocular muscle surgery): Include both adults and children. Patient
             undergoing primary, elective minimally invasive glaucoma surgery, ocular surface
             surgery, or strabismus surgery.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy controls: Any ocular disease that restricts the ability to perform OCT
             scanning. Conflict of interest with investigators/study personnel, e.g. a student in
             the lab of an investigator.

          2. Surgeons as research subjects: no specific exclusion criteria.

          3. Surgical patients (vitreoretinal surgery): Neonates (&lt; 4 weeks of age) and patients
             with any ocular disease that restricts the ability to perform OCT scanning.

          4. Surgical patients (anterior segment surgery-corneal and cataract diseases): Pediatric
             patients: The cornea and cataract surgery studies will be restricted to adults (≥ 18
             years). Children do not have cataract surgery typically by residents and therefore
             would not fit our study design. Similarly pediatric corneal transplants are very rare.
