  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postmenopausal women have a higher prevalence of cardiovascular (CV) disease than age-match
      men. Growing evidence from rat studies have demonstrated CV-protective effects of pumpkin
      seed oil (PSO).

      The investigators hypothesis is that PSO would improve CV health in postmenopausal women.

      The purpose of the study is to examine the effects of 6 weeks of PSO on arterial and
      autonomic function in postmenopausal women. Specific aims of the study are to:

      To investigate the extent to which PSO will improve cardiovascular disease risk factors by
      assessing arterial stiffness, aortic BP and wave reflection, and autonomic function (heart
      rate variability).
