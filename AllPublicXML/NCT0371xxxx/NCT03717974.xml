  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Access to care for people with traumatic or degenerative neurological disabilities is a
      current public health concern. New technological tools such as telemedicine can bring
      expertise to the place of life of people while promoting the city-hospital link.

    <description>It can detect anxiety and depressive disorders. It has 14 items rated from 0 to 3. Seven questions relate to anxiety (total A) and seven others to the depressive dimension (total D), thus obtaining two scores (maximum score of each score = 21). 7 or less: no symptomatology 8 to 10: doubtful symptomatology 11 and above: certain symptomatology.</description>

    <measure>Doloplus scale</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Behavioral Assessment Scale of Pain in Older People with Verbal Communication Disorders. This scale comprises ten items divided into three subgroups (five somatic, two psychomotor and three psychosocial).
Each item is rated from 0 to 3 (four exclusive and progressive level scoring), which results in an overall score between 0 and 30.
The pain is clearly affirmed for a score greater than or equal to 5 out of 30.</description>

    <measure>Zarit's score</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Zarit scale assesses the emotional, physical and financial burden for caregivers of caring for someone with a loss of autonomy.
The total score, which is the sum of the scores obtained for each of 22 items, varies from 0 to 88.
A score less than or equal to 20 indicates a low or no load; a score between 21 and 40 indicates a light load; a score between 41 and 60 indicates a moderate load; a score above 60 indicates a severe charge.</description>

    <description>Goal Attainment Scale by objectives at the beginning and end of taking charge. Each item built has 5 levels of answers 0: corresponds to the achievement of the goal set by the examiner.
1: is a better score than expected.
2: corresponds to the most favorable evolution expected.
1: corresponds to a score lower than that expected.
