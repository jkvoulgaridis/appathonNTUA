  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, dose escalation, Phase I study to evaluate the safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics and efficacy in patients with advanced malignancies.

      The study is composed of Ia and Ib phases.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phase Ia study is composed of two stages: Phase Ia Part A initial dose escalation and Phase
      Ia Part B maintenance dose escalation. Both parts will adopt the classical 3+3 dose
      escalation design.

      The starting dose for phase Ia part A is 0.1 mg/kg QW, followed by 2 dose cohorts (0.3 mg/kg
      QW and 1 mg/kg QW). Duration of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) observation is 14 days.

      Phase Ia Part B will have 4 dose cohorts(3mg/kg QW、10mg/kg QW、20mg/kg QW and 30mg/kg QW). DLT
      observation period is 28 days. The subject number for each cohort in Phase Ia Part B will be
      increased to 6 if the subject number enrolled in each cohort is less than 6.

      Dose level for Phase Ib study will be determined based on the recommended dose from phase Ia.
