      1. Prospective, randomized, multicenter clinical study

        2. This is a post-marketing clinical study to evaluate whether it will affect the safety
           event when it is used in different treatment ways. Adopting non - inferiority design,
           2700 cases were enrolled.

        3. EDC system (eCRF electronic data collection system)

        4. Follow-up points: 30 days,3 months, 12 months, 24 months, 36 months, 48 months and 60
           months after the operation;

      1. Subjects are eligible for coronary intervention

        2. The lesion needs to be pre-expanded or special circumstances should be carefully
           considered according to the clinical manifestations

        3. The selection of target vessel is based on the criteria of a diameter between 2.25mm and
           4.0mm

        4. If a stent needs to be placed at the target vessel, it is recommended that there be at
           least 2mm overlap between the stents; if the stent expansion is not sufficient,
           post-dilatation treatment is required.
