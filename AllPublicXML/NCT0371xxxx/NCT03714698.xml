  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is one of the most frequent psychiatric disorders with a prevalence of 0.5-1.0
      % all over the world. It remains one of the major reasons for disability although medical and
      psychosocial interventions.

      People suffering from schizophrenia may also have many complex health troubles such as
      cardiovascular disease, metabolic disease, diabetes mellitus, and pulmonary problems.

      Researchers have been debating the utility of exercise over depression, anxiety, and
      obsessive-compulsive symptoms last decades. Studies indicate that physical activity improves
      mood, self-esteem, energy, motivation, concentration, cognitive skills, quality of life, and
      social interactions. Particularly in the last decade studies have been carried out showing
      that various exercise approaches and physical activities contribute positively to the
      physical and mental health of schizophrenic patients. Clinic impacts of these interventions,
      dominantly including aerobic exercise, strengthening and fitness training, also varied
      according to the type, duration and intensity of the method used.

      The knowledge obtained about schizophrenia patients point out that physically and mentally
      holistic approaches should be required to this complicated disease. Previous trials
      demonstrated that various physical activity or exercise methods have positive effects in
      patients with schizophrenia. However, to the best of the our knowledge, literature lacks
      investigation about benefits of Pilates on several domains, in particular about the potential
      changes on physical and mental health in patients with schizophrenia. The aim of this study
      was to investigate the effects of Pilates-based exercise training on the physical and mental
      health of schizophrenia patients.

      Pilates exercises developed by Joseph Pilates has an increasing popularity in last decades.
      Pilates supposed that the balance between body and mind is an important factor in achieving
      health and happiness. Pilates stimulates the mind and decreases mental strain. The basic
      principles of Pilates-based approach are concentration, control, centering, diaphragmatic
      breathing, lightness, precision, and relaxation. It also aims to enlighten the awareness of
      body by inducing mind control. The control of large group muscles with coordination and
      focusing on breathing may increase aerobic capacity, and further improves mental health.
      Heretofore, some researchers also reported that the holistic approach of Pilates-based
      training may provide physical and psychological improvements on human health, and various
      intensities benefit the quality of life, mental health, physical fitness levels, and body
      types. Pilates exercises are utilized with a wide range spectrum for many diseases'
      management and are particularly used also for mental health disease such as depression,
      anxiety, mood etc. The sample of the study consisted of patients who were diagnosed with
      schizophrenia according to The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth
      Edition (DSM-5). Current study was conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration and
      its subsequent amendments. All the subjects volunteered to participate in this research and
      signed the informed consent form approved by the Institutional Clinical Research Ethics
      Committee (Protocol no: 2015-84-21/10). On receipt of a completed consent form, patients were
      assigned to Pilates exercise group (PEG) or control group (CG) based on their willingness.

    <measure>Change from baseline &quot;6 Minute Walk Test&quot; at 6 week</measure>
    <time_frame>at the baseline and after six weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The 6MWT is a practical simple test that requires a 100-ft hallway but no exercise equipment or advanced training for technicians. Walking is an activity performed daily by all but the most severely impaired patients. This test measures the distance that a patient can quickly walk on a flat, hard surface in a period of 6 minutes (the 6MWD). It evaluates the global and integrated responses of all the systems involved during exercise, including the pulmonary and cardiovascular systems, systemic circulation, peripheral circulation, blood, neuromuscular units, and muscle metabolism. The self-paced 6MWT assesses the submaximal level of functional capacity. Most patients do not achieve maximal exercise capacity during the 6MWT; instead, they choose their own intensity of exercise and are allowed to stop and rest during the test.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia at 6 week</measure>
    <time_frame>at the baseline and after six weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS) was developed to assess the level of depression in schizophrenia. It is the only depression scale designed for the assessment of depression in schizophrenia and it differentiates between depression and the negative and positive symptoms of schizophrenia. The CDSS depression score is obtained by adding each of the item scores (9 items). A score above 6 has an 82% specificity and 85% sensitivity for predicting the presence of a major depressive episode.All ratings of the items are defined according to operational criteria from 0-3.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline The Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms at 6 week</measure>
    <time_frame>at the baseline and after six weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) was the first instrument developed in order to provide for comprehensive assessment of negative symptoms in schizophrenia (Andreasen, 1982, 1983). It consists of five scales that evaluate five different aspects of negative symptoms: alogia, affective blunting, avolition-apathy, anhedonia-asociality, and attentional impairment. Each of these negative symptoms can be rated globally, but in addition detailed observations are made in order to achieve the global rating.Each of the measures is defined and broken down in observable behavioral components that are rated on a 6-point scale. The rating of each of the behavioral components is followed by an item that describes the patient's subjective evaluation of the symptom as a whole.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline The Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS) at 6 week</measure>
    <time_frame>at the baseline and after six weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS) permits detailed evaluation and global ratings of hallucinations, delusions, positive formal thought disorder and bizarre behaviour (Andreasen, 1984). Taken together, the two scales provide a comprehensive set of rating scales in order to measure the symptoms of schizophrenia and to assess their change over time.The scale was developed by Nancy Andreasen and was first published in 1984. SAPS is split into 4 domains, and within each domain separate symptoms are rated from 0 (absent) to 5 (severe). The scale is closely linked to the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) which was published a few years earlier.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale at 6 week</measure>
    <time_frame>at the baseline and after six weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) is a rating scale which a clinician or researcher may use to measure psychiatric symptoms such as depression, anxiety, hallucinations and unusual behaviour. Each symptom is rated 1-7 and depending on the version between a total of 18-24 symptoms are scored. The scale is one of the oldest, most widely used scales to measure psychotic symptoms and was first published in 1962.The single items were rated on a seven-point scale (1, not present; 2, very mild; 3, mild; 4, moderate; 5, moderately severe; 6, severe; 7, extremely severe). Thus, the range of possible BPRS total scores is from 18 to 126.</description>
