  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this randomized double blind placebo controlled study of tranexamic acid during minor
      spinal surgery, mean postoperative blood loss in the patients who received TXA was
      statistically significantly lower compared to placebo.

      Study Design: Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study.

      Objective: To investigate the effect of tranexamic acid (TXA) compared to placebo in low-risk
      adult patients undergoing elective minor lumbar spine surgery on operative time, estimated
      blood loss and complications.

      Summary of Background Data: Studies have shown that TXA reduces blood loss during major spine
      surgery. There are no studies on the effect of TXA in minor lumbar spine surgery on operative
      time, intraoperative and postoperative blood loss and complications.

      Methods: We enrolled patients with ASA grades 1 to 2, scheduled to undergo lumbar
      decompressive surgery at Middelfart Hospital. Patients with thromboembolic disease,
      coagulopathy, hypersensitivity to TXA or history of convulsion were excluded. Patients were
      randomized, in blocks of 10, to two groups: TXA or placebo. Anticoagulation therapy was
      discontinued 2-7 days preoperatively. Prior to the incision, patients received either a bolus
      of TXA (10mg/kg), or an equivalent volume of saline solution (placebo).

    <description>Intra-operative blood loss was estimated by adding the weight (1g=1mL) of swabs and blood in the suction bottle and subtracting all fluids added to the surgical field. Surgical drain volume was estimated visually at two and 18 hours post-operatively. Total volume of peri-operative blood loss was calculated as the volume of intraoperative blood loss plus the post-operative volume measured from the drain output.</description>
