  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the proposed study, the investigators assumed that using robot assisted tenodesis-grip
      training providing high does assisted grip movement may do the effects on motor shaping and
      greater brain priming for hand paresis of the stroke patients. The specific aim of this study
      is to examine the difference in the treatment effects between the combination of robot
      assisted tenodesis-grip training with task-oriented training and combination of traditional
      occupational therapy with task-oriented training on the motor, sensation, hand performance of
      the stroke patients. The expected outcomes of this research are to help the clinicians
      understand the training mechanism and effects of robot assisted tenodesis-grip training on
      functional performance of upper extremity for unilateral stroke patients.

    <description>Each item is rated on a three-point ordinal scale (2 points for the detail being performed completely, 1 point for the detail being performed partially, and 0 for the detail not being performed). The maximum motor performance score is 66 points for the upper extremity.completely, 1 point for the detail being performed partially, and 0 for the detail not being performed). The maximum motor performance score is 66 points for the upper extremity.</description>
