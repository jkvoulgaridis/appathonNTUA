  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the fact that a substantial number of school age children struggle with both reading
      and math acquisition, the brain mechanisms of the overlapping aspects of reading and math
      skills, thought in part to be linked via executive functions (EF), have not been unpacked.
      This project will use a longitudinal design, following children from Kindergarten through 1st
      grade, to understand how the brain networks associated with reading, math, and EF interact to
      predict academic outcomes and, in those who struggle academically, intervention response.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This longitudinal study will be conducted with 260 Kindergartners, staggered across multiple
      cohorts, who are followed through 1st grade. There will be three time points of testing for
      each cohort: fall of Kindergarten, spring of Kindergarten, and in the fall of 1st grade.

      After the third testing time point, in the fall of 1st grade, the bottom 1/3 of readers in
      the sample will be selected to participate in the intervention arm of the study. These
      students will be randomly placed in one of two arms: business-as-usual, in which children
      receive no additional instruction; or the reading intervention condition, in which they
      receive 20 hours of 1:1 reading intervention over 6 weeks. Children in both sub-sample arms
      are assessed again after tutoring is complete, in the spring of 1st grade.

      Neuroimaging through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional magnetic resonance
      imaging (fMRI) will occur as part of study participation in conjunction with testing at fall
      of Kindergarten, fall of 1st grade, and spring of 1st grade time points.

          3. known uncorrectable visual impairment;

          4. documented hearing impairment greater than or equal to a 25 decibel (dB) loss;

          5. medical contraindication to MRI procedures (e.g., metal devices) - excludes from MRI
             procedures only;
