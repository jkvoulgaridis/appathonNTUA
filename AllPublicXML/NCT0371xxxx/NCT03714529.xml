  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A single center, open-label, phase IIa, single arm, window of opportunity trial with IO103
      and Montanide adjuvant in patients with surgically resectable BCC.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      10 patients with BCC will be vaccinated with a peptide derived from the immune checkpoint
      molecule PD-L1. Patients will be vaccinated once every 2 weeks (Q2W) for 10 weeks and then
      evaluated for a clinical response.

      Patients with clinical response to vaccination will continue with one vaccination once every
      4 weeks (Q4W) for 12 weeks and thus receive 9 vaccinations in total over the course of 22
      weeks.

      Patients with no effect of treatment after 6 vaccinations will be treated with standard of
      care (SOC).
