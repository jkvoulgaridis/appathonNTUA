    <textblock>
      PEFCAT is a prospective, single-arm, multi-center, safety and feasibility study evaluating
      the FARAPULSE Endocardial Ablation System for the treatment of paroxysmal atrial
      fibrillation.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing catheter ablation for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation will be screened for
      enrollment per protocol inclusion and exclusion criteria. Enrolled patients will then undergo
      ablation using the FARAPULSE Endocardial Ablation System. Subjects will be followed at 7
      days, 30 days, 75 days, 6 months, and 12 months with a blanking period for recurrent atrial
      fibrillation or atrial tachycardia of 3 months following the PEF (pulsed electric field)
      catheter ablation procedure.
