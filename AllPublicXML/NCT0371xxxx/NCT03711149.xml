  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial that compares a system using activity monitors to
      provide real-time feedback on daily ambulation to patients undergoing major surgeries, paired
      with step-count-measured art tours of the surgical units, versus standard of care, on step
      count. The hypothesis is that the feedback system + art tours will encourage patients to
      ambulate more.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After major surgery, patients are encouraged to walk early and often, since early ambulation
      is linked with improved clinical and efficiency outcomes. This research study tests whether
      providing goal-directed feedback on daily ambulation to patients using activity monitors in
      combination with an app that provides step count-rated &quot;art tours&quot; of the surgical floors
      will increase the amount of steps taken after surgery. Upon enrollment, all patients will be
      assigned to either the control (no intervention) or experimental (activity monitor feedback +
      art tours) group, stratified by surgery type. This randomized controlled trial aims to
      determine if this feedback system/art tours approach improves: (1) daily step count, (2)
      length of stay, and (3) patient satisfaction compared with standard of care.

    <description>Patient satisfaction measured using likert-scale rated items. Scale measures patient/physician communication, patient awareness of step goals, and patient confidence in accomplishment of daily goals. The following scale ranges will be used:
Never, Once a day, Twice a day, Three times a day, More than three times a day
Much lower, Lower, About the same, Higher, Much higher
Not at all, Slightly, Moderately, Very, Extremely
Positive answer in likert-scales indicate higher patient/physician communication, patient awareness, and patient confidence in accomplishing daily step goals.</description>
