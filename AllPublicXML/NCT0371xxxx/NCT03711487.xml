  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chinese Medicine Ironing using Foeniculum vulgare has been applied in some departments to
      promote bowel function recovery, but the efficacy of ironing therapy remains uncertain after
      colorectal resection surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative ileus is one of the most common complications after abdominal surgery. It
      refers to obstipation and intolerance of oral intake due to nonmechanical factors that
      disrupt the normal coordinated propulsive motor activity of the gastrointestinal tract
      following abdominal or nonabdominal surgery. When the expected period of gastrointestinal
      recovery time extends beyond what is acceptable, the patient is diagnosed as having a
      &quot;pathologic&quot; postoperative ileus (POI), which leads to patient discomfort, dissatisfaction,
      prolonged hospitalization and increased medical expenses. The incidence of POI is about
      17%~24% after abdominal surgery. Chinese Medicine Ironing using Foeniculum vulgare has been
      applied in some departments to promote gastrointestinal function recovery as a empiric
      therapy. However, the definite efficacy of Foeniculum vulgare ironing therapy（FIT）is
      uncertain after colorectal resection surgery and whether FIT can reduce the incidence of POI
      remains unkonown.
