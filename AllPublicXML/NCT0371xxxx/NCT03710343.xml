  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will focus on the feasibility of Metformin use in children with cerebral palsy
      (CP) on improving gross motor function. The study design is a phase II, double blind,
      randomized control feasibility trial. Participants will be placed randomly into one of two
      groups based on chance (50/50). The 2 groups are: 1) metformin and 2) placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clinically, children with CP may receive active physiotherapy, and there is support for goal
      directed physiotherapy with a focus on motor function and active motor learning principles to
      enhance motor function in children with CP. For this study, the investigators want to do a
      feasibility study, to see if taking the drug metformin for 16 weeks while doing physiotherapy
      leads to better gross motor function (i.e. controlled body movements) and thinking skills
      when compared to doing physiotherapy alone.

      Participants in both groups will receive goal-directed, active physiotherapy twice a week
      during the same 16 weeks intervention period.

      This study will be done at two different locations in Toronto 1) Holland Bloorview Kids
      Rehabilitation Hospital and 2) the Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids). Each participant
      will be asked to go to both hospitals to do different tests and assessments for the study.
      Fifty participants with bilateral spastic CP age 5 to 12 with evidence of white matter
      imaging (WMI) and gross motor function classification system (GMFCS) levels II-V will be
      recruited for participation. MRI, cognitive testing and questionnaires will be conducted at
      SickKids where paediatric protocols and processes have been developed.

    <description>Safety will be measured by the Safety Monitoring Uniform Report Form (SMURF). The SMURF consists of semi-structured interview questions that capture participants' perceptions of potential AEs and study procedures. It has been modified to assess AEs that are metformin-specific such as the potential for lactic acidosis, fatigue, difficulty breathing, dizziness, irregular heartbeat, sweating, changes in vision, coordination, confusion and seizures. Participants will be asked to indicate 'Yes' or 'No' to a wide range of potential AEs. Incidence of AEs will be compared between each treatment group (metformin/placebo).</description>

    <measure>Gross Motor Function Measure-66</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in Gross Motor Function Measure-66 (GMFM-66) from baseline to 40 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participant's gross motor function will be measured by the Gross Motor Function Measure-66 (GMFM-66). The GMFM-66 is an interval-level measure of foundational gross motor skills. Participant is measured on a continuum from 0 (low motor ability) to 100 (high motor ability). Two forms of the GMFM: the original 88-item GMFM, which yields a total score and scores in five dimensions (lying &amp; rolling, sitting, crawling &amp; kneeling, standing, walking, running &amp; jumping); and the GMFM-66 (66 of the 88 items) with interval scaling. Individual items on the GMFM are scored on a 4-point ordinal scale; 1 indicates that the child initiates the task (completes &lt; 10% of the activity); 2 indicates that the child partially completes the task (completes from 10 to 99% of the activity); 3 indicates that the child completes the task (100%); and NT indicates that the child was not tested. Scores vary from a minimum of 0 (scores of 0 on all items) to 100 (scores of 3 on all items).</description>

    <measure>Wechsler Scales of Intelligence</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in Wechsler Scales of Intelligence measures from baseline to 40 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Wechsler Scales of Intelligence provide a brief measure of overall intelligence. WASI-II is applicable for people aged 6.0 to 90.11 years of age. For participants who are 5.0 to 5.9 years of age, the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence - Fourth Edition (WPPSI - IV) will be used instead. The WASI groups ability into two areas: Verbal Comprehension Index (VCI), which measures verbal ability, and Perceptual Reasoning Index (PRI), which involves the manipulation of materials or processing of visual stimuli to solve problems. There is also a full-scale IQ score. Both indexes and the IQ score have standard scores with a mean of 100, and scores of 90 to 110 falling into the Average range. The WPPSI - IV measures ability across five areas of cognitive functioning: Verbal Comprehension, Visual Spatial, Fluid Reasoning, Working Memory, and Processing Speed. A full scale IQ composite score is derived from these subtests.</description>

    <measure>Change in spasticity as measured by the Modified Tardieu Scale from baseline to 40 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in MTS measure from baseline to 40 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by the Modified Tardieu Scale (MTS), which consists of performing a passive muscle stretch at two velocities, slow and fast. The rater measures the angle of the spastic catch in the fast stretch (defined as R1) and then measures the passive range of motion during the slow stretch (defined as R2) in the ankle plantar flexors and knee flexors bilaterally. The difference between R2 and R1 will be the measure of the dynamic component of spasticity. Results are presented on a scale ranging from 0-4 where decreased scores indicate less resistance, which is considered to be a better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Change in health and social service resource utilization as measured by the Resource Use Questionaire - Cerebral Palsy from baseline to 40 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in health and social service resource utilization from baseline to 40 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by the Resource Use Questionnaire-CP (RUQ-CP). This instrument is designed to measure family resource use of cerebral palsy-related treatments, services and programs. Categories included are: School Programs; Speech-Language or Communication Services; Occupational Therapy or Physiotherapy; Child-Focused Recreational Activities; Medications; Additional Services; Purchased Materials, Equipment; Time Associated with Treatment and Care; and Government Tax Deductions, Subsidies and Other Financial Supports. The outcome is measured in dollars and subsequently bounded by $0 at the low end and unbounded at the high end. The RUQ-CP provides no guidance regarding better or worse, rather it reports dollars spent where a higher value reflects a greater level of expenditure. Cost categories are summed to form an estimate of total utilization.</description>
