  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ablation of pulmonary veins is a very effective treatment for the treatment of paroxysmal
      atrial fibrillation. The benefit of the isolation of pulmonary veins in persistent atrial
      fibrillation seems to be minor and the level of scientific evidence available requires
      additional clinical trials to define the value of ablation in this type of patients.

      The symptomatology of atrial fibrillation recurrences is variable among patients and among
      differens moments in the same patient. Pharmacological treatment and ablation have been used
      to reduce the symptomatology of atrial fibrillation recurrences and to increase the
      proportion of asymptomatic recurrences. Different forms of electrical monitoring of the heart
      rate are used to evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention. Frequents monitoring periods
      provide the information of the heart rate and the effect of any intervention.

      The &quot;Confirm RX heart monitor® (Abbott)&quot; is a subcutaneous implantable device that provides
      continuous monitoring of the heart rate for more than 3 years without any effect on cardiac
      function. This implantable Holter automatically detects and saves atrial and ventricular
      arrhythmic episodes. The device can be analyzed in person or remotely, and can help to make
      decisions regarding anticoagulant and antiarrhythmic treatment of patients, while
      representing a powerful research tool for evaluate the effectiveness of different therapeutic
      options.

      This is a prospective, randomized, multicenter study that compares the relative efficacy and
      safety of cryoablation of pulmonary veins using the Arctic Front Advance® balloon catheter
      with antiarrhythmic treatment in patients with persistent atrial fibrilation.
