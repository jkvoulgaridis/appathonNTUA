  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the treatment efficacy of tinnitus in people with mild hearing loss.
      One-third of participants will use hearing aid, one-third of participants will use customized
      music, while the other one-third participants will receive no treatment (waiting list
      control).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acoustic stimulation could induce plastic changes in the auditory cortex, and tinnitus
      mechanisms have been viewed as a negative consequence of neural plasticity in the central
      nervous system after peripheral aggression. Cortical changes (neural activity in the
      deafferented cortical area was reduced but the adjacent frequencies of the hearing loss
      region activated more extensive cortical areas) occur after sensorineural hearing loss, while
      exposure to an acoustically enriched environment or using hearing aids may minimize or
      reverse the plastic tonotopic map changes in the auditory cortex. The use of hearing aids in
      tinnitus management for people with significant hearing loss will always be associated with
      an improvement in hearing handicap and quality of life, and that complicates the
      interpretation of how much hearing aids specifically affect tinnitus. Thus studies on
      tinnitus patients with mild hearing loss could be illuminating, and this population will be
      targeted in the present study.

    <measure>The Tinnitus Functional Index (Chinese version) (TFI-CH)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline value at 3 months, 6 months and 12 months after the first day of treatment will be measured.</time_frame>
    <description>TFI-CH is a 25-item self-administered questionnaire which assesses eight domains of tinnitus impact: intrusiveness; sense of control; cognitive; sleep; auditory; relaxation; quality of life (QoL); emotion. The total TFI score ranges 0 - 100, the higher score is indicative of greater problem with tinnitus.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Tinnitus Questionnaire (Chinese version) (TQ-CH) scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline value at 3 months, 6 months and 12 months after the first day of treatment will be measured.</time_frame>
    <description>The TQ-CH is a 52-item questionnaire which assesses five dimensions of tinnitus complaint: emotional distress; auditory perceptual difficulties; intrusiveness; sleep disturbance; and somatic complaints. The total TQ score ranges 0 - 104, the higher score is indicative of greater problem with tinnitus.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (Chinese version) (THI-CH) scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline value at 3 months, 6 months and 12 months after the first day of treatment will be measured.</time_frame>
    <description>The THI-CH is a reliable 25-item self-administered Chinese QoL tool that quantifies the impact of tinnitus on daily living. The total THI score ranges 0 - 100, the higher score is indicative of greater tinnitus handicap.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-rated Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) on tinnitus loudness</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline value at 3 months, 6 months and 12 months after the first day of treatment will be measured.</time_frame>
    <description>The subjects will be asked to rate the perceived loudness of their tinnitus on VAS, with &quot;inaudible&quot; (scale rating value = 0) and &quot;very loud&quot; (scale rating value = 100) as reference points for the ends of the scale. The higher rating is indicative of louder tinnitus.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tinnitus loudness matches at the tinnitus frequency and at 1000 Hz</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline values at 3 months, 6 months and 12 months after the first day of treatment will be measured.</time_frame>
    <description>Tinnitus loudness matches will be done according to Vernon and Meikle's procedure</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Chinese Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline value at 3 months, 6 months and 12 months after the first day of treatment will be measured.</time_frame>
    <description>The Chinese HADS is a 14-item questionnaire that consists of two subscales that measure anxiety and depression. It serves as an outcome measure targeting psychological and mental health effects.</description>
