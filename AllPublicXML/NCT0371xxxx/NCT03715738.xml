  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast asymmetry is a rare in plastic surgery. In majority of cases, it is idiopathic.

      In cases that are poorly tolerated physically (vertebral imbalance, posture disorders) or
      psychologically, the decision to perform breast symmetrization surgery can be made. It is
      recommended to do this surgery after a slimming treatment if the woman is overweight or after
      pregnancy that causes a change in the structure and volume of the chest. In fact, the weight
      variations deteriorate the long-term result.

      However, this surgical management remains difficult. In fact, the volume to be removed
      (unilateral breast reduction) to be symmetrized is a function of the volume of the
      contralateral breast and the preoperative drawings are made while standing. Currently, the
      evaluation of the volume to be removed remains subjective and is based on the experience of
      the surgeon. In addition, intraoperatively, this evaluation is also subjective because the
      patient is lying down which changes the position of the anatomical landmarks: the
      optimization of the symmetrization is only possible by the eye and the touch.

      No measuring device is currently used to assess the difference in volume between the 2
      breasts and guide the surgeon in the volume (or weight) to remove. It is therefore sometimes
      necessary to perform a second intervention in case of residual postoperative asymmetry.

      Primary objective :

      To study the association between the weight of tissues removed during the intervention and
      the variation of the breast volume (pre / postoperative) measured by the Créaform® GOPRO 3D
      digital camera adjusted on the density of the gland measured by electronic palpation
      (MyotonPRO).

      Second objective : To study the association between the weight of tissues removed during the
      procedure and the variation of the breast volume (pre / postoperative) measured by the
      Créaform® GOPRO 3D digital camera adjusted on the density of the gland estimated by manual
      palpation (Likert scale from 1 to 5).

    <description>A clinical questionnaire is completed by the investigator (chest circumference, thorax turn, breast &quot;measurements&quot;).
The breast density is assessed by the surgeon and scored from 1 to 5 (Likert scale) and then by the MyotonPRO The volumetric measurement of the breast is performed using the 3D digital camera. The patient is bent forward with hands resting on a chair during 30 seconds to 1 minute. The 3D digital camera rotates around the breast to capture the volume of the breast.
Intraoperatively, the weight of tissues removed is weighed (in grams), recorded in the observation notebook.
In post-operative (4 months), the possible long-term complications related to the intervention (mainly the dissatisfaction of the patient as for the aesthetic result) are collected then a new acquisition of the mammary volume is carried out with the digital camera 3D.
Once this measurement is completed, participation in the study is complete</description>

estimation of the volume of the breast to be reduced with the 3D digital camera
measurement of breast density by Likert scale and MyotonPRO
The volumetric measurement of the breast is performed using the 3D digital camera. The patient is bent forward with hands resting on a chair to be as still as possible over a period of 30 seconds to 1 minute. The 3D digital camera rotates around the breast to capture the volume of the breast.
In peroperative, the weight of tissues removed is weighed (in grams). The removed weight is recorded in the observation notebook.
In postoperative (4 months), the possible long-term complications related to the intervention (mainly the dissatisfaction of the patient as for the aesthetic result) are collected then a new acquisition of the mammary volume is carried out with the digital camera 3D.
Once this measurement is completed, participation in the study is complete.</description>
