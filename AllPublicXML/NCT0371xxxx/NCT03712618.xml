    <textblock>
      Background:

      Platelets are cell fragments in the blood that help it clot. Some people get very low
      platelet counts during a disease or treatment. Low platelet counts can cause severe bleeding.
      Some people are not helped by platelet transfusions at the standard transfusion rate. This is
      called platelet transfusion refractoriness (PTR). Researchers want to learn more about
      transfusing platelets so they can make transfusions more effective.

      Objectives:

      To study the effects of transfusing platelets more slowly than the standard rate. To obtain
      data to improve the effectiveness of platelet transfusions in people with PTR and decrease
      the risk of bleeding in some people.

      Eligibility:

      Adults ages 18-100 who have very low platelet counts requiring platelet transfusion, and have
      evidence of PTR

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with a review their recent NIH medical records. They will have
      blood drawn.

      Participants will have up to three 12-hour treatment blocks. They can have only one block per
      day. During each block, they will have 2 platelet transfusions in those 12 hours.

      One transfusion will take place over 1 hour (SHORT infusion). The other will take place over
      4 hours (LONG infusion).

      Participants will be randomly put in 1 of 2 treatment groups. This will dictate whether they
      get the SHORT or LONG infusion first.

      Participants will have blood drawn:

        -  When they enroll

        -  Right before each transfusion

        -  2, 4, and 6 hours after each transfusion

      Each blood draw will consist of a complete blood count. Smaller tubes that require only small
      amounts of blood will be used to minimize the amount of blood drawn.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Platelet transfusion can be a life-saving procedure in preventing or treating serious
      bleeding in patients who have low and/or dysfunctional platelets. Treatment of blood cancer
      and other blood diseases, as well as bone marrow transplantation, is not possible without
      platelet transfusion support. Unfortunately, 15- 25% of chronically transfused patients
      platelet counts will stop responding to these transfusions, putting them at risk for serious
      bleeding complications. The development of HLA antibodies is responsible for 4- 8% of this
      platelet transfusion refractoriness. The presence of HLA antibodies is a clinical
      complication that is generally managed by the selection of products that are negative for the
      antigens for which the patient has antibodies. Often, for patients with chronic and ongoing
      need, this selection is facilitated by targeted recruitment of donors with known HLA types
      (i.e., types that lack antigens cognate to the patient s known antibodies and are thus
      predicted to be compatible). However, for very broadly HLA- alloimmunized patients,
      compatible products may be exceedingly scarce or completely unavailable, precluding the
      ability to consistently provide products the patient will likely increment from. This
      research protocol is designed to evaluate the efficacy of a 4-HOUR continuous infusion of
      single donor, apheresis platelets in overcoming both alloimmune-mediated and
      non-alloimmune-mediated platelet refractoriness. We hypothesize that when we transfuse
      patients over a long duration, who have platelet refractoriness, the platelet counts will
      increase to higher numbers for an extended period of time in the peri-transfusion period when
      compared to shorter transfusion intervals.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Ability to comprehend the investigational nature of the study and provide informed
             consent

          -  Thrombocytopenia

               -  Causes of thrombocytopenia may be due to:

                    1. Congenital causes

                    2. Bone marrow

                    3. Hematologic malignancies

                    4. Treatment related

               -  Thrombocytopenia is generally defined as one of the following:

                    1. &lt;10K/uL without bleeding

                    2. &lt;20K/uL for &quot;complicated prophylaxis&quot; in patient s determined to be at
                       increased risk of bleeding or other complications

                    3. &lt;50K/uL with evidence of active bleeding, such as intracranial hemorrhage,
                       GI bleeding, pulmonary hemorrhage, uncontrolled epistaxis, hematuria.

                       The treating provider may change the platelet transfusion threshold based on
                       the clinical circumstance, patient population, and/or concurrent primary
                       protocol considerations - similar to the PLADO study.

          -  Diagnosed with PTR, characterized by the following:

               -  Lack of adequate post-transfusion platelet count increment, defined by, CCI
                  &lt;5000/ul at 10-60 min after each of at least 2 consecutive platelet transfusions

               -  Presence of anti-HLA class 1 type A and/or type B antibody, in the setting of
                  PTR, as defined above, constitutes the HLA alloimmune-mediated subtype of PTR.
                  Presence of one or more HPA antibodies in the setting of PTR, as defined
                  above,constitutes the HPA alloimmune-mediated subtype of PTR. Failure to detect
                  HLA or HPA antibodies will be categorized as non-alloimmune-mediated PTR. .

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Less than 18-years-old

          -  Lack of ability to obtain informed consent

          -  Presence of ITP/autoimmune thrombocytopenia

          -  Immune platelet refractoriness responsive to treatment with IVIg or eculizumab, or
             other immunosuppressive therapy within the 3 preceding months. This is based on the
             wide variation in the duration therapeutic antibodies, with the upper limit frequently
             cited as 3 months.
