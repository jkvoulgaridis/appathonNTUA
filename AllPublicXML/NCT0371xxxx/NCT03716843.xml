  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) involves three-dimensional spinal deformity in children
      aged between 10 and 16. Traditional braces modify the natural dynamics and thus the
      mechanical behaviour of the scoliotic spine through external constraints. Patients usually
      develop pressure ulcers and skin irritation when prescribed brace treatment for 18-23 hours
      per day. The excessive pressure, unknown pressure distribution and pressure shifting between
      the human body and the brace causes the effects of brace treatment to be unpredictable.
      Dynamic pressure monitoring system will be developed based on the body landmarks of scoliotic
      patients and critical areas where active pressure is applied by the brace. The overall
      pressure distribution and dynamic pressure between the body and the thoraco-lumbo-sacral
      orthosis (TLSO) rigid brace will be measured. The efficacy of the brace design will be
      evaluated, and the maximum compressive stresses that patients can endure on different body
      parts without pressure injury can be computed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Global rates of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) range from 0.9% to 12%, and within this
      population, approximately 10% of adolescents aged 10-16 will eventually need treatment. The
      most common conservative treatment is bracing, in which AIS patients are prescribed a brace
      for 18 to 23 hours daily until skeletally mature. The objective of bracing is to stop curve
      progression and restore normal alignment of the spine by active pressure from the brace.
      There is strong clinical evidence of a positive correlation between the tightness of daily
      brace application and the ability of the brace to decrease the risk of curve progression to a
      surgical threshold. However, patients suffer physical and functional discomfort resulting
      from pressure points, including pressure ulcers, skin irritation and even asthma attacks,
      which reduces compliance with brace treatment. Clearly, the knowledge of human body responses
      to pressure applied by brace treatment remains lacking.

      This multi-disciplinary collaborative study involves experts in electrical and electronic
      engineering, orthopaedics, materials science and textiles, and biomechanics. A revolutionary
      pressure measurement system that integrates fibre optic sensors with textile yarns will be
      developed in the form of an undergarment. The sensor arrangement in the undergarment will be
      designed according to the body landmarks of scoliotic patients and critical areas where
      active pressure is applied by the brace. The overall pressure distribution and dynamic
      pressure between the body and the scoliosis brace will be measured. The efficacy of the brace
      design will be evaluated, and the maximum compressive stresses that patients can endure on
      different body parts without pressure injury can be computed.

      Academia, clinicians and AIS patients are predicted to benefit from using the pressure
      system, which determines the optimum pressure to be exerted on patients while minimizing
      pressure injuries. The output of the project can be extended to the standardization of
      pressure levels applied by different orthotic devices and will add a new dimension to fibre
      optic applications in biomechanics.

    <time_frame>6 month</time_frame>
    <description>A visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain due to the brace, a VAS for motivation and a VAS for quality of life graded 0 to 100 mm will also be used. For pain, 0 represents the absence of pain as a motivation, and 0 represents the absence of discomfort in daily life. Statistical analysis will be performed to determine the relationship between the level of brace correction force and effect. After this relationship is established, patients will no longer suffer unnecessary strain and pain caused by the brace. Optimum correction force will be achieved with higher patient comfort, reducing the possibility of developing pressure ulcers and improving user compliance.</description>

    <description>The pressure measurement undergarment will be given to all consenting AIS patients who have received their own thoraco-lumbo-sacral orthosis (TLSO) rigid brace. Each patient will wear the undergarment first and the TLSO brace on top. FBG sensors embedded in the undergarment will measure each pressure signal at approximately 2 minutes. The average force reading will be calculated.
Then, the experiment will be repeated once, but the anisotropic textile brace will replace the TLSO brace. The pressure measurement system will be used to obtain an accurate and adequate comparison of the forces applied to the patients. The effectiveness of the anisotropic textile brace will be evaluated through X-ray radiography, and its correction effect with be compared with that of the TLSO brace.</description>

        performed with up to two different braces tried on the same patient in one spinal centre in
