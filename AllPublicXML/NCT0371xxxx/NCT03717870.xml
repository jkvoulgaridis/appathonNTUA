  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endometriosis is an estrogen-dependent chronic disease, characterized by the presence of
      endometrial-like tissue, glands and stroma outside the uterine cavity. Although endometriosis
      is classified in four stage (minimal, mild, moderate, severe), from the clinical point of
      view it is possible to subdivide among peritoneal superficial lesions, ovarian endometriomas
      and Deep Infiltrating Endometriosis (DIE).

      According to the European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) Guideline on
      the management of women with endometriosis, it is recommended to clinicians that in infertile
      women with endometrioma larger than 3 cm, cystectomy should be considered prior to Assisted
      Reproduction Technology (ART) to improve endometriosis-associated pain or the accessibility
      of follicles. They further recommend that clinicians counsel women with endometrioma
      regarding the risks of reduced ovarian function after surgery, the possible loss of the
      ovary, and consider that the decision to proceed with surgery should be taken carefully if
      the woman has had previous ovarian surgery.

      In addition, this Guideline suggests that clinicians can prescribe prolonged (3-6 months)
      pituitary downregulation with Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone-agonists (GnRH-a) prior to ART,
      in order to increase live birth rate by four-fold.

      Despite these recommendations, to date there is not robust evidence to choose between the two
      strategies prior to ART in order to improve reproductive outcomes.

      For this reason, the aim of the current study will be to compare reproductive outcomes in
      infertile women affected by ovarian endometrioma, undergoing laparoscopic enucleation or
      prolonged pituitary downregulation with GnRH-a, prior to ART.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Indication for ART: compromised tubal function, male factor infertility, other
             treatments have failed and/or prolonged infertility of more than 4 years.

          -  Age between 18 and 35 years.

          -  Ultrasound diagnosis of one ovarian endometriotic cyst with a diameter of 30 mm or
             more, according to the International Ovarian Tumor Analysis (IOTA)-criteria for
             reliable diagnosis of endometriomas in premenopausal women.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any comorbidity other than ovarian endometrioma.

          -  Deep Infiltrating Endometriosis.
