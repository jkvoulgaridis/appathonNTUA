  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to identify how much and how often pralatrexate, given with
      vitamin B12 and folic acid, can be given safely to patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma
      (CTCL) that has relapsed (returned after responding to previous treatment) or is refractory
      (has not responded to previous treatment). It is also being conducted to get information on
      whether or not pralatrexate is effective in treating relapsed or refractory CTCL.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, single-arm, open-label, multi-center study designed to determine an
      effective and well-tolerated dose and schedule of pralatrexate when administered concurrently
      with vitamin B12 and folic acid supplementation to patients with relapsed or refractory CTCL.
      The start of study treatment is defined as the initiation of pralatrexate. A patient may
      begin pralatrexate, provided he/she has methylmalonic acid (MMA) serum concentrations &lt; 200
      nmol/L and homocysteine (Hcy) concentrations &lt; 10 μmol/L at screening. If a patient has
      elevated MMA and/or Hcy concentrations, vitamin supplementation will be initiated at least 10
      days prior to pralatrexate initiation. Once the patient is on study, the dosing of vitamin
      supplementation must adhere to the schedule defined by the protocol. Vitamin supplementation
      will consist of vitamin BB12

      1 mg intramuscular (IM) every (q) 8-10 weeks, and folic acid 1 mg by mouth (PO) once a day
      (QD).

    <time_frame>Assessed at the end of every even-numbered cycle (every 8 weeks) for the first 6 months, then every 4 cycles (16 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Response rate was used as the primary measure of efficacy during the process of identifying a well-tolerated and effective dosing regimen of pralatrexate in patients with relapsed/refractory CTCL. Duration of response was defined as the number of days between the date of first tumor response assessment of objective response (CR, CRu, or PR, whichever was recorded first) and the first date that recurrent disease or PD was objectively documented or death.</description>

    <time_frame>Assessed at all study visits: weekly while on treatment and at safety follow-up (35 +/- 5 days post-last dose) or early termination visit (at time of withdrawal)</time_frame>
    <description>The safety analysis set included all patients who received at least 1 dose of pralatrexate. In order to be considered evaluable in the dose-finding phase of the study, patients must have
(a) either experienced a DLT or (b) received all planned doses within the first cycle. Patients who terminated from the study prior to completion of cycle 1 for reasons other than DLTs were replaced.</description>
