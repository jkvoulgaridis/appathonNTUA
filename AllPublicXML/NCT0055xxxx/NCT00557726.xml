      This protocol is being established to cover the evaluation of patients with inflammatory
      and/or infectious diseases which are not covered under previously existing protocols. The
      purpose of such a protocol is that frequently patients are referred to us with either
      diagnosed or undiagnosed illnesses which would be of interest to our teaching program or
      which would serve as a source of patients to subsequently be entered into established,
      ongoing protocol studies. Such patients will be admitted to the protocol and handled
      according to accepted medical practice of diagnosis and treatment.
