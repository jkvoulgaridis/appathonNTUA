      RATIONALE: Estrogen can cause the growth of breast cancer cells. Letrozole may fight breast
      cancer by lowering the amount of estrogen the body makes. It is not yet known which regimen
      of letrozole is more effective in postmenopausal women who have received hormone therapy for
      early-stage breast cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is comparing two different regimens of letrozole in
      preventing cancer in postmenopausal women who have received 4-6 years of hormone therapy for
      hormone receptor-positive, lymph node-positive, early-stage breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Compare the disease-free survival (DFS) of postmenopausal women treated with continuous
           letrozole for 5 years vs intermittent letrozole over a 5-year period.

      Secondary

        -  Compare overall survival of patients treated with these two regimens.

        -  Compare distant DFS of these patients.

        -  Compare breast cancer-free interval of these patients.

        -  Compare sites of first DFS failure in these patients.

        -  Compare second (nonbreast) malignancies in these patients.

        -  Compare deaths without prior cancer events in these patients.

        -  Compare adverse events resulting from these two regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to treatment center
      and type of prior endocrine therapy (selective estrogen receptor modulators [SERMs] alone vs
      aromatase inhibitors [AIs] alone vs both SERMs and AIs each for at least 1 month). Patients
      are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral letrozole daily for 5 years.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral letrozole daily for the first 9 months of years 1 through
           4, followed by 12 months in year 5.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed annually.

Any known untoward event that occurs subsequent to the adverse event reporting period that the investigator assesses as possibly related to the protocol treatment should be considered an adverse event. Symptoms of the targeted cancer (if applicable) should not be reported as adverse events.</desc>
