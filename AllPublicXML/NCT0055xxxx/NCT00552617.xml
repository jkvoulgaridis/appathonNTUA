  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the trial was to establish the dose-response relation of sugammadex (Org
      25969) given as a reversal agent of rocuronium or vecuronium at reappearance of T2 (the
      amplitude of the first response of second twitch to train of four (TOF) stimulation,
      expressed as percentage of control first twitch, T1) during sevoflurane anesthesia for
      Caucasian participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For most surgical procedures a depth of neuromuscular block of 1-2 twitches after
      TOF-stimulation is sufficient to avoid unwanted muscular activity. At reappearance of T2, the
      anesthesiologist might decide to either give (another) maintenance dose of rocuronium or
      vecuronium when surgery continues, to await spontaneous recovery of neuromuscular block or to
      reverse the neuromuscular block. Sugammadex has been shown in previous trials to greatly
      reduce the time to full recovery when administered at reappearance of T2, both after
      rocuronium- and vecuronium induced neuromuscular blockade. The current trial P05971 was
      conducted in Europe and set up to establish the dose response relationship of sugammadex
      given during sevoflurane anesthesia at reappearance of T2 after rocuronium or vecuronium in
      Caucasian participants. In addition to recovery time, also pharmacokinetics and safety of
      sugammadex were to be evaluated.

    <description>Neuromuscular functioning was monitored by applying repetitive Train-Of-Four (TOF) electrical stimulations to the ulnar nerve every 15 seconds and assessing twitch response at the adductor pollicis muscle. T1 and T4 refer to the amplitudes (heights) of the first and fourth twitches, respectively, after TOF nerve stimulation. The T4/T1 Ratio (expressed as a decimal of up to 1.0) indicates the extent of recovery from neuromuscular blockade (NMB). In this study, twitch responses were recorded until the T4/T1 Ratio reached &gt;= 0.9, the minimum acceptable ratio that indicated recovery from NMB. A faster time to recovery of the T4/T1 Ratio to 0.9 indicates a faster recovery from NMB.</description>

        <title>Time From Start of Administration of Sugammadex or Placebo to Recovery of the Fourth Twitch/First Twitch (T4/T1) Ratio to 0.9</title>
        <description>Neuromuscular functioning was monitored by applying repetitive Train-Of-Four (TOF) electrical stimulations to the ulnar nerve every 15 seconds and assessing twitch response at the adductor pollicis muscle. T1 and T4 refer to the amplitudes (heights) of the first and fourth twitches, respectively, after TOF nerve stimulation. The T4/T1 Ratio (expressed as a decimal of up to 1.0) indicates the extent of recovery from neuromuscular blockade (NMB). In this study, twitch responses were recorded until the T4/T1 Ratio reached &gt;= 0.9, the minimum acceptable ratio that indicated recovery from NMB. A faster time to recovery of the T4/T1 Ratio to 0.9 indicates a faster recovery from NMB.</description>

          <title>Time From Start of Administration of Sugammadex or Placebo to Recovery of the T4/T1 Ratio to 0.8</title>
          <description>Neuromuscular functioning was monitored by applying repetitive TOF electrical stimulations to the ulnar nerve every 15 seconds and assessing twitch response at the adductor pollicis muscle. T1 and T4 refer to the amplitudes (heights) of the first and fourth twitches, respectively, after TOF nerve stimulation. The T4/T1 Ratio (expressed as a decimal of up to 1.0) indicates the extent of recovery from NMB. A faster time to recovery of the T4/T1 Ratio to 0.8 indicates a faster recovery from NMB.</description>
          <population>All randomized participants who received sugammadex or placebo; without any protocol violations, and who had at least one post baseline efficacy measurement, who had a TOF trace, had a reliable TOF trace, and where drug administration did not interfere with the effect of rocuronium or vecuronium.</population>
