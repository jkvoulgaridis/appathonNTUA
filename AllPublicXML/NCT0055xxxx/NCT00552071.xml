  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately half of patients with acromegaly do not respond to treatment with somatostatin
      receptor ligands such as octreotide LAR. This may be due to inadequate drug delivery if the
      standard of care regular injection is inaccurately delivered in the intramuscular (IM)
      compartment. Ultrasound guidance of IM injections may improve accuracy of placement of IM
      injections and increase drug levels, thereby improving efficacy of octreotide LAR for the
      treatment of acromegaly. The purpose of this study is to determine whether octreotide LAR
      drug levels differ if given by ultrasound-guided IM injection or by regular IM injection in
      patients with acromegaly.

      <recruitment_details>This study recruited subjects with active acromegaly. Equal numbers of men and women were to be recruited, but the recruitment plan was adjusted during the course of the trial to account for the high number of women withdrawn from the study. 12 women and 9 men were recruited; 8 men and 7 women completed the study and were included in the analysis.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Subjects who had not received 3 monthly injections of a stable dose of octreotide LAR prior to enrollment were given 3 monthly injections of octreotide LAR at a stable dose of 30 mg every 28 days or at a dose determined by historical dosing. Nine of the 15 subjects participated in this run-in period.</pre_assignment_details>
