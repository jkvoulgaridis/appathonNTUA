  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the trial was to show equivalence in recovery from neuromuscular block after
      a single dose of 4.0 mg/kg sugammadex, administered at first twitch (T1) 3-10% after
      continuous infusion of rocuronium, between participants receiving maintenance anesthesia
      using propofol and participants receiving sevoflurane, to investigate the safety and to
      compare the plasma levels of rocuronium in participants after continuous infusion of
      rocuronium and before the administration of sugammadex, under either propofol or sevoflurane
      anesthesia.

    <description>Neuromuscular functioning was monitored by applying repetitive Train of Four (TOF) electrical stimulations to the ulnar nerve every 15 seconds and assessing twitch response at the adductor pollicis muscle. T1 and T4 refer to the amplitudes (heights) of the first and fourth twitches, respectively, after TOF nerve stimulation. The T4/T1 ratio (expressed as a decimal from 0 [loss of T4] up to 1.0 [no NMB]) indicates the extent of recovery from NMB. In this study, twitch responses were recorded until the T4/T1 Ratio reached &gt;= 0.9, the minimum acceptable ratio that indicated recovery from NMB. A faster time to recovery of the T4/T1 ratio to 0.9 indicates a faster recovery from NMB.</description>

        <title>Mean Time From Start of Administration of Sugammadex to Recovery of the T4/T1 Ratio to 0.7</title>
        <description>Neuromuscular functioning was monitored by applying repetitive TOF electrical stimulations to the ulnar nerve every 15 seconds and assessing twitch response at the adductor pollicis muscle. T1 and T4 refer to the amplitudes (heights) of the first and fourth twitches, respectively, after TOF nerve stimulation. The T4/T1 ratio (expressed as a decimal from 0 [loss of T4] up to 1.0 [no NMB]) indicates the extent of recovery from NMB. A faster time to recovery of the T4/T1 ratio to 0.7 indicates a faster recovery from NMB.</description>
