      Back pain is a common and expensive medical condition. Although rarely life-threatening, back
      disorders are a major cause of pain, disability, and social cost affecting the quality of
      life in most patients. Although primary care providers routinely treat back pain, little is
      known about how often primary care providers manage occupation-related symptoms and how
      outcomes compare with other treatment modalities. Treatment outcomes utilizing a
      non-operative treatment paradigm have not been adequately studied. This paradigm consists of
      treating patients sequentially with analgesics, physical therapy, use of back supports,
      caudal epidural steroid injections, or surgical referral. The use of spinal supports as a
      complimentary treatment along with physical therapy and posture education is promising.

    <description>numeric pain scale was used to determine pain at 1 week intervals starting from week 1 to week 24. Pain scores were determined by the numeric pain score of 1 to 10 (1 being the least painful to 10 being the highest level of pain) then summed up and averaged at 24 time points at 1 week intervals starting from week 1 to week 24.</description>

Pain scores were determined by the numeric pain score of 1 to 10 (1 being the least painful to 10 being the highest level of pain) then summed up and averaged at 24 time points at 1 week intervals starting from week 1 to week 24.</description>
