  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 24 week double-blind study in which subjects will be randomized 2:1 to receive
      Xolair (Omalizumab) or placebo. 14 subjects will receive Xolair and 7 will receive placebo.
      Xolair injections will occur every 2-4 weeks. Aspirin desensitization will occur several
      weeks later. One month after desensitization, the final visit will occur in the GCRC.

      We hypothesize that administration of Xolair, a monoclonal anti-IgE antibody, prior to the
      aspirin desensitization will reduce severity of aspirin-induced reaction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 24 week double-blind study consisting of up to 11 office visits for people 18 years
      of age with aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD). 21 subjects will participate and
      will be randomized 2:1 to receive Xolair (Omalizumab) or placebo. 14 subjects will receive
      Xolair and 7 will receive placebo. Xolair is a FDA approved medication for the treatment of
      moderate to severe allergic asthma. Injections will occur every 2-4 weeks, for 16 weeks. The
      dosage will be based upon IgE and body weight. Aspirin desensitization will occur 1-3 weeks
      later. One month after desensitization, the final visit will occur in the GCRC.

      Properly selected patients with aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) experience
      benefit in the course of their disease with aspirin desensitization treatment; however, AERD
      patients are at risk for potentially serious asthmatic reaction when undergoing aspirin
      desensitization. For this reason, this procedure is currently performed in a monitored
      setting. We hypothesize that administration of Xolair, a monoclonal anti-IgE antibody, prior
      to the aspirin desensitization will reduce severity of aspirin-induced respiratory reaction,
      and that ultimately, use of Xolair will permit this procedure to be performed safely in
      outpatient settings. This protocol also entails obtaining blood and urine samples to assess
      the influence of Xolair, compared with placebo. As aspirin induced reaction occurs via
      heightened release of leukotrienes combined with greater end organ responsiveness to these
      mediators, we also will be quantifying the impact of prior administration of Xolair, compared
      with placebo, on the elevation of urinary LTE4 in association with aspirin challenge and with
      aspirin provoked reaction.
