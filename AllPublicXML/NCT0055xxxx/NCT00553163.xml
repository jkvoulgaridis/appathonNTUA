      There is increasing evidence that worsening of ulcerative colitis (UC) can be provoked by
      psychological stresses. When this protocol was devised, there had been no proper scientific
      studies to find out whether stress reduction can improve the course of UC. Hypnotherapy is a
      technique by which a practitioner induces a temporary trance-like state in patients: while
      they are in this state, the practitioner uses suggestion to induce relaxation as well as
      beneficial modification of the way in which the patient experiences the gut working. In
      previous studies in our lab, we have shown that a single 50 minute session of hypnosis can
      reduce special indicators of inflammation both in the blood-stream and in the lining of the
      lower bowel (rectum). Furthermore, in earlier work by others, hypnosis had been shown to be
      effective in the treatment of patients with irritable bowel syndrome, duodenal ulcer and
      indigestion unassociated with ulcers.

      Many patients with UC need to take the immunosuppressive drug, azathioprine, in addition to a
      5ASA drug, to keep their disease under control. While azathioprine is usually effective in
      maintaining remission of UC, it does require regular drug checks and carries the risk of
      possible side-effects. We undertook a study of hypnotherapy to see whether it can prevent
      relapse (worsening) of UC in patients who normally need to take azathioprine to keep their UC
      inactive. To do this, we planned to ask 66 patients who agreed to participate in the trial to
      stop their azathioprine. They were then to be allocated to receive either gut-focussed
      hypnotherapy (44 patients) or, as a control, non-emotive educational sessions (22 patients)
      once a month for 3 months, with intervening self-hypnosis daily in the active arm. The
      numbers of patients in each group who developed relapse of their UC in a year were recorded.
      We diagnosed relapse from patients' diaries recording diarrhoea and bleeding, and by
      sigmoidoscopy.

      It was hoped that this clinical trial would identify a new drug-free way of reducing the
      chances of relapse in patients with UC.

      SCIENTIFIC ABSTRACT There is increasing evidence that relapse of ulcerative colitis (UC) can
      be provoked by psychological stress. When this study was planned, there were no proper
      scientific studies to find out whether stress reduction can improve the course of UC.
      Hypnotherapy is a technique by which a practitioner induces a temporary trance-like state in
      patients: while they are in this state, the practitioner uses suggestion to induce relaxation
      as well as beneficial modification of the way in which the patient experiences the gut
      working. In previous studies in our lab, we had shown that a single session of hypnosis can
      reduce measures of inflammation at both systemic and rectal mucosal levels. Thus, 50 min of
      gut-focussed hypnosis reduced serum interleukin-6 (IL6) and non-killer (NK) cell numbers in
      circulating blood, as well as rectal mucosal release of interleukin-13 (IL13), substance P
      and histamine. Furthermore, in earlier work by others, hypnosis had been shown to be
      effective in the treatment of patients with irritable bowel syndrome, duodenal ulcer and
      indigestion unassociated with ulcers.

      Many patients with UC need to take the immunosuppressive, azathioprine, in addition to a
      5ASA, to keep their disease in remission. While azathioprine is usually effective in
      maintaining remission of UC, it does require regular drug checks and carries the risk of
      possible side-effects. We undertook a study of hypnotherapy to see whether it could prevent
      relapse of UC in patients who normally need to take azathioprine to keep their UC inactive.
      To do this, we planned to ask 66 patients who agreed to participate in the trial to stop
      their azathioprine. They were then to be allocated to receive either gut-focussed
      hypnotherapy (44 patients) or, as a control, non-emotive educational sessions (22 patients)
      once a month for 3 months, with intervening self-hypnosis daily in the active arm. We then
      recorded relapse rates in each group at 1 year. We diagnosed relapse from patients' diaries
      recording the Simple Clinical Activity Index, and by Baron score &gt;1 at sigmoidoscopy.

      It was hoped that this clinical trial would identify a new drug-free way of reducing the
      chances of relapse in patients with UC withdrawing from treatment with azathioprine.

    <description>IBDQ (standard measure of IBD patients' Quality of life (QoL) (Irvine et al 1982 approx). The IBDQ is a validated and reliable tool to measure of health-related quality of life in adult patients with IBD. The questionnaire consists of 32 questions scored in four domains: bowel symptoms, emotional health, systemic systems and social function. Scores range from 1 (poorest QoL) to 7 (best QoL). Higher scores indicate better QoL. Lowest score 7, highest score 224.</description>

HADS questionnaire consists of a 14 question validated questionnaire, developed to measure anxiety and depression in the hospital setting. Each item is answered by the patient on a four point (0-3) response category so the possible scores range from 0 (minimum) to 21 (maximum) for anxiety and 0 (minimum) to 21 (maximum) for depression.

      <recruitment_details>We aimed to recruit 66 patients from across London, but after &gt;3 years could recruit only 26. Reasons for failure to complete recruitment included the relative rarity of this patient-group (ie with inactive ulcerative colitis (UC) for some years while on thiopurine, willing to stop the drug, and with time to complete the intensive programme).</recruitment_details>
