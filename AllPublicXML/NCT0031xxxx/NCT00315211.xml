      The purposes of this study are:

        -  To determine the overall response rate of patients treated with at least 2 cycles of
           this regimen.

        -  To determine the feasibility and toxicity of the combination of topotecan and docetaxel.

      The main objective of this study was to determine the overall response rate of patients
      treated with at least 2 cycles of topotecan and docetaxel. The secondary objectives were to
      determine the feasibility and toxicities of this combination. The final secondary objective
      is overall survival for patients that received 2 or more cycles.

      Methods: Eligible pts with recurrent small cell lung cancer had to be at least 3 months from
      initial treatment. Pts received Docetaxel 30 mg/m2 IV followed by Topotecan 3 mg/m2 IV Days 1
      and 8 of a 21 day cycle. Disease assessment was done every 2 cycles. Toxicity was measured
      each cycle.
