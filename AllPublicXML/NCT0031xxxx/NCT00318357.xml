      The CARE-HF long-term follow-up trial evaluates the effects of cardiac resynchronization (CR)
      therapy on the mortality of patients from the CARE-HF program for an additional 4 year
      follow-up. Investigators are free to choose whatever available treatment they believe is in
      the patient's best interest.

      The CARE-HF study enrolled 813 patients from 82 centers in 12 European countries (Austria,
      Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland,
      and UK). All patients that were reported to be alive in May 2005 will be asked to
      participate.

      In the CARE-HF LTFU program patients from the CARE-HF trial were asked to be enrolled for an
      additional 4 year follow-up. Investigators were free to choose whatever available treatment
      they believe is in the patient's best interest, however the outcome of the CARE-HF trial
      suggested that all patients should receive CRT therapy on top of Optimal Medical Treatment.

    <description>Long-term mortality with cardiac resynchronization therapy in the Cardiac Resynchronization-Heart Failure (CARE-HF) trial.
The patients that were still alive after closure of the CARE-HF study (2005,NCT00170300), that were willing to participate in the CARE-HF LTFU study continued additional follow-up for 4 years, till end 2009. The reported mortality data is the combined mortality of the CARE-HF and the CARE-HF LTFU study. Study start CARE-HF 2000.</description>
