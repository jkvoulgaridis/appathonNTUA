      Cohort 1 and 2:

      The primary objectives of this study are:

      Part A:

      - To evaluate the steady state pharmacokinetics (PK) of bictegravir (BIC) and confirm the
      dose of the bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (B/F/TAF) 50/200/25 mg fixed dose
      combination (FDC) in HIV-1 infected, virologically suppressed adolescents (12 to &lt; 18 years
      of age) and children (6 to &lt; 12 years of age)

      Parts A and B:

      - To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the adult strength B/F/TAF FDC through Week 24
      in HIV-1 infected, virologically suppressed adolescents (12 to &lt;18 years of age) and children
      (6 to &lt;12 years of age)

      Cohort 3:

      The primary objectives of this study are:

      Part A:

      - To evaluate the steady state PK of BIC and confirm the dose of B/F/TAF 30/120/15 mg FDC in
      HIV-1 infected, virologically suppressed children ≥ 2 years of age weighing ≥ 14 to &lt; 25 kg

      Parts A and B:

      - To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the low dose B/F/TAF FDC tablet through Week 24
      in HIV-1 infected, virologically suppressed children ≥ 2 years of age weighing ≥ 14 to &lt; 25
      kg

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

        Cohort 1: HIV-1 infected adolescents (12 to &lt; 18 years of age and screening weight ≥ 35 kg)
        who are virologically suppressed for ≥ 6 months prior to screening.

        Cohort 2: HIV-1 infected children (6 to &lt; 12 years of age and screening weight ≥ 25 kg) who
        are virologically suppressed for ≥ 6 months prior to screening.

        Cohort 3: HIV-1 infected children (≥ 2 years of age and screening weight of ≥ 14 to &lt; 25
        kg) who are virologically suppressed for ≥ 6 months prior to screening.

          -  Documented plasma HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL on a stable regimen (or undetectable HIV-1
             RNA level according to the local assay being used if the limit of detection is ≥ 50
             copies/mL) for ≥ 6 months preceding the Screening visit. Unconfirmed virologic
             elevations of ≥ 50 copies/mL (transient detectable viremia, or &quot;blip&quot;) prior to
             screening are acceptable. If the lower limit of detection of the local HIV-1 RNA assay
             is &lt; 50 copies/mL (eg, &lt; 20 copies/mL), the plasma HIV-1 RNA level cannot exceed 50
             copies/mL on two consecutive HIV-1 RNA tests.

          -  Stable antiretroviral regimen of 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs)
             in combination with a third agent for a minimum of 6 months prior to the screening
             visit. Individuals undergoing dose modifications to their antiretroviral regimen for
             growth or who are switching medication formulation(s) are considered to be on a stable
             antiretroviral regimen.

          -  Estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m^2 according to the
             Schwartz Formula

          -  No documented or suspected resistance to emtricitabine (FTC), tenofovir (TFV), or
             integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) including, but not limited to, the
             reverse transcriptase resistance mutations K65R and M184V/I

        Note: Other protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply.
