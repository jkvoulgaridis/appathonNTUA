      Study on the registration of coronary heart disease patients undergoing PCI in Chinese's
      population. Get the incidence of adverse events in these patients after PCI, a clear type of
      adverse reaction, forms, influencing factors, to establish risk management processes,
      clinical safety and reasonable treatment, and provide the basis for further research and
      reference.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dual antiplatelet therapy, comprising a low-dose aspirin and a kind of P2Y12 Receptor
      Inhibitors, has been the mainstay of the management in patients with acute coronary syndromes
      and/or undergoing Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI). While variability to P2Y12
      receptor inhibitors is common in patients and is a major cause of adverse cardiovascular
      events. Low response to P2Y12 receptor inhibitors will result high platelet reactivity (HPR)
      and patients who exhibit HPR are at increased risk of atherothrombotic occlusion events. Vice
      versa, high response to P2Y12 receptor inhibitors will lead to low platelet reactivity (LPR)
      and increase the risk of hemorrhage.Now, the absence of a universal definition of therapeutic
      window for different racial and actual clinical situations and lacking the gold standard test
      to quantify it limit the use in clinic practice.So this clinical trial try to use patient's
      platelet reactivity combine with type of adverse reaction, forms, influencing factors to find
      a proper therapeutic windows for P2Y12 receptor inhibitors in Chinese people.
