      The strong relationship between falling and severity of cognitive impairment in the elderly
      is well established. The association premorbid gait and executive disorders suggests that
      they are under tension by the same mechanisms. The gait fortiori neurological are fall risk
      factors. Dysfunctions underlying disorders as Parkinson called march executive disorders are
      subcortical origin involving so the basal ganglia. This study is indeed based on the
      assumption that the dysfunction of the basal ganglia as observed in parkinsonian syndromes
      resulting in disorders of posture and walking, by dysexecutive syndrome, anxiety and the
      contrast vision disorders. These gait exposed to falls and dysexecutive these disorders with
      cognitive impairment and greater susceptibility to confusional states. The executive
      disorders, gait disorders, anxiety, disturbances of vision and especially saccadic eye
      movements, impaired vision contrasts are well established in the degenerative parkinsonian
      syndromes. This study proposes a new approach to assessing gait disorders to define a high
      risk of falling in the presence of parkinsonian walking in the elderly over 75 years.
