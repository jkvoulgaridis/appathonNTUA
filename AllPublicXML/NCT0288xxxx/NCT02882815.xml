    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to collect more data about performance and safety of the device
      called &quot;IrisFITTM PFO occluder&quot;. This data will be used to help more patients who will accept
      treatment with this device in the future.

      Patients will undergo routine examination, procedure and follow-up. Related data will be
      collected and kept in a way that patient info is well protected.

      This is a Post Market Clinical Follow-up study. Informed consent will be obtained from the
      patient or from a legally authorized representative of the patient at screening. The patients
      will be screened (pre-procedure) to determine eligibility for the study. At screening,
      patients will be assessed for study eligibility by the inclusion/exclusion criteria through
      their medical history, demographics and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). Participating
      patients will have their PFO closed using the IrisFITTM PFO Occluder device. The patients
      will undergo a clinical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG), clinical laboratory assessment
      and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). All periprocedural procedures will be performed
      according to site´s standard of care.. The efficacy and safety of the devices will be
      assessed by ECGs, vital signs, physical examination and TTE, which will be done at 1day, at
      1month and at 6 months post procedure. Safety will also be assessed at 12 months by telephone
      visit.
