        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject must read, understand, and sign the STATEMENT OF INFORMED CONSENT and
             receive a fully executed copy of the form.

          2. The subject must appear able and willing to adhere to the instructions set forth in
             this clinical protocol.

          3. The subject must be between 35 and 42 years of age (inclusive).

          4. The subject's vertex corrected spherical equivalent distance refraction must be in the
             range of -6.00 Diopters (D) to +4.00 D in each eye.

          5. The subject's refractive cylinder must be â‰¤ 0.75 D in each eye.

          6. The subject must have best corrected visual acuity of 20/30 or better in each eye.

          7. The subject must be an adapted soft contact lens wearer in both eyes (defined as a
             minimum of 6 hours of Daily Wear (DW) for a minimum of 1 month prior to the study).

          8. The subject must have normal eyes (i.e., no ocular medications or infections of any
             type).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Currently pregnant or lactating (subjects who become pregnant during the study will be
             discontinued).

          2. Any ocular or systemic allergies or diseases that may interfere with contact lens
             wear.

          3. Any infectious disease (e.g., hepatitis, tuberculosis) or a contagious
             immunosuppressive disease (e.g., HIV) by self-report.

          4. Clinically significant (grade 3 or 4) corneal edema, corneal vascularization, corneal
             staining, or any other abnormalities of the cornea which would contraindicate contact
             lens wear.

          5. Clinically significant (grade 3 or 4) tarsal abnormalities or bulbar injection which
             might interfere with contact lens wear.

          6. Any ocular infection.

          7. Any previous, or planned, ocular or interocular surgery (e.g., radial keratotomy,
             photorefractive keratectomy (PRK), laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK),
             etc.)

          8. Any corneal distortion resulting from previous hard or rigid gas permeable contact
             lens wear.

          9. Habitual contact lens type is toric, bifocal, in monovision contact lens wear, or is
             worn as extended wear.

         10. Participation in any contact lens or lens care product clinical trial within 30 days
             prior to study enrollment.

         11. Employee of investigational clinic (e.g., Investigator, Coordinator, Technician)
