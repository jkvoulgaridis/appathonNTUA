  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preoperative 5FU based chemoradiotherapy is still the standard of treatment for locally
      advanced rectal cancer. About 15-20% of patients would achieve pathologic complete response
      (pCR) after neoadjuvant CRT, and the survival outcome was much better than that of non-pCR.
      Total neoadjuvant treatment had been evaluated a lot in recent years, including induction
      chemotherapy or consolidation chemotherapy, or concurrent chemoradiotherapy. We aimed to
      evaluated the safety and efficacy of total neoadjuvant treatemnt in locally advanced rectal
      cancer.

      Preoperative 5FU based chemoradiotherapy is still the standard of treatment for locally
      advanced rectal cancer. About 15-20% of patients would achieve pathologic complete response
      (pCR) after neoadjuvant CRT, and the survival outcome was much better than that of non-pCR.
      However, distant metastasis would occur in about 30% of patients even after CRT. To improve
      the survival of rectal cancer patients, we hope to improve the pCR rate. In our previous
      FOWARC study, mFOLFOX6 with radiation had the pCR rate of 27.5%. It had been reported that
      adding FOLFOX after neoadjuvant chemo radiation in locally advanced rectal cancer would
      improve pCR rate. Nowadays, induction or consolidation chemotherapy or concurrent
      chemoradiotherapy had been used in clincal practice. Here, we are going to evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of total neoadjuvant therapy in real world.
