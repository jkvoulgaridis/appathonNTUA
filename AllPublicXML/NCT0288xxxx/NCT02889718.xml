  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a feasibility study of anesthesia in closed loop with the CONCERT-CL® station, on the
      effect of the hypnotic agent, measured by the bispectral index of the electroencephalogram,
      to maintain the hypnosis level within the recommended limits for general anesthesia. The
      analgesic agent is administered in &quot;Target-Controlled Infusion = TCI&quot; and analgesia evaluated
      by pupillometry.

      This is a prospective, open, non-controlled, non-randomized, monocentric study. The main
      objective is to study the potential contribution of the system in the conduct of anaesthesia,
      as decision support, for the administration of the hypnotic agent.

      Secondary objectives will include hemodynamic stability, and the average concentrations of
      opioid and hypnotic anesthetic agents evaluated from the pharmacokinetic model.

      The study will involve surgical patients scheduled for surgery under general anesthesia for
      more than 1 (one) hour.
