    <textblock>
      To evaluate the dynamic alterations of Th2/Th1 for the prediction of clinical immunity and
      how it was related to 28 day-prognosis and ICU-acquired infections among critically ill
      patients of community-acquired severe sepsis with new onset.

        We enroll patients with community-acquired severe sepsis and then the patients admitted to
        ICU without the diagnosis of severe sepsis as ICU control group, and the heathy volunteers
        as healthy control group.
