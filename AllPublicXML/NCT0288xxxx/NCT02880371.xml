  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter Phase 1b/2 study to determine the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) and/or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of ARRY-382 in combination with pembrolizumab in
      adult patients with selected advanced solid tumors (Part A/Phase 1b); and to estimate the
      efficacy of the combination in three separate cohorts: 1) patients with advanced solid tumors
      that have progressed on prior PD-1/PD-L1inhibitors, 2) patients with platinum-resistant
      ovarian cancer and 3) patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (Phase 2).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ARRY-382 is an inhibitor of CSF1R (colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor).

      Each phase of the study consists of a 28-day screening period; 21-day treatment cycles with
      the combination of ARRY-382 and pembrolizumab until disease progression as determined by the
      Investigator, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or death (or other
      discontinuation criteria are met), and a 30-day safety follow-up period. Patients in all
      cohorts/phases will be monitored for overall survival (OS) until 1 year after the date of the
      last patient's first visit.
