  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of VR non-opioid management vs. a control
      &quot;sham&quot; intervention for a broad and representative group of medical and surgical patients
      with pain. Hospitalized patients will receive specialized VR interventions, administered via
      portable VR headsets, to manage breakthrough pain. Control patients will view content on the
      in-room Health and Wellness television channel. Investigators will follow patients throughout
      the course of their hospitalization and monitor outcomes during and after their stays,
      including pain levels, medication requests, and quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study population will consist of 120 patients - 60 patients who are exposed to VR, and 60
      control patients exposed to an audiovisual &quot;sham&quot; intervention. Investigators will select up
      to 120 hospitalized patients at CSMC admitted during the study period of November 2016 to
      September 2017. The inpatient wards serve patients ranging in age from 18 to over 100,
      allowing us to assess the feasibility of using VR across diverse age groups. Appropriate
      inpatients will be selected at random by Dr. Rosen or other authorized co-investigators or
      study staff, who will obtain relevant clinical variables from the EHR. All patients admitted
      to the hospital will be considered for the study. The location and identity of the inpatient
      will be relayed by their attending physician to a member of the study team, who will deliver
      a randomly selected intervention (either VR or Health and Wellness Channel) to the patient
      the same day (at the patient's discretion). The patient will continue usage as needed for up
      to 20 days of the hospital stay. VR Interventions include both relaxing environment and
      engaging games. The Health and Wellness Channel includes some of the same types of content,
      but it is delivered passively through the in-room television system. Investigators will
      examine changes in pain level, length of stay, medication requests (amount and timing),
      Quality of Life, Functioning, and Patient Satisfaction.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Intensity Ratings (NRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately every 3-4 hours for the period 48 hours pre and post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome was pain intensity collected via ecological momentary assessment in the course of usual care by hospital staff. At three-to-four hour intervals during waking hours, subjects were asked by their assigned nurse to rate their pain using a standard 11-point numeric rating scale (NRS), where 0 is &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 is &quot;worst imaginable pain.&quot; Data are summarized as pre/post mean and in time-series.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Morphine Milligram Equivalents (MME)</measure>
    <time_frame>assessed at 48 hours before intervention and 48 hours after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Opioid usage was defined as mean total milligrams of morphine equivalent (MME), calculated by first multiplying the quantity of each prescribed medication by the strength of that medication (milligrams of given opioid per unit dispensed), and then multiplying this quantity-strength product by conversion factors derived from published sources to estimate the milligrams of morphine equivalent to the opioids dispensed in the prescription. The mean pre-intervention MME for subjects in each arm was calculated by adding the morphine equivalents for each prescription dispensed during the 48 hours before intervention, while the post-intervention MME for subjects in each arm was calculated by adding the morphine equivalents for each prescription dispensed during the 48 hours after intervention.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Length of Stay) LOS</measure>
    <time_frame>Count of Days in Hospital Stay up to 20</time_frame>
    <description>defined as the number of days from the date of admission to date of hospital discharge. Hour of admission was not available in these data, so patients admitted late on Day 0 (i.e., before midnight), and discharged the following calendar day (i.e., between 00:00 and 23:59), were counted as a 1-day hospital stay. Patients who were admitted and discharged on the same calendar day were considered to have an LOS of 0.</description>

        <description>Opioid usage was defined as mean total milligrams of morphine equivalent (MME), calculated by first multiplying the quantity of each prescribed medication by the strength of that medication (milligrams of given opioid per unit dispensed), and then multiplying this quantity-strength product by conversion factors derived from published sources to estimate the milligrams of morphine equivalent to the opioids dispensed in the prescription. The mean pre-intervention MME for subjects in each arm was calculated by adding the morphine equivalents for each prescription dispensed during the 48 hours before intervention, while the post-intervention MME for subjects in each arm was calculated by adding the morphine equivalents for each prescription dispensed during the 48 hours after intervention.</description>
