  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the effects of treatment with daclizumab on
      the proportion of participants relapse-free at 6 months in Relapsing-Remitting Multiple
      Sclerosis (RRMS) participants, who switched from treatment with natalizumab to daclizumab due
      to safety concerns. The secondary objectives of this study in this study population are to
      evaluate the effects of daclizumab on the following: 1) Multiple Sclerosis (MS) relapse
      activity including the annualized relapse rate (ARR) and the proportion of participants
      experiencing relapses requiring hospitalization and/or steroid treatment; 2) MS-related
      outcomes measured using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); 3) Safety and tolerability in
      participants previously treated with natalizumab.

    Study terminated in line with Biogen decision to withdraw Zinbryta from the market and not to
    pursue further studies of daclizumab in MS.

    <description>Relapses were defined as new or recurrent neurological symptoms not associated with fever or infection, lasting at least 24 hours, and accompanied by new objective neurological findings upon examination by the Examining Neurologist. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of the percentage of participants relapse-free at Month 6 is reported.</description>

    <description>Relapses were defined as new or recurrent neurological symptoms not associated with fever or infection, lasting at least 24 hours, and accompanied by new objective neurological findings upon examination by the Examining Neurologist. The ARR was calculated by tabulating the total number of relapses experienced in the group divided by the number of days up to the end of Month 12, and the ratio then multiplied by 365.</description>

    <measure>Permanent Discontinuation Rate of Daclizumab at Month 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>Permanent Discontinuation Rate was calculated as the ratio of number of participants who had permanently discontinued daclizumab prior to Month 12 over the total number of participants who received at least 1 dose of daclizumab in the study.</description>

    <description>An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death or in the view of the Investigator, places the participant at immediate risk of death or requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization or results in persistent or significant disability or results in a birth defect.</description>
