      This randomized phase III trial studies how well combination chemotherapy works in treating
      young patients with newly diagnosed B acute lymphoblastic leukemia that is likely to come
      back or spread, and in patients with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-like tyrosine kinase
      inhibitor (TKI) sensitive mutations. Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to
      stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing,
      or by stopping them from spreading. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) and
      giving the drugs in different doses and in different combinations may kill more cancer cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if the administration of post-Induction age-adjusted intrathecal triple
      therapy (ITT) on a Modified Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (MBFM) interim maintenance high-dose
      methotrexate (IMHDM) backbone will improve 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) of children
      with high-risk (HR) B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) compared to age-adjusted intrathecal
      (IT) methotrexate (MTX). (Completed effective March 19, 2018) II. To determine, in a
      randomized fashion, if the cyclophosphamide + etoposide containing regimen (Experimental Arm
      1) will improve the 4-year DFS of children, adolescents, and young adults with very high-risk
      (VHR) B-ALL compared to a modified MBFM-IMHDM regimen that contains a second IM (Control
      Arm). (Completed effective February 15, 2017)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the toxicity and tolerability of post-Induction age-adjusted ITT compared to
      age-adjusted IT MTX in children with HR B-ALL. (Completed effective March 19, 2018) II. To
      determine the toxicity and tolerability of Experimental Arm 1 compared to the Control Arm in
      children, adolescents, and young adults with VHR B-ALL. (Completed effective February 15,
      2017) III. To determine whether a single-arm, modified Induction with limited anthracycline
      exposure and post-Induction therapy regimen with MBFM-interim maintenance intermediate dose
      methotrexate (IMIDM) and reduced vincristine (vincristine sulfate)/steroid pulse frequency
      and enhanced supportive care in children with Down syndrome (DS) and HR B-ALL will result in
      a &gt;= 65% 5-year DFS and &lt; 10% Induction mortality.

      IV. To describe the outcomes for children and young adults with Philadelphia chromosome
      (Ph)-like B-ALL and a predicted TKI-sensitive mutation treated with dasatinib plus
      MBFM-IMHDM.

      V. To determine the toxicity and tolerability of MBFM-IMIDM in children with DS and HR B-ALL.

      VI. To estimate overall survival (OS) rates both overall and by regimen a) for HR B-ALL and
      b) VHR B-ALL patients.

      VII. To determine the incidence of osteonecrosis (ON), defined by magnetic resonance (MR)
      imaging, and to characterize the natural history of clinically silent ON in children,
      adolescents, and young adults 10 years of age and greater and to assess the role of drugs
      (i.e., asparaginase and methotrexate) in addition to corticosteroids, in the risk for
      development of ON. (Completed accrual July 2016) VIII. To determine if the prevalence of
      cognitive deficits measured by CogState, in children (ages 6 to &lt; 13 years) with HR- and VHR
      B-ALL at 1 year off therapy, is significantly higher than the normative population (&gt; 14%) in
      the following domains: working memory, executive function, visual motor, processing speed,
      and visual attention.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if the reduction of minimal residual disease (MRD) from end-Induction to
      end-Consolidation is greater for children, adolescents, and young adults with VHR B-ALL
      receiving Experimental Arm 1 compared to the Control Arm. (Closed effective October 20, 2017)

      days 1, 8, 15, 43, and 50; dexamethasone PO BID or IV on days 1-7 and 15-21; doxorubicin
      hydrochloride IV over 1-15 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15; pegaspargase IV over 1-2 hours on
      days 4 and 43; cyclophosphamide IV over 30-60 minutes on day 29; thioguanine PO QD on days
      29-42; cytarabine IV over 1-30 minutes or SC on days 29-32 and 36-39; methotrexate IT on days
      1, 29, and 36; and leucovorin calcium PO on days 3-4, 31-32 and 38-39.

      MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Patients with CNS3 disease undergo RT QD, 5 days a week, for 2 weeks (10
      fractions total). Patients receive vincristine sulfate IV over 1 minute on day 1; prednisone
      PO BID or IV on days 1-5 (may receive methylprednisolone IV if PO not tolerated);
      methotrexate PO on days 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, 43, 50, 57, 64, 71, and 78; mercaptopurine PO QD
      on days 1-84; and methotrexate IT on day 1 (also day 29 of courses 1-4 for CNS3 patients who
      did not undergo RT). Treatment repeats every 12 weeks for 2 years (females) or 3 years
      (males) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicities.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for 10 years.
