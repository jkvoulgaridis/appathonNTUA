      Investigators plan to study the role of spine surgery analgesic pathways - for procedures
      with high risk of postoperative pain - in improving the quality of recovery
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial comparing &quot;spine surgery analgesic pathway&quot; with &quot;usual
      care&quot; in improving postoperative quality of recovery and pain management in spine surgery
      patients. At the time of surgery office visit or at the time of preoperative assessment by
      anesthesia care team, risk factor for suboptimal pain management will be identified and
      documented. Patients will be assessed at the time for surgical office visit for their risk
      for severe post-operative pain. Patients with 2 or more risk factors will be classified as
      high-risk for severe postoperative pain and the patients with less than 2 factors as low
      risk. After obtaining informed consent spine surgery patients will be randomized 1:1 in one
      of the 2 study groups on the day of the surgery:

        1. &quot;Usual care&quot; group A

        2. &quot;Care pathway&quot; group B

      If the participant is randomized to the &quot;spine surgery analgesic pathway&quot; group the
      participant will be evaluated by the Acute Pain Management Service (APMS) before the surgery
      for their specific pain management needs. The participant will also get some additional
      medication for pain in preoperative and intraoperative period. Before surgery the participant
      will receive Acetaminophen and Gabapentin pills. During the surgery, once the participant is
      asleep the participant will receive an infusion of ketamine and lidocaine through the
      participant venous line. After the surgery the participant will receive pain medications as
      per current standard protocol including acetaminophen and gabapentin. Pain management team
      specialist will follow for pain control after a surgery as needed.

      If the participant is randomized to the &quot;usual care&quot; group the participant will be given
      placebo preoperatively; the rest of the time pain medication will be provided in a routine
      manner as per the anesthesia care team and the surgical team. Pain management team specialist
      will follow for pain control after a surgery as needed.

      The primary outcome will be assessed on post-operative day 3: The participants will complete
      a short survey about quality of recovery.

    <time_frame>Three days after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of postoperative recovery should be multidimensional including physiological parameters, functional recovery parameters, and patient-reported outcomes. Quality of postoperative recovery will be assessed by asking the patient &quot;how have you been feeling during the past 24 hours.&quot; Using the Quality of recovery form (QoR15) to document their replies. Quality of recovery (QoR15) score of (0 to 10), where: (0) none of the time (poor) and (10) equal all of the time (excellent). There are a total of 15 questions with each score ranging from 0 to 10. The range of reported total score is 0-150 where higher scores mean better quality of recovery.</description>

    <description>Postoperative pain was evaluated with numeric rating scores (0-10) at 15-min intervals for the initial two postoperative hours or until discharge, whichever came first. A time-weighted averages pain score is equal to the sum of the portion of each time interval (as a decimal, such as 0.25h) multiplied by the levels of the pain (0-10 numeric rating scores) during the time period divided by 48h.</description>

          <title>Charlson comorbidity index, No(%)</title>
          <description>The Charlson comorbidity index is a risk score assigned to patients for assessing their one-year mortality risk. It is based on a weighted count of specific chronic conditions in a patient’s diagnosis history. Higher scores mean higher risk. Generally 0-2 means low risk; 3-4 means moderate risk and above 5 means high risk.</description>

        <title>Quality of Recovery</title>
        <description>Assessment of postoperative recovery should be multidimensional including physiological parameters, functional recovery parameters, and patient-reported outcomes. Quality of postoperative recovery will be assessed by asking the patient &quot;how have you been feeling during the past 24 hours.&quot; Using the Quality of recovery form (QoR15) to document their replies. Quality of recovery (QoR15) score of (0 to 10), where: (0) none of the time (poor) and (10) equal all of the time (excellent). There are a total of 15 questions with each score ranging from 0 to 10. The range of reported total score is 0-150 where higher scores mean better quality of recovery.</description>

        <description>Opioid-Related Symptom Distress Scale (ORSDS) evaluates opioid-related side effects. ORSDS is a 4-point scale that evaluates 3 symptom distress dimensions (frequency, severity, bothersomeness) for 12 opioid-related side effects. The mean of the 12 scores are reported with a range from 0-4 where the higher scores mean more opioid-related side effects.</description>

Placebo- During surgery the subject will receive a placebo infusion of - ketamine (5 mcg/kg/min) and lidocaine (1.5 mg/kg/hr start at incision and decreased to 1 mg/kg/hr at start of closing and continued to PACU and stop at the first oral intake).

          <title>Spine Surgery Analgesic Pathway</title>
          <description>Before surgery, the subject will be given one-time oral dose Acetaminophen (1000 mg ) and gabapentin (600 mg).
During surgery, the subject will receive an infusion of ketamine (5 ug/kg/min; Ketamine was stopped at wound closure.) and lidocaine (1.5 mg/kg/hr start before the incision and decreased to 1 mg/kg/hr at start of closing and continued to PACU and stop at the first oral intake).
After surgery, the surgical team will manage pain medication and will consult acute pain management team as needed.
