    <textblock>
      Remote ischemic post-conditioning, which consists of several brief cycles of intermittent
      ischemia-reperfusion of the arm or leg, may potentially confer a powerful systemic protection
      against prolonged ischemia in a distant organ. Numerous reports have confirmed it strongest
      endogenous neuroprotection against brain injury after stroke. Ren et al demonstrated that
      remote ischemic post-conditioning (RIPC) performed in the hind limbs can not only
      significantly reduce the stroke volume within 3 hours in rat model, but also ameliorate the
      outcome of the behavioral test. A long-term repeated RIPC therapy can also help improving
      neurological functions. A combination of RIPC and tPA can help with neuroprotection which
      improves the neurological functions. Thus, it is meaningful to transform these basic
      experimental results to the clinical treatment. In the RECAST-1 trial, RIC has shown it
      safety and efficiency in AIS patients without tPA. However, there is no further explanation
      for the patients with IVT. Thus, in this study, we aim to demonstrate the efficiency and
      safety of RIPC in AIS patients performed rt-PA within 4.5 hours.

    <description>The Modified Rankin Scale Score (mRS) is the most comprehensive and most widely used primary outcome measurement to assess the neurological functional disability in contemporary acute stroke trials. The mRS is an ordinal, graded interval scale that assigns patients among 7 global disability levels, which ranges from 0 (no symptom) to 5 (severe disability) and 6 (death). We will use mRS to evaluate the degree of disability or dependence during daily activities. The mRS will be assessed by certified study investigator, who is blinded to the treatment assignment, at 90 days postoperation. The distribution of mRS will be compared between groups</description>
