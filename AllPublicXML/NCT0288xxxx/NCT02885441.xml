      Patients with acute pancreatitis will be randomly assigned in either study group to receive
      oral (injection) Ketorolac or the control group. In patients who cannot tolerate oral
      medications, ketorolac injection will be used.

      Patients with acute pancreatitis will be randomly assigned in either study group or control
      group.

        -  The study group will receive injection or oral Ketorolac.

        -  The control group will receive standard medical treatment.

      Ketorolac is administrated three times daily by mouth or injection starting from the time of
      admission for the first three days of hospitalization (72 hours).

      Hs-CRP will be measured in admission in addition to standard laboratory tests.It will be done
      every day for up to 5 days, after the administration of study drug or till the time of
      discharge whichever occurs earlier. Patients will follow up for organ failure involvement and
      duration of hospitalization. The study will continue to gather clinical follow up information
      up to four months.
