      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of oxidative phosphorylation
      inhibitor IACS-010759 in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia that has come back or
      does not respond to treatment. Oxidative phosphorylation inhibitor IACS-010759 may stop the
      growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Safety and tolerability. II. Determine dose limiting toxicities (DLTs). III. Establish
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Oxidative phosphorylation inhibitor IACS-010759 (IACS-010759) pharmacokinetics and food
      effect.

      II. Preliminary clinical efficacy (overall response rates, duration of response,
      progression-free survival, overall survival).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Pharmacodynamic and exploratory biomarkers of activity of IACS-010759.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      INDUCTION PHASE: Patients receive oxidative phosphorylation inhibitor IACS-010759 orally (PO)
      once daily (QD) on days 1-7.

      MAINTENANCE PHASE: Patients receive oxidative phosphorylation inhibitor IACS-010759 PO QD on
      days 8 and 15 of course 1 and on days 1, 8, and 15 of subsequent courses. Treatment repeats
      every 21 days for subsequent courses for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients may receive additional courses of oxidative
      phosphorylation inhibitor IACS-010759 at the discretion of study doctor.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-6 months for up to 5
      years.

        Inclusion:

          1. Subjects with AML should have failed any prior induction therapy regimen or have
             relapsed after prior therapy (defined as patients in first relapse and less than 12
             months from diagnosis [short first remission] or in second or later relapse:
             Dose-escalation phase: Subjects with confirmed relapsed or refractory AML and no
             available treatment options with known benefit. Expansion phase: Subjects with
             relapsed/refractory AML who have failed therapy with up to one prior salvage regimen
             and no available treatment options with known benefit Exception: SCT or stem cell
             therapy for subjects who previously underwent SCT/stem cell therapy, and are currently
             in remission will not be considered a salvage regimen.

          2. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) &lt;/= 2

          3. Patients who have had prior SCT are eligible if they have a relapse &gt; 3 months since
             autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation provided, 1) No clinically
             significant active graft-versus-host disease (GVHD &gt; grade 1); 2) No treatment with
             high dose steroids for GVHD (i.e. &gt;20 mg Prednisolone or equivalent per day); 3) No
             treatment with immunosuppressive drugs with the exception of cyclosporine and
             tacrolimus.

          4. Subjects with history of central nervous system (CNS) disease are allowed if at the
             time of day 1 of the study there is no evidence of active CNS disease as documented by
             negative imaging or spinal fluid analysis carried out at least 2 weeks prior to the
             first study drug administration in a subject with no clinical signs of CNS disease.

          5. Adequate renal and hepatic function: 1) Serum creatinine &lt;/= 2.0 X ULN; 2) Total
             bilirubin &lt;/= 2 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) (or &lt;/= 3.0 x ULN if deemed to
             be elevated due to Gilbert's disease or leukemia); 3) Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT)
             and Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) &lt;/= 2.5 times ULN (&lt;/= 5.0 x ULN if due to
             leukemic involvement).

          6. Negative urine pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to the first dose of study therapy
             for women of child-bearing potential (WCBP), defined as a sexually mature woman who
             has not undergone a hysterectomy or who has not been naturally post- menopausal for at
             least 24 consecutive months (i.e., who has had menses any time in the preceding 24
             consecutive months).

          7. Have been informed of other treatment options and is not a candidate for standard
             treatment options or stem cell transplant at the time of enrollment.

          8. Age &gt;/= 18 years.

          9. In the absence of rapidly progressing disease, the interval from prior treatment to
             time of initiation of IACS-010759 administration will be at least 2 weeks or 5
             half-lives (whichever is shorter) for cytotoxic/noncytotoxic agents and
             biological/immune therapies, including investigational agents. The half-life for the
             therapy in question will be based on published pharmacokinetic literature (abstracts,
             manuscripts, investigator brochures, or drug-administration manuals) and will be
             documented in the protocol eligibility document. The use of chemotherapeutic or
             anti-leukemic agents is not permitted during the study with the following exceptions:
             (1) intrathecal therapy for subjects with controlled CNS leukemia at the discretion of
             the PI and with the agreement of the Sponsor. (2) Use of hydroxyurea for subjects with
             rapidly proliferative disease is allowed before the start of study therapy and for the
             first 2 cycles on therapy. These medications will be recorded in the case-report form.

         10. Women of childbearing potential must agree to use an adequate method of contraception
             during the study and until 3 months after the last treatment. Males must be surgically
             or biologically sterile or agree to use an adequate method of contraception during the
             study until 3 months after the last treatment. Adequate methods of contraception
             include: 1) Total abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual
             lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation,
             symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
             contraception; 2) Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with
             or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study
             treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the
             woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment;

         11. #10 continued: 3) Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). For
             female subjects on the study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner
             for that subject;4) Combination of any of the two following (a+b or a+c or b+c): a.
             Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or other forms of
             hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate &lt;1%), for example
             hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception;b. Placement of an
             intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS); c. Barrier methods of
             contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with
             spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/ vaginal suppository. In case of use of oral
             contraception, women should have been stable on the same pill before taking study
             treatment.

         12. #11 continued: Note: Oral contraceptives are allowed but should be used in conjunction
             with a barrier method of contraception due to unknown effect of drug-drug interaction.
             Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have
             had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile
             (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral
             oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago.
             In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has
             been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child
             bearing potential.
