  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of iFIT Prosthetics, LLCÂ® was to create and commercialize a modular, immediate fit,
      fully adjustable, prosthetic system suitable for mass production using high strength
      injection molded polymer materials. This goal was achieved and the aim of this project is now
      to conduct a feasibility and effectiveness study and to assess the design of the device. The
      investigators will be fitting transtibial and transfemoral amputees with the iFIT prosthetic
      system. Patients will wear the device for 2 weeks in order to compare the device to their own
      prosthetic (if they currently have one). They will report any device breakages or adverse
      events. They will also fill out a questionnaire to determine if the iFIT prosthetic is a
      feasible option for treating patients with limb loss.

    <description>Participants will fill out an evaluation on their current prosthesis, and the iFIT prosthesis after a two week time interval. The questionnaire intends to compare the immediate fit prosthesis to the conventional prosthetic to determine if it is a feasible alternative for persons with limb loss.</description>

    <description>Transtibial and transfemoral amputee volunteers will be fit with the iFIT device and instructed on its use. Patient will wear the iFIT device for a two week time period according to a provided wear schedule. At the end of this time patient will rate it for comfort, stability and ease of use.</description>
