      The overall goal of this study is to test personalized mobile phone-based physical activity
      interventions among staff members at the University of California, Berkeley. Most physical
      fitness applications for smartphones and activity trackers use a constant goal for the number
      of steps each day. However, if the step goals are dynamically adjusted according to past
      behavior, then the corresponding goals may encourage individuals to increase their physical
      activity level. This study consists of a randomized controlled trial in which we are
      assessing the efficacy of two different algorithms for calculating personalized goals for the
      number of steps each day.
