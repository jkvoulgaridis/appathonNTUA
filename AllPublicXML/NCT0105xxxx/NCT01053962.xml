      This is a Phase 2a, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 14-day repeat oral, dose
      ranging study to determine the safety, PK and PD effects of SP-304 in patients with chronic
      idiopathic constipation. Patients diagnosed with chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) will
      be screened for the anticipated 4 cohorts, to yield 80 randomized patients for enrollment.
      Four dose cohorts are planned (0.3 mg, 1.0 mg, 3.0mg, and 9.0 mg) with 20 patients per dose
      cohort [randomization ratio 3:1 (15 receive SP-304:5 receive placebo)]. Patients who continue
      to meet all the entry criteria and complete the pre-treatment bowel movement (BM) diary will
      receive, in a double-blind, randomized fashion, SP-304 or matching placebo. It is expected
      that each patient will complete all 14 days of dosing (including making accurate BM diary
      entries for all 14 days in the treatment period). All patients receiving at least one dose of
      SP-304 or matching placebo will be considered evaluable for the safety endpoints. If a
      patient receives at least 5 doses per treatment week (1 dose per day for 7 days) and has
      completed BM diary entries for those 5 dosing days in each corresponding treatment week,
      he/she will be considered evaluable.

    <description>Using a Daily Diary, patients recorded the number of spontaneous bowel movements having the sensation of complete evacuation (Complete Spontaneous Bowel Movement - CSBM). The total number of spontaneous bowel movements associated with a feeling of complete evacuation were summed and divided by 2 (the number of weeks in treatment). Change was calculated as the difference between the number of the CSBMs at the completion of the 2-week treatment period, versus the 14-day pretreatment baseline.</description>

    <description>Using a Daily Diary, patients recorded Stool Consistency using the 7-point Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS) (1 = separate hard lumps, like nuts; 2 sausage shaped but lumpy; 3 = like a sausage but with cracks on surface; 4 = like a sausage or snake, smooth and soft; 5 = soft blobs with clear-cut edges; 6 = fluffy pieces with ragged edges, a mushy stool; 7 = watery, no solid pieces, entirely liquid). Changes in mean BSFS were assessed from the average 14-day pretreatment baseline to the average during the 2-week treatment period.</description>

Changes in overall ease of passage (Straining) were assessed from the average 14-day pretreatment baseline to average during the 2-week treatment period</description>

      <recruitment_details>This study was conducted between 3 March 2010 and 26 August 2010 at 14 study centers in the United States. Four dose cohorts were planned (0.3 mg, 1.0 mg, 3.0 mg, and 9.0 mg with 20 patients per dose cohort randomized in a 3:1 ratio [15 pts receive SP-304, 5 pts receive placebo].</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>During the pre-treatment period (Study Days -14 though -1), 84 eligible patients completed daily bowel movement diaries to obtain baseline data. Of these, 78 patients (58 and 20 patients for the SP-304 and placebo treatment groups, respectively) received at least one dose of study drug.</pre_assignment_details>

The total number of spontaneous bowel movements associated with a feeling of complete evacuation were summed and divided by 2 (the number of weeks in treatment).
