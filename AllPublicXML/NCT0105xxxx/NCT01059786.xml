    <textblock>
      Background:

        -  Researchers are attempting to develop new treatments for hairy cell leukemia (HCL) that
           has not responded well to or has recurred after standard HCL therapies. One nonstandard
           treatment for HCL is rituximab, an antibody that binds to the cancer cells and helps the
           immune system destroy them. By combining rituximab with other anti-cancer drugs,
           researchers hope to determine whether the combined drugs are successful in treating HCL.

        -  Pentostatin and bendamustine are two anti-cancer drugs that have been used to treat
           different kinds of blood and immune system cancers. Bendamustine is approved to treat
           other kinds of leukemia and lymphoma, but it has not been used to treat HCL. Pentostatin
           has been used for more than 20 years to treat HCL, but it has not been combined with
           rituximab in official clinical trials.

      Objectives:

        -  To determine whether rituximab with either pentostatin or bendamustine is a more
           effective treatment for HCL than rituximab alone.

        -  To determine whether pentostatin or bendamustine is a more effective treatment for HCL
           when combined with rituximab.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with hairy cell leukemia that
      has not responded well to or has relapsed after standard HCL therapies.

      Design:

        -  The study will last for four treatment cycles of 28 days each.

        -  Prior to the study, participants will be screened with a full medical history and
           physical exam, bone marrow biopsy (if one has not been performed in the last 6 months),
           computed tomography (CT) or ultrasound scan, tumor measurements, and other tests as
           required by the researchers. Participants will provide blood and urine samples at this
           time as well.

        -  Rituximab with bendamustine: Participants will receive rituximab on Days 1 and 15 of
           each cycle and bendamustine on Days 1 and 2 of each cycle, for a total of four cycles.

        -  Rituximab with pentostatin: Participants will receive rituximab on Days 1 and 15 of each
           cycle and pentostatin on rituximab on Days 1 and 15 of each cycle, for a total of four
           cycles.

        -  Participants will have regular tests during the treatment cycles, including bone marrow
           biopsies and CT or ultrasound scans. Participants will also provide regular blood and
           urine samples to assess the results of treatment.

      Background:

        -  Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) is highly responsive to purine analogs cladribine and
           pentostatin, without evidence of cure. Neither is standard after 2 courses, due to
           cumulative marrow and T-cell toxicity and declining remission rates and durations. Once
           resistant, patients after multiple relapses can die of disease-related cytopenias.

        -  Rituximab alone in 51 patients from 5 trials who had cytopenias and at least 1 prior
           purine analog resulted 10 complete + 10 partial remissions (CR+PR= ORR 39%).

        -  Rituximab with cladribine gives high CR rates in 1st or 2nd line, but is not standard.

        -  While cladribine use is more common for 1st and 2nd line, pentostatin is often used for
           subsequent treatment because of &lt; 100% cross-resistance.

        -  Retrospective published data for pentostatin plus rituximab in HCL include 7 of 7
           responses with 6 (86%) CRs, and there are no prospective data.

        -  Recombinant immunotoxins targeting CD25 (LMB-2) and CD22 (BL22 and HA22) are highly
           active in purine analog resistant HCL. Palliative pentostatin-rituximab is often used
           off-protocol for patients with immunogenicity needing more therapy.

        -  Bendamustine is approved for early treatment of CLL, and is effective with rituximab for
           relapsed/refractory CLL. Its use in HCL is unreported.

        -  CRs with minimal residual disease (MRD) by immunohistochemistry of bone marrow biopsy
           (BMBx IHC), can relapse early. Tests for HCL MRD in blood or marrow include flow
           cytometry (FACS) or PCR using consensus primers. The most sensitive MRD test in HCL is
           real-time quantitative PCR using sequence-specific primers (RQ-PCR).

        -  Of 5 HCL-specific trials listed on Cancer.gov, 2 are phase II trials of cladribine +
           rituximab in 1st and 2nd line (1 randomized at NIH, 1 non-randomized at MDA), and 3 NIH
           phase I-II trials of recombinant immunotoxins BL22, HA22 and LMB-2.

      Objectives:

      -Primary:

      --To determine if pentostatin + rituximab and bendamustine + rituximab are each associated
      with adequate response rates (ORR=PR+CR) in patients with relapsed HCL, and, if so, to select
      which combination is likely to be superior.

      Eligibility:

        -  HCL needing therapy, either greater than or equal to 2 prior courses of purine analog, 1
           course purine analog plus greater than or equal to 1 course rituximab if &lt; 1 year
           response to the 1 course purine analog, diagnosis of HCL variant (HCLv), or unmutated
           IGHV4-34+expressing HCL/HCLv.

        -  Prior treatment, ineligibility for, or patient refusal of recombinant immunotoxin.

      Design:

        -  Rituximab 375 mg/m(2) on day 1, 15 for 6 x 28-day cycles (all 72 patients).

        -  Initial tolerability study: 12 patients receive rituximab + bendamustine (nonrandom),
           including 6 at 70 mg/m^2 and 6 at 90 mg/m^2 of bendamustine.

        -  Randomize: 1) 28 patients to bendamustine 90 mg/m2/day, days 1 and 2 each cycle 2) 28
           patients to pentostatin 4 mg/m2 days 1 and 15 of each cycle.

        -  Non-randomize: up to 4 patients to receive either bendamustine 90 mg/m^2/day, days 1 and
           2 each cycle or pentostatin 4 mg/m^2 days 1 and 15 of each cycle.

        -  Statistics: If &gt; 14/28 respond, can conclude with 90% power that response &gt; 40% in that
           arm. &gt;80% probability of selecting the better arm if true response probability is
           approximately 40-50% on the inferior arm and &gt;15% higher on the superior arm.

        -  Stratify to equalize the % of patients/arm refractory to last course of purine analog.

        -  Accrual Ceiling: 74
