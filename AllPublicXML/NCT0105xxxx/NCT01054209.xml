    <textblock>
      This study will demonstrate whether an electric warming mattress can reduce the number of
      patients who get cold and shiver after elective cesarean section.

      Peri-operative hypothermia (body temperature below 36 ºC) is a cause of post-operative
      complications and patient discomfort. Immediately post-operatively such discomfort is due to
      increased pain and shivering. Patients say that their time in the recovery ward is very
      stressful and this is prolonged if they become cold (hypothermic)or shiver. Subsequently,
      patients can suffer with increased risk of infections and delayed discharge from hospital.

      For patients (and their babies) having Cesarean sections it is important to start breast
      feeding as soon as possible, but being cold may delay this.

      For some types of surgery measures are put in place to stop patients becoming cold and
      thereby reduce the number of problems. However this is not the case with patients undergoing
      Cesarean sections because the special blankets through which hot air is blown to keep them
      warm are inappropriate for mothers giving birth by Cesarean section as it would make it
      difficult for a mother to have good skin-to-skin contact with her new baby immediately after
      delivery - an important part in the bonding process.

      A solution is to use a new warming mattress. This has been shown to be safe and effective
      with some types of surgery, but has not been tested in Cesarean sections.

      In the investigators study,the investigators will warm a group of patients undergoing planned
      Cesarean section and compare them to an unwarmed group to see if there is any difference
      primarily in post-operative temperature. Secondarily, the investigators will also look for
      differences in total blood loss, incidence of blood transfusion, wound infection, shivering,
      the immediate health of the baby, time taken to become fit for discharge from recovery,
      length of hospital stay and time to breast-feeding.

      This project will be a randomised controlled trial comparing a warming mattress with current
      standard of care (no warming).

      Prospective participants will be invited by letter and provided with a information booklet
      explaining the study and their rights. Informed consent will be taken in writing.

      Patients will be randomised using a protocol created by the Trusts Clinical Investigations
      Research Unit who will use an Internet based randomisation system.

      The researcher will not be blinded as it is not logistically feasible. The statistician
      analysing the results will be blinded to which group receives warming.

      Study data will be collected manually on a standardised data collection sheet.

      All enrolled patients will have their temperatures measured at specified times and will be
      observed for shivering. Data collection required to measure the primary outcomes will be
      complete by time of discharge from the recovery room. Data collection for secondary outcomes
      will be prospective and retrospective and will occur from time of anaesthesia through to one
      month after the procedure.

      All patients will receive routine post-operative care.

      To ensure any late complications are not missed we will interview the patients by phone one
      month after the date of their procedure.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients undergoing elective (planned) caesarean section under spinal or combined
             spinal and epidural (CSE) anaesthesia will be eligible.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exclusion criteria will be those who refuse, who are unable to fully understand the
             trial or are under 16 years of age when presenting for their Caesarean section.

          -  Those that are unable to understand for language issues are excluded with regret due
             to the difficulties of obtaining interpreters at the time of caesarean section, in
             recovery and once at home for the telephone interview. Waiting for additional
             interpretation may delay the clinical management of the patient and also the patient
             may not be able to convey questions or concerns about the study through mail, email or
             telephone prior to attending.

          -  Patients under 16 years of age will be excluded from the trial for reasons of consent.
             Although a patient less than 16 years of age may have Gillick competence and therefore
             have the capacity to consent to take part in this trial, as a minor their parents may
             have concerns leading them to refuse trial entry. Child birth in minors can be very
             stressful for the patient, family and clinical team and we are keen not to add to this
             for the purposes of a study.

        <title>This Study Intends to Investigate Whether an Electric Warming Mattress Can Reduce the Incidence of Shivering in Patients Undergoing Planned Caesarean Section.</title>
        <description>Whether an electric warming mattress can reduce the incidence of shivering in patients undergoing planned Caesarean section. Shivering will be described according to severity on a scale of 1-4 where 1 is no shivering and 4 is uncontrolled shivering</description>
