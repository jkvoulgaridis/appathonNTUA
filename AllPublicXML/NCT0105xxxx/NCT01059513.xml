  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study in which a questionnaire is used to obtain quality of life
      data after patients undergo a hypo-fractionated course of stereotactic body radiotherapy
      (SBRT) for the treatment of their prostate cancer. The SBRT itself is considered standard of
      care for these patients and as such, is not an official component of the study.
