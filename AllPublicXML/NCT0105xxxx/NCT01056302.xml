  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study proposes to develop a computer-based software tool that will allow surgeons to
      plan and simulate surgery for patients with jaw trauma.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed tool will allow surgeons from different specialties to simulate, plan and
      iterate on complex procedures based on individual patient data in 3-D from a CT scan. The
      software will allow surgeons to both see and feel the results of their interventions - for
      example, the quality of the bite or bone alignment of a reconstructed jaw following severe
      trauma - before the actual surgery, leading to better planning, fewer errors, shortened
      surgery time and improved outcomes for the patients. The purpose of this study is the
      evaluation of a visuohaptic planning system for mandibular trauma surgery that is based on
      interactive manipulation of CT data.

    <measure>Percentage of Deviation From Actual Surgical Outcome During Virtual Repair of Mandibular Fractures, Using the Novel Visuohaptic Computational Platform That Was Developed by the Investigators</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The virtual surgical outcome was compared to the actual surgical outcome. This was accomplished by measuring distances (mm) and angles between specific mandibular anatomic points in the virtual environment and comparing it to the same distances (mm) and angles between specific mandibular anatomic points in the actual surgical outcome, as seen in a 3D rendering derived from the patient's postoperative CT scan. The actual surgical repair was considered to be the gold standard. A deviation of more than 10% between the virtual surgical repair and the actual surgical repair was considered to be above threshold (inaccurate virtual fracture repair).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Development and Evaluation of Automation Features for the Visuohaptic Virtual Surgery Planning Environment</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The addition of automation features for the visuohaptic virtual surgical planning environment was envisioned to make it possible to predict the number, type, size, and position of reconstruction hardware (bone plates and screws) that would best fit the virtually repaired mandibular fractures. The goal was to compare the hardware configuration selected and used in the actual surgical repair for the 3 participating patients with what the software predicted. Unfortunately, the software development proved to be difficult to add this automated feature.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Implementation and Test of the Telemedicine Prototype</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Measurement of the accuracy of the virtual surgical repair generated by the surgeon operating the software when a remote surgeon digitally sends a CT scan of a patient with an acute mandibular fracture(s). The telemedicine interface would require an automated method to segment the CT scan into the fractured components. The operator would manipulate the bone fractures, select the hardware type and size for &quot;best fit&quot;, and generate a report back to the remote surgeon.</description>

    <description>Patients will undergo whatever needed surgical repair of maxillofacial trauma that is necessary. Records such as CT imaging and plaster models of the jaws will be utilized in the standard way to plan and carry out the surgery. The CT scan will also be used within the visuohaptic computational environment to develop and evaluate the user interface. The amount of time taken to work up and plan surgery using standard surgical practice and using the computational platform will be compared. Real surgical outcome will be compared to the simulated surgical outcome using the proposed software tool.</description>

        Study population will veterans who present to the Oral/Maxillofacial Surgery Clinic at the
        San Francisco VA Medical Center. The study will use pre-existing data from patients
        undergoing reconstructive facial surgery at the San Francisco VA with clinic indications
        that require preoperative CT scans and preoperative radiographs as well as model casts.

        <title>Percentage of Deviation From Actual Surgical Outcome During Virtual Repair of Mandibular Fractures, Using the Novel Visuohaptic Computational Platform That Was Developed by the Investigators</title>
        <description>The virtual surgical outcome was compared to the actual surgical outcome. This was accomplished by measuring distances (mm) and angles between specific mandibular anatomic points in the virtual environment and comparing it to the same distances (mm) and angles between specific mandibular anatomic points in the actual surgical outcome, as seen in a 3D rendering derived from the patient's postoperative CT scan. The actual surgical repair was considered to be the gold standard. A deviation of more than 10% between the virtual surgical repair and the actual surgical repair was considered to be above threshold (inaccurate virtual fracture repair).</description>

Patients underwent surgical repair of their mandibular fracture(s) in the usual and customary way. Preoperative CT imaging was utilized by the surgeon to plan and carry out the surgery. Following surgery, a postoperative CT scan was done to assess the success of the surgery to accurately reposition all the fractured bone. Each patient's preoperative CT scan was also used within the visuohaptic computational environment to develop and evaluate the user interface. Once the software was deemed suitable for use, it was tested. The test consisted of measuring the accuracy of the virtual surgical repair compared to the real surgical outcome, as seen on the postoperative CT scan.</description>
