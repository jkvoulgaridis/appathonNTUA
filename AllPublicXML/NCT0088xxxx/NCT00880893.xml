      Primary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate safety after each CYD Dengue vaccination in terms of injection site and
           systemic reactogenicity.

        -  To evaluate the occurrence of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) throughout the trial period.

        -  To evaluate the humoral immune response to each CYD Dengue serotype after each
           vaccination in a subset of participants.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the persistence of the humoral immune response during 4 years after the last
           vaccination in a subset of participants.

      This was a multicenter trial involving three vaccinations one each at 0, 6 and 12 months over
      a period of 1 year, and a 4-year follow-up following the last vaccination.

    <masking_description>An observer-design for the first vaccination and a single-blind design for the second and third vaccination were chosen to minimize the bias of the vaccine evaluation. The Investigator in charge of safety evaluation, the Sponsor, and the participants/parents did not know which vaccine was administrated at the first visit. For the second and third vaccinations, the participants/parents did not know which vaccine was administered.</masking_description>

        <description>Seropositivity against each serotype with the dengue virus strain were assessed using a PRNT assay. Seropositive participants were defined as participants with neutralizing antibody titers &gt;=10 (1/dilution).
