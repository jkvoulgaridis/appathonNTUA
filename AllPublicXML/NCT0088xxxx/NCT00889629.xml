  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with kidney transplants often develop bone disease. One reason for bone disease may be
      overactivity of a gland in the neck called the parathyroid gland. Overactivity of the
      parathyroid gland may be caused by lack of Vitamin D in the body. It has recently been
      discovered that many patients with kidney transplants have low Vitamin D levels. The
      investigators are examining the effects of doxercalciferol on parathyroid hormone levels,
      proteinuria and bone turnover markers in people who have had a kidney transplant.

      People with kidney transplants often develop bone disease. One reason for bone disease may be
      overactivity of a gland in the neck called the parathyroid gland. Overactivity of the
      parathyroid gland may be caused by lack of Vitamin D in the body. It has recently been
      discovered that many patients with kidney transplants have low Vitamin D levels.

      25-OH Vitamin D3 is now recommended to treat kidney transplant patients with low vitamin D
      levels but it may not be enough to treat the parathyroid problems and bone disease.
      Doxercalciferol is a form of Vitamin D that has been used to treat bone disease and
      parathyroid problems in dialysis patients but has not yet been studied in patients with
      kidney transplants. We are interested in seeing whether doxercalciferol given together with
      25-OH Vitamin D3 will be a better treatment for the overactive parathyroid gland and bone
      disease than 25-OH Vitamin D3 alone in patients with kidney transplants.

Safety labs and end point labs are monitored as per protocol, with the opportunity to increase the dose of doxercalciferol if target PTH value is not achieved by the predetermined midpoint.</description>
