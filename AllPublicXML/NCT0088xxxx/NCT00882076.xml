      The purpose of this study is to establish toxicity and a maximum tolerated dose recommended
      phase 2 dose of Clofarabine in combination with Etoposide and Mitoxantrone for therapy of
      relapsed or refractory acute leukemias. The investigators will observe responses with these
      therapy agents and assess the impact of Clofarabine interacting with Etoposide in induction
      of DNA strand breaks.

      This will be a phase I study with a standard 3x3 design. Patients will proceed to treatment
      through a series of cohorts with the three drugs being delivered over five days beginning
      with a dose of Etoposide 100 mg/m2 on days 1-5,Mitoxantrone 8 mg/m2 days 1-3, and clofarabine
      at 20 mg/m2 IV on days 2-6. Presuming this and subsequent cohorts are tolerable and no more
      than 1 patient per cohort develops DLT, MTD patients will be treated in cohorts of 3-6
      patients up to a final dose level of Etoposide 100 mg/m2 on days 1-5,Mitoxantrone 8 mg/m2
      days 1-5, and Clofarabine at 30 mg/m2 IV on days 2-6. Patients failing to enter remission may
      receive 4 days of therapy with Etoposide 100 mg/m2 on days 1-4,Mitoxantrone 8 mg/m2 days 1-2
      or 1-4,and Clofarabine at 20-30 mg/m2 IV on days 1-4. According to established definitions
      for dose limiting toxicity a recommended phase II dose will be established. After this is
      established the final cohort will be expanded to 15 patients.

             been completed. Patients with organ-confined prostate cancer with no evidence of
             recurrent or progressive disease based on prostate-specific antigen values are also
             eligible for this study if hormonal therapy has been initiated or a radical
             prostatectomy has been performed. Additionally, patients with prostate cancer treated
