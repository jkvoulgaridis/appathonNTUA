    <measure>Total Number of Gd-Enhancing T1-Weighted MRI Lesions Per Scan Averaged During Weeks 12, 16, 20, and 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 12, 16, 20, and 24</time_frame>
    <description>Lesions were measured using Gd-enhancing T1-weighted MRI scans. The number of T1-weighted lesions per scan was obtained from the number of T1-weighted lesions observed during a specified week divided by the number of scans performed that same week. To obtain the number of T1-weighted lesions per scan averaged during Weeks 12, 16, 20, and 24, the number of lesions per scan at each week was summed and then divided by the number of visits with non-missing lesion counts.</description>

    <measure>Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 12, 24, and 48</time_frame>
    <description>The EDSS is a rating scale for quantifying disability in multiple sclerosis (MS) participants. The EDSS has 8 functional systems (pyramidal, cerebellar, brain stem, sensory, bowel and bladder, visual, cerebral, and other) each rated on a scale from 0 (normal) to 5 (severe disability) or 0 (normal) to 6 (severe disability). The EDSS score was computed based on an algorithm of these components, and scores ranged from 0.0 (normal neurological exam) to 10.0 (death due to MS) in increments of 0.5.</description>

    <measure>Time to First Relapse</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through Week 24, Baseline through Week 48, and Week 24 through Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>A confirmed relapse was defined as the appearance of 1 or more new neurological symptom(s) attributable to MS or the worsening of 1 or more previously observed symptoms. This change in clinical state was to last at least 48 hours and be immediately preceded by an improving neurological state of at least 30 days from onset of previous relapse. New or worsening neurological symptoms were accompanied by objective EDSS changes on examination (an increase from baseline of at least 1 point on the EDSS, at least 1 point on 2 EDSS functional systems, or at least 2 points on 1 EDSS functional system). A relapse may or may not have required systemic corticosteroid treatment. If a relapse did not occur during the specified time frame, the time to the first confirmed relapse was censored to the date of the participant's last available visit at or prior to Week 24, Week 48, and Week 48 for the respective time frames.</description>

    <measure>Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite Scale (MSFC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 12, 24, and 48</time_frame>
    <description>The MSFC is a composite scale consisting of 3 components [Timed 25-Foot Walk, 9-Hole Peg Test (9-HPT), and 3-Second Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT-3)]. The Timed 25-Foot Walk was a quantitative measure of lower extremity function. The 9-HPT was a quantitative measure of upper extremity (arm and hand) function. The PASAT-3 was a measure of cognitive function that specifically assessed auditory information processing speed and flexibility, as well as calculation ability. Component scores ranged from 0 to 60 and were converted to standard scores (z-scores). The MSFC score was calculated as the average of the 3 standardized component scores. Higher MSFC scores reflected better neurological function.</description>

    <measure>Visual Analog Scale (VAS) of Wellbeing</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 12, 24, and 48</time_frame>
    <description>The VAS is a 100-millimeter (mm) horizontal line marked with 0 mm = &quot;poor&quot; and 100 mm = &quot;excellent.&quot; Participants were asked to assess their wellbeing by making a vertical mark on the scale. The score was computed as the distance from 0 mm to the vertical mark.</description>

    <measure>16-Item Quick Inventory for Depressive Symptomatology Self Report (QIDS-SR16)</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 12, 24, and 48</time_frame>
    <description>The QIDS-SR16 is a 16-item participant-rated measure of depressive symptomatology. Each item corresponds to 1 of 9 criterion domains for depression: change in sleep disturbance [question (Q) 1 through Q4], sad mood (Q5), decrease or increase in appetite and weight (Q6 through Q9), concentration (Q10), self-criticism (Q11), suicidal ideation (Q12), interest (Q13), energy/fatigue (Q14), and psychomotor agitation and retardation (Q15 and Q16). Each question was scored 0 (no problems) to 3 (increased symptoms). The total score=(the highest score from Q1 through Q4)+(Q5 score)+(the highest score from Q6 through Q9)+(the total score for each Q10 through Q14)+(the highest score from Q15 and Q16). A total score of 0 through 5 was considered no depression likely, 6 through 10 was mild depression, 11 through 15 was moderate depression, 16 through 20 was severe depression, and 21 or over was very severe depression.</description>

    <measure>Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) Component Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 12, 24, and 48</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 was a 36-item, health-related survey that assessed participant's quality of life on 8 domains: physical functioning, bodily pain, role limitations due to physical problems, role limitations due to emotional problems, general health, mental health, social functioning, vitality and 2 component scores (mental and physical health). Domain scores were calculated by summing individual items for each domain and transforming scores into 0 to 100 scale; higher scores indicated better health status or function. The mental component summary (MCS) score, based on SF-36 domains, consisted of social functioning, vitality, mental health, and role-emotional scales (range: 0 to 100). The physical component summary (PCS) score, based on SF-36 domains, consisted of physical functioning, bodily pain, role-physical, and general health scales (range: 0 to 100).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 2, Weeks (Wks) 1, 4, 12, 24, 36, and 48</time_frame>
    <description>Cell surface marker cluster designation (CD)19, CD27, and immunoglobulin D (IgD) expression levels were used to define the various B cell subsets. Cell surface markers were defined as being either present (+) or absent (-). Peripheral blood B cell subsets included: mature naive B cells (CD19+IgD+CD27-); immature/transitional (immature/tran) B cells (CD19+IgD-CD27-); switched memory B cells (CD19+IgD-CD27+); and non-switched memory B cells (CD19+IgD+CD27+). A positive or negative change indicated an increase or decrease, respectively in B cell count.</description>

        <title>Total Number of Gd-Enhancing T1-Weighted MRI Lesions Per Scan Averaged During Weeks 12, 16, 20, and 24</title>
        <description>Lesions were measured using Gd-enhancing T1-weighted MRI scans. The number of T1-weighted lesions per scan was obtained from the number of T1-weighted lesions observed during a specified week divided by the number of scans performed that same week. To obtain the number of T1-weighted lesions per scan averaged during Weeks 12, 16, 20, and 24, the number of lesions per scan at each week was summed and then divided by the number of visits with non-missing lesion counts.</description>

        <title>Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)</title>
        <description>The EDSS is a rating scale for quantifying disability in multiple sclerosis (MS) participants. The EDSS has 8 functional systems (pyramidal, cerebellar, brain stem, sensory, bowel and bladder, visual, cerebral, and other) each rated on a scale from 0 (normal) to 5 (severe disability) or 0 (normal) to 6 (severe disability). The EDSS score was computed based on an algorithm of these components, and scores ranged from 0.0 (normal neurological exam) to 10.0 (death due to MS) in increments of 0.5.</description>

        <title>Time to First Relapse</title>
        <description>A confirmed relapse was defined as the appearance of 1 or more new neurological symptom(s) attributable to MS or the worsening of 1 or more previously observed symptoms. This change in clinical state was to last at least 48 hours and be immediately preceded by an improving neurological state of at least 30 days from onset of previous relapse. New or worsening neurological symptoms were accompanied by objective EDSS changes on examination (an increase from baseline of at least 1 point on the EDSS, at least 1 point on 2 EDSS functional systems, or at least 2 points on 1 EDSS functional system). A relapse may or may not have required systemic corticosteroid treatment. If a relapse did not occur during the specified time frame, the time to the first confirmed relapse was censored to the date of the participant's last available visit at or prior to Week 24, Week 48, and Week 48 for the respective time frames.</description>

          <description>A confirmed relapse was defined as the appearance of 1 or more new neurological symptom(s) attributable to MS or the worsening of 1 or more previously observed symptoms. This change in clinical state was to last at least 48 hours and be immediately preceded by an improving neurological state of at least 30 days from onset of previous relapse. New or worsening neurological symptoms were accompanied by objective EDSS changes on examination (an increase from baseline of at least 1 point on the EDSS, at least 1 point on 2 EDSS functional systems, or at least 2 points on 1 EDSS functional system). A relapse may or may not have required systemic corticosteroid treatment.

The Timed 25-Foot Walk was a quantitative measure of lower extremity function. The 9-HPT was a quantitative measure of upper extremity (arm and hand) function. The PASAT-3 was a measure of cognitive function that specifically assessed auditory information processing speed and flexibility, as well as calculation ability. Component scores ranged from 0 to 60 and were converted to standard scores (z-scores). The MSFC score was calculated as the average of the 3 standardized component scores. Higher MSFC scores reflected better neurological function.</description>

        <description>The QIDS-SR16 is a 16-item participant-rated measure of depressive symptomatology. Each item corresponds to 1 of 9 criterion domains for depression: change in sleep disturbance [question (Q) 1 through Q4], sad mood (Q5), decrease or increase in appetite and weight (Q6 through Q9), concentration (Q10), self-criticism (Q11), suicidal ideation (Q12), interest (Q13), energy/fatigue (Q14), and psychomotor agitation and retardation (Q15 and Q16). Each question was scored 0 (no problems) to 3 (increased symptoms). The total score=(the highest score from Q1 through Q4)+(Q5 score)+(the highest score from Q6 through Q9)+(the total score for each Q10 through Q14)+(the highest score from Q15 and Q16). A total score of 0 through 5 was considered no depression likely, 6 through 10 was mild depression, 11 through 15 was moderate depression, 16 through 20 was severe depression, and 21 or over was very severe depression.</description>

        <description>The SF-36 was a 36-item, health-related survey that assessed participant's quality of life on 8 domains: physical functioning, bodily pain, role limitations due to physical problems, role limitations due to emotional problems, general health, mental health, social functioning, vitality and 2 component scores (mental and physical health). Domain scores were calculated by summing individual items for each domain and transforming scores into 0 to 100 scale; higher scores indicated better health status or function. The mental component summary (MCS) score, based on SF-36 domains, consisted of social functioning, vitality, mental health, and role-emotional scales (range: 0 to 100). The physical component summary (PCS) score, based on SF-36 domains, consisted of physical functioning, bodily pain, role-physical, and general health scales (range: 0 to 100).</description>

        <description>Cell surface marker cluster designation (CD)19, CD27, and immunoglobulin D (IgD) expression levels were used to define the various B cell subsets. Cell surface markers were defined as being either present (+) or absent (-). Peripheral blood B cell subsets included: mature naive B cells (CD19+IgD+CD27-); immature/transitional (immature/tran) B cells (CD19+IgD-CD27-); switched memory B cells (CD19+IgD-CD27+); and non-switched memory B cells (CD19+IgD+CD27+). A positive or negative change indicated an increase or decrease, respectively in B cell count.</description>
