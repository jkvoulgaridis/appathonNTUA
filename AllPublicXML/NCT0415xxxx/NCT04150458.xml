  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, open-label, phase III trial in up to 2000 patients with known or
      suspected benign or malignant tumors which are known or suspected to be
      18F-fluorocholine-avid.

      Patients will receive regular standard clinical care. The only study-specific procedure will
      be the administration of 18F-fluorocholine followed by a PET/CT scan.

      Diagnostic accuracy of 18F-fluorocholine PET/CT will be captured versus a composite clinical,
      radiological and histopathological standard of truth at follow-up.

    <description>The sole study-specific procedure is a single 18F-fluorocholine positron emission tomography / computed tomography (PET/CT). Subjects will receive 9 mCi 18F-fluorocholine IV, 5 to 120 minutes prior to PET/CT. 18F-fluorocholine PET/CT studies will be performed on hybrid PET/CT scanners which combine a dedicated, full-ring PET scanner with a multi-slice spiral CT scanner.</description>
