  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of neoadjuvant cemiplimab as
      measured by Pathologic complete response (pCR) rate per independent central pathology review.

      The secondary objectives of the study are:

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of neoadjuvant cemiplimab on measures of disease response,
           including:

        -  Major pathologic response (mPR) rate per independent central pathology review

        -  pCR rate and mPR rate per local pathology review

        -  ORR prior to surgery, according to local assessment using RECIST 1.1

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of neoadjuvant cemiplimab on event free survival (EFS), disease
           free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS)

        -  To evaluate the safety profile of neoadjuvant cemiplimab

        -  To assess change in surgical plan (ablative and reconstructive procedures) from the
           screening period to definitive surgery, both according to investigator review and
           independent surgical expert review

        -  To assess change in post-surgical management plan (radiation, chemoradiation, or
           observation) from the screening period to post-surgery pathology review, both according
           to investigator review and independent surgical expert review

             pneumonia) or active, noninfectious pneumonitis that required immune-suppressive doses
             of glucocorticoids to assist with management.

          -  Uncontrolled infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B or
             hepatitis C virus (HBV or HCV) infection; or diagnosis of immunodeficiency
