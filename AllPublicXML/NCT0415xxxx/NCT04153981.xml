        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have T2DM based on the disease diagnostic criteria from the World Health Organization
             (WHO) classification for at least 6 months before screening.

          -  Have been receiving glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) or ≥2 oral
             antihyperglycemic medication (OAMs) at stable doses for 90 days prior to screening.

          -  Have an HbA1c level ≥7.0% and &lt;11.0%.

          -  Have never been treated with insulins except for short term treatment of acute
             conditions up to a maximum of 14 days.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have any form of diabetes other than T2DM.

          -  Have hypersensitivity to the active substance of LY2963016 or to any of the
             excipients.

          -  Have any clinically significant disorder, other than T2DM, that in the investigator's
             opinion, would preclude participation in the trial.

          -  Are receiving systemic glucocorticosteroids therapy or have excessive insulin
             resistance (total insulin dose &gt;2 units per kilogram).

          -  Have a history or diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus infection, hepatitis B and
             C.

          -  Have comorbidities of unstable angina, cardiac failure (Stage III or IV as per New
             York Heart Association guidelines) or renal failure (estimated glomerular filtration
             rate &lt;30 milliliters/minute/meter squared).

          -  Are pregnant or intend to become pregnant during the course of the study; or are
             sexually active women of child-bearing potential not actively practicing birth control

          -  Have participated within the last 30 days in a clinical trial involving an
             investigational product other than the LY2963016. If the previous investigational
             product has a long half-life, 3 months or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) should
             have passed.

          -  Have previously completed or withdrawn from this study or any other study
             investigating LY2963016. This exclusion criterion does not apply to participants who
             are rescreened prior to baseline visit.

          -  Are currently enrolled in any other clinical study involving an investigational
             product or any other type of medical research judged not to be scientifically or
             medically compatible with this study.

          -  Are unwilling or unable to comply with the use of a glucometer.
