  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to validate the e-MIP design and function by testing the
      ability of e-MIP to harvest energy and return a sufficient amount of energy to assist the
      user during gait. The investigators will also evaluate whether prosthetic users are able to
      wear and use the e-MIP device long-term.
