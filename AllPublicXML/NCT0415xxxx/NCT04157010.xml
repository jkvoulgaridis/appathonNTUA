  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The TREMERA study focuses on patients with newly diagnosed, untreated, rheumatoid arthritis
      (RA). Recent international treatment recommendations emphasise the need to diagnose RA early
      and start treatment immediately (this being associated with better response rates); and to
      aim for the goal of remission i.e. the absence of signs and symptoms of active inflammatory
      disease activity which is associated with better outcomes for the patient. Remission is more
      achievable with significant treatment advances that have been made in the form of highly
      effective biologic therapies. Tocilizumab (TCZ) is a newly introduced biologic drug that is
      used in established RA. The TREMERA study primarily aims to investigate the biological
      changes seen in blood and tissue following TCZ therapy this will contribute to a better
      understanding of how the drug works as well as disease processes; and will also identify
      whether administering a biologic drug such as TCZ can also switch off immunological
      parameters associated with a disrupted immune system of RA. The study will assess the
      effectiveness of TCZ given on its own or in combination with methotrexate (MTX; a standard
      therapy usually given with biologic treatments)in patients with early onset RA to determine
      the proportion that achieve remission. This study also aims to find out how quickly remission
      can be achieved with TCZ and the depth of remission achieved. This will be done using usual
      clinical assessment but also imaging such as ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      which can detect inflammation not apparent on clinical assessment.
