      Several studies suggested that ARDS may have important adverse effects on renal function, but
      few studies have specifically addressed the risk factors of AKI and its impact on the outcome
      in theses patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute respiratory distress syndrome is considered an acute diffuse lung injury in which an
      inciting inflammatory event is followed by hypoxemic respiratory failure. Despite advances in
      the management of ARDS, the mortality remains high. The LUNG SAFE study reported that
      hospital mortality was 34.9% in patients with mild ARDS, 40.3% in patients with moderate
      ARDS, and 46.1% in patients with severe ARDS. Understanding the prognostic factors in ARDS is
      essential for decreasing its mortality. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and challenging
      medical condition in critically ill patients, in which there is a sudden renal impairment
      during hours to days and it is known to be associated with increased mortality .Other adverse
      outcomes associated with AKI includes chronic kidney disease (CKD) and high cardio-vascular
      complications. The incidence of AKI in hospitalized adults was reported to be 22% with a
      mortality rate of 24%. The severity of AKI ranges from stage 1 to stage 3 according to The
      KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) system, based on decreased urine output
      over time, or increases in serum creatinine, or both.
