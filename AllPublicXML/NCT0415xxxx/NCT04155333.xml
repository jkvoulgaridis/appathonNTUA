  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-invasive brain stimulation has been shown to alter performance in both clinical and
      healthy populations on cognitive tasks. While the performance alterations have generally been
      shown to result in enhancement, mixed results remain in the literature. Much of the mixed
      results within the literature have been attributed to the use of different stimulation
      parameters, targeting of different brain areas, and using a variety of performance measures
      or assessing different constructs. However, non-invasive brain stimulation is a desirable
      method for enhancing Soldier performance given the ease of administration and minimal side
      effects as compared to other forms of performance enhancement (e.g., pharmaceuticals,
      caffeine). The objective of the current study is to evaluate the effects of non-invasive
      brain stimulation to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in enhancing Soldier cognitive
      skills and performance on military tasks. A double blind within-subjects design will be used
      with healthy, rested Soldiers who will receive non-invasive brain stimulation and perform
      basic cognitive and operationally relevant tasks.

    <intervention_name>Transcranial direct current stimulation</intervention_name>
    <description>Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a form of non-invasive brain stimulation that stimulates the brain through the application of a low-intensity electrical current, typically ranging from 1 to 2 milliamps (mA), via electrodes placed on an individual's scalp. During the active stimulation sessions, 2 mA of stimulation will be applied for 30 minutes. During the sham stimulation session, 2 mA of stimulation will be applied over the course of 90 sec, the electrodes will remain in place for the 30 minute duration.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Must be 18 (if active duty), 19 (if non-active duty) up to 40 years old.

          2. Must have normal hearing, vision or corrected to normal vision, and cognitive function
             as determined by self-report and screening by study physician

          3. Must have obtained at minimum 6 hours of sleep prior to data collection, as assessed
             by actigraphy data and self-report.

          4. Must have refrained from consumption of caffeine, 16 hours, nicotine, 2 hours, and
             alcohol, 24 hours, prior to the study, assessed by self-report.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The following medically-related exclusionary criteria will be used, as assessed and
             verified by the study physician:

               1. Haven taken any medications which induce drowsiness, such as over-the-counter
                  antihistamines within 24 hours of participation in the study. Any self-medication
                  will be assessed through self-report

               2. No current medical conditions or medications affecting cognitive function or
                  attention.

               3. Any history of any attention deficit condition requiring medication.

               4. Any history of psychological/psychiatric disorder.

               5. Any history of seizures, migraines, or neurological disorders.

               6. History of a head injury involving loss of consciousness.

               7. Any metal implanted within the head (e.g., shrapnel, surgical clips) or any
                  implanted devices (e.g., cardiac pacemaker, brain stimulator, hydrocephalic
                  shunt).

               8. Skin condition on the scalp, such as psoriasis or eczema, or wounds on the head.

               9. Currently receiving hormonal therapy treatments, other than birth control or as
                  determined by physicians.

              10. Potential for caffeine withdrawal symptoms that will impede cognitive testing.

          2. Females with a known pregnancy, who test positively for pregnancy, or refuse the test
             will be excluded, given the lack of available research regarding the effects of tDCS
             during pregnancy. Known pregnancy will be assessed during screening, females without a
             known pregnancy will be requested to provide a urine sample during the screening
             procedures to ensure the absence of pregnancy.
