  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to characterize the Portuguese population of patients with moderate-to-severe
      UC receiving advanced therapies, by describing clinical and sociodemographic characteristics,
      and remission outcomes . The clinical, biochemical, endoscopic, and histological outcomes
      will also be described, as well as frequency of selected EIM, comorbidities and the uptake of
      preventive care measures and hospitalizations .
