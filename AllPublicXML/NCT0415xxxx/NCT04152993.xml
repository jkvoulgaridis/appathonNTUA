  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) refractory to treatment is marked by failure of fear
      extinction and its biological substrate, amygdala reactivity to trauma reminders. Decades of
      research have clarified the neuronal mechanisms coordinating fear extinction and
      consolidation. Fear cells and extinction cells in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) alter their
      firing rate based on the nature of the stimulus and the influence from the medial prefrontal
      cortex (mPFC) and the ventral hippocampus (vHPC). Together, the BLA, mPFC, and the vHPC form
      an anxiety-processing network where the BLA links stimulus to emotion, the vHPC provides
      memory context, and the mPFC coordinates extinction or consolidation. Local field potential
      (LFP) recordings from the BLA have revealed specific signals that correspond to an enhanced
      fear state. Previous studies have shown that neuromodulation of the BLA can promote
      extinction in a rodent model and in a treatment-refractory PTSD patient. This action is
      likely carried by disrupting fear signals within the BLA; however, continuous
      neurostimulation may also disrupt normal function of the amygdala. The present application
      proposes to investigate the use of Responsive Neurostimulation (RNS, Neuropace) in six (6)
      veterans suffering from severe treatment-resistant PTSD. This dual-activity device will allow
      us to chronically record LFPs from the BLA under specific conditions such as fear
      conditioning, exposure to trauma reminders, and emotional memory encoding and retrieval. In
      addition, the neural activity will be captured during real-life symptoms of flashback and
      nightmares. These recordings will provide the specific electrophysiological biomarkers of
      hypervigilance and re-experiencing. The device will then be programmed to detect and treat
      these biomarkers with a pre-determined electrical pulse. The patients will be followed
      prospectively using psychological scales but also with functional neuroimaging and
      electroencephalograms. These modalities will be used to determine the extent of circuit
      engagement as a result of the therapy. By approaching PTSD from a fear processing mechanism
      perspective, our project will serve as a proof of concept for other circuit-based therapies
      in psychiatry. This proposal is a multi-departmental effort involving 11 investigators across
      7 departments and requires a close collaboration between clinical and basic scientists. As a
      result, the findings underlying chronic recordings will bridge the basic science results from
      fear conditioning research to clinical neural processes in PTSD patients.
