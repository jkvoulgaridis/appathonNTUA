  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators long-term goal is to demonstrate the effectiveness of acupuncture for the
      treatment of adults with chronic pain of sickle cell disease (SCD), a debilitating pain
      syndrome characterized by acute and chronic pain. The objective of this study is to explore
      the feasibility and acceptability of acupuncture with adult sickle cell patients. The
      investigators will conduct the study with adults with chronic pain from SCD, 18 years old or
      greater. They will all receive acupuncture. Treatments will be twice weekly for 5 weeks for
      30 minutes. At baseline and post-treatment, subjects will complete measures that include
      pain, fatigue, anxiety, depressive symptoms, injustice experience, and pain catastrophizing.
      Subjects will also complete a measure of study acceptability, the Protocol Acceptability
      Scale for Treating SCD with Acupuncture at post-treatment. The investigators will describe
      the procedures and potential challenges to implementing the acupuncture protocol and the
      range in the subjects' Acceptability Scale scores. The investigators will expect to identify
      and rectify any procedural problems subjects will report regarding the 10-session study
      protocol.
