  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled trial that will assess the effects of an evidence
      based, multi-component, leadership support intervention, Resilience-Supportive Leadership
      Training (RESULT), using accelerated learning strategies aimed at improving Service Member
      resilience and readiness in the military.

      The intervention is expected to increase perceptions of resilience-supportive behaviors,
      resilience indicators, and related behavioral health outcomes such as emotion regulation,
      connectedness, team cohesion, psychological health, and physical health following the
      training from the perspective of the Service Member.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of our proposed study is to adapt our existing, evidence-based supportive leadership
      training for an active duty population, focusing on training junior leaders in the Army on
      ways they can enhance readiness and resilience in their soldiers, as well as their own
      resilience. The investigators will draw on best practices from existing military and civilian
      programs in a training that is engaging, interactive, and customizable. The investigators
      will use micro-learnings - small, bite-sized pieces of information delivered in
      non-traditional ways, such as short podcasts or videos to enhance the training and enable it
      to be integrated easily into both military and civilian jobs.

      The investigators will evaluate the effectiveness of our Resilience-Supportive Leadership
      Training (RESULT) intervention with U.S. Army soldiers stationed at Joint Base Lewis-McChord
      (JBLM) in the State of Washington. The study will include a control group, so The
      investigators can better determine whether any observed changes in our participants are due
      to our training programs, and not some other factor. The investigators anticipate that the
      training programs will have a positive impact on service member readiness and resilience,
      psychological health, team cohesion, and reduced loneliness.

      This research is designed to benefit not only U.S. Army soldiers but across all military
      branches, as well as first-responders and other civilian occupations that face highly
      stressful situations as part of their work. Our training will have the potential to
      positively contribute to the military by enhancing service member readiness and unit
      autonomy, and improving mental and physical health.
