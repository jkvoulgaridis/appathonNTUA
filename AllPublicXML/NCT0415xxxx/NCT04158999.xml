      This study; this work; The aim is to investigate the effects of mothers' nutritional status
      on breast milk macro nutrients (carbohydrate, fat and protein).

    <textblock>
      Macronutrients in breast milk can be affected by various factors. The mothers will be taken
      in the first 24 hours after birth and their nutritional habits, socio-demographic
      characteristics, anthropometric characteristics of the mother, body mass index will be
      examined and newborn characteristics will be taken. 2 ml sample from colostrum will be
      analyzed with milk analyzer instrument. The mothers will be re-checked on the 5th day and
      their anthropometric properties will be obtained. The same procedure will be repeated on the
      15th day after childbirth. At each control, the mother's last 24-hour feeding status will be
      taken and the nutritional values consumed by &quot;BeBis&quot; program will be examined.
