  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the efficacy and safety of dasatinib 70 mg once daily
      as first line therapy in patients with early chronic phase (CP) chronic myeloid leukemia
      (CML).

    <textblock>
      A multicenter, single-arm, prospective, open-label study to detect the efficacy and safety of
      70mg dasatinib by measuring rates of major molecular response (MMR) at 12 months in patients
      with CML-CP in China. Approximately 65 Patients will be recruited consecutively from the
      study sites during the enrollment period and will be given dasatinib 70 mg QD. The duration
      of patient participation will be 12 months.
