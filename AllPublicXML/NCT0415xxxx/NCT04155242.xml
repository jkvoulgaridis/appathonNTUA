    <textblock>
      This prospective cohort study aims to assess the utility of a panel of molecular biomarkers
      for predicting the risk of relapse of Barrett's Oesophagus after endoscopic treatment of
      early oesophageal neoplasia with RadioFrequency Ablation (RFA). Patients who received
      endoscopic treatment of early oesophageal neoplasia with RFA and achieved endoscopic
      remission will be recruited. During the surveillance visits patients will receive a
      Cytosponge test followed by an endoscopy with Narrow Band Imaging (NBI) magnification and
      biopsies. Patients will receive an endoscopy every 6 months and Cytosponge every 12 months
      for at least 2 years. Molecular biomarkers including a methylation panel on DNA and
      immunohistochemical markers on formalin fixed paraffin embedded samples. After 2 years of
      intensive endoscopic follow up, patients will be prospectively tracked for up to 3 years.

      The investigators will also evaluate:

        -  The risk of progression to dysplasia or oesophageal intestinal metaplasia (IM) in
           patients with IM at the GOJ post RFA in the absence of retreatment

        -  the diagnostic accuracy of NBI for IM/dysplasia at the GOJ .

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The panel of predetermined molecular biomarkers includes:

        1. IM-SCORE - a score quantifying the extent of intestinal metaplasia at GOJ, which uses a
           4-tier system based on the number of glands and the number of biopsies with features of
           IM. The score has been developed in a pilot study (manuscript under submission) and will
           be validated in this study

        2. Methylation markers- assessed by a PCR-based method (Methylight) on Cytosponge samples.

        3. P53 status.

        4. TFF3 protein expression.

    <description>As part of the post RFA treatment follow up patients will receive a Cytosponge test followed by an endoscopy with NBI magnification and biopsies. Four endoscopies will be performed during 2 years of active follow up together with up to 2 Cytosponge procedures. Molecular biomarkers including a methylation panel on DNA and immunohistochemical markers on formalin fixed paraffin embedded samples obtained during the examinations will be assessed. Patients will be then followed up for up to 3 years with standard endoscopy to assess for relapse of Barrett's oesophagus/IM/dysplasia.</description>

    <intervention_name>Cytosponge test</intervention_name>
    <description>The Cytosponge will be administered by the study nurse prior to the participant having the endoscopy, usually as part of the same visit to hospital. The capsule along with the string is swallowed by drinking a small glass of water. The participant is asked to hold the Cytosponge in situ for 5 minutes. The sponge contained within expands and is then drawn back by the research nurse up the oesophagus by the attached string, collecting cells as it moves upwards. This device received a letter of no objection by the MHRA for use in the BEST pilot trial (LRQ 0939857) but it is not CE marked. Cytosponge and research endoscopic biopsies will be couriered to the Fitzgerald laboratory, at the MRC Cancer Cell Unit on a regular basis. The specimens will be processed in conjunction with the Cambridge University Hospitals' NHS Foundation Trust tissue bank which is accredited to GLP standards.</description>

    <description>Endoscopy will be carried out with white light and NBI with optical magnification or near focus to inspect oesophagus and GOJ.
NBI magnification will be used to assess systematically the mucosal pit pattern at the GOJ and to look for light blue crest (LBC) sign.
Targeted biopsies will be taken from either areas with LBC or irregular pit pattern on NBI, followed by random biopsies as per clinical standard. A maximum of 6 biopsies will be taken at the GOJ (maximum 4 targeted and 4 random.. During the first 2 post RFA follow up, at discretion of the endoscopists, neo-suqamous biopsies can be taken in line with local policies.
Argon plasma coagulation ablation is allowed in a single island up to 5mm or up to 3 islands &lt;3mm within the study endoscopy as long as this does not represent an obstacle to GOJ biopsies.</description>

        Exclusion criteria

          1. Evidence of BE requiring additional RFA

          2. Anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy for high risk conditions, whereby
             discontinuation of the treatment is not recommended.

          3. Individuals with a diagnosis of an oro-pharynx, oesophageal or gastro-oesophageal
             tumour (T2 staging and above), or symptoms of dysphagia,

          4. Oesophageal varices, stricture or requiring dilatation of the oesophagus

          5. Individuals who have had a myocardial infarction or any cardiac event less than six
             months ago

          6. Patients whose primary previous ablative treatment was different from RFA, such as
             Photodynamic therapy (PDT), APC or Cryotherapy

          7. Participants who are unable to provide informed consent.

          8. Participants under age 18.

          9. Endoscopy is generally avoided in pregnant women and therefore it is unlikely that any
             pregnant women will be included although pregnancy would not be an absolute
             contraindication. Pregnancy/ pregnancy test will not be recorded as part of the trial.
