  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, observational, cohort study aiming to compare point-of-care
      high-sensitive troponin I testing from different sample types with central laboratory (CL) HS
      cTnI plasma samples.

      A registry of all included patients and their troponin results (POC, CL and HS cTnT) will be
      made to compare these testing methods.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Point-of-care (POC) troponin testing, defined as laboratory testing near a patient location
      with rapid availability of results, has attracted much interest in the emergency department
      setting (ED) and seems feasible. These devices might enable earlier decisions, reduce stay at
      the ED and improve patient flow. While an elevated troponin in patients with suspected acute
      coronary syndrome (ACS) confirms diagnosis and initiates adequate treatment, ruling out ACS
      aids in proper patient dismissal. A next step could be ruling out myocardial infarction by
      the general practitioner (GP) or fast responder using an on-site POC troponin test. However,
      drawing venous blood might not be easily available to every GP, especially not during peak
      hours. The Minicare cTnI is a bedside system which requires capillary blood, venous whole
      blood or plasma. The results of the troponin will be given within 10 minutes. It is a very
      sensitive troponin test, the most clinically sensitive available POC for c-Troponin.
      Currently Minicare prepares for a high sensitive troponin analysis targeting a reliable
      result within an hour after onset of chest pain. The objective of this study is to determine
      if high sensitive troponin testing by Minicare (POC HS cTnI) has the same analytical
      performance as standard high sensitivity troponin I testing in our central hospital
      laboratory ( CL HS cTnI ARCHITECT immunoassay analyzer, Abbott).

    <description>The primary objective is to compare the analytical performance (method and sample comparison) of Minicare® high sensitive troponin I testing (POC, different sample types) and conventional venipuncture troponin I test in our central hospital laboratory (CL) with the Abbott Architect.
This comparison will comprise:
Minicare® POC (different sample types) vs conventional HS cTnI CL test (Method comparison)
Minicare® capillary vs. Minicare® venipuncture and vs. Minicare® plasma (Sample comparison)
The analyses linked to the primary objectives are:
The agreement between POC (three sample types) and CL testing by using the Bland-Altman method.
The agreement between different POC sample types by using the Bland-Altman method.
The primary objective will be achieved by taking capillary and (an extra) venous blood samples (one per timepoint) from every patient presenting at the cardiac ED with chest pain suspected for ACS.</description>
