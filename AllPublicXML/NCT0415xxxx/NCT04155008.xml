  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Loss of appetite is a common symptom of patients with cancer and can cause distress which
      impacts patients and caregivers. Patients diagnosed with head/neck, lung or pancreatic cancer
      will be recruited for this study to decrease the suffering and distress associated with
      eating during cancer treatment and improve the quality of life of patients by implementing an
      algorithm utilizing nutrition intervention and appetite stimulants.

    <description>If the patient's prognosis is extremely poor (less than 12 weeks expected survival, based on discussion with the patient's treating physicians) and there is no additional disease modifying therapy planned, the patient will be prescribed 4mg dexamethasone (which is FDA approved), once daily, to be taken orally in the morning.</description>

    <description>If the patient does not have any history of marijuana use, mirtazapine will be prescribed. If the patient is under the age of 70, then the patient would be prescribed 15mg of mirtazapine (which is FDA approved), once daily, to be taken orally at bedtime. For geriatric population (if the patient is over the age of 70), then the patient would be prescribed 7.5mg of mirtazapine, once daily to be taken orally at bedtime.</description>
