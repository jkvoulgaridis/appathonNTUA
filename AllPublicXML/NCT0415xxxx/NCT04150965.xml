  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This a Phase I/II randomized trial for patients with relapsed refractory Multiple Myeloma who
      have relapsed after treatment with prior therapies. The protocol is designed to evaluate two
      agents, Anti-LAG-3 and Anti-TIGIT, in order to understand their immunologic effects and
      safety both as single agents and in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone. In these
      arms, patients will be treated with either Anti-LAG-3 or Anti-TIGIT respectively for one
      cycle as single agent followed by the addition of pomalidomide and dexamethasone in
      combination for subsequent cycles.

      A third arm allows patients to be treated with the FDA approved combination of elotuzumab
      plus pomalidomide and dexamethsone as a control. This arm will thus allow a concurrent
      standard of care comparator for the experimental arms.

      This study will enroll 104 patients to one of three treatment arms. The study is open to
      patients relapsing with refractory Multiple Myeloma who have:

        -  received 3 prior lines of therapy

        -  exposed to each of these 3 drug classes:

             -  IMiD

             -  proteasome inhibitors, and

             -  anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody

        -  relapsed and refractory are defined using the IMWG criteria:

             -  disease that is non-responsive while on salvage therapy or progresses within 60
                days of last therapy in patients who have achieved minimal response or better at
                some point previously to then progressing in their disease course.
