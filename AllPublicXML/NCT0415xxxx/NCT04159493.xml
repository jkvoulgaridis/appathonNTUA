  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      dose-de-escalation study whose purpose is to establish the lowest efficacious dose. The first
      40 subjects will be randomized 1:1:1:1 to either 500 mcg, 50 mcg, 10 mcg, or placebo. After
      four weeks of dosing with 500 mcg, vaginal pH, vaginal maturation index, and subject's most
      bothersome moderate to severe symptom will be assessed; the changes observed will be used as
      the benchmark for efficacy throughout the remainder of the study and select the next
      dose-level to be investigated. Subjects will be enrolled in small cohorts at various doses
      until the lowest effective dose is identified. Then, 1 to 2 doses and a placebo group will be
      expanded to enroll 70 subjects per treatment group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For each dose, an initial efficacy determination will be made based on changes in vaginal pH,
      vaginal maturation index, and patient's most bothersome moderate to severe symptom after four
      weeks of dosing. Depending on the initial efficacy results, one of the following dosing
      schemes may occur:

        -  If 50 mcg is determined to be inefficacious, 10 additional subjects will be enrolled at
           50 mcg. If 50 mcg is now determined to be efficacious, the dosing cohort will be
           expanded to 70 subjects at 50 mcg. If 50mcg is determined to be inefficacious, no groups
           will be expanded to 70 subjects.

        -  If 10 mcg is determined to be efficacious, an additional 10 subjects will be enrolled to
           2.5 mcg. If 2.5 mcg is determined to be efficacious, 10 subjects will be enrolled to
           0.25 mcg. If 0.25 mcg is efficacious, 0.25 mcg and 0.5 mcg will be enrolled to a total
           of 70 subjects per dose. If 0.25 mcg is determined to be inefficacious, 10 subjects will
           be enrolled to 0.5 mcg. If 0.5 mcg is determined to be efficacious, 0.5 mcg and 2.5 mcg
           will be enrolled to 70 subjects per dose. If 0.5 mcg is determined to be inefficacious,
           2.5 mcg and 5 mcg will be enrolled to 70 subjects per dose. If 2.5 mcg is determined to
           be inefficacious, 10 subjects will be enrolled to 5 mcg. If 5 mcg is determined to be
           efficacious, 5 mcg and 10 mcg will be enrolled to 70 subjects per dose. If 5 mcg is
           determined to be inefficacious, 10 mcg and 12.5 mcg will be enrolled to 70 subjects per
           dose.

        -  If 10 mcg is determined to be inefficacious, 10 subjects will be enrolled to 25 mcg. If
           25 mcg is determined to be efficacious, 10 subjects will be enrolled to 12.5 mcg. If
           12.5 mcg is determined to be efficacious, 12.5 mcg and 25 mcg will be enrolled to 70
           subjects per dose. If 12.5 mcg is determined to be inefficacious, 25 mcg and 50 mcg will
           be enrolled to 70 subjects per dose. If 25 mcg is inefficacious, 50 mcg will be expanded
           to 70 subjects.

      Subjects will be randomized 1:1:1 for each of the two doses selected and placebo for
      expansion to 70 subjects. For all doses evaluated, the mean change from baseline in vaginal
      maturation index and vaginal pH and the mean change from baseline in the most bothersome
      symptom will be assessed at the end of 12 weeks.

      Evaluation After 4 weeks of Dosing After four weeks of dosing, each dose will be assessed for
      its efficaciousness in altering the vaginal maturation index, the vaginal pH, and the most
      bothersome moderate to severe symptom. The response identified in the subjects dosed in the
      500 mcg cohort relative to placebo at four weeks will serve as the effect of the active
      control to assess the efficaciousness of the other dose levels. After reviewing these
      results, the sponsor will determine the assessment of subsequent dose levels.
