  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sarcoidosis is a multisystemic granulomatous disease of unknown origin. Fatigue is a common
      problem in sarcoidosis affecting between 50% and 80% of patients, and thus represents a major
      impairment of their quality of life.

      The findings of recent studies suggest a high prevalence of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) in
      patients with sarcoidosis, estimating a range from 17% to 67%. Pathomechanisms leading to
      this increased OSA prevalence are still unclear, yet likely to be multifactorial including
      sarcoid myopathy and neuropathy leading to impaired integrity of the upper airways as well as
      corticosteroid induced obesity.

      While both diseases, Sarcoidosis and OSA, could lead to fatigue and excessive daytime
      sleepiness (EDS) the current managing strategies differ significantly. OSA patients are
      mostly treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) whereas sarcoidosis associated
      fatigue may require increased immunosuppressive therapy. Little is known about treatment of
      fatigue and sleepiness in patients suffering from both conditions.This study aims to close
      this knowledge gap and define prevalence of OSA in a swiss cohort with sarcoidosis patients.

      Therefore, we plan a prospective, observational, controlled study to investigate the
      prevalence of sleepiness, fatigue, life quality and obstructive sleep apnoea in patients with
      Sarcoidosis.

      Patients treated in the University Hospital Zurich due to sarcoidosis will be invited by
      letter to take part in this study. After confirmed consent and baseline assessments at the
      University Hospital Zurich, these patients will undergo a single night, in-home sleep study
      to assess possible OSA.

      Sleepiness and fatigue specific questionnaires and in-home respiratory polygraphy (oRP) are
      obtained in all subjects. To assess inflammation status and other conditions connected to
      sleepiness like hypothyroidism and anaemia, sarcoidosis patients will undergo blood sampling.

    <description>Sarcoidosis patients and control subjects will undergo one night of home sleep apnea testing using ApnoeaLinkTM Plus device (ResMed Corporation, Poway, Calif). The device records the patient's nasal respiratory pressure signal as a surrogate of nasal flow, respiratory movements by a thoracic impedance belt, and finger pulse oximetry. The results of the sleep study will be scored automatically with dedicated software (ResMed Corporation, Poway, Calif), and manually reviewed to ensure data accuracy.</description>
