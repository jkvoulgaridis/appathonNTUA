  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      the risk of aspiration pneumonitis during cesarean sections has significantly decreased.
      Nevertheless, precaution against gastric aspiration is still vital in patients in whom
      regional anesthesia contraindicated or in whom general anesthesia has to be administered (for
      example; during emergency cesarean delivery). The administration of intravenous anesthetics
      reduces the level of consciousness of a patient that compromises the protective reflexes of
      the upper airways. Moreover, a high level of sedation also reduces the tone of the LES (lower
      oesophageal sphincter). Both these situations predispose the risk of aspiration pneumonia in
      patients awaiting surgical interventions in supine position under general anesthesia

      Since regional anesthesia has largely replaced general anesthesia, the risk of aspiration
      pneumonitis during cesarean sections has significantly decreased. Nevertheless, precaution
      against gastric aspiration is still vital in patients in whom regional anesthesia
      contraindicated or in whom general anesthesia has to be administered (for example; during
      emergency cesarean delivery). The administration of intravenous anesthetics reduces the level
      of consciousness of a patient that compromises the protective reflexes of the upper airways.
      Moreover, a high level of sedation also reduces the tone of the LES (lower oesophageal
      sphincter). Both these situations predispose the risk of aspiration pneumonia in patients
      awaiting surgical interventions in supine position under general anesthesia .

      The risk of aspiration increases in outpatients if the volume of the gastric contents
      increases beyond 25 ml, and its pH falls below 2.5. However, the risk of aspiration
      significantly decreases in &quot;fasted&quot; outpatients. Since most patients awaiting elective
      surgery remains fasted, routine prophylaxis for preventing aspiration pneumonitis not
      recommended anymore. Studies suggest that metoclopramide, in combination with H2-receptor
      antagonists (such as cimetidine), significantly reduces the risk of postoperative emesis and
      aspiration pneumonitis. However, the time available for administering oral prophylaxis with
      such anti-emetic and anti-histaminic is too short for these medications to be effective
