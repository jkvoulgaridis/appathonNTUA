    <textblock>
      This research study is studying the combination of anakinra and axicabtagene ciloleucel to
      reduce the occurrence of the side effects Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) and neurologic
      toxicities with relapsed or refractory Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).

        -  Relapsed NHL is the condition of returned Non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

        -  Refractory NHL is the condition of previous treatment resistant Non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

        -  Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) is a group of side effect symptoms that can include
           nausea, headache, rapid heartbeat, shortness of breath, kidney damage, and rash.

        -  Neurologic toxicity is nervous system disorder characterized by confusion

      This research study involves two drugs:

        -  Anakinra

        -  Axicabtagene Ciloleucel.

      This Phase 2, single center, open-label research study is studying the combination of
      Anakinra and Axicabtagene Ciloleucel to reduce the occurrence of the side effects Cytokine
      Release Syndrome (CRS) and neurologic toxicities in people with relapsed or refractory
      Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).

      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including
      evaluations and follow up visits.
