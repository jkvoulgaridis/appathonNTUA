  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical prehabilitation is the process of enhancing one's physical function and mental
      capacity to enable him/or her to withstand the stressor of surgery. Prehabilitation can be
      achieved via optimizing physical fitness, nutrition, and psychological health. Studies have
      shown that prehabilitation may prevent complications during and after surgery, reduce
      hospital length of stay, and improve postoperative recovery. Despite the growing interest in
      the field of prehabilitation, little is understood about how to implement prehabilitation an
      integrated clinical service. This study will examine the effect of a prehabilitation program
      that includes exercise, psychological, and nutritional optimization that emulates clinical
      integration pathways. Participants of this study will have a choice of participating in
      facility-based prehabilitation (FBP) or home-based prehabilitation (HBP) depending on their
      needs/accessibility to the Toronto General Hospital. Participant outcomes will be measured
      using standardized fitness testing, self-report questionnaires, and medical record reviews at
      baseline, one week preoperatively, and at 30 and 90 days postoperatively. A comprehensive
      assessment of feasibility will also be conducted to better understand facilitators and
      barriers to clinical integration.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is growing interest in the role of prehabilitation to reduce surgical risk, attenuate
      surgery-related deconditioning, and facilitate postoperative recovery. Compared to the
      postoperative setting, initiating health interventions preoperatively is proposed as an
      important strategy to improve health outcomes because: i) it targets modifiable risk factors
      for surgical complications; ii) patients may be more physically and/or psychologically
      capable of affecting change in health status compared to the early postoperative period; iii)
      wait times prior to surgery may be several weeks thus representing an opportunity to
      proactively invest in their recovery; and iv) patients may be sensitized to the importance of
      adverse health behaviours that may have contributed to the need for surgery (i.e. a
      'teachable moment'). The potential benefit of prehabilitation extends beyond potential gains
      in health from baseline to surgery, but also includes the prevention or attenuation of
      deconditioning that patients experience during the postoperative period. The findings of
      recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses assessing the benefits of prehabilitation
      interventions in surgical oncology provide support for their efficacy in improving physical
      fitness, length of stay, surgical complication rates, and health-related quality of life
      (HRQOL).

      While previous interventional studies have demonstrated promising findings, little is known
      about how feasible it is to integrate prehabilitation into standard of care for people with
      cancer awaiting surgery. This study intends to employ intervention design features previously
      shown to be feasible and efficacious and employs a hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial
      design model to assess feasibility of clinical integration.

    <measure>Window of opportunity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The 'prehabilitation window' will be recorded and is operationally defined as the time from program referral to the date of surgery.
