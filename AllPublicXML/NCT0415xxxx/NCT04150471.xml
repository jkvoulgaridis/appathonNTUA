  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is conducted in patients with newly diagnosed CP CML (Chronic Phase Chronic
      Myeloid Leukemia) who have achieved EMR (&lt; 10% IS BCR-ABL) at 3 months after first line
      treatment with dasatinib. Subjects will be allocated to 80mg QD based on EMR (Early Molecular
      Response) achievement and early safety profile following a standard of care approach.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will sign the consent forms for screening prior to frontline dasatinib therapy (1st)
      and the 3 month molecular test date (2nd). The molecular samples will be analyzed in the
      central lab as part of the screening procedure.

      Subjects will be treated for a maximum of 60 months after allocation of the last subject on
      the assigned regimen (dasatinib 80mg QD), unless disease progression, treatment failure or
      unacceptable toxicity occurs, the subject withdraws consent, or the study is discontinued by
      the sponsor. Subjects who discontinue study therapy early due to disease progression or
      intolerance to study medication will continue to be followed yearly for survival for up to 5
      years after allocation of the last subject. All subjects will be followed yearly for
      progression-free survival and overall survival.

      For patients who continue their assigned treatment, safety assessments will be conducted
      every 6 months and cytogenetic assessment as investigator assessment.

      Follow up visits after the last dose of study drug will be required at least every 4 weeks
      until all study related toxicities resolve to baseline (or CTC Grade ≤ 1), stabilize or are
      deemed irreversible.

        Adult CML-CP Ph+ patients with BCR-ABL1 will start frontline dasatinib 100mg QD treatment.
        Dasatinib monotherapy must have been started within 3 months of CP-CML diagnosis. Patients
        having BCR-ABL1 transcript level &lt; 10% IS (International Standard) after 3 months of
        treatment with frontline dasatinib will reduce dasatinib dose to 80mg QD and all of
        patients must have any grade of adverse events at 3 months.
