  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double blind, active-controlled, parallel group, multicenter 52-week
      Phase 3 study to compare the efficacy and safety of benralizumab 30 mg versus mepolizumab 300
      mg administered by subcutaneous (SC) injection every 4th week in patients with relapsing or
      refractory EGPA on corticosteroid therapy with or without stable immunosuppressive therapy.

      All patients who complete the 52-week double-blind treatment period on IP may be eligible to
      continue into an open label extension (OLE) period. The OLE period is intended to allow each
      patient at least 1 year of treatment with open-label benralizumab 30 mg administered SC every
      4th week (earlier enrolled patients may therefore be in the OLE for longer than 1 year).
