    <textblock>
      This interventional trial studies the effectiveness of adding cryoablation treatment in
      patients who are receiving standard of care immunotherapy to treat cancer that is has spread
      to other parts of the body (metastatic). Cryoablation uses a probe that freezes the tissue
      around the tumor to try to kill the cancer cells. Using cryoablation to treat cancerous
      lesions may help to kill the cancer cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the effect of cryoablation on adaptive resistance to immunotherapy in
      metastatic cancer patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess additional efficacy response to treatment. II. To assess the safety and
      tolerability of cryoablation in this population. III. To compare the radiologic response of
      ablated and non-ablated lesions using Immune-Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
      Tumors (iRECIST) and RECIST 1.1.

      IV. To assess the immune effect of cryoablation on the non-ablated lesion using pre- and
      post-treatment biopsies.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the immune microenvironment and systemic changes as a result of cryoablation
      with the goal of biomarker discovery.

      OUTLINE:

      Beginning 1 week prior to the next scheduled standard of care immunotherapy infusion,
      patients undergo core biopsy of the lesion to be ablated and a non-ablated lesion and also
      undergo cryoablation. Patients undergo a mandatory second core biopsy of the non-ablated
      lesion at 4 weeks after cryoablation.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up for 12 months after cryoablation and then
      periodically thereafter.
