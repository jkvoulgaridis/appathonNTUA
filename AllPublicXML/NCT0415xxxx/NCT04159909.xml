      The purpose of this study is to see if stimulation of the vagus nerve via a non-invasive
      device placed behind external ear can reduce physical and psychological discomfort during
      acute alcohol withdrawal in patients with alcohol use disorder when people just stop drinking
      alcohol and in detoxification stage.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The management of acute alcohol withdrawal is a clinical challenge, in part because there are
      limited medications available for the condition and the majority of the medications are
      controlled substances, which may cause significant adverse effects and can be potentially
      addictive.

      The rationale for using transcutaneous auricular VNS (taVNS) on a specific target area of the
      ear is based on anatomical studies suggesting that this area is the only place on the human
      body surface where there is afferent vagus nerve distribution (Mercante et al., 2018).
      Therefore, direct stimulation of the afferent nerve fibers on the ear can produce an effect
      similar to that by implanted device-generated VNS yet without the need of surgical
      intervention. Although taVNS has not been tested for treatment of AUD, it interestingly
      appears to be very similar to auricular acupuncture that has been widely used for AUD.
      However, acupuncture needs to be administered by medical providers who have undergone long
      trainings and own special licensure, which is usually unavailable in acute detoxification
      units where patients receive treatment for acute alcohol withdrawal.

      The pilot study will enroll 70 evaluable subjects who are in inpatient detoxification unit
      randomized to receive single-blind treatment with vagus nerve stimulation or sham stimulation
      (1:1, VNS: sham). Evaluable subjects are those who complete stimulations (VNS) or sham 5
      minutes twice a day for 4 days.

    <description>The primary clinical endpoint is the alcohol withdrawal symptoms assessed by the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol-Revised (CIWA-Ar) (Sullivan, Sykora, Schneiderman, Naranjo, &amp; Sellers, 1989) as well as the amount and frequency of as needed comfort medications (benzodiazepines, e.g., Chlordiaxepoxide, Lorazepam) used from day 1 to day 4 by the participants in acute detoxification inpatient unit treated with VNS compared to subjects receiving sham stimulation.</description>

    <measure>Assesssment of change of neruroinflammatory reflex by measurement of blood levels of cytokines following VNS treatment for acute alcohol withdrawal</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months after completion of pilot study (enrollment)</time_frame>
    <description>The mechanistic endpoints accompanying this protocol will evaluate potential effects of VNS on inflammatory markers and cytokines known to be involved with AUD. 8 ml venous whole blood from participants will be collected on Day 1 before receiving any VNS or sham treatment and on Day 5 after completing all 8 treatments. Serum and plasma from 8cc of whole blood will be collected, stored in aliquots at -20∙C. Serum levels of potential inflammatory markers and markers regulated by the alpha-7nAChR will be determined, including levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF, HMGB1, IL-6, Il1B, IFNα and IL10 which are known to be elevated in patients with AUD.</description>

    <description>5 minutes of stimulation (VNS) twice a day for 4 days. Patients will receive transcutaneous stimulation (30 Hz, 300 msec.) on the auricular branch of the vagus nerve 5 minutes twice a day for 4 days. Due to the theoretical risk that right vagus nerve stimulation could affect the heart, and to ensure consistency of the intervention, all subjects randomized to receive transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation will receive stimulation of the auricular branch of the left vagus nerve. The subject will be blinded to their treatment arm.
The device to be used will include a handheld electrical pulse generator and a pair of electrodes to be placed at the ear for stimulation. The specific target at the ear will be the auricular branch of the vagus nerve, which innervates the skin of a specific ear area termed &quot;Cymba Concha&quot;. Electrodes will be placed on this area to provide stimulation to the auricular branch of the afferent vagus nerve.</description>
