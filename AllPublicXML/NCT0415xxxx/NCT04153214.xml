  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The recent literature has highlighting the importance of the time of inactivity and the level
      of physical activity (PA) as predictors of metabolic cardio risks. Now, sedentary lifestyles
      are well recognized as one of the causes of mortality. As with physical activity, a
      dose-response relationship appears to exist: mortality would increase with time spent in
      sedentary behaviors. However, this relationship would not be linear: the more the daily
      sitting time increases, the more the consequences on mortality are important. It is now well
      demonstrated that time spent in sedentary adult behaviour finds primarily its origin in the
      work, characterized by prolonged and uninterrupted periods of sitting. Many strategies have
      been settled to break the prolonged sitting time. The most promising one seem to be the use
      of active workstations (treadmill, cycling, stepping) because they reduce sedentary time at
      work and increase physical activity with positive effects on the global health. If active
      workstations have demonstrated their effectiveness with overweight or obese people by
      increasing daily energy expenditure, their interest in prevention in normal weight people is
      less known. In addition, the long-term effectiveness of a program of reactivation by active
      workstation on biological parameters, quantitative and qualitative time of sedentary
      behaviour (duration, number of breaks) and physical fitness was not assessed.

      The main objective of this project is to study the effects of the use of a cycling
      workstation for 60 minutes per day (30 minutes twice a day) for 3 months among professionals
      with an office-sitting desk on overall quantity of physical activity time (work and non-work)
      and sedentary time.

      Subject will have a pre-inclusion visit during a medical consultation where the eligibility
      criteria to participate to this study will be checked.

      After the inclusion of subject and their agreements to participate to the study, they will
      know in which group they are :

        -  Group who performs 30minutes twice a working day from day 1 to day 180 (interventional)

        -  Group who performs 30minutes twice a working day from day 90 to day 180 (control)

      They will have evaluation at three different times : T0 (Day 1), T1 (Day 90), T2 (Day 180).
      The evaluation will evaluate :

        -  overall quantity and quality of physical activity time (work and non-work) and sedentary
           time

        -  Body composition

        -  Biological parameters

        -  Physical fitness

        -  Psychological parameters At the end of the protocol, there will be an assessment of the
           obstacles or motivations to this program.
