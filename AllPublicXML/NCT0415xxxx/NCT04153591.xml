  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To describe the prescribing patterns at MDMC for the treatment of newly diagnosed mural
      thrombus and to determine the efficacy and safety of DOACs apixaban, dabigatran, and
      rivaroxaban in comparison to warfarin.

      With limited treatment guideline consensus, minimal evidence to support the use of DOACs for
      LAA thrombus and LVT, and a lack of evidence for the use of DOACs in aortic thrombus, further
      research is warranted to determine the role of DOACs in the treatment of various mural
      thrombi in comparison to warfarin.

      Retrospective chart review of MDMC patients from 4/1/2017 to 8/31/19 with newly diagnosed
      mural thrombus.

      3.1. Study Methods

        -  Patients will be allocated into two groups: those who were prescribed DOACs upon
           discharge and those who were prescribed warfarin upon discharge

        -  Subgroup analyses will occur to evaluate the difference in efficacy and safety endpoints
           for patients into four categories including: those predisposed to mural thrombus by
           baseline risk factors (AFIB vs. ACS), location of the mural thrombus (atrial,
           ventricular, aortic), DOAC by agent (apixaban, rivaroxaban, dabigatran), and DOAC by
           scheduled dosing indication (AFIB vs. VTE).
