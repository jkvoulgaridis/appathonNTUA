  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, multidisciplinary, open-label, single-arm prospective clinical
      study. Fifty-one patients will be enrolled in this study, who have locally advanced-stage
      disease, including TNM stage cT3-4N1-2M0 and require a total laryngectomy as an initial
      therapy. Patients who achieved a CR or PR at the primary site after three cycles of
      TPF-regimen chemotherapy combined with immuotherapy will be referred for definitive RT and
      immuotherapy, while patients who received an evaluation of PD or SD at the primary site were
      referred for surgery followed by adjuvant RT/CRT.
