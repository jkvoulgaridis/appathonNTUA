  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to determine the effectiveness of a computerized clinical decision support tool
      (Best Practice Alert - BPA) in reducing unnecessary platelet transfusions based on guidelines
      published by national transfusion societies such as the AABB (formerly American Association
      of Blood Banks).

      A computerized alert will be deployed through the electronic health record. The alert will
      trigger when a provider orders platelet transfusion above a threshold supported by current
      guidelines. The alert will provide information on current evidence and give the provider the
      option to cancel the order or proceed. The alert will not be triggered in procedural areas
      such as the operating room or as part of any emergency orders to prevent any delays to urgent
      patient care.

      The proposed project will evaluate this alert by randomizing its implementation by patient
      chart. The investigators will observe the prevalence of this alert and its impact on ordering
      practices for the next 3 months. For patient charts randomized not to receive the
      intervention, the providers will not receive any alerts, but the analytics tool will record
      if the alert would have been triggered and the pertinent clinical information. After a period
      of three months, the investigators will review patient and provider information through
      analytics tools, assessing differences in platelet usage between the patients whose charts
      showed the alerts vs. those (control) patient charts not showing alerts.

    <description>Platelet transfusion orders for patients with a recent platelet count exceeding 50,000 per microliter (50k/uL) will trigger an alert in the electronic health record that displays current guidelines for platelet transfusion. The alert will allow providers to bypass the recommendation and continue with platelet ordering by selecting a clinical acknowledgement / exception to recommendation.Exclusions will be built into the alert to avoid triggering in operative or procedural settings, for neurosurgery providers, or patients on anti-platelet medications.</description>

    <description>Upon ordering platelets in patients with recent platelet count &gt;50,000, a pop-up within the electronic health system will recommend to not continue with transfuse product order and provide clinical exceptions to continue. Importantly, the alert does not trigger in operating areas, emergency medicine treatment areas, for certain specialties like neurosurgery or for massive transfusion orders.</description>
