  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A large number of frail older adults have difficulty performing activities of daily living
      and resuming former roles in the months following hospital discharge. This increases the risk
      of unplanned hospital readmissions and emergency visits after they return home.
      Comprehensive, patient-centered discharge planning has been reported to improve older adults'
      ability to perform activities of daily living and to reduce readmission rates after hospital
      discharge. However, to our knowledge, no evidence-based discharge protocol is routinely used
      in Canada with the frail population. An innovative discharge planning intervention called
      &quot;HOME&quot; was recently developed in Australia, which includes: 1) hospital based partnership
      with patient and family to establish goal setting and problem solving; 2) pre-discharge home
      assessment to address safety issues and problems with patient and family; 3) post-discharge
      home assessment and in-home training to address unmet needs; and 4) follow-up telephone calls
      to provide ongoing support to patient and family. A Canadian version of HOME has been
      developed. This will be followed by a large trial to investigate if this intervention
      increases functioning in daily life activities and decreases hospital and emergency
      readmissions for frail patients who are discharged home. Our proposed study is a preliminary
      and necessary step to identify problems that may arise during this large trial and address
      them proactively. If proven beneficial, the Canadian version of HOME would be an appropriate,
      applicable and acceptable intervention to improve patients' experiences and outcomes as well
      as change health practice surroundings discharge planning with frail older adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 31% of frail patients are readmitted to hospital within 30 days post-discharge. Unmet
      needs related to new difficulties in performing activities of daily living (ADL) upon
      returning home increase their risk of readmission. Comprehensive, patient-centered discharge
      planning has been reported to improve older adults' ability to perform ADL and to reduce
      readmission rates. To our knowledge, no such evidence-based discharge protocol is routinely
      used in Canada with the frail population.

      An innovative discharge planning protocol called &quot;HOME&quot; was recently developed in Australia
      and a randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted in a large sample of older adults in
      this country. The HOME intervention includes: 1-hospital-based partnership with patient and
      family to establish goal setting and problem solving; 2-pre-discharge home assessment to
      address safety issues and problems with patient and family; 3-post-discharge home assessment
      training to address unmet needs; and 4-Follow-up telephone calls to provide ongoing support
      to patient and family. Using the HOME protocol in a real-world Canadian context is expected
      to yield positive functional and clinical outcomes for this population. This hypothesis needs
      to be verified through a full-scale pragmatic mixed-method (qualitative and quantitative)
      RCT. This innovative method supports the integration of research into care and increase
      understanding of the results. Given the changes we are making to the Australian design and
      the different context in which the research will be done, a feasibility study will first be
      conducted to help circumvent problems that may arise during the full-scale RCT. Thus this
      study aims to assess the feasibility of conducting a fully powered multi-site, pragmatic,
      mixed-method RCT that will evaluate the comparative effectiveness of a Canadian version of
      HOME with respect to (a) functional outcomes: independence in ADL and functional goal
      attainment; and (b) clinical outcomes: unplanned hospital readmissions and emergency
      department visits.

      A pragmatic pilot RCT using a rater-blinded mixed-method design will be conducted over a
      2-year period. Seventy-two frail hospitalized older adults will be consecutively recruited in
      Sherbrooke (Quebec). Participants will be randomly allocated to the intervention group (HOME)
      or the control group (customary in-hospital care). Feasibility data, including recruitment
      and retention rates, will be collected. Quantitative methods will be used to explore the
      effect of the HOME intervention on (a) functional outcomes, measured by the Functional
      Autonomy Measurement System and the Goal Attainment Scale, and (b) clinical outcomes based on
      medical chart data reviews. A qualitative method embedded in the RCT will be used to explore
      how the intervention is experienced by clinicians, patients and families to plan further
      refinements. Measures will be taken at baseline, 1 and 3 months post-discharge.

      With the participation of the Australian research team and a network of patient-caregiver
      representatives, clinicians, and key policy makers (e.g., Quebec Ministry of Health), this
      study will provide clinically-relevant results to support the full-scale RCT. By providing
      evidence on the effectiveness, benefits and potential drawbacks in a real-world context of
      the two options (HOME vs customary care), findings from this RCT will help stakeholders make
      decisions about the best way of delivering discharge planning care for frail patients.

    <intervention_model_description>A feasibility study including a pragmatic, rater-blinded, mixed-method pilot RCT will be conducted over a 2 year-period to prepare for our large-scale planned study design. 72 frail older adults will be consecutively recruited from 2 acute care wards (geriatric and medicine units) in a hospital located in a semi-urban area (Sherbrooke, Quebec). Participants will be randomly assigned to receive HOME (experimental; n=36) or customary discharge planning (control; n=36). The number of participants is achievable within the time frame as, based the number of beds and average length of stay, approximately 1200 potential eligible patients are admitted yearly. This number (n=72) would make it possible to detect a large effect size, based on calculation for primary outcomes (α = 0.05; power = 80%) and the expected dropout rate (a ≈ 16-20%). Randomization will occur after baseline assessment using randomly generated numbers provided by a statistician not involved in data collection.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>HOME will be delivered by a community-based OT, who will be involved in the hospital discharge planning, trained by the PI. The HOME intervention comprises 4 phases: Phase 1 (in hospital): The clinician will focus on building a rapport with the patient and family members. Information will be gathered about the participant's home environment and functional ability. Phase 2 (± 5 days prior to expected discharge): Clinician will conduct a pre-discharge home assessment with patient and family to evaluate the environment, identify potential problems, and suggest appropriate ways to address them. Phase 3 (&lt;1 week after discharge): Post-discharge home assessment will be conducted to provide additional in-home training and follow up on any of the patient's unmet needs. Phase 4 (2-4 weeks post-discharge): Follow-up telephone calls will be made to provide ongoing support to participant and family and encourage self-problem solving and independence.</description>

    <description>Usual care group will receive the customary discharge planning assessment by a different clinician (OT). During this assessment, according to usual care, information regarding the participants' ability to perform activities of daily living and regarding their home environment is gathered and used to plan for discharge. Usual care group will not receive an OT home assessment as this is not part of usual care. If the clinician identifies a potential need for assistive equipment and home modification needs, patients will be referred to community-based homecare services as is the current practice, and a home visit may be performed following discharge, typically after an lengthy wait (weeks, months) for service.</description>

    <description>HOME's focus is on the person's functional ability, safety and transition from hospital to home. HOME will be delivered by a community-based clinician (OT who will be involved in the hospital discharge planning) trained by the PI. Training will include two sessions covering assessment of functional ability, goal setting and home safety. The clinician will keep a record of recommendations provided, length of home visit and any adverse events during the intervention. Twice over the course of the study, the PI leader will observe the clinician conducting HOME interventions to assess adherence to the study protocol using a fidelity checklist. The HOME intervention comprises 4 phases, which are described in the arms section.</description>
