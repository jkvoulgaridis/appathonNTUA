  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study aims to evaluate the usefulness of protocol biopsies in a cohort of renal
      transplant patients of high immunological risk for graft injury and loss.

  <detailed_description>

      This will be a prospective study undertaken at the Renal Transplant Unit of Hospital of
      Clinics of Porto Alegre. In addition to the routine evaluation commonly carried-out at this
      post-transplant period, protocol biopsies will be performed at the 10th-week
      post-transplantation in high-risk transplant recipients. Biopsy fragments will be evaluated
      for tissue immune aggression (mainly cellular and antibody-mediated rejections) and other
      conditions such as infections, particularly polyomavirus and cytomegalovirus and medication
      toxicities. The presence of donor-specific antibodies and graft-damaging infectious agents
      will also be searched in the peripheral blood at the time of biopsy.One hundred patients will
      be randomized to a protocol biopsy and noninvasive assessment or only for noninvasive
      assessment. The hypothesis of the study is that biopsies will lead to treatments that may
      allow better outcomes of renal transplants, related to lowering the progression of
      subclinical aggressions, avoiding or delaying graft loss and preserving or decreasing the
      rate of loss of the glomerular filtration rate. Therefore, this strategy has the possibility
      of reaching clinical practice routine and thus contribute positively to the management of
      renal transplant patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Adult kidney transplants, with high immunological risk, who consented to participate in the
        study by signing the informed consent form. The high immune risk is defined by:

          -  Positive pre-transplant T-lymphocyte cross-test by flow cytometry (channel deviation
             greater than 62);

          -  Flow cytometry pre-transplantation positive B lymphocyte cross-test (channel deviation
             greater than 112);

          -  Calculated panel reactivity greater than 50% in class I and / or class II;

          -  Presence in the pre-transplantation serum of donor class I and / or II anti-Human
             Leukocyte Antigen antibodies with intensity and fluorescence greater than 1000;

          -  Occurrence of cellular or antibody-mediated rejection within 30 days prior to the date
             of the protocol biopsy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with contraindication to renal graft biopsy;

          -  Patients whose biopsy fragments are not representative;

          -  Patients with graft dysfunction in whom renal graft biopsy is indicated within 4 weeks
             prior to protocol biopsy.
