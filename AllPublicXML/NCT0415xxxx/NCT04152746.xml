  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Periostin is a matricellular protein that has been shown to be a marker of Type 2
      inflammation associated with airway eosinophilia. Matricellular proteins are highly expressed
      at sites of injury or inflammation. Periostin involves tissue fibrosis and remodeling in the
      nasal mucosa in some of the otolaryngologic diseases. The up-regulation of periostin
      expression has been shown in allergic rhinitis, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps ,
      and aspirin intolerant asthma. In the light of these findings the investigators aimed to
      evaluate the relation between adenoid hypertrophy and periostin levels.

  <detailed_description>

      A total of 40 patients-age ranged between 2 and 12 years- were planned to enroll in the study
      prospectively. Patients that were scheduled to undergo adenoidectomy were included in the
      study group (adenoid group). The control group comprised of 20 healthy children who had
      previously been treated for anemia in the out-patient clinic of the Pediatrics Department and
      were clinically healthy with normal complete blood cell counts at their follow-up visits.

      Serum samples were obtained from the two groups. The samples were centrifuged at 1500 g for 5
      minute and stored in -80 oC for later analysis of periostin levels. Adenoid tissue and normal
      mucosal tissue samples were obtained from the adenoidectomy patients and stored in -80 oC for
      later homogenization and measurement of periostin levels.
