  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pediatric cardiac patients undergoing surgical anesthesia are at an increased risk of poor
      neurologic outcome (20-50%). Unattenuated anesthetic exposure and pain contributes to
      physiologic perturbations that may increase neurologic morbidity. Because of the often-large
      exposure to anesthetic agents in these cardiac children, at such a young age and the
      potential modifying anesthetic practice that could lead to improved neurodevelopmental
      outcomes and surgical recovery is paramount. Regional anesthesia such as thoracic epidurals
      provide effective analgesia and reduced intraoperative anesthetic needed but carry
      devastating sequelae neurological risks of epidural hematomas after anticoagulation during
      cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Recently, a newly described erector spinae plane block (ESPB)
      is superficial to neuraxial or vascular structures, providing opportunity to be placed with
      less risk for surgery requiring CPB. This block has been described as effective regional
      anesthesia for adult cardiac surgery.

    <description>In volatile anesthetic technique, maintenance of anesthesia will be standardized to the volatile anesthetic isoflurane. Isoflurane will be delivered at 1.5-2.0%% as required for anesthetic management.
Rocuronium or pancuronium will be used for muscle relaxation. Narcotic, fentanyl will be administered at no greater than 2 mcg/kg/hr. However, the primary anesthetic during CPB will be isoflurane with no narcotic administered during CPB.</description>

    <intervention_name>Erector Spinae Plane Block</intervention_name>
    <description>The ESPB is a fascial plane block performed by injecting local anesthetic between the erector spinae muscle and the transverse process. Its proposed mechanism of action is via blockade of the dorsal and ventral rami of the thoracic spinal nerves and sympathetic fibers.</description>
