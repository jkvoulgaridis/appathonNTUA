  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to better understand HHT, the symptoms and complications it causes
      (&quot;outcomes&quot;) and how the disease impacts people's lives. The investigators are aiming to
      recruit and gather information together in the Registry from 1,000 HHT patients from four HHT
      Centres of Excellence in North America. The Investigators will collect long-term information
      about the people in the Registry, allowing the investigators to understand how the disease
      changes over time, and what factors can influence those changes. Ultimately, this should help
      improve treatments for the disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background and Rationale HHT has an estimated prevalence of 1 in 5000, affecting children and
      adults, in multiple organs. The disease is characterized by the presence of vascular
      malformations (VMs), including arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) of the lung, liver, brain,
      spinal cord and smaller mucosal lesions (telangiectasia) of the nose, mouth and GI tract.
      These lesions lead to acute and chronic bleeding, stroke, heart failure and death. Treatments
      are currently mostly limited to managing complications, while approximately 90% of adults
      have ongoing symptoms, despite best surgical and medical therapies. With recent drug
      development related to angiogenesis, there is hope for effective novel therapies.
      Investigators, experts, the International HHT Guidelines, Pharma representatives, the CDC and
      HHT patient advocates (curehht.org) all agree that there is an urgent need for natural
      history data in this disease, with characterization of clinical outcomes, to allow patients
      to benefit from the explosion of drug development in the field.
