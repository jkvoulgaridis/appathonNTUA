      Objective: To investigate the current clinical practice of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB)
      in patients with early stage breast cancer in China. Methods: The data of early breast cancer
      patients who underwent SLNB in 40 Grade III Level A hospitals in China in 2018 will be
      collected. Different centers, tracer methods, molecular typing and neoadjuvant chemotherapy
      will be used as stratification factors to analyze the implementation rate, number of
      detections, positive rate of SLNB and the follow-up treatment.
