      A novel dynamic random-dot stereopsis test that included motion + disparity (MD), motion (M),
      and disparity (D), in which the disparity cues range from 200 to 1200 arc-seconds was used.
      The characteristics of preoperative dynamic stereopsis in 83 intermittent exotropia patients
      and its associations with clinical features were analysed, and the prognosis was followed up
      on the 1st day and 2nd, 6th and 12nd months postoperatively.
