  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Canada, approximately 20% of patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) have
      treatment-resistance and fail to respond to trials of pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy.
      Although the treatment of choice has historically consisted of electroconvulsive therapy
      (ECT), this is not always feasible or practical, and carries a risk of side-effects that may
      be unacceptable to certain patients.

      In this pragmatic, multi-site, placebo-controlled and double-blinded clinical trial,
      participants with ultra treatment-resistant MDD will be randomized to receive either active
      or sham transcranial direct current stimulation in addition to their usual treatment. Ultra
      treatment-resistant depression will be operationally defined as MDD that has failed to
      respond to at least five previous trials of antidepressants at sufficient doses, or ECT, or
      ketamine. Patients will receive a total of 30 active or sham treatment sessions (5 per week),
      for 30 minutes per session. In both groups, the anode will be placed over the left
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (position F3), and the cathode over the right dorsolateral
      prefrontal cortex (position F4). Patients in the sham group will receive electrical
      stimulation at 2 mA for less than 30 seconds, whereas patients in the active group will
      receive that level of stimulation for the entire duration of treatment.

      The study's primary outcome is the change in score on a clinician-graded depression inventory
      (the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scales). Secondary outcomes include change in scores
      on a self-administered depression rating scale and measurement of function scale. Information
      on language ability will also be collected, as will data on side-effects of treatment. Scores
      will be collected before the trial start, after every 10 sessions, and one month after trial
      completion.

The short period of active stimulation is included to stimulate the somatic sensations of active therapy. The trickle current at 0.3 mA is necessary to measure electrode contact and prevent investigators from deducing that the device is no longer active. Participants will receive the sham therapy on sequential weekdays for a total of 30 sessions. Participants will continue to receive their usual pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Currently suffering from an MDE with a score on the Montgomery-Ã…sberg Depression
             Rating Scale (MADRS) greater than 34 (signifying severe depression)

          -  Have ultra treatment resistant MDD (defined as failure to remit despite adequate
             trials with five antidepressants, or failure to remit with ECT, or failure to remit
             with ketamine)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have been diagnosed with psychosis, an addiction disorder (other than nicotine),
             borderline personality disorder, or antisocial personality disorder, as these
             conditions could interfere with adherence to the study protocol

          -  Are currently using a herbal compound or known NMDA-modulating agent, as these
             substances could interfere with the induction of LTP and thereby limit the
             effectiveness of tDCS

          -  Are pregnant, as tDCS has not been adequately studied in this population

          -  Have an electronic implant, cardiac dysrhythmia, seizure disorder, neurological
             disorder, or neurosurgical history, as the safety of electrical stimulation with tDCS
             cannot be assured given these comorbidities
