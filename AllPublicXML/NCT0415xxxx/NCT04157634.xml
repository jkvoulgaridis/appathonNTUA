  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to develop a integrated predictive model based on serum biomarkers, HRV, and
      an innovative computerized classifier output, to predict the patient long term neurological
      outcome after a moderate or severe TBI in children.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in children. Most
      children with moderate and severe TBI have long term sequelae including neurological deficit,
      cognitive impairment and behavioural disorders. In the acute care setting, neither clinicians
      nor researchers are able to adequately predict the long term outcome of children with TBI,
      consequently limiting their ability to tailor medical care, rehabilitation and support
      services. Improving our understanding of a TBI patient's exact cerebral status and prognosis
      is a critical step toward optimized and personalized patient management. In this research
      study, an innovative and integrated model will be developed to improve the prognostication in
      the early phase of a TBI. This model will combine key clinical variables commonly collected
      in the acute care setting and combine these with cutting-edge empirical measures: 1)
      biomarkers; 2) a new physiological monitoring based on heart-rate variability (HRV) to assess
      the integrity of the autonomic system; and 3) a computerized classification tool developed
      using the concept of artificial intelligence to continuously categorize the patient's
      cerebral status.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Children 1) &lt;18 years; 2) admitted to the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit at the Centre
        Hospitalier Universitaire Ste-Justine; 3) moderate (Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS): 9-12) or
        severe TBI (GCS ≤8), assessed after initial resuscitation; 4) admitted to the Paediatric
        Intensive Care Unit less than 24 hours after the initial TBI and 5) written parental
        consent. Patients with either inflicted or accidental TBI will be included as they
        characterize different but important population, our model should be valuable for both.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Children 1) suspected of being brain death at the time of Paediatric Intensive Care Unit
        entry (GCS 3 and loss of all brain stem reflexes); 2) with a pacemaker (HRV monitoring
        unreliable); and/or 3) patients or parents who do not speak or read English or French.
