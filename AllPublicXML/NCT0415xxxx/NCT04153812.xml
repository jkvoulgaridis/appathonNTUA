  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on the mechanism hypothesis and clinical efficacy of VNS in treating refractory
      depression, this study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of VNS in treating refractory
      depression through a small sample of clinical trials

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is a prospective, self - controlled clinical validation study. Subjects
      who met the inclusion criteria and did not meet the exclusion criteria were screened to enter
      the test. After admission, subjects received vagus nerve stimulation and conventional
      treatment. Enrolled 10 subjects. Parameter setting and observation were performed 2 weeks
      after implantation of the vagus nerve stimulation lead and pulse generator, and follow-up
      evaluation was performed at 3, 6 and 12 months.
