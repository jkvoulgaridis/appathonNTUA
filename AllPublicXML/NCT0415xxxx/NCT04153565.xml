  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, non-randomized, study of pembrolizumab (PBZ) in
      combination with cisplatin (CIS) and pemetrexed (PMX) in treatment of naïve participants with
      a histologically confirmed diagnosis of advanced malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) in
      Japanese participants. This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary
      efficacy of PBZ in combination with CIS and PMX. The primary objective is to evaluate the
      safety and tolerability of treatment with PBZ in combination with CIS and PMX.
