      This phase-2 monocenter non-randomized prospective clinical trial evaluates the effectiveness
      of minimally invasive microwave ablation plus immunotherapy for unresectable non-metastatic
      locally advanced pancreatic cancer.

      Research Hypothesis Does MIS-MWA combined with durvalumab (MEDI4736) plus tremelimumab and
      gemcitabine prolong progression-free survival in patients with unresectable non-metastatic
      adenocarcinoma of the pancreas?

      Investigational Product(s) and Reference Therapy:

      Combination of Durvalumab (fixed dose of 1500 mg) and Tremelimumab (fixed dose of 75 mg) will
      be given 2 weeks before surgery.

      Minimally invasive surgical microwave ablation (MIS-MWA) of the pancreatic tumor will be
      performed two weeks after the first dose of Durvalumab and Tremelimumab After 4 doses of
      Durvalumab and Tremelimumab, only Durvalumab 1500mg is provided q4w until disease
      progression.

      Systemic gemcitabine will be started 6 weeks after MIS-MWA. Gemcitabine will be given at a
      dose of 1000 mg /m² body surface, once a week for 3 weeks, followed with a week of rest.

      Objectives:

      Primary Objectives:

      Progression-free survival (PFS)

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  Safety: clinical and hematological toxicity (NCI CTCAE v. 5.0) of chemotherapy and
           immunotherapy

        -  Safety: number and type of postoperative complications of the MIS-MWA procedure

        -  Length of hospital stay

      Tertiary Objectives Overall survival (OS)

    <description>The study is exploratory and cannot be statistically powered for comparisons. Median progression-free survival (PFS) time is chosen as the clinically meaningful outcome. Survival estimates will be calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. For information, the reference PFS time in patients with non-metastatic LAPC treated with gemcitabine monotherapy is about 6 months. Results will be presented descriptively.</description>
