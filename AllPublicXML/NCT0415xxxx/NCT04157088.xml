  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers in this study want to compare the effects of drug darolutamide and drug
      enzalutamide on physical function, including balance and daily activity, in patients with
      castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Both darolutamide and enzalutamide are approved
      AR inhibitors used for the treatment of patients with CRPC. AR inhibitor is a substance that
      keeps androgens (male sex hormones) from binding to proteins called androgen receptors, which
      are found in normal prostate cells, some prostate cancer cells, and in some other cells.
      Preventing this binding blocks the effects of these hormones in the body and therefore keeps
      prostate cancer cells from growing. Patients participating this study will receive either
      darolutamide or enzalutamide tablets. To evaluate the physical function, patients will be
      asked to make some movements like rising from a chair, walking three meters, etc.
      Additionally, researchers also want to find out the survival of patients and if patients have
      fatigue (feeling tired), cognitive (learning and thinking) problems, or other medical
      problems during the trial. Brand name of darolutamide is Nubeqa; brand name of enzalutamide
      is Xtandi.
