    <textblock>
      This study will recruit 400 participants who are taking part in the Computed Tomography
      Coronary Angiography for the Prevention of Myocardial Infarction (SCOT-HEART 2) trial. The
      investigator will assess diet, activity and habits at the start of the study and 6 months
      later. This will help us understand the effects taking part in the study may have on
      lifestyle. In addition, for participants who have CT scans, the investigator will present the
      results of the heart from the CT scan. This will help us understand how best to explain the
      results of the CT scan to patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a sub-study of the SCOT-HEART 2 trial (which aims to determine the best way to
      prevent heart attacks).

      The purpose of this sub-study is to determine the effect of getting information on heart
      disease risk on lifestyle. At present doctors usually use a &quot;risk score&quot; to identify people
      at risk of heart disease who may benefit from medical treatment. In the SCOT-HEART 2 study
      the investigator will compare this &quot;risk score&quot; to a specialised heart scan (a computed
      tomography coronary angiogram or CTCA scan). In this study the investigator would like to
      understand more about the effects of receiving this information about the heart on lifestyle,
      including effects on smoking, diet and activity.

      This study will recruit 400 participants who are taking part in the SCOT-HEART 2 trial. The
      investigator will assess lifestyle by using a detailed questionnaire which will be done at
      the start of the study and 6 months later. The investigator will also perform some simple
      investigations including a carbon monoxide breath test, blood pressure tests and measurements
      of activity such as step counts. This will help us understand the effects on lifestyle of
      getting information about a &quot;risk score&quot; or having a CT scan. In addition, for people who
      have CT scans the investigator will either provide a verbal explanation of the results, as is
      usual, or show pictures of the heart from the CT scan. This will help us understand how best
      to explain the results of the CT scan to partipants.

    <description>The baseline assessment will be completed on the same day as consent is gained. Every patients will complete a comprehensive assessment including questionnaires and objective assessments.
Patients randomised to standard care with ASSIGN score alone (n=200) will be invited back approximately 6 months after baseline assessment. The detailed questionnaire, breath test, blood pressure monitoring, and 2-week activity monitor will be repeated. Bloods will be retaken to look at change in lipid levels and HbA1c where appropriate - no more than 30mls will be required.</description>

The review WITH images (VISUAL REPORT N=100) group will have results delivered by the principal investigator (a trained Cardiology Registrar) to ensure a standardised approach to relaying information. These results will be preliminary and focused only on whether the patient has evidence of coronary disease or not. A full report describing the extent of coronary disease, other cardiac problems and incidental findings will follow as per the SCOT-HEART-2 protocol. Patients will be made aware that the presented findings are a focused preliminary report and that a more detailed formal report will follow.</description>
