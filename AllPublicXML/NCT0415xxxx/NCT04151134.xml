  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a cancer that originates from the cells lining the body and
      can spread into the lymph glands and beyond. Some patients first present with an SCC which
      has moved to the lymph glands of the neck. Clinical examination and imaging investigations
      are performed to try and identify the site where the cancer has originated. However, if no
      original site can be identified, then the investigators call these 'cancers of an unknown
      primary' (CUP) of the head and neck.

      One region where these cancers could have originated from is the oropharynx. There are two
      areas in the oropharynx were cancers commonly arise. One area is the palatine tonsils, which
      can be removed for analysis with an operation called tonsillectomy. The other area is the
      tissue lining the back of the tongue, known as the tongue base. A relatively new surgical
      technique called 'tongue base mucosectomy' (TBM) allows removal of this tissue to see if the
      primary cancer is contained within it. This study will then use a histological method called
      'step serial sectioning' (SSS) to look in more detail at the tonsils and tongue base, hoping
      to increase the detection rate of the primary cancer.

      Centres performing TBM will be asked to participate. Patients will be asked to consent to
      their tissue being used for SSS after it has undergone conventional histology. Anonymised
      samples will be sent to a central laboratory in Newcastle for processing. Other anonymised
      data regarding the patients' diagnosis and care will be collated. Patients will be asked to
      complete questionnaires regarding pain and swallowing recovery following surgery. A smaller
      cohort of patients will also be interviewed as part of a qualitative research process to
      establish their views on CUP and the acceptability of the above treatment.
