  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II single arm study is being done to determine if bavituximab could potentially
      synergize with PD-1 inhibitor therapy to generate an effective anti-tumor immune response in
      patients with recurrent/metastatic squamous cell head and neck cancer (HNSCC) who progressed
      on a PD-1 inhibitor.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to assess whether treatment with bavituximab shifts the cellular
      balance to favor an effective T-cell mediated antitumor response resulting to an enhanced
      response in conjunction with pembrolizumab. Bavituximab is a chimeric (human/mouse)
      monoclonal antibody that targets phosphatidylserine (PS). PS facilitates the recognition and
      clearance of dying cells, triggering the release of immunosuppressive cytokines and
      inhibiting the production of proinflammatory cytokines. Within the tumor microenvironment, PS
      polarizes macrophages toward an immunosuppressive phenotype. Bavituximab upregulates the
      adaptive T cell-mediated response through crosslinking FCRγ and dampening of signaling
      between PS and PS receptors on immunosuppressive myeloid-derived suppressor cells.

      Thus, the investigators are doing this phase II single arm study to determine if bavituximab
      could potentially synergize with PD-1 inhibitor therapy to generate an effective anti-tumor
      immune response in patients with recurrent/metastatic squamous cell head and neck cancer
      (HNSCC) who progressed on a PD-1 inhibitor.

             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

          -  Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit
             through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.

          -  Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies).

          -  Has known active Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA
             [qualitative] is detected).

          -  Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy. Note:
             Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and
             are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist®) are live
             attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed.

        Patients with a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (&gt;10 mg
        daily prednisone equivalent) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of
        randomization. Inhaled or topical steroids and adrenal replacement steroid doses &lt; 10 mg
        daily prednisone equivalent, are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease.
