  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers are evaluating if subjects who have already experienced tonic spinal cord
      stimulation would have a better pain relief status with burst spinal cord stimulation.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a controlled trial with subjects that have an already-implanted SCS device (Eon
      Mini™) and are not satisfied with their pain relief status. As part of medical standard of
      care, patients with already-implanted Eon family tonic implantable pulse generators (IPGs)
      have the opportunity to experience burst stimulation for 30-Day Trial FDA approved. The aim
      of the study record patients experience during the 30-Day Trial using standard
      questionnaires.
