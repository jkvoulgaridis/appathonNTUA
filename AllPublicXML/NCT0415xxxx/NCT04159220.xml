  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intra hospital transport of ICU patients is still at high risk of respiratory
      complications.We propose to determine if endotracheal tube clamping prior to disconnect
      ventilator allows to avoid oxygenation decrease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Changing respiratory support and multiples endotracheal tube disconnections may induce a loss
      of PEEP and finally lead to alveolar derecruitment. This study is an evaluation of a care
      procedure to limit the incidence of alveolar derecruitment in ventilated intubated ICU
      patients during transport for CT scan.

      Intra hospital transport of ICU patients are performed by anesthesiologist nurses, the
      physician entrusts them this activity.

      This is a randomized controlled study, the procedure is to clamp endotracheal tube before
      each disconnection from ventilator.
