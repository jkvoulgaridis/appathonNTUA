    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to explores various psycho-social, physiological, cognitive,
      behavioral, and environmental factors that may affect the association between pulmonary
      status and Susceptibility to Electronic Cigarette Use

    <textblock>
      In this study self-report questionnaires will be distributed and it should take between 20-25
      minutes. Participants will be be asked questions related to smoking history, e-cigarette use,
      psychosocial factors, behavioral factors, environmental factors, and cognitive factors.

      There is also an option of taking a web-based survey, Qualtrics® (Qualtrics, Provo, UT), if
      they do not have enough time to complete the surveys at this time. The online version of the
      questionnaires will be sent to the one week from now.

      There is also a follow-up 5 minutes call with 6 months after today to follow-up with any
      change regarding to e-cigarette use.

    <measure>To examine psychosocial (stress, depression, anxiety) as mediators of the relationship between pulmonary disease status and susceptibility to using e-cigarettes.</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The DASS-21 is a clinical assessment that measures the state of depression, It has 21 questions. The internal consistency of the DASS-21 scales was acceptable (depression: alpha = .829). The scale range is from 0 to 28 + with 0 being closest to normal and 28+ being extremely severe. The DASS-21 is a clinical assessment that measures the state of anxiety, It has 21 questions. The internal consistency of the DASS-21 scales was acceptable (anxiety : alpha = .778). The scale range is from 0 to 20 + with 0 being closest to normal and 20+ being extremely severe. The DASS-21 is a clinical assessment that measures the state of stress, It has 21 questions. The internal consistency of the DASS-21 scales was acceptable (stress : alpha = .871). The scale range is from 0 to 37 + with 0 being closest to normal and 37+ being extremely severe</description>

    <measure>To examine physiological variables (quality of life) as mediators of the relationship between pulmonary disease status and susceptibility to using e-cigarettes.</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The Health Survey SF-12 questionnaire will be used to assess the quality of life (Ware, Kosinski, &amp; Keller, 1996). The SF-12 is a reliable and valid instrument. Internal consistency, test-retest reliability, construct (convergent and discriminant) validity, and criterion (concurrent and predictive) validity have been shown to be adequate (continuous variable). The minimum score is 0 and maximum score is 100, and higher scores mean a better quality of life and lower score mean worse outcome.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To examine physiological variables (Respiratory Symptoms) as mediators of the relationship between pulmonary disease status and susceptibility to using e-cigarettes.</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Questions that was developed by (Leidy, 2003) will be used to assess Breathlessness, Cough, Sputum, and chest tightness. Each symptom will be tested individually for its mediating effect, and they will be combined as one composite score to test the total mediating effect. The minimum score is 0 and maximum score is 25, and higher scores mean a worse respiratory symptoms and lower score mean better respiratory symptoms.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To examine physiological variables (Eating Disorder Questionnaire) as mediators of the relationship between pulmonary disease status and susceptibility to using e-cigarettes.</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>12 questions adopted from Gideon et al. (2016) will be used to discover which participants believe that they suffer from eating disorders. This measure showed high internal consistency (Cronbach's α = .913) and temporal stability (ICC = .93; p &lt; .001) (continuous variable). These range from a score of zero (&quot;no symptoms&quot;) to three (&quot;extreme symptoms&quot;).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To examine cognitive variables (Belief) as mediators of the relationship between pulmonary disease status and susceptibility to using e-cigarettes.</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>A short form of the e-cigarette consequence questionnaire will be used to assess the e-cigarette expectancy questionnaire. This questionnaire was developed and validated by Peter S. Hendricks et al. (2014). Cronbach's alpha reliabilities of the e-cigarette-specific range from .67 to .88 (ordinal variable). This questionnaire has 25 statements. Each statement contains a possible consequence of smoking an e-cigarette. For each of the statements, participants should rate how LIKELY or UNLIKELY that they believe each consequence is for them when they use an e-cigarette. If the consequence seems LIKELY to them, they should circle a number from 5-9. That is, if they believe that a consequence would never happen, circle 0; if they believe a consequence would happen every time they smoke, circle 9. If it seems a little unlikely to them, they would circle 4</description>

    <measure>To examine cognitive variables (Risk Perception) as mediators of the relationship between pulmonary disease status and susceptibility to using e-cigarettes.</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Questions that have been successfully used in previous studies (Adkison et al., 2013; Choi &amp; Forster, 2013; Nicksic et al., 2017; Stein et al., 2015) will be used to assess the participants' risk perception of e-cigarettes (ordinal variable). There are six statements that assess the participants' perception toward e-cigarette, and the participants should choose between 1 to 5 where 1 means &quot;strongly disagree&quot; and 5 means &quot;strongly agree&quot;.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To examine cognitive variables (attitudes toward e-cigarettes) as mediators of the relationship between pulmonary disease status and susceptibility to using e-cigarettes.</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The Comparing E-cigarettes and Cigarettes Questionnaire (CEAC) will be used to assess attitudes towards e-cigarettes compared to cigarettes. The CEAC is a 17-item self-report measure with three factors: (1) General Benefits (seven items; α = 0.85), (2) Addiction/Cessation Benefits (five items; α = 0.89), and (3) Improve Health (five items; α = 0.92) (Hershberger, Karyadi, VanderVeen, &amp; Cyders, 2017). The CEAC has been shown to be positively related to e-cig use (b 0.41-1.24, p &lt; .01) and has demonstrated good psychometric properties (α 0.83-0.93) (ordinal variable). There are ten statements that assess the participants' perception toward e-cigarette, and the participants should choose between 1 to 5 where 1 means &quot;strongly disagree&quot; and 5 means &quot;strongly agree&quot;.</description>

    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>They will be assessed using a previously used questionnaire (P. S. Hendricks, Delucchi, Humfleet, &amp; Hall, 2012) (categorical variable). Participants should choose &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; based to see if they drink alcohol or use any of the addictive substance.</description>

    <measure>Susceptibility to e-cigarette use</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The questionnaire that will be used in our study was adopted from a study performed by Nicksic, Snell, Rudy, Cobb and Barnes (44). Nicksic, Snell, Rudy, Cobb and Barnes (44) adapted a validated measure on susceptibility to smoking. The adapted survey scale for measuring susceptibility to using e-cigarette showed a high degree of internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.97). The susceptibility to e-cigarette use score is constructed based on participants' responses to the following questions: (1) Do you think that you will use an e- cigarette soon? (2) Do you think that in the future you might experiment with e-cigarettes? (3) Do you think you will use an e-cigarette in the next year? and (4) If one of your best friends were to offer you an e-cigarette, would you smoke it? After each question, participants could endorse &quot;Definitely not,&quot; &quot;Probably not,&quot; &quot;Probably yes,&quot; and &quot;Definitely yes.&quot; (Continuous variables).</description>
