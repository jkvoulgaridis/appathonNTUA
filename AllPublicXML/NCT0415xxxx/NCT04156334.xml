  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Use of local anaesthesia during full mouth dental rehabilitation under general anaesthesia is
      an everyday practice. It enables better control of the post-extraction bleeding and better
      control of physiological responses. Postoperative numbness and lip and cheek biting can be an
      undesired side effect. With our research, we aim to compare two different types of local
      anaesthesia in relation to postoperative side effects. We also aim to assess the oral
      health-related quality of life after treatment in general anaesthesia to enlighten how full
      mouth rehabilitation affects a child's life.

    <textblock>
      Dental treatment of children under general anaesthesia (GA) is intended for children who, for
      one reason or another, are unable to participate in the outpatient clinic.

      When extracting teeth in GA, local anaesthetics (LA) are regularly applied to control
      bleeding, reduce postoperative sensitivity, and to better control vital functions. The side
      effects of LA can be the patient's irritation due to not understanding the postoperative
      numbness and lip and cheek biting.

      The aim of our study is to determine if there is a difference between the two types of local
      anaesthesia (computer-controlled intraosseous anaesthesia and classical local/conductive
      anaesthesia) in the frequency and extent of the occurrence of side effects postoperatively.

      The research data would help establish a better dental extraction protocol for children under
      GA, which would allow for less postoperative complications.

    <time_frame>an average 51 hours (monitoring of pain will be performed one hour before the general anesthesia treatment, 2 hours after treatment, 12 hours after treatment, 24 and 48 hours after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Monitoring's the pain with CHEOPS which evaluates crying, face expression, speech, body movement, touching of the painful area and leg movement. Each category has specific points according to the level of behaviour. Points are added and final scores range between 4-13 points. The number of scores at different measuring points before and over 48 hours after treatment will be compared between the two study groups.</description>
