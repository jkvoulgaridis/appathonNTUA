  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the best dose of copanlisib when given together with combination
      chemotherapy (R-GCD) in treating patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma that has come
      back (relapsed) or does not respond to treatment (refractory) or grade 3b follicular lymphoma
      that has come back (relapsed) after 1 prior line of therapy. Copanlisib may stop the growth
      of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as rituximab, gemcitabine, carboplatin, and dexamethasone, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving copanlisib together with R-GCD
      as second line therapy may improve the complete response rate for patients with diffuse large
      B-cell lymphoma or follicular lymphoma.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of copanlisib.

      Patients receive copanlisib intravenously (IV) and gemcitabine IV on days 1 and 8,
      carboplatin IV and rituximab IV on day 1, and dexamethasone orally (PO) or IV 30-60 minutes
      prior to chemotherapy on day 1 or PO in the morning (AM) or 30-60 minutes prior to
      chemotherapy on days 2-4. Patients also receive pegfilgrastim subcutaneously (SC) on day 8 or
      9. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 3 cycles in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for up to 1 year.

             (including transient ischemic attacks), deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism
             within 3 months before the start of study treatment

          -  Non-healing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture

          -  Active, clinically serious infections &gt; CTCAE grade 2

          -  Patients with seizure disorder requiring medication

          -  Patients with evidence or history of bleeding diathesis. Any hemorrhage or bleeding
             event &gt;= CTCAE grade 3 within 4 weeks prior to the start of study treatment

          -  Any illness or medical conditions that are unstable or could jeopardize the safety of
             the patients and their compliance in the study

          -  History of having received an allogeneic bone marrow or organ transplant

          -  Anti-arrhythmic therapy (beta blockers or digoxin are permitted)

          -  Major surgical procedure or significant traumatic injury (as judged by the
             investigator) less than 28 days before start of treatment, open biopsy less than 7
             days before start of treatment

          -  Systemic continuous corticosteroid therapy at a daily dose higher than 15 mg
             prednisone or equivalent is not allowed. Patients may be using topical or inhaled
             corticosteroids. Previous corticosteroid therapy must be stopped or reduced to the
             allowed dose at least 7 days performing the screening computed tomography
             (CT)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). If a patient is on chronic corticosteroid
             therapy, corticosteroids should be de-escalated to the maximum allowed dose before the
             screening. Patients may be using topical or inhaled corticosteroids

          -  Use of CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers. Copanlisib is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4.
             Therefore, concomitant use of strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole,
             itraconazole, clarithromycin, ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir), and
             strong inducers of CYP3A4 (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital,
             St. John's wort) are not permitted from day -14 of cycle 1 until the safety follow-up
             visit
