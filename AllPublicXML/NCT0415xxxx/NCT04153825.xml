  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of transcutaneous electrical nerve
      stimulation (TENS), interferential currents (IFCs) and sham devices in improving central
      sensitization (CS) findings, including pressure pain thresholds, pain catastrophizing,
      depression, and kinesiophobia in patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Knee OA, which is the most frequently encountered type of OA is a leading cause of disability
      and chronic pain. CS is as important as nociceptive component in the pathogenesis of
      OA-related pain. Therefore, the necessary interventions for CS should be also considered when
      deciding the treatment protocol.TENS and IFC have been safely and commonly employed in the
      conservative treatment of knee OA. However, there are limited and inconsistent data
      concerning the impact of these modalities on CS component of pain.Therefore, the aim of this
      study is to investigate whether these agents are effective on CS and they are superior to
      each other.

    <measure>Pressure-pain thresholds</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline pressure-pain thresholds at 2 weeks and at 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Pressure pain thresholds is measured on the knee (M. Vastus Medialis) and on the upper part of the homolateral arm (lateral part of M. Deltoideus, 10 cm below acromion) using a pressure algometer. The pressure is raised at a rate of almost 1 kg/s, until the patient first notifies that the pressure sensation changes to a pain sensation.</description>

    <measure>Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline kinesiophobia scores at 2 weeks and at 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Tampa Scale contains 17 parts that measure anxiety and fear related to movement. The total score ranges between 17-68 points. Higher scores represent higher grades of kinesiophobia.</description>

    <measure>Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline BDI scores at 2 weeks and at 12 weeks.</time_frame>

    <measure>Pain catastrophizing scale (PCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline PCS scores at 2 weeks and at 12 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>PCS consists of 13 items in three subscales (rumination, helplessness, and magnification). Higher final score indicates more catastrophic thinking related to pain.</description>

    <measure>Western Ontario and McMaster University (WOMAC) Index.</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline, at 2 weeks and at 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>There are three subscales with a possible score range of 0-20 for Pain, 0-8 for Stiffness, and 0-68 for Physical Function. Usually a sum of the scores for all three subscales gives a total WOMAC score.
Higher scores on the WOMAC indicate worse pain, stiffness, and functional limitations.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Timed Up and Go Test (TUG)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline, at 2 weeks and at 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Timed up and go test is used to assess mobility which recorded the time of rising from a back-rest chair, walking at a normal pace 3 meters, turning, walking back to the chair, and sitting recumbently. In one minute durations, each participant will perform the test three times and this time will be recorded in seconds.</description>

    <measure>Five Times Sit to Stand Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline, at 2 weeks and at 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The participant is asked to sit-to-stand action from a standard chair five times as quickly as possible, and the time taken to complete is recorded.</description>
