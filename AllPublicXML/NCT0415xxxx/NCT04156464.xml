  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our aim is to compare outcomes of patients with benzodiazepine-refractory alcohol withdrawal
      syndrome who are treated with either a phenobarbital-based or a lorazepam based protocol.

      -  This study is a prospective, open-label, randomized, controlled trial.

        -  The electronic medical record will be used to identify patients who have a diagnosis of
           alcohol withdrawal or are receiving alcohol withdrawal. Subjects who are anticipated to
           meet inclusion criteria will be pre-consented for the study using an informed consent
           process. see informed consent form.

        -  Subjects will not be enrolled and randomized until they have met inclusion criteria.

        -  If a patient meets criteria, but is deemed non-decisional or unable to give consent, the
           patient's medical decision maker will undergo the informed consent process.

        -  After enrollment, participants will be randomized to either the control group
           (lorazepam-based therapy) or the study group (phenobarbital-based therapy)

        -  Personnel unassociated with patient screening, enrollment, or follow up will create the
           allocation sequence and will use a random, computerized number generator. The allocation
           sequence will then be transferred to sequentially numbered, opaque envelopes for
           purposes of allocation concealment. These sequentially numbered envelopes, which are
           blinded to clinical trial coordinators/physicians, will be handed out in order as
           patients are enrolled. Clinical trial coordinators/physicians will verify treatment
           eligibility and informed consent before opening the envelope to obtain the treatment
           assignment.

        -  The study group will be placed on the phenobarbital-based protocol as described below in
           procedures. The control group will be placed on the lorazepam-based protocol, also
           listed below in procedures.

        -  All medications in the study are FDA approved. No investigational medicines will be
           used.

        -  Data will be collected on each participant as noted below in measurements.

        -  The data will be analyzed and published as noted above in the statistical analysis plan
           and data use and management section.

    <description>The phenobarbital group will undergo management with a phenobarbital based treatment protocol with additional symptom triggered therapies.
On day 1, the phenobarbital group receive a loading dose of phenobarbital intravenous 10mg/kg (actual body weight) with a maximum dose of 1 g/100 mL
On day 2 of study protocol, and no sooner than 12 hours after loading dose, phenobarbital 64.8 mg is administered every 12 hours for two doses.
On day 3 of study protocol, patients will receive phenobarbital 32.4 mg every 12 hours for two doses.
On day 4 of study protocol, patients will receive phenobarbital 32.4 mg once, to be given 24 hours after last scheduled dose.
Throughout the 4 day protocol, the patient will have phenobarbital 65 mg every 6 hours as needed available either IM or IV, starting no sooner than 30 minutes after the loading dose.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Lorazepam based treatment</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>The lorazepam group will undergo management with a lorazepam based treatment protocol with additional symptom triggered therapies.
On Day 1, the lorazepam group will be started on scheduled lorazepam 4 mg every 6 hours
After day 1, the scheduled lorazepam dose will be modified based on the total lorazepam requirements from the previous day and divided into 4-6 doses.
A lorazepam infusion, at physician discretion, will be available at any point if the dose of scheduled and PRN lorazepam being given is too high or frequent to effectively be administered.
Once symptoms are well controlled on lorazepam based therapy, the total dose given over the past 24 hours will be calculated and weaned by approximately 10-20% per day when clinically appropriate.
Throughout the entire protocol, 2-4 mg lorazepam IV q 30 minutes PRN will be available for a goal CIWA &lt;6 or RASS -1 to 0.</description>
