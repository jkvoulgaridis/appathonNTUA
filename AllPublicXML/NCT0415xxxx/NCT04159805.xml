  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of TAK-079 in
      participants with generalized myasthenia gravis (MG) who are receiving stable background
      therapy for MG.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disorder in which autoantibodies, such as those
      targeting the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) or muscle specific kinase (MuSK),
      interfere with neuromuscular transmission, resulting in fatigue and weakness.

      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-079. TAK-079 is being tested to treat
      people who have generalized myasthenia gravis.

    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (example, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A TEAE is defined as an AE with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug will be graded evaluated as per national cancer institute common terminology criteria for adverse events (NCI CTCAE), version 4.03.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of Myasthenia Gravis (MG) supported by a positive serologic test for
             anti-AChR or anti-MuSK antibodies at screening.

          2. Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America (MGFA) clinical classification II to IV at
             screening.

          3. Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) total score of 6 or greater at
             screening, with at least 4 points attributed to nonocular items.

          4. If receiving immunosuppressive drugs (ie, mycophenolate mofetil, methotrexate,
             cyclosporine, tacrolimus, cyclophosphamide), therapy must be ongoing for at least 6
             months, with stable dosing ongoing for at least 3 months before screening.
             Participants receiving azathioprine must be on a stable dose for at least 6 months
             before screening.

          5. If receiving oral corticosteroids, therapy must be ongoing for at least 3 months, with
             a stable dose at least 1 month before screening. Corticosteroids, including
             dexamethasone, must be given as oral, daily or every-other-day therapy, as opposed to
             pulse therapy.

          6. If receiving cholinesterase inhibitors, therapy with a stable dose is required at
             least 2 weeks before screening.

          7. The doses of concomitant standard background therapy must be expected to remain stable
             throughout the study unless dose reduction is required due to toxicities. Allowed
             background therapy is defined as no more than a cholinesterase inhibitor ±
             corticosteroid ± one steroid-sparing immunosuppressive drug (limited to azathioprine,
             mycophenolate mofetil, methotrexate, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, or cyclophosphamide).
             Participants must be on at least one allowed background medication.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of thymoma or other thymic neoplasms.

          2. History of thymectomy within 12 months before screening.

          3. MGFA class I or V.

          4. Received intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), subcutaneous immunoglobulin (SCIg), or
             plasmapheresis/plasma exchange within 4 weeks before screening.

          5. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma with a pre-bronchodilatory
             forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) &lt;50% of predicted normal.

             Note: FEV1 testing is required for participants suspected of having COPD or asthma.

          6. Received rituximab, belimumab, eculizumab, or any monoclonal antibody for
             immunomodulation within 6 months before first dosing. Participants with prior exposure
             to rituximab must have CD19 counts within the normal range at screening.

          7. Known autoimmune disease other than MG that could interfere with the course and
             conduct of the study.

          8. Received a live vaccine within 4 weeks before screening or has any live vaccination
             planned during the study.

          9. Opportunistic infection ≤12 weeks before initial study dosing or currently receiving
             treatment for a chronic opportunistic infection, such as tuberculosis (TB),
             pneumocystis pneumonia, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, herpes zoster, or
             atypical mycobacteria. A mild, localized herpes simplex infection within 12 weeks of
             study dosing is allowed, as long as the lesion has resolved without systemic therapy
             prior to Day 1.
