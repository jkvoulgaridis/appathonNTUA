  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Open-label, multi-center, non-randomized, multiple dose, safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamics and clinical activity study of PF-06940434 in patients
      with SCCHN (Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck), renal cell carcinoma (RCC - clear
      cell and papillary), ovarian, gastric, esophageal, esophageal (adeno and squamous), lung
      squamous cell, pancreatic and biliary duct, endometrial, melanoma and urothelial tumors. This
      study contains two parts, single agent dose escalation (Part 1A), dose finding of PF 06940434
      in combination with anti-PD-1 (Part 1B), biopsy cohorts with monotherapy lead-in at the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD), followed by combination of
      anti-PD-1 [PF-06801591] (Part 1C) followed by dose expansion (Part 2). Part 2 Dose
      Combination Expansion will enroll participants into 2 cohorts at doses determined from Part
      1B in order to further evaluate the safety of PF-06940434 in combination with anti-PD-1.
