      The purpose of this study is to understand the role of repetitive Transcranial Magnetic
      Stimulation (rTMS) in reducing opioid and other substance use and craving and improving
      thinking skills.

      The overarching goal of this study is to investigate a form of neuromodulation, rTMS, as an
      adjunctive treatment for OUD by evaluating the impact of rTMS on substance use, craving and
      inhibitory control, factors which contribute to relapse. The primary outcome will be the
      assessment of whether rTMS reduces substance use. Additional exploratory outcomes include the
      assessment of whether rTMS applied to the DLPFC provides neuromodulatory effects through the
      assessment of craving, inhibitory control, and functional connectivity via MRI. The targeted
      sample size for this open-label study, where all enrolled subjects will receive 9 sessions of
      active rTMS over 3 weeks.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Able to provide written informed consent, and to comply with study procedures.

          -  Be actively enrolled in the COAT Program

          -  Meet DSM-V criteria for a primary OUD assessed via structured clinical interview

          -  Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale score &lt; 4

          -  Be abstinent from opioids (other than prescribed buprenorphine/naloxone) and illicit
             substances other than marijuana at the time of the enrollment, confirmed via urine
             drug screen

          -  Willing to practice contraception to avoid pregnancy the duration of the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Medical conditions that preclude rTMS: including vasodepressor syncope, glaucoma,
             increased intracranial pressure, cardiac disease, migraine disorder, cerebral vascular
             events (cerebral vascular accident, transient ischemic attack), any brain lesions
             (such multiple sclerosis), brain injury, seizure disorder (or family history) of any
             type, and have cardiac pacemakers or implanted medication pumps

          -  DSM-V criteria for major psychiatric illness other than depression

          -  Major Cognitive Disorder (as evidenced by a score of &lt;21/30 on the Mini Mental Status
             Exam (MMSE)

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Positive responses to the TMS Adult Safety Screen or the MRI checklist

          -  Intake of one or a combination of the following drugs forms a 'Strong Potential
             Hazard' for application of rTMS due to their significant seizure threshold lowering
             potential:

               -  Imipramine, Amitriptyline, Doxepine, Nortriptyline, Maprotiline, Chlorpromazine,
                  Clozapine, Foscarnet, Ganciclovir, Ritonavir, Amphetamines, Cocaine (MDMA,
                  ecstasy), Phencyclidine (PCP, angel's dust), Ketamine, Gamma-hydroxybutyrate

               -  The inclusion of a patient on any of the above medication will be carefully
                  evaluated and a decision documented by the medically responsible physician. The
                  risk is dependent on the patient's past medical history, drug dose, speed of dose
                  increase (or decrease), history of recent medication changes or duration of
                  treatment, and combination with other CNS active drugs.

          -  Recent withdrawal from one of the following drugs forms a 'Strong Relative Hazard' for
             application of rTMS due to the resulting significant seizure threshold lowering
             potential:

               -  Alcohol, Barbiturates, Benzodiazepines, Meprobamate, Chloral hydrate
