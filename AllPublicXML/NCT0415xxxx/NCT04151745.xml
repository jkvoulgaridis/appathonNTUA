  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Temporary pacing with an external pacemaker after open heart surgery - besides preventing
      arrhythmias and AV-conduction disorders - is used to improve cardiac output. In theory,
      postoperative stunning temporarily limits stroke volume and SA-node dysfunction compromises
      an adequate compensatory rise in heartrate to ensure sufficient cardiac output. There is a
      lack of consensus regarding the use of this form of pacing. Protocols vary widely between
      hospitals. Moreover, the scientific base for this form of pacing mainly comprises studies
      dating back to the nineteen sixties and seventies. Major changes in (operating) techniques
      have taken place since then. Also, the role of the right ventricle in this context has not
      been studied specifically. The current study aims to investigate the effects of atrial pacing
      on right ventricular function specifically and hemodynamics in general, in today's
      postoperative setting. We hypothesize that a reduction in heart rate may lead to decreased
      right ventricular function.

      When a hemodynamically stable state is achieved, the external pacemaker will be switched off
      for 30 minutes. Hemodynamic parameters will be acquired directly prior to switching off, 15
      respectively 30 minutes after switching off, and 15 minutes after switching back on. To gain
      insight in the natural course of stunning, this routine will be repeated the next morning. No
      additional hemodynamic interventions will be allowed in these periods.
