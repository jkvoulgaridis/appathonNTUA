  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the possible effect of postbiotics supplementation, combined with
      interventions aimed at improving diet and lifestyle, on gut microbiota composition and
      metabolite production. It also wants to determine whether postbiotics supplementation,
      combined with interventions to improve diet and lifestyle, reduces adverse metabolic
      consequences together with their co‐morbidities.

      All participants will follow a behaviour (promotion of physical activity) and dietary
      treatment according to Italian dietary guidelines for childhood obesity.

      Postbiotics and vitamin D3 will be given orally for four months; patients will be evaluated
      four months after supplementation and diet-lifestyle intervention and four months after the
      end of supplementation and after the alone diet-lifestyle intervention with blood testing and
      echosonography of the liver.

      25-30 Caucasian obese children will be enrolled at the Pediatric Department of San Paolo
      Hospital - University of Milan.

      Stool samples from all enrolled patients at the different time points (t0, before
      supplementation and diet-lifestyle intervention, t1, four months after supplementation and
      diet-lifestyle intervention and t2 four months after the end of supplementation and after the
      alone diet-lifestyle intervention) will be collected and stored at -80°C until the following
      investigation:

        1. study of the microbiota biodiversity by high-throughput sequencing techniques (16S rRNA
           gene sequencing) in order to establish whether postbiotics could modulate the microbial
           composition in obese children;

        2. analysis of short chain fatty acids concentration by gas-chromatography (GC-FID) in
           order to monitor the effect of postbiotics intake modulating microbial metabolite
           production.

      The following tasks will be also performed at t0, t1 and t2:

        -  Clinical examination including: physical examination, Tanner score evaluation; Bristol
           Stool Chart

        -  Blood pressure will be checked in all children by using oscillometric devices validated
           in the pediatric age group.

        -  Anthropometry including body circumferences and skinfolds, calculation of BMI z scores
           and body composition. Body composition will be assessed using an air displacement
           plethysmography system (BOD POD COSMED-USA).

        -  Dietary assessment:

             1. Food intakes will be recorded by prospective 3-d weighed food records obtained with
                food scales. Parents will be advised on how to record all food and beverages
                consumed during 2 weekdays and 1 weekend day. Quantification and analysis of the
                energy intake and nutrient composition will be performed with an ad hoc PC software
                (MètaDieta®, Me.Te.Da S.r.l., San Benedetto del Tronto, Italy).

             2. Mediterranean Diet Quality Index (KIDMED) questionnaire for Mediterranean Diet
                assessment. The KIDMED index ranges from 0 to 12, and is based on a 16-question
                test that can be self-administered. The sums of the values from the administered
                test will be classified into three levels:

                  1. 8 or more: optimal Mediterranean diet;

                  2. 4-7: improvement needed to adjust intake to Mediterranean patterns.

                  3. 3 or less: very low diet quality.

        -  Hematological and biochemical status including:

             1. Complete cell blood count;

             2. Metabolic and nutritional parameters according to local routines for childhood
                obesity (fasting glucose, fasting insulin, LDL, HDL, total cholesterol,
                triglycerides, Apolipoprotein A and Apolipoprotein B levels, transaminases and
                amma-glutamyl transferase). Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) will be performed.
                The insulin sensitivity and insulin resistance was assessed by calculating HOMA
                index (Homeostasis Model Assessment) and QUICKI (Quantitative Insulin-Sensitivity
                Check Index), using the following formulas:

                  -  HOMA: fasting plasma insulin in mU/l x FPG in mmol/l/22.5

                  -  QUICKI: 1/(log10 fasting plasma insulin in mU/l + log10 glucose in mg/dl)

             3. Inflammatory index (VES, high-sensitive CRP, including fecal calprotectin)

        -  Liver ultrasonography will be performed by a single evaluator.

      All participants will follow a behavior (promotion of physical activity) and dietary
      treatment according to Italian dietary guidelines for childhood obesity.

      Postbiotics will be given at the dose of 80 mg/day (2 ml per day SMART D3 MATRIX Smartfarma
      S.r.l. Via San Vittore 40 - 20123 MILAN; fermented fructooligosaccharides from Lactobacillus
      paracasei strain CNCM I-5220). 2 mk of product will give 1600 UI/die of VIT D3.
