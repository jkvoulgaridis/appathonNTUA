      In the last decades, caesarean section (CS) rates are getting higher in all over the world.

      This encourages us to improve operative techniques. In January 2018, investigators have
      introduced in the study unit: The French Ambulatory C section (FAUCS). This innovative
      approach appeares to provide a shorter recovery time, with a hospital discharge the day after
      surgery in 90% and then a better experience of childbirth.

      The diffusion of this technique requires its integration to the curriculum of residency.

      In this study, investigators will determine the mean number of procedures needed for trainees
      to master FAUCS.

      Caesarean section (CS) is of the most commonly performed operations worldwide. This
      encourages a permanent search to improve the operative techniques for a better childbirth
      experience. The MisgavLadach (MLC), caesarean section is the gold standard for caesarean
      section. Thus so, it is included During the first years of obstetrics curriculum.

      In January 2018, investigators have introduced The French Ambulatory C section (FAUCS) in the
      study unit. It is an innovative approach for CS. combining a left paramedian incision , an
      extra peritoneal access to the uterus and a purse-string double-layer closure of the uterus.
      Since that date, two doctors practice it regularly. However, the diffusion of this technique
      requires its integration into the curriculum of residency. Currently, there is no study on
      the learning procedure of FAUCS.

      In our study, investigators will determine the mean number of procedures needed for trainees
      to master FAUCS.

      Once the resident will master the procedure, investigators will study his skills evolution
      every 5 surgeries performed alone.

Scores 7 and above are generally normal; 4 to 6, fairly low; and 3 and below are generally regarded as critically low and cause for immediate resuscitative efforts .</description>

    <description>The participant will be first invited to consult a theoretical support and a video treating on FAUCS.
After that, he will be asked to be the first assistant, in a FAUCS procedure with one of the two senior surgeons assigned for the study.
In a second step, the trainee will have to perform all the steps of the FAUCS, assisted by one of the two senior surgeons . During each surgery, Operative time will be measured, while an evaluation on four stages according to the Zwisch model of supervision will performed by the senior surgeons .
Once, the two seniors agree on the highest level assessment for the resident, he will be allowed to operate alone FAUCS procedures and will be evaluated by the measurement of operating times, the neonatal outcomes and the occurrence or not of complications.
finally, total number of FAUCS procedures required for each resident in order to master the technique will be determined.</description>
