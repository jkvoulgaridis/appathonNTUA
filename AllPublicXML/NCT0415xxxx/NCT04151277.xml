  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is comparing two combinations of chemotherapy treatments in patients with
      metastatic pancreatic cancer. Half the participants will receive FOLFOX-A and the other half
      will receive AG. Treatment will continue until progression or patient/clinican decision or
      intolerable toxicity.

      PRIMUS 001 is a multicentre, randomised, open label, two arm, phase II interventional trial
      with pre-clinical and translational work including in-depth molecular profiling and biomarker
      discovery/development. The primary objective is to look at the efficacy of FOLFOX-A compared
      to AG in all comers and in a biomarker positive group using progression free survival.
