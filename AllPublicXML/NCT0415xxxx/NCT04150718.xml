  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis underlying this proposal is that deficits of synaptic plasticity underlie the
      slow-wave activity (SWA) abnormalities observed n major depressive disorder (MDD), and that
      manipulating SWA may serve to circumvent these deficits by facilitating an increase in
      synaptic strength via the inhibition of synaptic down-scaling, thereby improving plasticity
      and mood.
