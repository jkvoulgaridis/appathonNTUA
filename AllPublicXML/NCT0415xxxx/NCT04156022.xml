  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dystonia is a disorder characterized by excessive involuntary contraction of muscles with
      repetitive and patterned movements. The primary focal dystonias are the most common type of
      dystonia and include Limb dystonias (like writer's cramp), Cervical dystonia (spasmodic
      torticollis), Laryngeal dystonias (like spasmodic dysphonia), and Craniofacial dystonias
      (like blepharospasm). The purpose of this study is to create resources to help learn more
      about the primary focal dystonias and to develop and validate various dystonia rating scales.

      This collaborative, international effort has two primary goals. The first is to create a
      biospecimen repository and associated clinical database to be used as a resource for dystonia
      and related disease research. The second goal is to create and validate various rating scales
      for focal dystonias to be used during a typical clinical examination. Across sites, the
      investigators hope to enroll at least 5,000 adult patients.

      Subjects of this study will be asked to complete a neurological exam which will be
      videotaped, complete some questionnaires, and donate a blood sample. A study visit will take
      between 45 minutes and 1 hour depending upon which portions of the study a subject completes.
      A subset of subjects will be asked to return no more often than once a year for a one hour
      follow-up visit.
