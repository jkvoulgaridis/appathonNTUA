  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Overweight and obesity are increasing and more than 50% of all people over 18 years in Sweden
      are overweight or obese. Main causes are changes in lifestyle habits regarding diet and
      physical activity. Obesity increases the risk of various diseases such as type 2 diabetes,
      cardiovascular disease, arthrosis and cancer; it also affects the quality of life. Losing
      5-10% of body weight can improve metabolic health and quality of life. However, weight loss
      is difficult to achieve and especially to maintain over a longer period of time. Treatment
      based on cognitive behavioral therapy improves long-term outcomes. A behavioral treatment
      program via the Internet has been developed that contains 12 treatment modules that the
      patient follows for 6 months. The patient has regular contact with a therapist who follows
      the patient's treatment process and provides support. The purpose of this pilot study is to
      evaluate the Internet-based treatment regarding weight reduction, change in eating habits,
      physical activity and quality of life. We also intend to investigate how feasible and
      user-friendly the treatment program is and the patients' experiences of the treatment
      effects.

    <description>Change in physical activity measured with a questionnaire from The National Board of Health and Welfare, Sweden. The questionnaire contains two questions about exercise and everyday activities that measure how much time per week the person performs: 1) strenuous activities, e.g. running, playing ball, and 2) moderately strenuous activities, e.g. walking, cycling.</description>

    <description>Change in weight-related psychosocial functioning measured by the Obesity-related Problems scale, version 3 (OPv3). OPv3 comprises 26 items on a four-point response scale. The participants indicate how bothered they are by their obesity in a broad range of social activities and to what extent they avoid social activities because of their obesity. The responses are aggregated into two domains: Distress (13 items) and Avoidance (13 items). Scale scores range from 0 (no distress/avoidance) to 100 (maximum distress/avoidance).</description>

    <description>The patient's experiences of the treatment program are measured with five study-specific questions about how easy or difficult it was 1) to follow the treatment program, 2) to understand the language and content, 3) to use the program 4) to understand the home tasks and if they were relevant, and 5) how useful feedback from the therapist was .</description>

    <time_frame>From baseline to follow-up at 6 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The patient's experiences of the treatment effects are measured with study-specific questions (18 and 15 questions at 6 and 12 months follow-up respectively). The questions concern the following aspects: 1) if the treatment has been helpful in making lifestyle changes, 2) if the participant is satisfied or dissatisfied with the weight change, 3) if the participant considers that the treatment has had an effect on health and well-being.</description>

    <description>The intervention is a treatment of overweight and obesity based on cognitive behavioural therapy provided via the Internet. The treatment lasts for six months and comprises 12 treatment modules. The patient works with each module for two weeks. The modules conclude with one or more exercise tasks to be performed before the next module is activated. The patient has written contact with the therapist via the Internet platform.</description>
