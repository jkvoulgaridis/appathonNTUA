    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled study will be conducted at the accredited Baby Friendly Hospital in
      Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina. The study will include primiparas who have established breast
      feeding at the maternity ward and developed symptoms of painful and sore nipples within 72
      hours from childbirth. Participants will be allocated in two groups and will receive
      education prior to the study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies show that early termination of breastfeeding is often associated with painful
      and sore nipples. Although health professionals recommend various treatments for painful and
      sore nipples, including alternative treatments, there is currently not enough evidence to
      recommend specific treatment of painful and sore nipples in lactating women. The primary
      objective of this study is to compare the effect of lanolin administration and the
      application of breast milk on the intensity of pain and healing of damaged nipples during
      breastfeeding. Subjects in the lanolin group will apply lanolin on each nipple and areola
      after each feeding while subjects in the breast milk group will apply several drops of milk
      on the nipple after each feed and allow them to air dry. In both groups, the treatment will
      last for 7 days or until the symptoms of pain and nipple damage have ceased. The main outcome
      measure is pain, which will be assessed through three time points and will be measured using
      an abridged version of the McGill Pain Questionnaire. Nipple damage will be assessed by means
      of a validated assessment tool, the Nipple trauma score. Secondary outcome measures will
      include breastfeeding efficacy, duration of any/exclusive breastfeeding, reasons for stopping
      breastfeeding and satisfaction with proposed treatment.The contribution of this study will be
      reflected in efficient treatment, better care of health professional in the prevention and
      treatment of damaged and sore nipples, and the study will also contribute in defining the
      guidelines for the development of procedure in midwifery practice for the treatment of
      painful and damaged nipples.

    <time_frame>3 days after applying the treatment</time_frame>
    <description>An abbreviated version of the McGill Questionnaire (SF-MPQ) will be used to assess the intensity of nipple pain. For the assessment of the current intensity of pain in the nipples will be used subcategories SF-MPQ, the current assessment of pain (PPI). It consists of a verbal scoring scale with values from 0 to 5, 0= No pain, 1= Mild, 2 = Discomforting, 3= Distressing, 4= Horrible, 5= Excruciating</description>

    <description>The baseline assessment of nipple damage will be performed by a validated Nipple Trauma Score (NST). The assessment is performed on scales from 0 to 5 where 0 = no macroscopically visible changes in the skin, 1 = erythema or edema or a combination of both, 2 = superficial damage or no scab on &lt;25% of the nipple surface, 3 = superficial damage with or without scab on&gt; 25% of nipple surface, 4 = partial thickness wound with or without scab on &lt;25% of nipple surface, 5 = partial thickness with or without scab on&gt; 25% of nipple surface.
Three and 7 days after applying the treatment, the condition of the nipple will be evaluated with a Questionnaire on Pain and Damage to the Nipple, where a telephone survey will be performed by the Principal Investigator in order to describe and compare the condition of the nipples.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment of breastfeeding self-efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>3 days and 7 days after applying treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>Breastfeeding self-efficacy will be evaluated by a validated version of the Self-Efficacy Scale-Short Form (BSES-SF). The scale consists of 14 items, with the offered five statements on the Likert scale, from strongly disagree to strongly agree. The sum of grades ranges from 14 to 70, the higher the sum the greater the efficiency of breastfeeding.</description>
