  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are currently completing a data collection to try to optimize pediatric
      patients' preoperative screening, in the setting of an upper respiratory infection.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to evaluate various extubation criteria and their predictive
      value for successful extubation in non-cardiac surgical procedures. To evaluate the
      predictive value of room air oxygen and an original preoperative URI questionnaire in
      pediatric patients with URI or URI symptoms.
