      This study will compare the effect of segmental spine mobilization and entire spine
      mobilization in the patients with lumber spondylosis.

      There will be two groups ; experimental and control. Half of study group will receive
      segmental mobilization along with conventional treatment such as moist heat , soft tissue
      mobilization and traditional stretching exercises and half of study group will receive entire
      spine mobilization along with the same conventional treatment given to other group.

      This is a randomized controlled trial which is being conducted in Pakistan Railway hospital
      enrolled total 40 participants diagnosed with lumbar spondylosis who fulfilled the inclusion
      criteria through sealed envelope method using purposive sampling technique into two groups
      I-e experimental (n=21) and control group(n=19).The treatment protocol administered to
      experimental group was Maitland entire spine mobilization along with other conventional
      treatments such as hot pack, soft tissue mobilization.

      and home-based exercises (Bridging, knee to chest, Hamstrings stretching and TA stretching).
      While the control group received segmental spine mobilization along with same conventional
      treatment as mentioned above for 8 sessions. Physical therapy along with pharmaceutical
      management is effective in improving pain on NPRS, ODI values in patients with lumbar
      stenosis. Based on evidence that manual therapy interventions when used in combination with
      exercise therapy in clinical practice has beneficial effect in the treatment of degenerated
      lumbar spinal stenosis.

      effects of 'specific segmental level 'spinal joint mobilization techniques in creating
      positive outcomes on pain NPRS measures and range of motion concluded that a single session
      of segmental joint mobilization can lead to pain reduction at both rest and with most painful
      offending movement.

      Manual therapy approaches such as Maitland mobilizations are more productive in the
      management of chronic low back pain, quality of function and lumbar spine range of motion in
      patients of lumbar spondylosis than traditional physical therapy interventions such as muscle
      stretching and spinal traction.

      Osteophytes were the most numerous radiographic feature detected in patients with lumbar
      spondylosis, with greater occurrence in men. Intervertebral disc space narrowing was more
      prevalent in women than men. Both distinctive radiographic features presence increased with
      increasing age. Disc space reduction seemed more strongly related with chronic low back pain
      than osteophytosis, especially in men and disc space narrowing at 2 or more segments appeared
      more powerfully associated with low back pain than disc space reduction at only 1
      intervertebral segment.

      Maitland posteroanterior spinal mobilizations are performed by a therapist on symptomatic
      segments after assessment compared with mobilization treatment given on any random spinal
      segment in patients suffering with chronic low back pain. The results were greater degree of
      immediate reduction of pain in patients receiving posteroanterior mobilization on symptomatic
      segment rather than any random segments in offending movement direction.

    <measure>Oswestry Disability Index (ODI)</measure>
    <time_frame>8th day</time_frame>
    <description>Oswestry disability index is basically a tool established by Jeremy Fairbank et al to measure functional outcome and quality of life of persons suffering from low back pain. It consists of total of 10 questions, Every question sores from 0-5 containing 6 questions, which constitutes total of 60 marks for 10 questions. By increasing the value of ODI degree of disability increases. If the percentage fall in 0-20% it indicates minimal disability.21-40% indicates moderately disabled persons, 41 -60% demonstrates severely disabled persons. 61- 80% showed crippled and above 80 are bed bound or psychologically ill patient. Percentages were taken on 1st, 4th and 8th visits to determine the quality of life of patients.</description>

    <measure>Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>8th Day</time_frame>
    <description>NPRS values was taken as baseline assessment on 1st visit and post intervention assessment after 1st session. Then again, readings were taken on 4th visit. And final reading was taken on 8th visit for both back and legs.
The 11-point numeric scale ranges from '0' representing one pain extreme (e.g. &quot;no pain&quot;) to '10' representing the other pain extreme. Scores range from 0-10 points, with higher scores indicating greater pain intensity.</description>
