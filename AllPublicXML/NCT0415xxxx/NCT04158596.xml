    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to assess the safety and efficacy of SDX-3101 for
      treatment of adult patients with chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps (CRSsNP) by
      investigating a vibration pattern of SDX-3101 compared to a control

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a common disease (e.g. 11% of adults in the UK report
      symptoms of CRS) leading to substantial health and socioeconomic burden with estimated
      healthcare costs in the USA of $772/patient/year (2011).

      CRS is characterised by the long-term presence of multiple symptoms including facial
      pain/pressure in about 80% of CRS patients. Factors contributing to the pathophysiology of
      adult CRS include allergies, bacterial biofilms, asthma and exposure to various environmental
      pollutants. Computed tomography (CT) scans are often used to identify mucosal thickening and
      to identify any comorbid factors such as anatomic abnormalities.

      It is known from the literature that low vibration frequency can improve blood flow,
      significantly reduce inflammation, and increase the fibroblast activity [13]. Therefore,
      SynDermix AG created the innovative high-technology, portable medical device SDX-3101
      targeting a disease with high unmet medical need. The device offers a drug-free or eventually
      an add on treatment complying with the maximum demands of safety for the patients potentially
      avoiding undesirable drug effects or surgery. SDX-3101 is indicated for treatment of CRSsNP
      in adults
