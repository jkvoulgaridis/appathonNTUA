  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study tests the hypothesis that use of the research RFA (Radiofrequency ablation)
      Physics Library will result in more frequent technical success (complete necrotization of
      target tissues) compared to ablations conducted without computer guidance.

      The RFA Physics Library -- a Planning and Guidance Platform (PGP) (NE Scientific, LLC) --
      will be used to support percutaneous liver RFA under CT-guidance by assisting physicians in
      the identification of ablation targets, assessment of proper ablation probe placement, and
      projection of the created ablation zones on the CT image.
