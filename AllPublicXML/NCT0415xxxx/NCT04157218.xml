  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Skin aging is a continuous and inevitable presses usually starting at the age of
      mid-twenties, this prosses affects all facial layers including skin, subcutaneous fat,
      superficial muscular aponeurotic system (SMAS), deep facia, the retaining ligaments, muscle
      activity, and even facial bony structure . The clinical outcome of this process causes the
      aging signs of the face and neck, including loose facial skin, sagging cheeks, excess skin
      hanging from the lower jawline and excess fat in the neck .

      In the last decade with the introduction of absorbable threads, thread lifting has gained
      interest and popularity among patients and physicians, as noninvasive technique to treat
      ptotic skin and reposition of ptotic soft tissue into a more anatomical direction.
      Histopathological studies indicated that dermal and subcutaneous foreign body reaction after
      inserting the threads, in forms of collagen deposition, and fibrosis , could explain the
      tightening effect throughout contracture and remodeling. However, some studies question
      efficacy especially in the aspects of durability and patient satisfaction .

      Another nonsurgical alternative for facial rejuvenation is high-intensity focused ultrasound
      (HIFU) therapy, during the past decade, HIFU has been used as a clinical noninvasive surgical
      tool to treat tumors, including those of the liver, prostate, and uterus (10-12) The HIFU
      devices heat tissue with acoustic energy in a focused, controlled manner. The thermal injury
      within the tissue leads to focal necrosis and cellular damage, initiating an inflammatory
      cascade that culminates in tissue remodeling, similar to changes that occur after ablative or
      nonablative laser treatments .

      The Investigators hypothesis that the HIFU treatment followed immediately by thread insertion
      can amplify and enhance the skin fibrosis, tissue lifting capacity and might give better and
      longer clinical results in treating ptotic skin.
