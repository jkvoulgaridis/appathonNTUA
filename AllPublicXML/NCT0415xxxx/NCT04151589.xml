  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is the second phase of Endovascular Treatment Key Technique and Emergency Work Flow
      Improvement of Acute Ischemic Stroke (ANGEL-ACT).

      During the first phase of the ANGEL-ACT (NCT03370939, a prospective multi-center registry
      study), problems and difficulties in the emergency work flow of acute ischemic stroke care in
      China have been identified, such as inadequate pre-hospital notification, delay of
      in-hospital diagnosis and treatment, difficulty in treatment consent, lack of professional
      training of endovascular treatment,etc., especially in the delay of in-hospital diagnosis and
      treatment.

      ANGEL-ACT II is a cluster randomized, parallel controlled study. The aim of this study was to
      evaluate the effectiveness of multi-modal medical quality improvement measures on the delay
      of hospital-level emergency work flow of acute ischemic stroke management as well as its
      impact on patient prognosis. The interventional measures include emergency work flow
      management app on smartphone, specialized training, assessment of quality improvement
      outcomes and feedback on a regular basis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-centre, cluster randomized, open label, parallel controlled
      study that enrolled patients with acute ischemic stroke who underwent endovascular treatment
      in about 34 hospitals in China. The ratio Interventional arm control arm is 1:1, which means
      17 hospitals and 332 participants in each arm.

    <description>The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) is a commonly used scale for measuring the degree of disability or dependence in the daily activities of people who have suffered a stroke or other causes of neurological disability. (Score Description: 0---No symptoms at all. 1---No significant disability despite symptoms; able to carry out all usual duties and activities. 2---Slight disability; unable to carry out all previous activities, but able to look after own affairs without assistance. 3---Moderate disability; requiring some help, but able to walk without assistance. 4--- Moderately severe disability; unable to walk without assistance and unable to attend to own bodily needs without assistance. 5---Severe disability; bedridden, incontinent and requiring constant nursing care and attention. 6---Dead. In clinical practice, mRS â‰¤ 2 means good outcome. Modified Rankin Scale independence rate refers to the percentage of participants with mRS less than 3 after treatment.</description>

    <measure>EQ-5D-3L 90 days after the procedure</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days after the procedure</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-3L essentially consists of two pages: the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ-5D visual analogue scale (EQ VAS). The EQ-5D-3L descriptive system comprises the following five dimensions, each describing a different aspect of health: MOBILITY, SELF-CARE, USUAL ACTIVITIES, PAIN / DISCOMFORT and ANXIETY / DEPRESSION. Each dimension has three levels: no problems, some problems, extreme problems (labelled 1-3). The respondent is asked to indicate his / her health state by checking the box against the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. The EQ VAS records the respondent's self-rated health on a vertical VAS where the endpoints are labelled 'The best health you can imagine'( score as 100) and 'The worst health you can imagine' (score as 0). This information can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome as judged by the individual respondents.</description>

    <description>The process below will be allocated in Interventional Sites:
At each interventional sites, implementing full assessment of current emergency work flow of acute ischemic stroke patients who eligible for endovascular treatment. All interventional sites would undergo assessment in order to form a baseline.
Drafting intervention approaches based on the assessment results of all interventional sites. These approaches are executable, reproducible, and measurable.
Emergency work flow management APP would be installed on smartphones of designated personnel at each interventional sites.
Both intervention approaches and APP would be incorporated with original work flow at each interventional site.
Training sessions would be held in interventional sites or online every 3 month once the patient enrolment begin.
Outcome data would be analysed and dispatched every 3 month for each interventional sites.</description>
