  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laminoplasty and laminectomy have been used for decades for the treatment of intraspinal
      space occupying lesions, spinal stenosis, disc herniation, injuries, etc. After these
      procedures, patients often experience severe postoperative pain at the surgical site.
      However, current methods of pain control are mostly insufficient. At present, several pain
      controlling methods are available, to reduce postoperative pain after laminoplasty or
      laminectomy. Methods for systemic administration include: oral analgesics, intermittent
      intravenous, intramuscular injections, patient- controlled intravenous analgesia, etc.
      However, the aforementioned methods may have a lot of side effects, and are usually used
      after the occurrence of pain and the analgesic effects are sometimes inadequate. Topical
      administration options use a lower dose of drugs and therefore have less systemic side
      effects. Pre-emptive injection of local anesthetics can significantly reduce postoperative
      pain during rest and movement, however, the analgesic effect is maintained for a relatively
      short period of time. It is necessary to use more cases to explore the other compatibility of
      drugs with longer duration of action and stronger analgesic effect. Betamethasone as the
      stereoisomer of dexamethasone is a long-acting corticosteroid, which has long lasting
      anti-inflammatory properties. Whether betamethasone combined with local anesthetic for
      laminoplasty or laminectomy has better short-term and long-term effects than the local
      anesthetic alone has not been reported yet. Therefore, a prospective, randomized, controlled,
      blinded-endpoint study is needed to compare the postoperative analgesic efficacy of
      preemptive wound infilteration of ropivacaine alone and betamethasone plus ropivacaine for
      laminectomy or laminoplasty.
