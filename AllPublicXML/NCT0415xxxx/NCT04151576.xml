      The aim of the study was to determine the effect of aromatherapy massage on the pain severity
      and quality of life in patients diagnosed with migraine in addition to medical treatment
      during an acute migraine attack.

      In addition to medical treatments, complementary and supportive therapies are commonly used
      to cope with pain during a migraine attack. In recent years, aromatherapy through massage has
      become more common to reduce the severity of pain, make the patient painless and improve the
      quality of life. Aromatherapy applications are the application of pain relief oil mixtures
      through massage. Lavender and peppermint essential oils are mostly used in aromatherapy
      applications to reduce pain. Therefore, a mixture of mint and lavender oil was used in the
      study.

      The study was planned and conducted as a randomized controlled experiment. The sample of the
      randomized controlled trial consisted of 70 patients who applied to the emergency department
      with a migraine attack and met the study criteria. Data were collected via Patient
      Information Form, 24-Hour Migraine Quality of Life Scale, Visual Analogue Scale,
      Sphygmomanometer, and Pulse oximeter. Along with the medical treatment, patients of
      experimental group were massaged for 15 minutes with an aromatic oil mixture (lavender and
      peppermint) applied on the temple and root of the neck, and this application continued for
      three weeks. Control group patients, however, received only medical treatment. Descriptive
      statistics methods, Shapiro Wilks test, Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test, Mann Whitney U Test,
      Kruskal Wallis Test, Fisher's Exact Test and Chi-Square Test were used for data evaluation.

    <time_frame>After 30 minutes of medical treatment and massage, blood pressure, oxygen saturation and pain were reevaluated and &quot;24-Hour Migraine Quality of Life Scale&quot; was administered.</time_frame>
    <description>The scale measures the change in quality of life for 24 hours after medication to relieve migraine headache.There are a total of 15 questions on the 7 Point Likert Scale. The scale has five domains for the quality of life, each with three items. These are migraine symptoms, emotions-concerns, work functioning, social functioning and energy-vitality.</description>
