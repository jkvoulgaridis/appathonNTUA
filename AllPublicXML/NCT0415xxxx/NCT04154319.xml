      Objective: Implementation and examination of the efficacy of a culturally relevant,
      community-based HPV vaccination intervention among daughters of Latina immigrants 9-12 years
      of age in Alabama.

      Methods: Group-randomized controlled trial evaluating two interventions: 1) promotion of HPV
      vaccination and 2) promotion of healthy eating using &quot;place of residence&quot; as the unit of
      randomization. Between May 2013 and October 2017, forty locations with 317 mother-daughter
      dyads were enrolled.
