      The primary purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of tDCS timing on safety
      memory in PTSD. A total of 90 participants will be randomized equally across one of three
      groups:

        1. One group receiving active stimulation during extinction and sham during consolidation

        2. One group receiving sham stimulation during extinction and active during consolidation

        3. One group receiving sham stimulation both during extinction and consolidation

      This is a three-arm study composed of five visits over a period of three weeks. Ninety
      participants will be exposed to a fear conditioning, extinction and recall paradigm at three
      separate study visits; one of these study visits will include active or sham transcranial
      direct current stimulation (tDCS) for a period of 15-20 minutes. Additional study procedures
      will include a screening period and two MRI scans, one done on study day 2 and one done on
      study day 5.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Primary diagnosis of PTSD, assessed by the Structured Clinical Interview of DSM-5
             (SCID);

          2. aged 18-70;

          3. ability to speak, read, write, and understand English sufficiently well to complete
             study procedures and provide informed consent;

          4. Stable psychiatric medication use or treatment for at least 6 weeks.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Lifetime history of psychotic or bipolar disorder;

          2. Current moderate or severe substance use disorder; if mild, not under the influence at
             time of study participation;

          3. Acute suicidal or homicidal ideation as detected on screening instruments or in the
             investigator team's opinion, is likely to attempt suicide within 6 months;

          4. current (or past) significant neurological disorder, injury, or other intracranial
             pathology including severe traumatic brain injury or lifetime history of a) seizure
             disorder b) primary or secondary CNS tumors c) stroke or d) cerebral aneurysm;

          5. lifetime history of moderate or, current unstable medical conditions;

          6. Any problems that would interfere with study participation, including MRI- or
             tDCS-related contraindications (e.g., implanted metallic devices/substances, metallic
             tattoos, pregnancy, claustrophobia, holes in the skull, skin abnormalities under
             stimulation sites), or indication of colorblindness, or presence of any other
             condition or circumstance that, in the opinion of the investigator team, has the
             potential to prevent study completion and/or inability to schedule visit days within
             the allotted time, and/or to have a confounding effect on outcome assessments.
