  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Seasonal influenza surveillance in France relies on several sources to detect the onset of
      the epidemic early, as well as to estimate the severity of epidemics and their impact on the
      health system. However, the data collected do not fully measure the impact of epidemics on
      the hospital system.

      Increasing the investigator's knowledge of the impact of influenza on the hospital system,
      particularly on emergencies, which are the most affected service, is essential to better
      adapt the resources put in place to care for patients.

      The study will allow a better understanding of the influenza burden, by systematically
      documenting the severe events (i.e. requiring consultations to the Emergency Rooms) that are
      triggered by influenza but not necessarily reported/recorded as influenza.
