    <textblock>
      Liver cancer is a common malignant tumor in China, and its incidence rate ranks third and
      remains high. The treatment of liver cancer has made some progress in recent years, mainly
      the progress of radical treatment such as surgery and ablation. For liver cancer, due to the
      emergence of molecularly targeted drugs such as sorafenib and immunological checkpoint
      inhibitors, the systemic therapeutic effect of advanced liver cancer is improved, and the
      curative effect is further improved. In recent years, immunotherapy has become one of the
      clinical treatment options for cancer. T lymphocytes are a cell with cell killing ability in
      the immune system, and programmed death factor 1 (PD-1) is an important inhibitory receptor
      on the surface of T lymphocytes. It is known that the ligands of PD-1 are PD-L1 and PD-L2,
      and studies have found that a variety of tumor cells have high expression of PD-L1 ligand on
      the surface. At present, clinical research on target drugs for PD-1 has included dozens of
      solid tumors or hematological tumors. The results of clinical studies that have been
      completed and the interim results of some studies indicate that anti-PD-1 antibody drugs are
      more effective and safer than previous treatments. Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma
      (HCC) often undergo liver cancer resection, but the recurrence rate can reach 70% to 100%,
      which seriously affects the treatment outcome and long-term survival rate. Early recurrence
      of liver cancer is mainly related to the invasiveness of the tumor. Microvascular invasion,
      non-anatomical hepatectomy, AFP greater than 32 ng/ml, tumor diameter greater than 5 cm, and
      incomplete tumor capsule are risk factors for recurrence within 2 years after surgery. Hence,
      it is necessary to determine the risk factors for HCC recurrence and the markers for
      continuous monitoring of anti-tumor response before and after surgery. Circulating tumor
      cells (CTCs) is an integral part of &quot;liquid biopsy&quot; and has great potential to change the
      current treatment modality in the cancer field. CTCs are derived from solid tumors and are
      associated with hematogenous metastasis. Therefore, analyzing the level of CTC has clinical
      guiding significance. For liver cancer patients, overall survival (OS) tended to be poorer in
      patients with CTCs. Although surgical treatment of liver cancer has benefited most patients
      with liver cancer, monitoring postoperative recurrence, further improving the long-term
      prognosis of liver cancer, postoperative detection of CTCs and other related indicators,
      combined with targeted, immune and other related treatments for further study. It is expected
      to receive 100 patients (50 treatment groups, 50 control groups). Patients who underwent
      immunotherapy after surgery were assigned to the immunotherapy group, and patients who were
      not treated with sorafenib after surgery were classified as the control group. All patients
      underwent 7 CTCs tests (immunomagnetic beads negative enrichment-targeted PCR) before, 7 days
      after surgery and 1st, 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th postoperatively. All patients were observed
      from the observation period. After the liver cancer resection, the patient was observed to
      have died, lost to follow-up or the end of the study.

    <description>PD-1 (programmed death receptor 1), an important immunosuppressive molecule, is an immunoglobulin superfamily and is a membrane protein of 268 amino acid residues. It was originally cloned from apoptotic mouse T cell hybridoma 2B4.11. Immunomodulation targeting PD-1 has important implications for anti-tumor, anti-infective, anti-autoimmune diseases and organ transplant survival. Its ligand PD-L1 can also be used as a target, and the corresponding antibodies can also play the same role. PD-1 and PD-L1 bind to initiate programmed cell death of T cells, allowing tumor cells to gain immune escape.</description>

    <description>Sorafenib tosylate is a novel multi-target anti-tumor drug developed by Bayer Pharmaceuticals, Germany, which acts on both tumor cells and tumor blood vessels. It has a dual anti-tumor effect: it directly inhibits tumor cell proliferation by blocking RAF/MEK/ERK-mediated cell signaling pathways, and also by inhibiting VEGFR and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptors. Blocking the formation of tumor neovascularization, indirectly inhibiting the growth of tumor cells.</description>
