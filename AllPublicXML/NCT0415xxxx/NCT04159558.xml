      To develop, using barcode systems and virtual pillbox (TuMedicina and Alice), an App aimed at
      patients and carers of patients with cardiometabolic diseases as the main diagnosis, over 45
      years of age, who have one or more pathologies and use one or more drugs on a daily basis and
      to analyze their effectiveness in terms of achieving therapeutic objectives, self-efficacy
      and self-efficacy in self-care or provision of care (as the case may be), healthy behavior,
      therapeutic compliance and safe use of medication.

      In order to achieve the objective of this study, an experimental study will carry out on
      patients with cardiometabolic and respiratory diseases and their caregivers. A participation
      of 100 patients and 85 caregivers is planned. The aim is for them to use the mobile
      application developed over three months in order to evaluate their health improvement
      comparing several clinical and analytic parameters before and after the use of the App, and
      also evaluating the satisfaction of the participants.
