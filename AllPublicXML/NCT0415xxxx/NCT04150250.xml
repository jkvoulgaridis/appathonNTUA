      A single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess safety and
      preliminary efficacy of oral doses of iOWH032 on diarrhea output and clinical symptoms after
      a cholera challenge. A total of 48 healthy adult individuals will be enrolled and challenged
      with a cholera strain before being randomized to either iOWH032 or placebo for 3 days.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the
      therapeutic efficacy of oral doses of iOWH032 on diarrhea output and clinical symptoms after
      a cholera challenge. There will be 24 study participants challenged in the first cohort and
      an additional 24 study participants challenged in the second cohort, pending favorable
      results of an interim analysis. Participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive either iOWH032
      500 mg every 8 hours for three days or matching placebo. Blinded therapeutic dosing will
      start at the onset of diarrhea or by 48 hours after ingesting the challenge inoculum of 10^6
      cfu of V. cholerae El Tor Inaba strain N16961. The observation and management of cholera
      diarrhea and symptomatology will occur on an inpatient isolation research ward over a
      duration of ~11 days, including a three-day course of antibiotics to treat all participants
      prior to discharge from the inpatient unit. The final study follow-up visit will be six
      months after the challenge via phone call.
