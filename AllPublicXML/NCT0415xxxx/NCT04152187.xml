      This study aims to determine the possible effects of inspiratory muscle training on
      cardiovascular, respiratory, physical and psychosocial functions in patients with PH.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary Hypertension (PH) is a hemodynamic finding related to increase in pulmonary artery
      pressure. Because PH disease is a progressive, rare disease, it is important for this disease
      group to prolong the life span and to increase the quality of life and functional capacity.
      PH patients have been shown to have weakness in peripheral and respiratory muscles.

      Patients will be randomly assigned to the inspiratory muscle training and control group.
      Inspiratory muscle training will be initiated in accordance with the patient at a range of
      40-60%. Ä°nspiratory muscle training will be given based on the assessments by the
      physiotherapist. Patients with PH who come to the routine outpatient clinic and volunteer
      will be included in the study. The first session will be the evaluation session and the
      8-week inspiratory muscle training will be given, the other group will be the control group
      only. Dyspnoea, diaphragm thickness, pulmonary function, respiratory and peripheral muscle
      strength, blood pressure, arterial stiffness, physical activity, anxiety, depression and
      quality of life assessments will be repeated before and after the treatment.

    <measure>International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form has 7 items listing activities and requests estimates of durations and frequencies for each activity engaged in over the past week. Durations are multiplied by known metabolic equivalents per activity and the results for all items are summed for the overall physical activity score. Scores for walking and for moderate and vigorous activities are sums of corresponding item scores. Higher scores indicate higher physical activity level.</description>

    <description>The Fatigue Impact Scale is widely used to measure fatigue. It is a 40-item multidimensional scale measuring the physical, cognitive and social. Patients are asked to rate how much of a problem fatigue has caused them during the past month, including the day of testing, on a 5-point Likert-type scale, with response options ranging from 0 &quot;no problem&quot; to 4 &quot;extreme problem&quot;.

Total scores for each domain range from 0 to 100. Higher scores represent less quality of life in relevant domain.</description>
