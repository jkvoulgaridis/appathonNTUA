          -  Participant between ≥ 10 years and ≤ 18 years on Study Day 1

          -  General good health, confirmed by medical history and physical examination

          -  Vaccinated with Bacille Calmette Guerin (BCG) at least 5 years ago, documented through
             medical history or by presence of healed BCG scar

          -  Tests QuantiFERON®-TB Gold Plus Assay (QFT) negative at screening, using the
             manufacturer's recommended threshold of 0.35 international units per milliliter

          -  For female participants: not pregnant and agrees to avoid pregnancy throughout the
             first 12 months of the study. Women physically capable of pregnancy must agree to use
             an acceptable method of avoiding pregnancy during this period. Acceptable methods of
             avoiding pregnancy include sexual abstinence (not engaging in sexual intercourse), a
             confirmed sterile partner, or at least 2 contraception methods from the following
             list: male or female condom, diaphragm, intrauterine devices (IUDs), hormonal
             contraceptive (oral, injection, transdermal patch, or implant).

          -  Agrees to stay in contact with the study site for the duration of the study, provide
             updated contact information as necessary, and has no current plans to move from the
             study area for the duration of the study

          -  Capable of giving signed informed consent/assent and completes the written informed
             consent/assent process.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Body temperature ≥37.5 degree Celsius on Study Day 1

          -  History or evidence of any clinically significant disease, including severe eczema and
             severe asthma, or any acute or chronic illness that might affect the safety,
             immunogenicity, or efficacy of study vaccine in the opinion of the investigator

          -  Any current medical, psychiatric, occupational, or substance abuse problems that, in
             the opinion of the investigator, will make it unlikely that the participant will
             comply with the protocol

          -  History of autoimmune disease

          -  History or evidence of active tuberculosis (TB) disease

          -  History or laboratory evidence of any past or present possible immunodeficiency state

             corticosteroids are permitted.

          -  Received immunoglobulin or blood products within 42 days before Study Day 1

          -  Laboratory values from the most recent blood collected prior to randomization outside
             the normal range that are suggestive of a disease state. Grade 1 abnormalities (as per
             Division of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome toxicity table version 2.1) do not lead
             to exclusion if the investigator considers them not clinically significant

          -  Urinalysis abnormality greater than Grade 1 on the Toxicity Scale (with the exception
             of hematuria in a menstruating female), or urinalysis abnormality judged clinically
             significant by the investigator

          -  Shared residence with an individual who is receiving TB treatment or with someone who

          -  Child in Care

          -  Female participants currently pregnant or lactating/nursing; or positive serum
