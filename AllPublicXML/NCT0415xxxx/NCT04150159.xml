  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized, open-label, 7-month trial in eighty (80) adult subjects. Forty (40) subjects will
      be randomized to the intervention FMD arm with a 5 day meal program every month for four (4)
      months. Forty subjects will be randomized to a follow a Mediterranean diet plan for four
      months. Both arms will have a final study visit at month 7.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Determine the effects of the FMD on cardiovascular (CV) biomarkers, coronary heart disease
      (CHD) risk factors (body weight, body mass index (BMI), body composition, blood pressure,
      serum lipid levels and dysglycemia blood measurements), noninvasive cardiovascular testing
      for endothelial function, arterial stiffness of large and small arteries and autonomic
      function testing in adult subjects over a seven-month study period.

    <description>The Mediterranean diet is based on the traditional foods that people used to eat in countries like Italy and Greece in the 1960s.
Eat every day: vegetables, fruits, nuts, seeds, legumes, potatoes, whole grains, breads, yogurt, dairy, fish/seafood, herbs, spices and extra virgin olive oil.
Eat three or fewer servings each week: poultry, eggs, cheese.
Eat two or fewer servings each week: red meat, potatoes.
Eat two or fewer servings each week: sweets, sodas, processed meat, refined grains, refined oils and other highly processed foods.</description>
