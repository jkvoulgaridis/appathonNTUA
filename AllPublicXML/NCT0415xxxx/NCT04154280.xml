  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer among man and the fourth most occurring over
      all . Characterization and management of the diagnosed prostate cancer is a challenging task
      due to its clinically and morphologically diversity. Clinically, this cancer range from
      indolent growing slowly malignancy, which does not threatened the patient life, to aggressive
      tumor that metastasize rapidly with very bad prognosis. Therapy of prostate cancer ranges
      from a &quot;watch and wait&quot; approach to hormone deprivation therapy to aggressive surgical,
      radiation, and cryosurgical therapies depending on the cancer characteristics. Prostate
      cancer is diagnosed using digital rectal examination, serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA)
      testing and transrectal ultrasonography (US)-guided biopsies . Imaging technologies have been
      adapted as a non-invasive method to obtain a comprehensive assessment of the disease. MRI is
      widely used and more specifically multiparameter MRI (mMRI) for detection, staging and tumor
      localization. mMRI uses multiphase modes including diffusion-weighted and dynamic
      contrast-enhanced imaging in addition to T2-weighted imaging to identify and classify cancer
      type . Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) is MRI technique that allow detection of tissue
      metabolic composition which is occasionally used to characterize prostate cancer, however is
      not used as a standard procedure. By suppression of water and fat signal, MRS sequence can
      detect relationship between lower concentration prostatic metabolites such as citrate,
      choline, creatine, and polyamines in the cell cytosol and in the extra cellular ducts.

      Other imaging modalities used to characterize prostate cancer include ultrasound (US),
      computerized tomography (CT), functional imaging like bone scanning (BS) and hybrid imaging
      like choline based positron emission tomography and CT (PET/CT). However all of these
      modalities show disappointing sensitivity .

      In recent years a new modality has emerged showing promising accuracy targeting the Prostate
      Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) which is significantly overexpressed in prostate tumor
      cells. By attaching radioactive isotope 68Ga to PSMA ligands, PET/CT molecular imaging can
      provide information regarding prostate cancer relapses and metastases with high contrast .
      Several recent studies showed the potential of 68Ga-PSMA PET in many application correlated
      with prostate cancer such as staging, identifying reoccurrence, guided biopsy and others . In
      the study, we wish to utilize the new hybrid PET/MR technology and combine 68Ga-PSMA PET
      studies with MRS information in order to explore correlation between the data obtained by
      both modalities and investigate the implication on the disease characteristics.

    <description>The PET will be performed with 68Ga-PSMA tracer.
The 3 tesla magnet of the MRI will be used with sequence allowing MRS acquisition, additional sequences will include T2-weighted contrast and diffusion weighted contrast.
Images will be analyzed visually and quantitatively. Quantitative analysis will include MR parameters such as DWI apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and PET quantitative metabolic data such as standard uptake values (SUV) or Ki (in case dynamic PET protocol will be applied). In addition, content relationship between metabolic entities detected will be extracted.
Quantitative data will be correlated to clinical and pathological data to check accuracy, specificity and sensitivity.</description>
