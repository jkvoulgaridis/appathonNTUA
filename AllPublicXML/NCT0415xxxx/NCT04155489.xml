  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although blood transfusion is a representative treatment for acute anemia due to blood loss
      during surgery, it is also a powerful risk factor for postoperative cognitive dysfunction.

      'Restrictive transfusion', which transfusions minimal red blood cells, is not only useful for
      conserving limited blood resources, but also does not worsen prognosis or mortality after
      surgery. Research has also been reported that severe restrictive transfusion has improved
      prognosis and mortality.

      However, anemia is also one of the risk factors for postoperative complications, including
      neurocognitive impairment, it is still controversial how much anemia should be allowed in
      elderly people who are sensitive to ischemia or heart disease.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the restrictive transfusion policy reduces
      the frequency of postoperative cognitive dysfunction than the liberal transfusion policy in
      patients aged 65 years or older who undergo lumbar interbody fusion.

      Restrictive transfusion strategy (which initiates transfusion when hemoglobin level is less
      than 8 g / dL during perioperative period) // liberal transfusion strategy (which initiates
      transfusion when hemoglobin level is less than 10 g / dL during perioperative period)

      The Aim of this study was to compare the frequency of postoperative cognitive dysfunction
      diagnosed 7 days after surgery between two groups.

      K-MOCA (Korean-Montreal Cognitive Assessment) is used to evaluate cognitive dysfunction. In
      addition, plasma inflammatory markers (CRP, IL-6) and GFAP reflecting brain damage were
      measured before and after surgery to determine whether brain injury caused by systemic
      inflammatory response is associated with cognitive dysfunction

    <description>On the day before the surgery and the seventh day after the surgery, the patient scan K-MOCA (Korean-Montreal Cognitive Assessment). If the difference between the preoperative test results and the post-operative test results is RCI (Reliable Change Index) &lt;-1.96, it is determined that cognitive dysfunction occurred.</description>
