    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this study is to assess differences in the microbiome between women with
      and without endometriosis.

      A second goal of this study is to assess immunologic differences between the eutopic (within
      the uterus) and ectopic (outside of the uterus) endometrial tissue in women with
      endometriosis.

      In order to investigate these areas of interest, 25 women with endometriosis and 25 women
      without endometriosis will be enrolled. All women will be undergoing a previously scheduled
      surgical procedure at which time presence or absence of endometriosis will be confirmed and
      specimens will be obtained.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endometriosis is a chronic gynecologic condition where implants of endometrial glands and
      stroma are present outside of the uterus. It occurs in 6-10% of women of reproductive age and
      is characterized by dysmenorrhea, chronic pelvic pain, dyspareunia, or infertility. In
      addition to symptom burden, there are significant direct costs related to diagnosis and
      treatment of disease, as well as indirect costs related to absenteeism from school and work,
      loss of productivity, and unemployment. The estimated national economic burden in the United
      States related to these costs is approximately 78 billion dollars per year. While clinical
      signs and symptoms may be suggestive of endometriosis, the gold standard for diagnosis
      requires surgical confirmation of disease.

      The pathogenesis of endometriosis is complex and likely multifactorial with genetic,
      epigenetic, environmental, and immunologic factors. An increasing number of studies have also
      suggested the role of the microbiome in human health and development of disease. This study
      aims to investigate possible differences in the microbiome and immunologic factors that could
      contribute to pathogenesis of this disease. Findings from this study could potentially
      contribute to the development of of a less invasive, non-surgical diagnostic test for
      endometriosis.
