  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center, phase III trial to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of Toripalimab injection (JS001) combined with
      platinum-based doublet chemotherapy versus placebo combined with platinum-based doublet
      chemotherapy in resectable stage IIIA NSCLC.

      Subjects meet all the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be paralleled assigned according
      to the stratification factors as below:

        -  Pathological type: squamous cell carcinoma vs. non-squamous cell carcinoma

        -  PD-L1 status: PD-L1 expression ≥1% vs. PD-L1＜1% or not evaluable

        -  Planned surgical operation: pneumonectomy vs. lobectomy Neoadjuvant therapy should be
           started within 3 days after randomization. Toripalimab IV 240mg Q3W will be given
           combined with platinum-based doublet chemotherapy for three cycles in the neoadjuvant
           setting in the experimental group; Every 3 weeks of treatment is regarded as one cycle,
           in which combined therapy is given in the first day of every cycle. Placebo combined
           with platinum-based doublet chemotherapy will be given for three cycles in the control
           group instead.

      All the subjects will receive preoperative radiological and surgical evaluation 3-5 weeks
      after neoadjuvant therapy.

      All the qualified subjects will receive radical excision based on the surgical operation
      criteria of the World Association for Lung Cancer Research within 4-6 weeks after neoadjuvant
      therapy. Pathologic staging based on AJCC Cancer Staging Manual (version 8) of the whole
      specimens will be performed by the local pathologist. And then all the specimens will be sent
      to the BIPR for further evaluation. All the subjects accept the radical operation will
      receive one cycle of postoperative neoadjuvant therapy, i.e., Toripalimab IV 240mg / placebo
      + platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, 30 days after the operation. In case of no indication
      for radiotherapy, it will proceed to consolidation treatment period three weeks later; if
      indicated for radiotherapy, it will proceed to consolidation treatment period 30 days after
      the radiotherapy. In the consolidation treatment setting, JS001 is given by IV 240mg in each
      cycle of every 3 weeks for a total of 13 cycles i in the experimental group; placebo is given
      by IV 240mg in each cycle of every 3 weeks for a total of 13 cycles in the control group.
      Adverse events (AE) will be monitored throughout the study, and the seriousness will be
      graded to the guideline in national cancer institute (NCI) common terminology criteria for
      adverse events (CTCAE) version 5.0 or above. The safety will be followed up in the subjects
      who have received treatment and discontinued the drug prematurely. All the subjects will be
      followed up for overall survival, until death, withdrawal of informed consent or end of
      study.
