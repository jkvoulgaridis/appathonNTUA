  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the benefit of adding mental visualization to a
      training program in medical education. Undergraduate medical students will be randomized
      before participating in a training program on airway management during rapid sequence
      induction. In the control group, participants will receive traditional teaching including
      theoretical courses and procedural simulation. In the intervention group, in addition to
      traditional teaching, participants will be trained and encouraged to practice mental
      visualization. The main outcome will be clinical performance during a standardized
      high-fidelity simulation of rapid sequence induction assessed using a specific
      pre-established checklist.
