    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II study of daratumumab based therapies for older adults with multiple
      myeloma.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this response adapted approach, older adults with newly diagnosed symptomatic multiple
      myeloma will receive daratumumab and dexamethasone for 2 months. Patients who achieve a
      partial response or better will continue on daratumumab. Patients who achieve less than a
      partial response will have lenalidomide or bortezomib added to their therapy. Patients who
      experience progressive disease on daratumumab after the initial 2 months of monotherapy or on
      the combination of daratumumab and either lenalidomide or bortezomib will come off study

Patients with a creatinine clearance &lt; 30 ml/min are not eligible but patients who experience a deterioration in the renal function during screening or treatment may continue on lenalidomide therapy as long as the risk / benefit profile is deemed acceptable, that study therapy is in the best interest of the patient and after discussion with the study principal investigator / sponsor.</description>

             antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen [anti-HBs]) must be screened using real-time
             polymerase chain reaction (PCR) measurement of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA levels.
             Those who are PCR positive will be excluded. EXCEPTION: Subjects with serologic
             findings suggestive of HBV vaccination (anti-HBs positivity as the only serologic
