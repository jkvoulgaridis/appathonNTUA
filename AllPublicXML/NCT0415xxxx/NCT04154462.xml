  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background and study aims: Medical scribes are trained paraprofessionals that assist
      providers with documenting patient encounters. Prior evidence suggests that scribes may be
      effective in increasing provider productivity and satisfaction, and decreasing provider time
      spent on documentation without negatively affecting patient satisfaction. Section 507 of the
      MISSION Act of 2018 mandated a two-year pilot of medical scribes, which will begin in March
      2020 in specialty clinics and emergency departments (EDs) of twelve VA Medical Centers
      (VAMCs) across the country. The aims of this study are to understand how the introduction of
      scribes and scribe training affect provider efficiency, patient and provider satisfaction,
      wait times, and daily patient volume in the VA context.

      Who can participate? Urban and rural VAMCs willing to be assigned medical scribes for use in
      EDs or selected high wait time specialty clinics (cardiology, orthopedics).

      What does the study involve? Four medical scribes will be assigned to each of the 12 VAMC
      sites randomized into treatment with the VA hiring half as new employees and contracting out
      for the remaining half. 30% of the scribes will be assigned to emergency departments and the
      other 70% will be assigned to specialty care. Remaining sites that expressed interest in the
      pilot but were not randomized treatment will be used as comparators. Provider productivity,
      patient volume, wait times, and patient satisfaction from the treated sites will be compared
      to baseline (pre-scribe) data as well as data from comparison sites.

      What are the possible benefits and risks of participating? VAMCs where medical scribes are
      introduced may see gains in provider efficiency, reduced wait times, and increased patient
      satisfaction due to the shifting of administrative burdens associated with documenting
      patient encounters in electronic health records from providers to these trained
      professionals. The introduction of medical scribes could complicate patient encounters by
      making some patients and/or providers uncomfortable.

      Where is the study run from? This study is being coordinated by the Partnered Evidence-based
      Policy Resource Center (PEPReC) at the VA Boston Healthcare System in collaboration with the
      VA Office of Veterans Access to Care (OVAC).

      When is the study starting and how long is it expected to run for? March 2020 to February
      2022

      Who is funding the study? U.S. Veterans Health Administration

    <intervention_model_description>A two-arm randomized field experiment is being used to assess the effect of medical scribes on productivity, wait times, and patient satisfaction. OVAC will work with participating VAMCs to identify providers to participate in the pilot. A varied provider pool will limit selection bias but must be balanced with recruitment and retention of providers. The goal is to keep the provider-scribe pairs consistent throughout the pilot.
Each VAMC site randomized to treatment will have two VA employee scribes and two contract scribes. Two medical scribes, ideally one employee and one contract, will be assigned to one physician, with two physicians and/or Licensed Independent Practitioners (LIP) participating at each facility. Scribes will work with others if the provider partner is not available during a scheduled shift. Power analyses have been conducted to determine the minimum effect size for each outcome with 80% power, which will be useful for putting the final results into context.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Section 507 of the MISSION Act of 2018 mandates a two-year pilot of medical scribes in VA specialty clinics and emergency departments. Medical scribes assist health care providers by helping to administratively expedite an episode of care through the recording of patient information and updating patient records. Scribes are trained but non-licensed professionals, often deployed in emergency departments and outpatient clinic settings, that observe and document patient encounters but do not participate in clinical care.</description>

        Exclusion Criteria:

        â€¢ Lack of appropriate site capabilities

        The VA Office of Veterans Access to Care developed a list of 32 interested VAMCs based on
        email surveying, which were categorized based on location (urban, rural), desired scribe
        deployment (ED, specialty care), and underserved (based on high new patient specialty care
        wait times). 12 VAMCs were then randomly selected for the treatment, accounting for the
        requirements of the law, OVAC preferences, and site capabilities, with the remainder used
        as comparison sites.
