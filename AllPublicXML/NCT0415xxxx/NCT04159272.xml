  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The epidemiological data are alarming. Emotional distress, and depression in particular, is
      highly prevalent in adolescents, it has multiple problematic consequences and, most alarming,
      it is on the rise. All too often, these symptoms persist and lead to long-term and severe
      psychiatric problems. Mindfulness training (MT) is expected to counter both the
      non-acceptance of negative emotions (underlying depressed (sad) mood, anxiety and stress) and
      the dampening of positive emotions (underlying anhedonia). Vulnerable youngsters typically do
      not accept their negative emotions (which paradoxically further increases negative emotions)
      and also dampen positive emotions, as long as there are negative emotions present: a
      catch-22. MT, as a low-threshold intervention, is expected to 'unlock' this catch-22 by
      teaching participants to become non-judgmentally aware of thoughts, feelings, and sensations,
      and increasing their capacity to replace automatic, habitual, and often judgmental reactions
      with more conscious and skillful responses. That way, MT is hypothesized to reduce depressed
      (sad) mood, anxiety and stress and to promote protective positive emotions. On top, MT is
      expected to foster a healthier discourse among youngsters on their emotional lives as an
      alternative to society's malignant discourse that denounces negative emotions and
      over-focuses on the pursuit of happiness, which now backfires on vulnerable youngsters.

      The aim of the present study is to evaluate the effects of MT in adolescents on their
      experience of negative emotions (i.e. symptoms of stress, anxiety and depression),
      suppression/acceptance of negative emotions, symptoms of anhedonia (i.e. lack of pleasurable
      feelings), dampening of positive emotions, social expectancies towards the (non-)expression
      and (non-)experience of negative emotions, and on several secondary outcomes or endpoints
      (e.g., loneliness, repetitive negative thinking, self-compassion). Pairs of two classes will
      be recruited from schools in Flanders, Belgium, and all adolescents (&gt;14 years of age) of
      these selected classes will be invited to participate. One class in each pair will be
      randomly assigned to an 8-week MT during regular school hours supported by a newly developed
      mindfulness app for adolescents, while the other class (control group) follows the regular
      school curriculum. Before randomization, post-intervention and 3 months after the
      intervention, participant's current experience of negative emotions, their level of
      suppression/acceptance of negative emotions, dampening, and anhedonia will be assessed using
      experience sampling methods and self-report questionnaires.

      The investigators hypothesize that mindfulness can help youngsters in their school context to
      become more accepting of their emotions and, that this 'opening up' not only leads to less
      distress and anhedonia, but also to less toxic social pressure amongst peers in school not to
      feel and not to talk about negative emotions. That way, mindfulness can help foster a social
      climate that promotes a more balanced embracement of emotions which is likely beneficial for
      young people's well-being.

    <description>The MT programme adheres to a standardized protocol developed from MBSR (Kabat-Zinn, 1990) and MBCT (Segal et al., 2012) manuals and is adjusted to an adolescent population. Adjustments are based on our ample experience with mindfulness and adolescents in different contexts. Key objectives are: (1) to increase awareness of one's present moment experience; (2) to teach an attitude of openness and acceptance (non-judging) toward one's experience. This accepting attitude changes the person's relationship with the experience, being a detached and non-reactive orientation. Participants learn to recognize entanglement with one's thoughts and emotions and there is an increased understanding of one's spontaneous reactions. If adolescents adopt these skills, their negative emotions and cognitions will no longer be reinforced, creating the opportunity to deal with problematic thoughts and feelings.</description>

    <description>The programme consists of 8 90-min sessions held once a week for 8 consecutive weeks. Each session consists of guided experiential mindfulness exercises, sharing of experiences of these exercises, reflections in small groups, psycho-education, and review of home practices. An overview of the core elements in each session is given in Van der Gucht et al. (2017). The in-class MT programme will be supported with a mindfulness for adolescents smartphone application to support practice at home.
The curriculum is available in an open source platform. The training is supported by the use of homework assignments and audio material. The programme has already been piloted and reviewed in an expert group of mindfulness trainers and scientists working with youth in mental health care (Van der Gucht et al., 2017) and in refugee centres (Van der Gucht et al., 2019). The MT will be delivered by certified trainers (&gt;3 years of experience). During the trial they will receive regular supervision.</description>
