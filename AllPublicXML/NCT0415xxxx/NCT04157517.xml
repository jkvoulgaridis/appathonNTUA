      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of TAK-573 in
      participants with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-573. TAK-573 is being tested to evaluate
      the safety, tolerability, PK, and pharmacodynamics in participants with locally advanced or
      metastatic solid tumors. The study will include a dose escalation phase and a dose expansion
      phase.

      The study will enroll approximately 86 participants (approximately 30 participants in dose
      escalation phase and 7 participants per cohort with a total of 8 cohorts in dose expansion
      phase).

      The dose escalation phase will enroll participants with solid tumors. The dose escalation
      phase is to evaluate single agent recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) which could be either MTD
      or PAD.

      The dose expansion phase will be initiated once the MTD and /or PAD are determined for
      TAK-573. The dose expansion phase will enroll participants in 8 cohorts for participants with
      advanced or metastatic: NSCLC, CRPC, MSI-high solid tumors with acquired resistance to CPIs,
      melanoma with acquired resistance to CPIs, head-and-neck with acquired resistance to CPIs,
      TNBC, PDAC and MSS colon cancer.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States. Participants with
      demonstrated clinical benefit may continue treatment beyond 1 year if approved by the
      sponsor. The overall time to participate in this study is 43 months. All participants will
      make an end of treatment (EOT) visit 30 days after receiving their last dose of study drug or
      before the start of subsequent systemic anticancer therapy, whichever occurs first for a
      safety follow up assessment.

    <ipd_description>Takeda makes patient-level, de-identified data sets and associated documents available for all interventional studies after applicable marketing approvals and commercial availability have been received (or program is completely terminated), an opportunity for the primary publication of the research and final report development has been allowed, and other criteria have been met as set forth in Takeda's Data Sharing Policy (see www.TakedaClinicalTrials.com for details). To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias. Once approved, qualified researchers who sign a data sharing agreement are provided access to these data in a secure research environment.</ipd_description>
