  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PSMA (Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen) is overexpressed in prostate cancer cells.

      The 68Ga-PSMA PET / CT test, using small molecules that bind to the PSMA protein and undergo
      intercellularization, is a test that has been shown to be more sensitive and specific than
      other conventional and molecular imaging modalities (CT, MRI, bone mapping, Disease in
      prostate cancer patients and its consequences often change therapeutic decisions in patients.
      In light of this, the examination of the health basket of the State of Israel was introduced
      to the staging of patients at moderate or high risk, as well as to the extent of the disease
      in patients with biochemical failure.

      However, testing with 68Ga-PSMA has several limitations, resulting from the use of 68 Ga,
      which can be overcome by switching to fluorine-18 (18F) -based materials:

      A. The generation capacity of the generator is low and therefore limits the number of tests
      that can be performed at a given time. In contrast, 18F is produced in cyclotron.

      B. 68 Ga has a short half-life of 68 minutes, which is a logical consequence of its
      availability to remote medical centers from the place of production, the time of the test and
      the patient's comfort, and the possibility of subsequent mappings. The half-life of 18F is
      110 minutes.

      third. 18F has less energy than 68Ga (0.65 MEV vs. 1.9) and, as a result, a better maximum
      resolution that would potentially enable the demonstration of smaller lymph nodes involved in
      the disease.

      Among the fluorine-18 (18F) materials selected for clinical application is 18F-PSMA-1007,
      both because the uptake is higher in the tumor than in the background, and because its
      removal is mainly the pathobiliary and only a small fraction of the material is released in
      the urine. This is another advantage of 18F-PSMA-1007 over 68Ga-PSMA, potentially enabling a
      better demonstration of disease sites in the pelvis, without significant absorption of the
      bladder material.

      To date, accumulated promising experience, in Germany, in imaging with 18F-PSMA-1007. In one
      published case, 17 degenerative disease sites were detected in one patient with biochemical
      failure 9 years after undergoing radical prostatectomy, which was not demonstrated by other
      imaging modalities, including CT, MRI and bone mapping
