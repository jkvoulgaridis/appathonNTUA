  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess smoking, vaping, and alcohol consumption behaviors via online surveys in the
      population. Further, the objective is to administer additional surveys to assess which
      methods (e.g., pen-and-paper records, a smartphone app) for monitoring smoking, vaping,
      alcohol intake, and food intake are preferred by the study population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many smokers believe that smoking helps them to control their weight, and concerns about
      weight gain can interfere with smoking cessation. In fact, nicotine has been shown to
      suppress appetite and increase resting metabolic rate, and smoking also serves as a
      behavioral alternative to eating or a distraction from hunger or food cravings. E-cigarettes
      are frequently marketed as the safer and healthier alternative to smoking, and some
      e-cigarettes are in fact actively advertised for weight management and/or suppression of food
      cravings, encouraging smokers to make the switch. In contrast, alcohol consumption has been
      shown to increase appetite and food intake and at the same time is associated with smoking
      and vaping.

      Therefore, it is possible that participants who smoke or vape for weight control,
      particularly those who also regularly consume alcohol, would benefit from a lifestyle program
      that encompasses dietary counseling and exercise to prevent weight gain after smoking
      cessation. Additionally, methods to assess smoking, vaping, alcohol intake, and food intake
      (i.e., ingestive behaviors) historically relied on self-report, though the investigator's
      group has developed smartphone apps that allow people to capture images of their intake
      and/or self-report their intake in the app. App-based methods offer advantages, including the
      real-time transfer of data, and it is presumed that people will believe that apps are an
      easier and preferred method to capture ingestive behaviors, yet this assumption has not yet
      been thoroughly examined.
