      The purpose of this study are to determine the efficacy of tamsulosin compared to placebo in
      reducing post-operative urinary retention and improving other clinical outcomes in people
      undergoing thoracic surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Post-operative urinary retention (POUR) is not an uncommon complication following thoracic
      surgery. It has been reported to occur in up to 12-67% of patients with the use of thoracic
      epidural analgesia1. Risk factors associated with urinary retention in thoracic patients
      include male, age over 40 years, type 2 diabetes, undergoing lung resection and the use of
      thoracic epidural analgesia2. Patients who experience urinary retention are treated with a
      straight catheter and may subsequently require the placement of an indwelling catheter. The
      use of these catheters is associated with numerous complications. The best studied
      complications are infectious and include catheter associated urinary tract infections
      (CAUTIs). However, many patients continue to experience symptoms well after their catheters
      have been removed.

      Tamsulosin is an alpha one adrenergic receptor blocked that is indicated for the treatment of
      lower urinary tract symptoms in the context of benign prostatic hyperplasia. However, it is
      often used in clinical practice to treat other pathologies such as acute urinary retention
      and nephrolithiasis.

      The objectives of this study are to determine the efficacy of tamsulosin compared to placebo
      in reducing post-operative urinary retention and catheter related complications in people
      undergoing thoracic surgery.
