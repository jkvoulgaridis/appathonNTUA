      Study the effect of neurectomy of nasopalatine nerve on the sensation of anterior palate in
      patients undergoing rehabilitation of anterior maxillary ridge with dental implant
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Replacement of missing teeth in the anterior maxilla could be challenging if enlargement of
      the nasopalatine canal which is located in the midline of the palate posterior to the
      maxillary central incisors or ridge atrophy occur after tooth extraction. This could place
      the neurovascular content of the nasopaltine canal in the path of the dental implant which
      may lead to complications such as nasopalatine canal cyst, sensory dysfunction or implant
      failure. Technique to overcome this problem have evolved including neurectomy of the
      nasopalatine canal content and obliteration of canal with bone graft.

      Loss of sensation in anterior palate following this procedure could be an annoying
      complication for patients. In recent studies regaining of sensation following such procedure
      have been reported, Confirmation of such results is essential to rule out the side effect of
      loss of sensation in the anterior palatal region
