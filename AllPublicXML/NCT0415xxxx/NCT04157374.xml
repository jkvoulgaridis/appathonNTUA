      Patients will be recruited and then randomly assigned by an external collaborator to the
      experimental group or to the control group. To the patients that belong to the experimental
      group will be asked to watch a video showing a person carrying out some exercises (12
      exercises: 3 of stretching, 3 of core stability, 3 of mobilization and 3 of functional) and
      then they will have to practice them.On the other hand, to the patients that belong to the
      control group will be given a brochure with the same exercises the patients of the
      experimental group received through the video. Both groups will have to watch the video or
      read the brochure and repeat the exercises 5 times per week for 3 weeks. Patients will be
      evaluated before the treatment (T0), three weeks after the beginning (T1) and 4 months upon
      the end of it (T2). The evaluation will consist in the administration of the Oswestry
      Disability Index, of the Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia, of the Numerical Rating Scale and of
      the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36.

      A physiotherapist will instruct the patients about the exercises while a second one blinded
      about the belonging group of patients, will administer the evaluation scales.
