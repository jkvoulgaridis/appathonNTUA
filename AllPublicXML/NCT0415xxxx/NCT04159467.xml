  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) on
      urinary incontinence reports in obese women undergoing a low calorie diet prior to bariatric
      surgery for obesity. The study will also assess and compare rates of adherence to treatments,
      pelvic floor muscle function and women´s self perception of their PFM function, and
      satisfaction with treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the adult overweight rate in 2014 reached
      20%, with the highest prevalence among women. In addition to metabolic diseases, obesity can
      cause musculoskeletal disorders, including pelvic floor muscle (PFM) disorders and urinary
      incontinence (UI) is the most prevalent one. Conservative intervention can be medication,
      lifestyle changes, but pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) is considered the first-line
      conservative therapy for urinary incontinence in women and it is effective when delivered
      both individually or in group.

    <description>Experimental group will receive supervised pelvic floor muscle training additionally to a low calorie diet. Women will be instructed to perform daily pelvic floor muscle training at home. 4 sets of 10 maximal perceived voluntary pelvic floor contractions sustained for 6 seconds, followed by 5 voluntary pelvic floor muscle contractions. The 4 sets will be performed in 3 different positions (lying, sitting and standing). Twice a month (once every 15 days), they will receive a supervised session using the same protocol described above except for the position that will be only sitting and standing. In addition, they will be instructed to perform the &quot;the knack&quot; maneuver.</description>
