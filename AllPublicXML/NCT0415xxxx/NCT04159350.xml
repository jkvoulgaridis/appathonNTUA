      To prospectively evaluate the clinical utility of baseline anorectal function testing using a
      point-of-care device in predicting response of chronically constipated patients to physical
      therapy biofeedback training.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic constipation affects 10-20% of the US population and can impact quality-of-life to a
      similar degree as congestive heart failure or rheumatoid arthritis. Notably, 700,000
      individuals present to the emergency department for constipation each year in the US and $10
      billion is spent annually on laxative therapy. For symptomatic chronic constipation
      refractory to fiber or laxative therapy, clinical practice guidelines recommend physiological
      testing to identify abnormalities in anorectal function as the next step5. Abnormal anorectal
      function testing (including anorectal manometry and balloon expulsion testing) suggests an
      evacuation disorder, the most common of which is dyssynergic defecation or dyssynergia.
      Identification of patients with an evacuation disorder as a primary driver of constipation is
      important since therapy can then be targeted.

      To enable standardized, accessible chronic constipation testing for general
      gastroenterologists, the investigators invented an office-based, point-of-care Rectal
      Expulsion Device (RED). By incorporating RED into a general gastroenterologist's outpatient
      visit, chronically constipated individuals with abnormal anorectal function can be identified
      quickly and directly triaged to biofeedback therapy. Thus, RED offers the possibility of
      disrupting the current treatment paradigm by enabling an initial biomarker based strategy for
      patients with chronic constipation. Before such a process of care can be realized, there is a
      critical need for prospective data to determine the best setting for anorectal function
      testing in the clinical care pathway. The investigators aim to prospectively evaluate the
      clinical utility of baseline anorectal function testing using RED in identifying chronically
      constipated patients with evacuation disorders who would benefit from biofeedback therapy.

      The investigators will conduct a 12-week clinical trial enrolling individuals with
      laxative-refractory chronic constipation. All study participants will undergo RED and
      traditional lab-based testing at baseline, followed by a standardized three-session
      biofeedback protocol for dyssynergia.

    <description>Using the Bristol Stool Scale at week 0 and week 12 measure the change in bowel movement form. The scale breaks down bowel movements into seven different categories based on the appearance of the stool. Stool type 1 indicates severe constipation and stool type 7 indicates severe diarrhea</description>

    <measure>Level of agreement between binary test results of RED and traditional lab-based testing</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Because RED is designed to produce similar results compared to traditional balloon expulsion, traditional balloon expulsion will be used as the gold standard in the primary analysis. However, no single test can identify dyssynergia in current clinical practice. Rome IV enables a diagnosis of dyssynergia based on agreement among lab-based anorectal function tests. Further, Rome IV criteria do not specify which specific manometric quantitative measures define abnormal anorectal manometry will be assessed. In exploratory analysis, the level of agreement between RED and anorectal manometry, including recto-anal index and anal relaxation during attempted defecation. The concordance between binary testing results using RED as a single device, compared to combination lab-based anorectal function testing will be evaluated, to gather preliminary data assessing the robustness of RED in diagnosing dyssynergia as a single device.</description>

    <description>After a complete physical exam at bedside including a digital rectal exam, the patient is turned on their right side and RED is gently inserted into the rectum. The patient is then given one minute to expel RED while remaining on their right side. If the patient is unable to pass RED, the patient transfers to a commode and attempts to expel the device. If the device is not expelled, the device can be safely removed at bedside and the patient diagnosed with a biofeedback-responsive evacuation disorder.
The RED device is manufactured by Rose Medical (Grand Rapids, MI) under GMP conditions and final assembly is performed by In2Being (Saline, MI). The device contains accepted technologies that are already in use of humans, namely biomedical grade materials.</description>
