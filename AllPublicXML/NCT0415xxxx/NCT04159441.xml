  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is a common side effect in antituberculosis therapy, which
      interuputs the treatment of TB and leads to a higher proportion of Multidrug-Resistence
      TB(MDR-TB).The study primalily aims to observe the proportion of DILI in antituberculosis
      therapy. Furthermore, the secondary objective is to study the proportion of liver injury of
      based liver disase,liver failure and adjustment of chemotherapy in the obersevational study.
