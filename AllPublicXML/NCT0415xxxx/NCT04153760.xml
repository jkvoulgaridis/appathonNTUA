  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pilot PARTUM trial is a randomized, multicenter, placebo-controlled trial. Women who are
      at modest risk of VTE (as defined by the inclusion criteria) will be identified during
      pregnancy, labor and delivery and up to 48 hours postpartum. Eligible and consenting
      participants will be randomly assigned to one of two study arms: aspirin 81 mg daily or
      placebo daily for 6 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the pilot PARTUM trial is to determine whether it is feasible to conduct a
      larger randomized controlled trial to determine whether low-dose aspirin is efficacious and
      safe at preventing postpartum venous thromboembolism (VTE) in women at increased risk of VTE,
      compared to placebo.

      Given the large sample size needed to adequately power a large multicenter trial that
      assesses the efficacy of aspirin 81 mg versus placebo, the investigators first need to
      determine if it is possible to recruit enough women. If the pilot trial is successful and
      there are no major changes to the study design, then the secondary clinical outcomes
      collected in the pilot trial will be used in the analysis of the full multicenter trial.
