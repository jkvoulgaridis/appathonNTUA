  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, open-label, single-dose in healthy subjects conducted at single center.The
      objectives are to evaluate the metabolic and safety profile of EXPAREL®. Each volunteer will
      receive one dose of the investigational drug via subcutaneous injection at multiple points
      during the study period. Study duration is around 54 days, including screening, confinement,
      ambulatory visit and a phone follow up.

          3. Willing and able to give written informed consent and comply with the study visit
             schedule, study procedures and restrictions.

          4. Generally, in good health with no clinically significant abnormalities as determined
             by medical history, physical examination, 12-lead ECG and clinical laboratory tests.

          5. Have a body mass index (BMI) between 19.0 and 24.0 kg/m2, inclusive, and a body weight
             ≥50 kg at screening visit and baseline visit (Day -1).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Female subjects who are pregnant (positive pregnancy result at screening and on Day
             -1), or lactating.

          2. Female subjects of child bearing potential and sexually active don't agree to use
             medically acceptable contraceptive (e.g. insertable, injectable, transdermal, hormonal
             contraceptive) from the date of consent given until 30 days after administration of
             study drug. Menopausal woman don't have her menopausal status confirmed by
             follicle-stimulating hormone test at screening.

          3. Male subjects who are sexually active don't agree to use condom plus spermicide since
             the dosing day till 90 days after administration of study drug.

          4. Male subjects don't agree not to donate sperm since the dosing day till 90 days after
             administration of study drug.

             significance which may suggest of an underlying disease such as alanine
             aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) values, greater than 1.5
             times the upper limit of normal.

             herbal preparations, etc.) within 14 days or less than 5 half-lives (whichever is
             longer) prior to screening visit.

         14. Blood loss or donation more than 450ml within 3 months prior to dosing.

         15. Previous participation in an EXPAREL® study.

         16. Administration of an investigational drug within 30 days or 5 elimination half-lives
             of the investigational drug, whichever is longer, prior to study drug administration,
             or planned administration of another investigational product or procedure during the
             subject's participation in this study.
