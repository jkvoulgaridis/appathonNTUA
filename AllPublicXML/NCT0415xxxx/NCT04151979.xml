  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Placenta Accreta Spectrum (PAS) is a disease associated with abnormal placental adhesion and
      invasion. In recent years, the incidence of PAS has increased significantly, which can cause
      massive postpartum hemorrhage, hysterectomy,and even maternal mortality. The research team of
      Peking university third hospital developed the ultrasound rating scale in china at first to
      conduct preliminary assessment of the PAS risk which can identify the severity of cases. In a
      basis of ultrasound, plan to explore the MRI for the the investigators diagnosis of PAS
      according to some specific PAS features, like the the uneven signal intensity , the
      myometrial discontinuity, and black band on T2 image, and finally established a MRI scoring
      system of PAS. MRI score system of PAS can reduce the subjective difference of the
      clinician's visual reading, and assist the clinician to assess the risk of sever PAS further,
      and conduct perioperative preparation to reduce the risk of maternal morbidity and mortality
      to achieve a better clinical outcome.

      Placenta Accreta Spectrum (PAS) is a disease associated with abnormal placental adhesion and
      invasion. In recent years, the incidence of PAS has increased significantly, and the main
      risk is high hysterectomy rate,massive postpartum hemorrhage, and even maternal mortality in
      women at childbearing age. The research team of Peking university third hospital developed
      the ultrasound rating scale in china at first to conduct preliminary assessment of the PAS
      risk which can identify the severity of cases and guide the junior hospitals to transfer.
      Peking University third hospital is in the leading position in the preoperative diagnosis of
      PAS currently.

      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become a common method for preoperative evaluation for
      sever cases. MRI can provide a map of the placenta and PAS features, like the uterus enlarged
      significantly, the uneven signal intensity , the myometrial discontinuity, and black band on
      T2 image. It has a high diagnostic value. At present, only Lim and Ueno reported MRI scoring
      system for PAS. Due to the small sample size and the limitation of the research methods, a
      widely applicable rating scale has not been established. MRI score system of PAS can reduce
      the subjective difference of the clinician's visual reading, and assist the clinician to
      assess the risk of sever PAS further, and conduct perioperative preparation to reduce the
      risk of maternal morbidity and mortality and achieve a better clinical outcome.
