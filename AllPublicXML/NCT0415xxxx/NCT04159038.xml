  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study's goals are to improve connections between Oregon Women, Infants, &amp; Children (WIC)
      clinics, primary care providers, and Early Intervention/Early Childhood Special Education
      programs (EI/ECSE), in order to help children with suspected developmental delays get the
      services they need.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Disparities exist in early identification of developmental disabilities, particularly for
      families from low-income and/or racial ethnic minority backgrounds. As WIC has frequent
      contact with children and families in the first five years of life, it is optimally
      positioned to play a unique role in early identification of developmental disabilities.
      However, WIC staff are not formally trained in child development outside of program's primary
      focus on nutrition and supporting the feeding relationship nor is formal screening for
      potential developmental delays an allowable WIC expense. In our prior research Oregon WIC
      staff reported being frequently asked by parents about potential concerns yet they also
      reported not being well connected to pediatric primary care, Part C Early Intervention (EI),
      or other resources who could further assess these concerns. In this study the investigators
      propose to design and pilot test a 2-part intervention to enhance the link between WIC and
      early childhood resources. The 2-part intervention includes: (1) WIC staff training delivered
      at the Local Agency which will: build staff confidence in discussing developmental concerns
      with families, familiarize staff with the CDC Learn the Signs Act Early (LTSAE) material
      which may be used to support those conversations, provide easy tips for encouraging early
      language and literacy development with parents, and study procedures (2) the creation of a
      standardized, direct, closed-loop referral process from WIC to EI for families with an
      identified concern who agree to the referral. EI will notify the child's primary care
      provider of the referral as per usual EI protocol. A referral form has been approved by the
      Oregon Department of Education (ODE) to support the direct referral from WIC to EI, meeting
      all ODE FERPA requirements. In addition, a data use agreement has been approved by ODE to
      allow the study team to access data on referred children to determine if they completed
      further assessment and the given diagnosis (if any). While our primary quantitative outcomes
      of interest are the number of children with a potential developmental concern who are
      referred directly from WIC to EI, the timing of follow-up assessment by EI from that
      referral, services plan &amp; start of services; the project really centers on improving
      processes between organizations who are key stakeholders in referral, assessment, and
      treatment. Therefore, secondary outcomes include feasibility and acceptability of the
      intervention amongst WIC staff, EI staff and primary care providers Upon completion of the
      study the investigators hope to apply our findings to scale up the WIC staff training and
      closed-loop referral process to take it Statewide. If successful the investigators will
      disseminate findings through the National WIC Association to encourage other State and Tribal
      WIC Authorities to adopt our procedures as best practices.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The primary subject population of interest are Women, Infants, &amp; Children families who
             in the course of a WIC visit identify a potential developmental concern and agree to a
             direct referral from WIC to Early Intervention to further assess that concern. To be
             eligible for the study, the parent/guardian must speak English or Spanish. The child
             with the identified concern must be under 54 months of age as the investigators will
             need to follow the child for 6 months to determine initial outcomes and children are
             no longer eligible for WIC after their 5th birthday.

        WIC staff at the 4 intervention agencies, EI staff in the 4 communities in which the 4
        intervention WIC Local Agencies are located, and primary care providers (PCPs) who have had
        a patient referred to EI directly from WIC will all be invited to participate in a
        telephone interview to give their perspective on the process. The only staff inclusion
        requirement is that these staff are currently working in their professional role in the
        county studied.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Family speaks language that isn't English or Spanish. Child is older than 54 months.

        Staff does not work in their professional role in the county studied.
