      This study evaluates the feasibility and usability of continuous wireless vital sign
      monitoring of well newborns during their birth hospitalization.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is conducted for the purposes of understanding the feasibility and acceptability
      of routine wireless continuous monitoring on healthy newborns as a standard practice &amp; its
      effect on existing workflows and as a future tool for the early detection of undiagnosed
      problems. All infants will receive routine newborn nursing care .

      Once alarm limits have been determined, the monitoring data will be analyzed in real time and
      out of range vital signs will alert the nurse to perform standard assessment of the newborn.

      Nurse and parents will complete surveys regarding their experience with continuous vital sign
      monitoring.

    <description>TAM questionnaires will be distributed to the nurse taking care of each subject at the time of discharge of the infant. The questionnaire will include informed consent by the nurse for participation in the research. A similar questionnaire will also be distributed to the mother just prior to discharge.</description>
