    <textblock>
      This is a multicentre, randomised, open-label, parallel-group, active-controlled, phase IV
      study to assess the reduction of daily Symbicort® maintenance to anti-inflammatory reliever
      treatment only in participants with severe eosinophilic asthma on Fasenra® treatment, while
      maintaining asthma control.

    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted at approximately 25 study sites in approximately 3-5 countries.
      The study duration for each participant will be approximately 52-56 weeks. Approximately 240
      participants with severe eosinophilic asthma taking high-dose Inhaled corticosteroids/
      long-acting β2-agonist (ICS/LABA) who have been treated for severe eosinophilic asthma with
      at least 3 consecutive doses of Fasenra® and have clinically responded since the start of
      Fasenra® treatment (defined for the purpose of this study as an Asthma control
      questionnaire-5 item (ACQ-5 score) &lt;1.5 at Visit 1 and Visit 2) will be enrolled into this
      open-label study. The study consists of a Screening Visit (Visit 1) and 4- to 8-week
      screening and run-in period (to align the randomisation study visit with the next Fasenra®
      injection), a reduction period of 32 weeks, and a 16-week maintenance period.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Provision of informed consent prior to any study-specific procedures.

          2. Patient must be aged 18 years old or above at the time of consenting to study
             participation.

          3. Documented current maintenance treatment with high-dose ICS/LABA.

          4. ACQ-5 score &lt;1.5 at Visit 1.

          5. Treatment with Fasenra® for the indicated diagnosis of severe eosinophilic asthma and
             has received at least 3 consecutive doses (&gt;8 weeks) prior to Visit 1.

          6. Male or female.

          7. Negative serum pregnancy test at Visit 1 for women of childbearing potential (WOCBP).

          8. WOCBP must agree to use a highly effective method of birth control (confirmed by the
             Investigator) from randomisation throughout the study duration and within 16 weeks
             after the last dose of study treatment. Highly effective forms of birth control
             include:

               -  Combined (oestrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated
                  with inhibition of ovulation-oral, intravaginal, or transdermal.

               -  Progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of
                  ovulation-oral, injectable, or implantable.

               -  Intrauterine device (IUD).

               -  Intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS).

               -  Bilateral tubal occlusion.

               -  Sexual abstinence, ie, refraining from heterosexual intercourse (the reliability
                  of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the
                  clinical study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient).

               -  Vasectomised sexual partner (provided that partner is the sole sexual partner of
                  the WOCBP study patient and that the vasectomised partner has received medical
                  assessment of the surgical success).

        Women not of childbearing potential are defined as women who are either permanently
        sterilized (hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral salpingectomy), or who are
        postmenopausal. Women will be considered postmenopausal if they have been amenorrhoeic for
        ≥12 months prior to the planned date of randomisation without an alternative medical cause.

        The following age-specific requirements apply:

          -  Women &lt;50 years old will be considered postmenopausal if they have been amenorrhoeic
             for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal treatment and have
             follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels in the postmenopausal range. Until FSH or
             luteinizing hormone is documented to be within menopausal range, treat the patient as
             WOCBP.

          -  Women ≥50 years old will be considered postmenopausal if they have been amenorrhoeic
             for 12 months or more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatment.

        For randomisation at Visit 2, patients should fulfil the following criteria:

          1. ACQ-5 &lt;1.5 at Visit 2.

          2. No increase (worsening) in ACQ-5 of at least ≥0.5 units between Visit 1 and Visit 2
             compared to baseline.

          3. No asthma exacerbation (see Section 8.1.3) between Visit 1 and Visit 2.

          4. No use of Ventolin® for symptom worsening in &gt;3 out of the 7 days prior to Visit 2.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. As judged by the Investigator, any evidence of a severe or serious treatment-related
             AE during Fasenra® treatment which in the Investigator's opinion makes it undesirable
             for the patient to participate in the study.

          2. History of exacerbation requiring systemic corticosteroids or hospitalisation during
             the last 3 months prior to Visit 1 or during the run-in period.

          3. Clinically important pulmonary disease other than asthma (eg, active lung infection,
             Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), bronchiectasis, pulmonary fibrosis,
             cystic fibrosis), or ever been diagnosed with pulmonary or systemic disease, other
             than asthma, that are associated with elevated peripheral eosinophil counts (eg,
             allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis/mycosis, Churg-Strauss syndrome,
             hypereosinophilic syndrome).

          4. Current smokers or former smokers with a smoking history ≥20 pack/years.

             treatment administration.

         16. It is recommended to allow allergen immunotherapy provided it is stable for at least
             30 days prior to Visit 1 and there is no anticipated change during the treatment
             period. Allergen immunotherapy should not be administered on the same day as study
