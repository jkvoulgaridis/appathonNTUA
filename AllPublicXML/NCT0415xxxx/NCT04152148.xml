      1. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of
           BAT4306F in patients with CD20-positive B-cell lymphoma, when the injection dosage
           escalates, to ultimately determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), dose-limiting
           toxicity (DLT), and recommended dosage for phase II clinical studies ( RP2D);

        2. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of BAT4306F(for injection);

        3. To evaluate the immunogenicity profile of BAT4306F(for injection);

        4. To evaluate the efficacy profile of BAT4306F (for injection);Using the Lugano criteria
           (2014), the 2008 IWCLL efficacy evaluation criteria, and the 2014 IWWM-7 efficacy
           evaluation criteria were used to evaluate the efficacy of related diseases at week 7,
           week 13, and week 19. The index of evaluation was ORR (including CR, PR, SD and PD, ORR
           is the proportion of patients with CR and PR).

        marrow flow cytology results.) 2) Liver function is basically normal: ALT ≤ 2.5×ULN, AST ≤
        2.5×ULN, TBIL ≤ 1.5×ULN (except for liver invasion. Patients with B-NHL-related autoimmune
        hemolytic anemia, TBIL is not subject to this limit); 3) Renal function is basically
        normal: creatinine ≤ 1.5×ULN, or creatinine clearance ≥ 60mL/min; 4) The conventional
        coagulation examinations is basically normal: INR ≤ 1.5×ULN, APTT does not exceed the

        contraceptive procedure must be taken or during menopause or use of an effective
        contraceptive method during the study period and within 12 months of the study drug
        discontinuation, and avoid breastfeeding during the study period and within 12 months of
        the study drug discontinuation.
