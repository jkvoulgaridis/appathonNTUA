  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study medicine is a potential future treatment for schizophrenia, an illness that affects
      the way that people think, feel or behave. It is not clear what causes schizophrenia, but
      it's been linked to chemical imbalance in the brain. It is hoped that the study medicine will
      activate specific sites in the brain to help correct that imbalance. Current treatments for
      schizophrenia don't work very well and can cause unpleasant side effects. It is hoped that
      the study medicine will work better, and have fewer side effects than existing medicines.

      In this 2 part study (Part A: up to 40 healthy male subjects and up to 8 healthy female
      subjects, Part B: up to 32 healthy male subjects) the primary aim is to assess how safe the
      study medicine is in healthy men and women.

      This study will be in 2 parts, as follows:

      Part A will assess single doses of AUT00201 and Part B will assess multiple doses. Part A
      will be divided into 3 sub-parts: Part A1 will assess single ascending doses in healthy men,
      Part A2 will assess single ascending doses in healthy women, and Part A3 will assess the
      effect of food on the PK of AUT00201 in healthy men.

      A pharmaceutical company, Autifony Therapeutics Limited, is funding the study. The study will
      take place at 1 centre in London.
