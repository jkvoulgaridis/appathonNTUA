      Effectiveness of Early Enteral Feeding With High Protein Polymeric Formula Versus Oligomeric
      Formula Versus 5% Dextrose Solution in Clinical Improvement and Malnutrition on Intensive
      Care Unit Patients

      Background :

      Critically ill patients are physiologically unstable, often have complex hypermetabolic
      responses to trauma. These patients are facing a high risk of death, multi-organ failure, and
      prolonged ventilator use. Nutrition is one of therapy for critical illness, however, patients
      often experience malnutrition caused by disease severity, delays in feeding, and
      miscalculation of calorie needs, therefore, appropriate management of enteral feeding formula
      should be done in preventing malnutrition and improve clinical outcome during intensive
      treatment.

      Objective:

      This study aims to evaluate clinical improvement and malnutrition in critically ill
      participants under two different early enteral feeding formulas versus parenteral feeding

      Methodology :

      A three-arm randomized trial is performed (parenteral (5% Dextrose), and enteral high-protein
      polymeric formula, and oligomeric formula.) at the Intensive Care Unit in Wahidin
      Sudirohusodo Hospital, Makassar, Indonesia. The enteral feedings are given through a
      nasogastric tube within 24-48 hours after intensive care unit (ICU) admission as well as the
      parenteral group. A meticulous record of the calories and protein of intake is maintained for
      3 days follow up including clinical parameters. The changes between pre and post-intervention
      of clinical parameters and nutrition scoring are assessed as the outcome of the intervention

      Hypothesis :

      Enteral feeding with High Protein Formula provides a better clinical outcome and less
      malnutrition event in comparison to 5% Dextrose and Oligomeric Formula

      Procedure :

        1. All patients admitted to the Intensive care unit will undergo eligibility screening

        2. Baseline assessments will be performed to eligible participants upon the first 24 hours
           including :

             1. anthropometric data (age, gender, height (participant in the supine position),
                ideal body weight (IBW), Mid-Upper-Arm Circumference (MUAC), and primary admission
                diagnosis (Traumatic Brain Injury/TBI or non-TBI).

             2. Laboratory assessment including platelets, white blood cells, lymphocytes, serum
                creatinine levels, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels, albumin, serum potassium
                levels, serum sodium levels, serum pH, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide, and
                partial pressure of oxygen (PO2)

             3. Scoring of Severity-of-illness using the laboratory parameters and clinical
                parameters under SOFA, APACHE II Score and NUTRIC score elements

        3. The allocation of the participants is performed through simple randomization with the
           masking of the investigator.

        4. the intervention will be done according to the protocol of each arm.

        5. Measurement of outcomes according to the time frame by the intensive care and
           nutritionist team.

        6. Data analysis including descriptive statistics and outcome analysis using paired t-test
           or Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Differences in mean values between the 3 groups are
           compared using the ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis test. A p-value &lt;0.05 is considered
           statistically significant.

    <measure>Nutrition Risk in the Critically Ill (NUTRIC) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>3 days after intervention initiated</time_frame>
    <description>The Nutrition Risk in the Critically Ill (NUTRIC) Score is designed to quantify the risk of critically ill patients developing adverse events that may be modified by aggressive nutrition therapy ranging from 1-10. A score between 0-5 indicates a low malnutrition risk and 6 above means the patient is associated with worse clinical outcomes (mortality, ventilation) and the most likely to benefit from aggressive nutrition therapy.</description>

    <time_frame>Upon admission to Intensive Care Unit and 3 days after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The sequential organ failure assessment score (SOFA score) is a clinical scoring to determine the extent of a person's organ function or rate of failure during a stay in an intensive care unit (ICU) including the assessment of respiratory, cardiovascular, hepatic, coagulation, renal and neurological systems. The elements including PaO2/FiO2 (mmHg), Glasgow Coma Scale, Mean arterial pressure OR administration of vasopressors required, Bilirubin Level, Platelets, and Creatinine (mg/dl) [μmol/L] (or urine output). Each domain has scale from 0-4, with a total score for all domains is 24. Higher number indicates severe organ failure.</description>

    <description>Acute Physiology, Age, Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) Score II is an ICU-scoring system to measure the risk and severity of the disease, including :
AaDO2 or PaO2 (depending on FiO2) Temperature (rectal) Mean arterial pressure pH arterial Heart rate Respiratory rate Sodium (serum) Potassium (serum) Creatinine Hematocrit White blood cell count Glasgow Coma Scale. An integer score from 0 to 71 is computed based on measurements above; higher scores correspond to more severe disease and a higher risk of death</description>
