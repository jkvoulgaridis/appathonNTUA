    <time_frame>Subjects will followed for up to 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Alcohol Craving Questionnaire-Short Form has 12 questions about alcohol craving which are each scored 1-7, then summed for a weekly score between 7 and 84, with higher scores indicating greater craving.</description>

    <measure>Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II)</measure>
    <time_frame>Subjects will be followed for up to 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Beck Depression Inventory II consists of 21 questions assessing depression symptoms answered with scores between 0-3, summed for a weekly total score between 0 and 63, higher scores indicate more depression.</description>

    <measure>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Subjects will be followed for up to 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, modified for weekly administration, consists of 9 questions about sleep habits which are answered on a scale of 0-3. Results are sorted into 7 sub scales re-scored 0-3, then sub scales are summed for a weekly total score between 0 and 21, with higher scores indicating greater sleep impairment.</description>
