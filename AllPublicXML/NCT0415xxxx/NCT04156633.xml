    <textblock>
      In this before-after study, different new methods for bacterial species identification from
      positive blood cultures will be compared towards historic controls. All samples are analyzed
      within the routine workflow for bacterial species identification and antibiotic resistance
      profiling. Patients with positive blood cultures from 2016 to 2018 receiving a conventional
      identification methods (controls) will be compared to patients from 2018 and 2019 with a new
      identification method (cases). The conventional identification method consisted in general of
      an over-night subculture and subsequent identification of the bacterial pathogen using either
      biochemical profiling or Matrix-assisted Laser-Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight
      (MALDI-TOF MS). The new identification of positive blood cultures methods include (i) either
      the newly introduced Biofire FilmArray© Blood Culture Identification (BCID) panel or (ii) in
      a subset of patients whole genome sequencing (WGS) approaches.

    <description>Patients with positive blood cultures from 2018 and 2019 receiving a new identification method (cases). The new identification method is the Biofire FilmArray© Blood Culture Identification (BCID) panel, a polymerase chain reaction-based method, performed directly from the positive blood culture without the need of subculture to reach single bacterial colonies. The assays allow to identify a panel of 20 most commonly Gram-positive and -negative bacteria and yeast causing blood stream infections. It also allows to determine three resistance genes (mecA, vanA/B and KPC).</description>

    <description>Patients with positive blood cultures from 2018 and 2019 receiving a new identification method (cases). The new identification of positive blood cultures methods in a subset of patients is a whole genome sequencing approach. This so called shotgun metagenomic approach allows to sequence the whole genome (WGS) of pathogens and thereby potentially detect every potential pathogen and also resistance and virulence gene.</description>
