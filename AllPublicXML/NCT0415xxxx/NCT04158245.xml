  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot phase 2 single-arm study, of men with metastatic castration-resistant
      prostate cancer (mCRPC). Patients will be treated with abiraterone acetate 1000 mg daily plus
      prednisone 5 mg (or dexamethasone 0.5 mg) daily for mCRPC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is a hormonally-driven disease and androgens are key in the growth of both
      normal prostate and prostate cancer cells. Once mCRPC is evident, most patients receive a
      second-generation hormonal therapy to further suppress the synthesis or androgens
      (abiraterone) and to block androgen receptor (AR) activation, nuclear translocation and DNA
      binding (enzalutamide).

      Conventional imaging of prostate cancer has limitations in staging, restaging after
      biochemical relapse, and response assessment. Functional imaging with positron emission
      tomography (PET) can target various aspects of tumor biology and is clearly superior in the
      detection of extra-prostatic disease. 18F-fluciclovine is a synthetic amino acid transported
      across mammalian cell membranes by amino acid transporters that are upregulated in prostate
      cancer cells.

      18F-fluciclovine is approved for PET imaging to identify sites of prostate cancer recurrence
      in men with rising prostate specific antigen (PSA) following prior definitive treatment. This
      study describes the changes in 18F-fluciclovine PET scan and compare these results with PSA
      and conventional computerized tomography (CT) and bone scans, in mCRPC patients treated with
      abiraterone acetate-prednisone.

    <description>The use of 18F-fluciclovine PET scanning will allow a more sensitive assessment of mCRPC patients at the initiation of systemic therapy and changes observed in 18F-fluciclovine PET will correlate better with the serologic changes in PSA, allowing superior disease monitoring, as compared to conventional imaging modalities. In addition, 18F-fluciclovine PET will detect heterogeneity in disease response and thus identify potential lesions amenable to targeted therapy.</description>
