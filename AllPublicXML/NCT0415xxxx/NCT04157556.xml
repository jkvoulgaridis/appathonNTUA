  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play a critical role in the remodeling and regeneration of
      skeletal muscle. Studies which investigate exercise and effects of MMPs and tissue inhibitors
      of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMPs) are contradictory. Also the role of MMP9 -1562 C/T and
      TIMP1 372 T/C polymorphisms on exercise are unclear. In accordance with this conditions the
      hypothesis of the study are as follows:

        1. Levels of basal serum MMP9 and TIMP1 are different between athletes (volleyball,
           basketball, handball) and sedentary people.

        2. Levels of serum MMP9 and TIMP1 response to maximal exercise are different between
           athletes (volleyball, basketball, handball) and sedentary people .

        3. Relationship between levels of serum MMP9 and TIMP1 response to maximal exercise are
           different between athletes (volleyball, basketball, handball) and sedentary people.

        4. Levels of basal serum MMP9 and TIMP1 are related to MMP9 -1562 C/T and TIMP1 372 T/C
           polymorphisms.

        5. Relationship between levels of serum MMP9 and TIMP1 response to maximal exercise and
           MMP9 -1562 C/T and TIMP1 372 T/C polymorphisms are different between athletes
           (volleyball, basketball, handball) and sedentary people.

    <description>The test is a standard test battery with progressively increasing speeds. After every 40-m run (2x20 m), active rest is performed by walking or jogging at a distance of 10 m (2x5 m). for 10 seconds. Participants are trying to adjust their speed according to incoming audio signals.The test is terminated when the participants can not reach the signal twice. The test ends in 10-20 minutes depending on the level of participants.
