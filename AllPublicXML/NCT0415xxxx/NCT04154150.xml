  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project seeks to identify the acute and longer-term impact of a single dose of
      intravenous ketamine among suicidal patients referred for psychiatric consultation/liaison in
      the medical inpatient setting. The investigators will then test whether ketamine's rapid
      effects can be extended by introducing helpful information delivered by a computer-based
      training protocol. This work could ultimately lead to the ability to treat suicidality more
      efficiently and with broader dissemination by rapidly priming the brain for helpful forms of
      learning.
