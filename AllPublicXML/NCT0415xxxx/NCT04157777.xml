      Aims and objectives:This experimental study was conducted to determine the effect of perineum
      massage with olive oil performed in the second period of the delivery on travay duration,
      episiotomy requirement and perineum tears in term pregnant women.

      Background: Perineal trauma that may occur during labor may pose a critical risk both for
      mother's health and her quality of life.

      Design: A randomized controlled trial. This study adhered to CONSORT 2010 checklist
      guidelines for qualitative research reporting Method: Among women who applied to Maternity
      Hospital 350 pregnant women were assigned to massage group while other 350 were to control
      group. Participants in both groups filled out an information form including socio-demographic
      characteristics. Perineum massage with olive oil in the second period of delivery was
      performed to massage group. In the control group, no other interventions except for
      applications performed routinely in the delivery room were done.

      Results: Episiotomy was done in 34.3% of massage group while in 48.6% of control group.
      Percentage of being performed episiotomy in the massage group significantly decreased
      (p&lt;0.05).Tear appeared in 17.7% of the massage group while in 38.0% of the controls.
      Percentage of tear formation in the massage group significantly decreased (p&lt;0.05). No
      statistically significant difference was found between the second period of the delivery of
      massage and control group. All of the pregnant women in the massage group and midwives who
      performed massage were satisfied with perineum massage with olive oil in the delivery and
      stated that they would suggest and perform this application Conclision: Regarding the results
      of this study and those of other studies, perineal massage during the second stage of labor
      can reduce the need for episiotomy, and avoid perineal injuries, and perineal pain.

      This study provides useful information to clinician and researchers when determining
      practices such as postnatal standing up in early period,reduced episiotomy requirement,
      mother's health ,her quality of life, shorter hospital stay and perineal trauma.

      What does this paper contribute to the wider global clinical community?

        -  Perineum massage performed with olive oil in delivery are an effective, inexpensive,
           simple, and well‐tolerated way to improve intact perineum..

        -  Perineum massage performed with olive oil in delivery are safe and associated with
           mother's health and her quality of life and shorter hospital stay.

    <textblock>
      The idea that birth process should be undergone minimal intervention has been spreading.
      Unlike the abovementioned idea, the fact that episiotomy practice -especially on the
      primiparous pregnant women- has almost been a routine in Turkey and it has been practiced
      -even if it is not necessary- despite the fact that itprolongs the post-partum healing and
      increases perineum trauma risks.

      Perineal trauma is described as the damage that occurs spontaneously or due to a surgical
      incision or episiotomy during the labor in the genital region. Perineal trauma that may occur
      during labor may pose a critical risk both for mother's health and her quality of life.
      Perineal trauma is accompanied with short term or long term morbidity during and after birth
      and affects sexuality and physical image of the women negatively. Some of these effects are
      painful sexual intercourse, fecal and urinary incontinence and continuous perineal pain.

      Perineal massage performed by using an oily substance that has lubricant properties is
      described as the massage made on the muscles around the vagina and its tissues. The
      massage,which is thought to haveimportant effects onelasticity of the tissues and muscles and
      the rehabilitation is thought to provide benefits for vaginal births due to the similar
      useful effects on the tissues and muscles around the perineal. Perineal massage with
      lubricant is a poten-tial therapeutic approach implemented at the second stage of delivery.

      Background Perineal tissues should be pulled aside to allow the neonate exit from the
      vagina.Studies regarding the perineal pulling and massaging in the second stage of labor for
      relaxing the perineum and possibly preventing perineal laceration and episiotomy, have
      concluded that the perineal pulling and massaging increase possibility of childbirth with an
      intact perineum. Perineal massage increases elasticity and blood supply to the perineum and
      leads to easier pulling and less pain during childbirth. It also reduces the possibility of
      perineal laceration, the need to episiotomy, and postpartum perineal pain.

      Aims:

      The aim of the present research was to determine the effects of massage performed by using
      olive oil on travail duration, episiotomy requirement and perineal tears for the term
      pregnancies during second stage of the labor.

      COLLOUT: Perineal trauma that may occur during labor may pose a critical risk both for
      mother's health and her quality of life.

    <description>Among women who applied to Maternity Hospital 350 pregnant women were assigned to massage group. Participants in massage group filled out an information form including socio-demographic characteristics. Perineum massage with olive oil in the second period of delivery was performed to massage group.In massage group when they progressed to full dilatation of the cervix, the midwife inserted two fingers inside vagina and using a sweeping motion gently stretched the perineum with lubricant 5 up to 10 minutes, in and between mother's pushing in the second stage of labour.</description>

    <description>Among women who applied to Maternity Hospital 350 pregnant women were assigned to control group. Participants in control group filled out an information form including socio-demographic characteristics.And, no other interventions except for applications performed routinely in the delivery room were done.In control group just Ritgen Maneuver was applied. At last, we com-pared the rate of intact perineum, episiotomy and laceration, mean duration of the second stage of labor and Apgar score in 1 and 5 minutes be-tween two groups.</description>

    <description>Descriptive form used for data collection included questions about women's sociodemographic features, medical and obstetric history and previous and present birthsof women participated in the study.
The Reeda Scale The scale is consisted of five parameters of healing: Redness, Edema, Ecchymosis, Discharge Approximation.
Pregnant women who came to the delivery room and met the criteria were randomly selected and assigned to experimental and control group according to age and educational status.
There was not any change in the birth process of the delivery room during data collection and the pregnant women received routine care and treatments.
REEDA scale was administered by other midwives who worked at the puerperal room where pregnant women stayed after birth and did not know their groups because those who gave vaginal birth were early discharged from the hospital as they could answer only the first three parameters of REEDA scale.</description>
