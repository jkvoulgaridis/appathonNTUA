  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incorporation of PD-L1 testing into clinical practice has progressed at a rapid pace, and
      now offers an additional line of therapy for eligible patients with nonsmall cell lung
      cancer. The assay used to detect circulating levels of PD-L1 currently requires core
      biopsies, and is not approved to be used for specimens collected through a needle based
      cytological technique. Though endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial needle
      aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) has markedly improved the manner in which patients are diagnosed and
      staged for lung cancer, alternative means of tissue collection may be mandatory to offer
      patients access to newer lines of therapy such as PD-L1 inhibition. EBUS-miniforceps biopsy
      may allow bronchoscopists to obtain core biopsy specimens through the technique of
      endobronchial ultrasound, so that more invasive approaches such as surgery may be avoided.
      Feasibility using this approach would indicate that all patients being staged with
      endobronchial ultrasound procedures would be candidates for PD-L1 testing and potential
      therapy.

      This study is proposed to evaluate the feasibility of using endobronchial ultrasound guided
      miniforceps biopsy (EBUS-MFB) to acquire tissue that is adequate for PD-L1 testing.
      Feasibility in this study is defined as the ability to obtain adequate material during EBUS
      procedures to perform PD-L1 testing.

    <description>Standard of care convex-probe endobronchial ultrasound and transbronchial needle aspiration followed by rapid on-site evaluation. If evaluation yields a diagnosis of nonsmall cell lung cancer then EBUS-MFB will be performed.
With the EBUS bronchoscope, 6 needle punctures will be made into the targeted lymph node with the 22 gauge aspiration needle. The needle will be removed and the 1mm miniforceps will be passed through the working channel of the EBUS-bronchoscope into the targeted lymph node through the puncture site made using the 22 gauge needle using continuous endobronchial ultrasound guidance. The miniforceps will be used to obtain a core biopsy of the targeted lymph node - 8 core biopsies will be obtained from each targeted lymph node using this technique</description>
