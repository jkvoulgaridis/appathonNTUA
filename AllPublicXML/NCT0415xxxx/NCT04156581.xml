  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Enhanced recovery pathways (ERPs) emphasize evidence-based, multimodal anesthetic and
      analgesic choices to minimize opioid consumption while providing adequate pain control after
      surgery. Although ERPs for spine surgery are now being described, few pathways include
      regional analgesia. The Erector Spinae Plane Block (ESPB) may represent a novel opportunity
      to incorporate regional analgesia into ERPs for spine surgery. To date, there is minimal data
      to support the utility of ESPB in spine surgery, and this block has not yet been evaluated in
      complex spine surgery.

      This study seeks to see whether ESPB will reduce opioid consumption and pain scores, and
      improve patient recovery during the first 24 hours after complex spine surgery when included
      in a comprehensive ERP.
