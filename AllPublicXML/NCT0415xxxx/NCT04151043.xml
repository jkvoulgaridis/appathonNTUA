    <textblock>
      The study investigates analgesic effects of expectations and deep brain stimulation on
      chronic and evoked pain in patients with Parkinson's disease.

      The study includes patients with Parkinson's disease that are exposed to pain stimuli through
      injection of hypertonic saline. During pain induction and chronic pain evaluation deep brain
      stimulation treatment is regulated. Pain stimuli and regulation of deep brain stimulation are
      accompanied by verbal suggestions as to the analgesic effect of deep brain stimulation or no
      suggestions. During the test session patients evaluate their chronic and evoked pain and
      expectations.

      The study procedure is repeated on two separate test days to investigate pain during deep
      brain stimulation treatment with or without verbal suggestions. All participants will
      complete all study conditions with no suggestions and verbal suggestions, respectively.
