      This is a prospective, controlled, single-center clinical study to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of the Laser Scleral Microporation Procedure.

      Laser Scleral Microporation Procedure is a treatment to restore visual and accommodative
      function in presbyopic patients. The subjects are bilaterally treated with the Laser Scleral
      Microporation procedure.

    <description>The slitlamp examination is one examination to analyse the integrity of the eye structures.
With the slitlamp the ophthalmologist can observe the eyes stereoscopically. A focussed slit of light, which can be width-adjusted, is projected on the eye to be examined. The investigator observes this projection on the eye through a reflected light microscope. The slitlamp is used to observe the anterior and posterior part of the eye, including cornea, lens and anterior chamber. By dilating the pupil the fundus can also be examined. Following conditions shall be examined with the slitlamp:
Corneal clarity
anterior chamber cells
anterior chamber flare
lens grading using the LOCS III card
Conjunctival/scleral vessel injection
Degree of choroidal hue
Conjunctival edema
Conjunctival hemorrhages

          5. Previous corneal surgery (e.g., corneal transplant, DSAEK/DSEK, lamellar

             correction (i.e., no evident effect of reduced accommodative range);

          9. Use of systemic or ocular medications that may affect vision (the use of any miotic or
             cycloplegic agent is specifically contraindicated);

         10. Acute or chronic disease or illness that could increase the operative risk or confound
