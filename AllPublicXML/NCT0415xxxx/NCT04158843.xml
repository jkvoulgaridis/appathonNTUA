      A Randomized, Open Label, Phase III Trial to Evaluate Radical Local Treatment versus
      Palliative Treatment for Breast Cancer Patients with Primary Ipsilateral Humerus or Sternum
      Oligometastasis
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, and multicenter study to compare the radical local
      treatment versus palliative treatment for breast cancer patients with primary ipsilateral
      humerus or sternum oligometastasis.

      183 subjects will be randomized divided into two groups (experimental group and control
      group) at a ratio of 2 to 1.

      Control group: Palliative treatment. No radical surgical resection or radiotherapy is
      performed in this group. But palliative internal fixation or radiotherapy for pain relief is
      permitted. Moreover, systemic chemotherapy, endocrine therapy and targeted therapy are
      allowed.

      Experimental group：Radical local treatment. Radical resection is performed, and the cutting
      edge is negative, or radical local radiotherapy is feasible (cumulative radiotherapy dose is
      greater than or equal to 50Gy). Systemic endocrine therapy and targeted therapy are allowed
      after radical local therapy. However, whether systemic chemotherapy should be used is
      determined by clinicians according to clinical experience or guidelines.

    <description>OS is defined as time from randomization to death for any cause. If there is no death reported for a subject before the date cutoff for OS analysis, OS will be censored at the last contact date at which the subject is known to be alive.
For patients who had not died up to the cut-off date, the date they were last known to be alive was derived from the patient status records, the trial completion record, radiological imaging assessments, the study treatment termination record, and the randomization date.</description>
