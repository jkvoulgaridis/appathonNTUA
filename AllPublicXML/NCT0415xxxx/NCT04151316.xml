  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When the tooth is severely compromised, it needs a prosthetic crown. The tooth is prepared to
      allow the housing of the prosthetic crown without difficulty. This study aims to compare two
      different types of preparations to see with which of the two the gingival tissue reacts best.

    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Gingival thickness (GT) measured in millimetres in the mid-buccal area of the tooth, at the central point between the gingival margin and the gingival mucus junction (MGJ) using an endodontic specillus with a silicone stop put in contact with the soft tissue until the specillus reaches the hard surface. At the time of the initial measurement of the periodontal parameters, i.e.</description>

    <measure>variation of gingival thickness digital</measure>
    <time_frame>The impression is taken before the final impression (t1), at 3 months (t2), 6 months (t3), 12 months (t4) and the 3D images are compared using software to evaluate the variation of the soft tissue.</time_frame>
    <description>At the time of the initial measurement of the periodontal parameters, i.e. at the time 0 before the prosthetic preparation of the tooth element, a digital impression is taken in order to obtain a 3D image of the tissues around the tooth element to be rehabilitated.</description>

    <description>Aesthetic evaluation of soft tissue is performed with the Pink Aesthetic Score/White Aesthetic Score (PES/WES). The PES evaluation consists of 7 variables: mesial papilla, distal papilla, soft tissue level, soft tissue contour, alveolar process deficiency, soft tissue texture and color.
Mucosa is evaluated with WES, which consists of 5 variables: tooth shape, volume, color, surface texture, translucency/characterization.
The mesial and distal papillas are measured for absence, completeness, incompleteness, while the other variables are measured by comparing them with the contralateral teeth in terms of vertical level (score of 2), small (≤1 mm) discrepancy (score of 1), or large (≥1 mm) discrepancy (score of 0). The maximum score will be 14 for PES and 10 for WES, which will mean a perfect match for soft tissue and hard tissue respectively.</description>

    <measure>Digital valuation of emergency profile</measure>
    <time_frame>The angle of the emergence profile is evaluated first with the temporary (T0 first week) and then with the definitive(T1 after 3 month).</time_frame>
    <description>The prosthetic contour is evaluated with the fingerprint to evaluate the angular width of the emergence profile.
The amplitude of the angle evaluated is that formed between the emergence profile (part of the crown in contact with the soft tissues) and the long axis of the tooth.
The angle of the emergence profile is evaluated by making a digital impression on the plaster model with the crowns inserted in the prosthetic abutment of the master model, first with the temporary and then with the definitive. The unit of measurement expressed by the digital instrument is always the same so it is a single measurement carried out in two different times.</description>

    <measure>Evaluation of the interproximal papilla</measure>
    <time_frame>gap between the most coronal part of the papilla and the point of contact is measured and re-evaluated at 3 months (t2), 6 months (t3), 12 months (t4)</time_frame>
    <description>Once the final crowns have been cemented, the distance between the point of contact and the interproximal papilla is measured.</description>
