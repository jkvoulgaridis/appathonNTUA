  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuroendocrine tumors (NET's) are characterized, among other features, by presence of high
      concentration of somatostatin receptors. In recent years, for purposes of Positron Emission
      Tomography (PET) imaging, somatostatin receptor ligands have been labelled with the positron
      emitting radioisotope 68Ga to form molecules that bind to these somatostatin receptors that
      are present in high concentration in NET's and in low concentrations, if at all, in normal
      tissues. In the last 10-15 years, radioactively labelled versions of these molecules have
      been used for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes in the management of patients with
      NET's.

      The main goal of this study is to assess the feasibility of performing dynamic 68Ga-DOTATATE
      PET in the PET/MRI system and analyzing the effect of diffusion and perfusion over Ki values.

      Working hypotheses

        1. The PET/MR system will provide dynamic PET images of at least comparable quality
           compared to PET/CT. Dynamic PET/MR will be feasible, with the 45 minute dynamic PET
           acquisition occurring during the MR sequences, eliminating the need for the patient to
           undergo two separate lengthy studies.

        2. Diffusion and perfusion parameters extracted from MRI sequences will provide information
           that improves the process of Ki evaluation.

        3. The use of advanced statistics methodologies, such as those used in radiomics, to
           correlate Ki data with diffusion and perfusion data will provide a quantification tool
           that will improve staging, prediction and monitoring after treatment.

        4. Parametric Patlak Ki images calculated from the dynamic series of PET images will show
           better contrast between tumors and normal tissue, as compared to contrast in the
           conventional static images obtained from the last time frame of the dynamic image
           series. Tumors identified on the static PET image will be visualized at least as well on
           Patlak Ki images, and possibly additional tumor foci may be identified. MRI should
           assist in confirming and interpreting such findings.

      Research plan Population: 50 patients with NETs that have evidence of at least one abdominal
      lesion with diameter greater than 2cm. All patients will be aged 18 years or older of both
      sexes.

      Inclusion criteria: Patients with confirmed NET. Exclusion criteria: Patients younger than 18
      years; pregnancy; other known active malignancy; contraindication to MRI tests or intravenous
      contrast agents.

    <description>The patient will be positioned in the PET/MR with the field of view of the PET including the abdomen, and IV administration of 68Ga-DOTATATE will take place, with initiation of dynamic PET simultaneous with start of IV injection. Dynamic PET imaging will consist of 22 time frames of increasing durations (6 x 10, 3 x 20, 3 x 60, 5 x 180, and 5 x 300 s). The dynamic PET examination will be followed by a whole-body PET/MR scan ranging from the proximal femur to the base of the skull (3 min per bed position) starting at 60 min after injection. MR will be used for attenuation correction of the PET images of the abdomen/pelvis and whole-body. MR protocol will include three plane fast spin echo T2 weighted, DWI, DCE and ASL. The addition of PET/MR to the standard use of PET/CT adds no radiation exposure.</description>
