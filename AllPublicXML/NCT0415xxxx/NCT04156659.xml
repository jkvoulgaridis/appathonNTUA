    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, multi-center, phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      tisagenlecleucel in Chinese pediatric and young adult subjects with relapsed or refractory
      B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)
    </textblock>

    <textblock>
      The study will have the following sequential phases for all subjects:

        -  Screening

        -  Pre-Treatment (Cell Product Preparation and Lymphodepleting Chemotherapy)

        -  Treatment and Follow-up Tisagenlecleucel infusion should occur within 16 weeks of
           informed consent. The total duration of the study is 5 years. After tisagenlecluecel
           infusion, efficacy will be assessed monthly for the first 6 months, then quarterly up to
           2 years and semi-annually afterwards up to 5 years, or until the subject relapses.

    <description>Evaluate the efficacy of tisagenlecleucel using overall remission rate (ORR) during the 3 months after tisagenlecleucel administration as assessed by the investigator. The ORR is defined as the proportion of subjects with a best overall disease response of Complete Remission (CR) or Complete Remission with Incomplete blood count recovery (CRi), where the best overall disease response is defined as the best disease response recorded from tisagenlecleucel infusion until the start of new anticancer therapy. Best response will be assigned according to the following order:
CR
CRi
No response (NR)

    <description>DOR is defined as the duration from the date when the response criteria of CR or CRi is first met to the date of relapse or death due to underlying cancer.

    <description>RFS is measured by the time from achievement of CR or CRi whatever occurs first to relapse or death due to any cause during CR or CRi.
In case a subject does not have relapse or death due to any cause prior to data cutoff, RFS will be censored at the date of the last adequate assessment on or prior to the earliest censoring event.</description>

    <description>EFS is the time from date of tisagenlecleucel infusion to the earliest of of the following: death from any cause after remission, relapse or treatment failure. In case of treatment failure, the event date will be set to study Day 1 (CHMP 2010). In case a subject does not have an event, as defined above, prior to data cutoff, EFS is censored at the last adequate response assessment date on or prior to the earliest censoring event (except for Stem Cell Transplantation (SCT)).</description>
