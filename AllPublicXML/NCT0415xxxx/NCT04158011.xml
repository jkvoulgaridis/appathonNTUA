  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CAR T cells targeting CD19 have been approved for patients with relapsed or refractory ALL,
      failing two or more prior protocols. Several institutional-based studies with other CAR T
      cells targeting CD19 have demonstrated outstanding response rates in patients with refractory
      disease, and the ability of CAR T cells to clear CNS leukemia. Nevertheless, these cases are
      sparse and have never been reported collectively.

      Here, we aim to retrospectively assess toxicity and long term outcome of patients treated
      with CAR T cells for CNS relapse of ALL.
