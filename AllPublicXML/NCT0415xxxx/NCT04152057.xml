  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pyrotinib combined with
      albumin paclitaxel and trastuzumab in the treatment of Her2-positive early or locally
      advanced breast cancer, and to explore RCB scores and TILs expression and other related
      molecular markers for pyrrole the efficacy of the treatment with pyrotinib.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At present, the treatment mode of breast cancer has gradually turned to the individualized
      comprehensive treatment mode combining systemic therapy and local therapy, and neoadjuvant
      therapy is widely used. Albumin-bound paclitaxel alters the excipients, reduces adverse
      reactions and greatly enhances efficacy, facilitating clinical applications. Studies have
      shown that in the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, drugs containing purple shirts and
      anthracyclines will be the drug of choice. The HER2/erbB2 molecule is an independent
      prognostic factor for breast cancer. About 20%-30% of adenocarcinoma patients have
      amplification/overexpression of HER2 gene. These patients are insensitive to conventional
      therapy and are more prone to recurrence and metastasis. Shorter survival and poorer
      prognosis. Current drugs targeting HER2 targets mainly include macromolecular monoclonal
      antibodies and their conjugates and small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Pyrotinib is
      an irreversible inhibitor of small targets (EGFR and HER2). Compared with trastuzumab, it has
      different sites of action, which may lead to synergy in the treatment of human Her2-positive
      breast cancer.

      The excellent clinical efficacy of dual-targeted neoadjuvant therapy for Her2 positive breast
      cancer, the anti-tumor effect and good tolerance of pyrotinib, we intend to develop a
      pyrotinib combined with albumin paclitaxel and trastuzumab one-arm exploratory clinical study
      of neoadjuvant therapy for Her2-positive early or locally advanced breast cancer with the aim
      of assessing efficacy and safety, and exploring the efficacy of tumor-associated molecular
      markers such as RCB scores and TILs expression for pyrotinib treatment predicting
      effectiveness.

    <description>Preoperative
-Drug: Pyrotinib Maleate Tablets combined with Albumin Paclitaxel and Trastuzumab.
Surgery:Subjects should be evaluated by tumor-enhanced MRI combined with mammary gland ultrasound during the preoperative neoadjuvant administration, and evaluated every 2 cycles. The subjects who were evaluated for CR and PR for the first time should be confirmed after at least 4 weeks. The confirmed tumor assessment cannot change the previously fixed examination time point.
Postoperative
Drug: Epirubicin hydrochloride combined with Cyclophosphamide
At the same time, according to the recommendation of the clinician, choose whether to accept the same anti-HER2 treatment plan before surgery. For patients with tumors positive for estrogen receptor (ER) and/or progesterone receptor (PR), endocrine therapy should be given at the end of adjuvant chemotherapy, and if there is clinical indication at the end of adjuvant chemotherapy, radiotherapy should be given.</description>
