  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Liver donation by a living donor is major surgery and has a profound effect on health-related
      quality of life and psychology. This study aims at evaluating those aspects of a donor for a
      period of five years after surgery.

      Live donor liver transplantation (LDLT) has established itself as a treatment for end-stage
      liver disease but donor safety remains a major issue. It is the responsibility of the
      transplant team to restore donor's health, not only physical, but also mental, social and
      environmental. There is scarcity of long term longitudinal data on donor quality of life.
      Most of the studies are cross sectional which describe the quality of life at certain time
      point and do not take into account of changes that might occur over a period. It is more
      relevant in this scenario, as two persons from a family undergo surgery at the same time,
      which has a profound effect on family dynamics, and restoration towards normalcy goes hand in
      hand with adaptation to a new lifestyle. Another shortcoming of available literature is lack
      of uniform instruments which comprehensively measure the quality of life of live liver donors
      (LLDs). Standardized health related quality of life (HRQOL) instruments such as Short Form
      36(SF 36) or World Health Organization quality of life Brief (WHOQOL-BREF) are not designed
      for LLDs. Moreover, there are several symptoms which might interfere with daily activities
      such as incision site problems , dyspepsia to name a few, but are not distressing enough to
      be reflected on quality of life scores .The aim of current study was to observe the attitude
      of donors pre transplant, quality of life over a period, satisfaction with the donation
      process, their assessment of the health care team, satisfaction with the consent process, and
      change in pattern of symptoms and cosmesis after surgery.

    <description>The body image and cosmesis questionnaire consists of eight questions combined to form two scales: a body image scale and a cosmesis scale. Five questions regarding body image assess patient's perception of their own body and their satisfaction with that perception, while also evaluating patient's attitude toward their bodily appearance. The body image scale ranges from 5 (lowest body image score) to 20 (highest body image score). Three questions regarding the cosmetic result after the operation assess the degree of satisfaction with respect to the physical appearance of the incisional scar. The combined scores of these three questions resulted in the cosmesis scale ranging from 3 (lowest satisfaction) to 24 (highest satisfaction)</description>

    <description>These questions were based on the long term effect of cholecystectomy, incision site problems and abdominal surgery in general. The questions included gastro esophageal reflux disease (GERD)/Heartburn, nausea/vomiting, incision site discomfort and alteration in bowel habit. The number of donors reporting these symptoms were assessed to calculate the incidence at predefined time points.</description>
