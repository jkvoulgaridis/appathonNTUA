      An investigator-initiated, evaluator-blinded, prospective, multi centre, before-and-after,
      effectiveness-implementation hybrid design study to assess the feasibility of essential acute
      stroke care in a low resource setting
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicentre, before and after, effectiveness-implementation hybrid study design
      with blinded outcome assessment. Patients admitted to the participating hospitals will be
      managed under usual care conditions for three months (control arm). This will be followed by
      the training of the doctors and nurses in those hospitals on essential acute stroke care
      management. Patient management for the following three months after the training
      (intervention) will then be assessed to evaluate its impact on the care and clinical outcome
      of the patients.

    <description>Primary Outcome Measure: Adherence to the predefined components of the essential acute stroke care management plan Adherence will be expressed as all or none measure and is defined as the proportion of patients who receive all the components of acute stroke care management for which the patient is eligible. Adherence will also be expressed as a composite measure, which is defined as the total number of eligible components performed divided by the total number of components for which the patient was eligible.</description>

    <description>Training and education of the site staff about the treatment protocol for the different components of the management plan will be provided on two occasions. The aim of these sessions will be to educate stroke champions and other site staff on the management protocols. Available training resources will be accessed (including online materials) and simulation training will be used. New skills such as dysphagia assessment will be emphasized based on existing knowledge and competencies. After training, staff will have another assessment (Post-test) in order to determine whether they have been adequately trained and are able to adhere to the essential acute stroke care management plan. A standardised Power Point presentation and accompanying handouts will be made available for further use in the ward.
Refresher training will be provided monthly during the intervention.</description>
