    <textblock>
      The management of latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection is a new priority action for
      the WHO End Tuberculosis (TB) Strategy. However, national guidelines on latent tuberculosis
      infection testing and treatment have not yet been developed in children of China. Here, we
      present the results from the 3-year follow-up of a study that aimed to track the development
      of active disease in individuals with latent tuberculosis infection, identify priority
      populations for latent infection management, and explore the most suitable latent infection
      diagnostic approach.

      1. Baseline analysis of a population-based, multicentre, prospective cohort study

        1. A baseline survey of a population-based, multicentre, prospective cohort study were took
           in children (≤18).

        2. Eligible participants were identifi ed by door-to-door survey with a household sampling
           design.

        3. Participants were screened for active tuberculosis and history of tuberculosis then used
           a tuberculin skin test and an interferon-γ release assay (QuantiFERON [QFT]) to test for
           latent infection.

      2. Incidence of active tuberculosis in individuals with latent tuberculosis infection in
      children of China under different treatment regimens

        1. Individuals who had tuberculosis infection at baseline (QFT-positivity or TST tuberculin
           reaction size [induration] of ≥10 mm) were divided and treatment with different
           therapeutic schedule.

        2. Follow-up study were conducted to assess the proportion of latent TB infection converted
           to active TB
