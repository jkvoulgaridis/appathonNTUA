  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading infectious disease killer globally and leading cause of
      death in persons with HIV. The most effective way to reduce TB incidence and mortality is to
      interrupt transmission. This requires finding and treating individuals with TB disease early,
      including those with subclinical disease. Molecular epidemiologic studies and mathematical
      models have shown that the primary approach to case finding—household contact
      tracing—identifies only 8-19% of transmissions in high TB and TB/HIV burden settings. Thus
      there is a clear need to identify new groups and settings where TB transmission occurs.
      Spatial clustering of individuals with higher rates of progression from infection to disease,
      such as those with HIV and malnourishment, can also form transmission hotspots. Illicit drug
      (i.e., methamphetamines, crack/cocaine, opiates) users have higher TB infection prevalence
      and disease incidence compared to non-users, likely due to significant within-group
      transmission and/or clustered vulnerability. Increased transmission among people who use
      illicit drugs (PWUD) could result from creation of more efficient TB transmitters, increased
      close contact among transmitters, increased rates of primary progression from infection to
      disease among contacts, or a combination. Interrogation of illicit drug user networks for TB
      transmission, therefore, holds great potential as a target for early case identification and
      linkage to treatment, with potential benefit for halting transmission to the broader
      population.

      A cross-sectional, observational study design using respondent driven sampling (RDS) will be
      used for this research study.

      In Aim 1, individuals will be recruited who currently use meth and/or Mandrax to assess TB
      exposure, incipient TB prevalence, and TB disease prevalence in the network. RDS will be used
      to seek out 750 meth/Mandrax users. Initial seeds (N=4) will be individuals from the
      investigator's current R01, the Tuberculosis treatment outcomes and alcohol use study (TRUST)
      cohort who have had active pulmonary TB disease in the prior 1-2 years and report current
      meth/Mandrax use.

      For Aim 2, individuals from Aim 1 identified to have possible TB disease will be screened and
      enrolled to estimate the proportion that reflect recent transmission via genotyping and
      social epidemiologic links.

      In Aim 3, the investigators will examine physiologic factors that may make PWUD more
      efficient TB transmitters. 50 PWUD participants from Aim 2 will be recruited who have active,
      untreated pulmonary TB and 50 individuals with active, untreated pulmonary TB who do not use
      meth/Mandrax, matched on age and gender will be recruited
