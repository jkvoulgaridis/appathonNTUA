  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several studies have highlighted the value of analyzing a patient's psychological profile
      with the Bortner scale questionnaire (defined as type A or B personality). This analysis
      helps to better understand and anticipate patients' behaviour, stress and compliance with
      their disease and its progression. The Type A personality profile combines hyperactivity,
      competitiveness and exaggerated ambition, while the B profile is characterized by lower
      sensitivity to stress and reduced competitiveness.

      It has been shown that the type B psychological profile in patients with type 2 diabetes is
      an independent risk factor for inflammation and that, in type 1 diabetes, the type A
      psychological profile is associated with a decrease in the expression of the pro-inflammatory
      cFos gene.

      Thus, the psychological profile appears to have an impact not only on the patient's behaviour
      but also on his or her biology.

      It has never been determined whether the type A or B psychological profile assessed by
      Bortner's self-administered questionnaire can influence the development of foot wounds in
      patients with type 2 diabetes who often have a medically unfavourable prognosis and
      socio-economic difficulties. We would therefore like to study the psychological profile of
      these individuals in order to make comparisons with the data obtained in a previous study
      that included patients with type 2 diabetes who did not have a foot wound.
