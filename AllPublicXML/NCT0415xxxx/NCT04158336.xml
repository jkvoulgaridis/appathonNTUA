             informed consent.

          3. Adequate hematologic and organ function as defined by the following criteria:

               1. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 × 109/L; excluding measurements obtained
                  within 7 days after daily administration of filgrastim/sargramostim or within 3
                  weeks after administration of pegfilgrastim.

               2. Platelet count ≥ 100 × 109/L; excluding measurements obtained within 3 days after
                  transfusion of platelets.

               3. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 3 × upper
                  limit of normal (ULN). If liver function abnormalities are due to underlying
                  liver metastases, AST and ALT ≤ 5 x ULN.

               4. Total serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × ULN or ≤ 3 × ULN in the case of Gilbert's disease.

               5. Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN or creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥ 60 mL/min.

          4. Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative serum beta human
             chorionic gonadotropin test.

          5. Male subjects and female subjects of childbearing potential must agree to use an
             effective method of contraception per institutional standard prior to the first dose
             and for 90 days after the last dose of ZN-c3.

        Individuals must meet the additional criteria in order to be eligible to participate in
        Phase 1:

          1. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 2.

          2. Measurable or evaluable disease per RECIST version 1.1

        Individuals must meet these additional criteria in order to be eligible to participate in

          2. Measurable disease per RECIST version 1.1.

        Individuals must meet these additional criteria in order to be eligible to participate in
        Phase 2 combination with a PARP inhibitor:

          1. ECOG performance status ≤ 1.

          2. Measurable disease per RECIST version 1.1.

                  recovered to eligibility levels from prior toxicity.

               4. Autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplant within 3 months.

               5. Current use of an investigational agent that is not expected to be cleared by the
                  first dosing of study drug or that has demonstrated to have prolonged side

                  abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or
                  study drug administration, or may interfere with the interpretation of study
                  results, and in the judgment of the Investigator would make the subject
                  inappropriate for entry into this study.

             neuropathy, alopecia or skin pigmentation).

          4. Prior therapy with ZN-c3 or known hypersensitivity to any drugs similar to ZN-c3 in
             class.
