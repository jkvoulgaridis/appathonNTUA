  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, subject- and evaluator-masked,
      bilateral-implant study conducted at up to 15 sites worldwide. A total of up to 280 subjects
      will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio for implantation with either the TECNIS Symfony plus IOL
      Model ZHR00V or the Trifocal IOL. This will ensure that data from at least 100 subjects in
      the TECNIS Symfony plus lens group and at least 100 subjects in the Trifocal lens group will
      be available for analysis at the 6-month follow-up timepoint. All subjects will be followed
      for up to 6 months postoperative.

    <masking_description>Unmasked study personnel at the site will be trained to the randomization process through the EDC system and will randomize subjects. The surgeon and the operative staff will know which lens type is implanted. There may also be site coordinators and other site study staff, such as those performing slit-lamp exams, who will be unmasked. Unmasked study site staff will be instructed not to disclose the lens type the subject received or to talk about the lens to any masked evaluators or to the study subjects. The subjects and the study technicians performing the postoperative vision tests are to be masked through study completion. To maintain subject masking, a temporary IOL implant identification card will be issued to the subject at the time of surgery. Following completion of the final study exam, each subject will be given the permanent IOL implant identification card.</masking_description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        (all criteria apply to both eyes):

          -  Age 22 and older

          -  Bilateral cataracts or clear crystalline lenses for which posterior chamber IOL
             implantation has been planned

          -  Potential postoperative best corrected distance visual acuity (BCDVA) of 0.66 decimal
             (20/30 or 6/9 Snellen) or better

          -  Predicted postoperative corneal astigmatism less than 1.0 D, including posterior
             corneal astigmatism (PCA)

          -  Clear intraocular media other than cataract in each eye

          -  Availability, willingness and sufficient cognitive awareness to comply with
             examination procedures

          -  Ability to understand, read, and write English or the local language in which the
             informed consent and questionnaires are provided

          -  Written informed consent for participation in the study and data protection.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  (including device labeling, all criteria apply to both eyes):

               -  Require an intraocular lens power outside the available range of +14.0 to +26.0 D

               -  Irregular corneal astigmatism (as evaluated by topography)

               -  Prior corneal refractive (LASIK, LASEK, RK, PRK, etc.) or intraocular surgery,
                  including prophylactic peripheral iridotomies and peripheral laser retinal
                  repairs

               -  Corneal abnormalities such as stromal, epithelial or endothelial dystrophies
                  (e.g., any observed guttata) that are predicted to cause visual acuity loss to a
                  level worse than 0.66 decimal (20/30 or 6/9 Snellen) during the study

               -  Inability to achieve keratometric stability for contact lens wearers

               -  Recent ocular trauma or ocular surgery that is not resolved/stable or may affect
                  visual outcomes or increase risk to the subject

               -  Pupil abnormalities that may affect visual outcomes or increase risk to the
                  subject

               -  Subjects with diagnosed degenerative visual disorders (e.g., macular degeneration
                  or other retinal disorders) that are predicted to cause visual acuity loss to a
                  level worse than 0.66 decimal (20/30 or 6/9 Snellen) during the study

               -  Subjects with conditions associated with increased risk of zonular rupture,
                  including capsular or zonular abnormalities that may lead to IOL decentration or
                  tilt, such as pseudoexfoliation, trauma, or posterior capsule defects

               -  Use of systemic or ocular medications that, in the opinion of the investigator,
                  may affect vision

               -  Prior, current, or anticipated use during the 6-month study of tamsulosin or
                  silodosin that may, in the opinion of the investigator, confound the outcome or
                  increase the risk to the subject (e.g., poor dilation or a lack of adequate iris
                  structure to perform standard cataract surgery)

               -  Poorly-controlled diabetes or hypertension that, in the opinion of the
                  investigator, may mpact visual outcome or increase the risk to the subject

               -  Acute, chronic, or uncontrolled systemic or ocular disease or illness that, in
                  the opinion of the investigator, would increase the operative risk or confound
                  the outcome(s) of the study (e.g., immunocompromised, connective tissue disease,
                  suspected glaucoma, glaucomatous changes in the fundus or visual field, ocular
                  inflammation, etc.). Note: controlled ocular hypertension without glaucomatous
                  changes (optic nerve cupping and visual field loss) is acceptable.

               -  Known ocular disease or pathology that, in the opinion of the investigator,

                    -  may affect visual acuity (e.g., ocular surface conditions)

                    -  may require surgical intervention during the study (macular degeneration,
                       cystoid macular edema, diabetic retinopathy, uncontrolled glaucoma, etc.)

                    -  may be expected to require retinal laser treatment or other surgical
                       intervention during the study (macular degeneration, cystoid macular edema,
                       diabetic retinopathy, etc.)

               -  Pregnancy, planned pregnancy, presently lactating, or another condition
                  associated with hormonal fluctuation that could lead to refractive changes

               -  Concurrent participation or participation within 60 days prior to the
                  preoperative visit in any other clinical trial
