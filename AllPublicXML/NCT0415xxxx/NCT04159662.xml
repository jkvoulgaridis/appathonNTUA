  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia and depression are among the most disabling disorders in all of medicine.
      Cognitive deficits play a key role in patients' disability, affecting their capacity to
      contribute actively to society by sustaining employment or academic activity. Moreover,
      cognitive difficulties tend to persist even after the stabilization of other clinical
      symptoms. Verbal memory and emotion regulation are two important cognitive domains that are
      impaired in schizophrenia and depression and are associated with patients' functional
      outcomes. However, no medication has shown clear positive effects on these impairments at
      this point. Therefore, there is a great need to find effective cognitive remediation
      treatments (CRT) that could improve these domains in both psychiatric populations. In this
      study, the investigators will assess the efficacy of a cognitive rehabilitation intervention
      on the targetted cognitive domains (i.e., verbal memory and emotion regulation), general
      cognition, brain functioning, community functioning, symptom severity, and perceived
      cognitive deficits in both psychiatric populations. The study team also aims to investigate
      potential predictors of positive response to the intervention.

      Participants will be randomized into either a treatment group or an active control group for
      6 weeks. They will also be invited to undergo clinical and cognitive assessments as well as
      brain imaging before and after 6 weeks of intervention in order to compare the efficacy of
      the intervention. Additionally, their verbal memory and emotion regulation abilities will be
      assessed mid-intervention to examine the specific effect of each CRT module.
