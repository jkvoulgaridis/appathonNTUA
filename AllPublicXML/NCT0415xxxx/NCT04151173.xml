  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicentric (three centers: 1: Shanghai First Maternity and Infant
      Hospital, Shanghai, China; 2: International Peace Maternity and Child Health Hospital,
      Shanghai, China, 3: Shanghai Tongji Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai
      ,China), randomized clinical trial that includes patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery for
      primary unilateral ovarian endometriomas. Eligible patients will be subjected to transvaginal
      ultrasound before surgery to perform cyst classification (central type, marginal type and
      outcrop type). Patients are divided to two group: laparoscopic cystectomy group versus
      laparoscopic aspiration/electrocoagulation group. Biopsy samples in
      aspiration/electrocoagulation group and excision samples in cystectomy group are all
      subjected to histopathological examination. Follicular stimulating hormone (FSH), Anti
      mullerian hormone (AMH) and antral follicular count (AFC) will be measured pre-operative and
      post-operative.

      The aim of the study is to determine whether and to what extent the two surgical procedures
      for ovarian endometrioma, cystectomy and aspiration/electrocoagulation, affect ovarian
      reserve. The investigators intend to confirm the clinical utility of ultrasonic
      classification of ovarian endometrioma, FSH, AMH and AFC in the assessment of ovarian
      reserve, and to promote their use in predicting decreased ovarian reserve.

      The surgical excision of cystic wall, cystic fluid and peritoneal fluid will be subjected to
      transmission electron microscope, high resolution mass spectrometry and single-cell RNA
      sequencing to investigate their cellular and molecular features.
