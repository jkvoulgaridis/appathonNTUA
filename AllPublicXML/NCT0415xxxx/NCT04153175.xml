    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study to assess the safety and
      efficacy of ICV delivery of CT-010 via an implantable pump and a cranial port and dual lumen
      catheter (CIC) in subjects with focal seizures, with temporal lobe onset with or without
      secondary generalization. Up to 70 subjects will be enrolled. Eligible subjects will be
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either CT-010 or placebo treatment. Up to 14 clinical centers
      will be enrolled.

      Epilepsy patients that are refractory to oral anti-epileptic drug (AED) treatment have
      significantly higher mortality, higher morbidity, higher economic costs and diminished
      quality of life compared to those who suffer from epilepsy that can be adequately controlled
      with medical management. Current options for refractory patients include neurosurgical brain
      resection, responsive neurostimulation, and vagal nerve stimulation. None of these options is
      satisfactory due to the low applicability of surgery for patients with poorly localized or
      multifocal seizures and the limited success of currently available alternative treatment
      options.

      In this study, patients with medically refractory focal epilepsy will be treated with
      intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of CT-010, a reformulation of valproate, using
      an implantable drug pump system. This is a randomized, double-blind Phase 2 study evaluating
      the efficacy and safety of this therapy. Clinical assessments, adverse events (AEs), seizure
      diaries, concomitant medications, blood samples and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) will be
      collected and reviewed at designated time points. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
      electroencephalography (EEG) will also be performed. Subjects will have their surgery, dose
      changes and pharmacokinetics performed in an inpatient setting.

      Subjects will be enrolled based on Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria and undergo a 6-week baseline
      period confirming and establishing monthly seizure rate. Following the baseline period
      subjects will undergo system implant and a 1-month implant recovery period. Following
      successful implant and recovery subjects will be randomized to either active therapy or
      placebo for a 3-month blinded evaluation period. At the conclusion of the blinded evaluation
      period, subjects will enter an open-label long term follow-up period. Subjects that were
      randomized to placebo will receive active therapy during the open label period.

        Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria:

        -

        For a subject to be eligible for this study, he or she must meet ALL of the following
        criteria:

          1. Subject is male or female between the ages of 18 to 70 years old.

          2. Subject is considered an appropriate surgical candidate by the implanting
             Neurosurgeon.

          3. Subject has had a computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of
             the brain to rule out progressive structural lesions within 2-years of consent.

          4. Subject does not have a clear major structural related brain abnormality. If
             structural related lesion is present, then the subject must have: onset of epilepsy
             after age 5, have had normal brain development up to age 5, and have full scale
             intelligence quotient (IQ) &gt; 70 by testing or functional assessment using sites
             preferred testing. If the neuropsychology assessments at screening suggest a
             borderline IQ, the psychologist will complete a full IQ assessment prior to implant to
             obtain a baseline IQ.

          5. Subject has normal brain volume and is not noted to be abnormally small due to atrophy
             in review of MRI scan by either the Neurologist, Neurosurgeon or, radiologist.

          6. Subject has had confirmed refractory epilepsy for a minimum of 2 years, with
             unilateral or bilateral temporal lobe involvement with no more than 2 known
             extratemporal foci. Elements of the temporal lobe semiology must be present during a
             portion of the seizure if there is no electroencephalogram (EEG) evidence that
             seizures start in a temporal lobe, as defined by the International League Against
             Epilepsy (ILAE) Classification of Epileptic Seizures (2017). The temporal does not
             have to be the origin site of the seizures or interictal spikes.

          7. In the opinion of the Investigator, subject has disabling seizures. Disabling refers
             to seizures that are severe enough to cause injuries, are disabling or significantly
             impair Quality of Life. Seizures not visible to observers will not be credited to
             required seizure counts.

          8. Subject has had at least one seizure recorded by EEG or video EEG or invasive
             monitoring within the past 3 years consistent with focal temporal lobe seizures (a
             normal interictal EEG is consistent with focal seizures)

          9. Subject has not achieved effective results previously from at least 3 AEDs in single
             or combination. An AED may be counted as failed medication if subject has been on it
             for at least 3-months and is still refractory.

         10. Subject failed to obtain an adequate intake of oral valproate of at least 1,000 mgs a
             day and/or to achieve serum level of at least 60 µg/mL or in the opinion of the
             Investigator is not a candidate for oral valproate (including subject preference)

         11. Subject is currently taking approved AEDs (but is not on valproate or divalproex
             sodium) and has been on a stable dosing regimen for 1 month prior to consent.

         12. Per medical history, for the 3 months before informed consent an average of six or
             more disabling focal seizures of temporal lobe onset, with or without secondary
             generalization, per month. Only seizures with objectively visible manifestations
             should be counted. The subject should have no period longer than 30 days in the 3
             months prior to enrollment with less than two seizures.

             Note:

               -  Disabling refers to seizures that are severe enough to cause injuries, are
                  disabling or significantly impair Quality of Life.

               -  Seizures with temporal involvement are required with data from semiology, and
                  EEG, neuro-imaging, and/or epilepsy monitoring seizure localization.

         13. Subject has seizures that are distinct, stereotypical events that can be reliably
             counted, in the opinion of the Investigator, by the subject or caregiver.

         14. Subject has hearing, vision, and physical abilities adequate to perform assessments,
             with or without corrective aids, including keeping a seizure and medication diary
             during the study.

         15. Subject understands study procedures and has voluntarily provided signed, informed
             consent in accordance with institutional and local regulatory requirements.

         16. Medically refractory epilepsy for more than two year.

         17. Needs be literate in English.

         18. Women of childbearing potential must be using a medically accepted method of
             contraception and have a negative pregnancy test result from a urine or blood sample
             collected at Screening and until their withdrawal from, or completion of the study.

             Note:

               -  Non-childbearing potential is defined as any female who is post-menopausal for at
                  least 1 year or has had hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or is surgically
                  sterilized.

               -  The following are considered highly effective contraceptive methods: hormonal
                  oral contraceptives, injectables, and patches; intrauterine devices;
                  double-barrier methods (synthetic condom, diaphragm, or cervical cap used with
                  spermicidal foam, cream, or gel); and male partner sterilization.

         19. Subject maintains at least 70% of the days of the seizure diary and no more than five
             consecutive missed days during the Baseline Period and during the baseline period
             average at least six seizures per month.

         20. Subject agrees to maintain the diary for the duration of the study alone or with the
             assistance of a competent individual.

        Subjects must NOT meet any of the following Exclusion criteria to be eligible for
        enrollment:
