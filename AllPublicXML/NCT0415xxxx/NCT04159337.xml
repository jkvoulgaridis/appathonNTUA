  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Companion diagnosis by large-panel is in increasing acceptance and need during clinical
      cancer management. The purpose of this trial is to investigate the benefit of large-panel NGS
      analysis in companion diagnosis of advanced lung cancer patients and further optimize the
      parameters.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fresh tumor tissues and matched blood cells will be analyzed by large-panel (Berryoncology,
      lnc.) for multiple molecular biomarkers including mutations with sensitivity/resistance to
      targeted therapies, tumor mutational burden (TMB), microsatellite instability (MSI) status,
      etc., Therapeutic approach and outcome will be followed-up to inspect the clinical benefit by
      large-panel analysis. In addition, selected samples will be analyzed by WES to assess the
      correctness of TMB estimated by large-panel.
