  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The great promise of PET/MR for assessment of skeletal metastatic involvement is derived from
      the extensive experience with stand- alone MR, but initial data on the use of PET/MR for
      assessment of bone pathology indicate that PET/MR introduces unique issues that should be
      addressed when determining its role in this clinical scenario.

      In this study cohort includes 150 patients 18 years or older, having metastatic skeletal
      involvement on baseline PET/CT prior to treatment. Baseline studies and follow up studies of
      the patients referred post treatment, will be reviewed.

      The main goal of the study is to asses the accuracy of PET/MR in detection and monitoring
      response of bone metastases.

    <description>All patients will have a PET/CT and PET/MR study performed at the same clinical setting using a single dose of tracer administration.
The study cohort includes 150 patients 18 years or older, having metastatic skeletal involvement on baseline PET/CT prior to treatment. Baseline studies and follow up studies of the patients referred post treatment, will be reviewed.
The tracers will be FDG, labelled PSMA labelled Somatostatin and F-DOPA in order to assess skeletal lesions detection of all tumor types.
Skeletal lesions will be divided into marrow-based lesions, lytic, blastic and scleroric lesions. Tracer uptake will be measured at baseline and after treatment. Metabolic PET parameters, CT appearance and MR parameters will be assessed.
The best MR-based attenuation algorithm for detection of lesions and monitoring response will be derived.</description>
