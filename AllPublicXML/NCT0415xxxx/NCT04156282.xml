  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Caesarean section is one of the most commonly performed abdominal operations on women in most
      countries of the world. Its rate has increased markedly in recent years, and is about 20-25%
      of all child-births in most developed countries.

      The present study was a step to reduce postoperative pain in cesarean sections. Because of
      the large number of women that undergo caesarean section, even small differences in
      post-operative morbidity rates due to different techniques could translate into improved
      health and significant savings of cost and health services resources.

      Closing the rectus sheath in cesarean sections with the knots pricking through the skin
      causes significant postoperative pain, discomfort and delayed ambulation. No comments in
      literature regarding the best way for closing the rectus sheath in cesarean sections.

      AIM/ OBJECTIVES The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of burying knots beneath the
      rectus sheath during cesarean section in reducing post operative pain and discomfort.

      Study hypothesis:

      In women undergoing cesarean sections may or may not burying knots beneath the rectus sheath
      reduce the post operative pain and discomfort.

      Non absorbable and delayed absorbable monofilament materials require meticulous care to
      prevent knot slippage.

      One common problem that arises from use of these materials is the discomfort caused by the
      knot pricking through the skin. Although this is a common problem after cesarean section, it
      is often overlooked and only very few preventive techniques have been described.

      This study is to assess the efficacy of burying knots beneath the rectus sheath during
      cesarean sections in reducing post operative pain and discomfort.

      Type of Study : A randomized controlled clinical trial. Study Setting :this study will be
      conducted at the department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Ain-Shams University Maternity
      hospital.

      Study time: 2019. Study Population : The study population comprises pregnant women,
      fulfilling the inclusion criteria, attending to Ain Shams University Maternity Hospital,
      during the study period, who are planned for cesarean delivery.

    <description>The surgeon holds the left angle of the rectus sheath incision with an Allis. Using (Polyglactin 910) suture,The needle is taken from the inside outward on the upper edge.The needle is then taken lateral to the Allis and brought back into the wound by taking it through the inferior edge from outside to inside . A square knot is tied with three or four throws. The needle is then taken out of the wound through the upper edge and continuous running stitches . As the right angle is approached, the angle is held with an Allis. the suture, will be taken through the lower edge, is brought outside the wound and passed between the blades of a closed Allis before taking it inside out on the upper edge. One more bite is taken but this time just lateral to the Allis holding the angle, and the needle is brought back into the wound and to the outside between the edges of the rectus sheath. Using the loop of polyglactin held with the Allis , an Aberdeen knot is tied after removing the Allis.</description>
