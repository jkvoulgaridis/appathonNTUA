  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective exploratory study using narrative therapy in group format, over 20
      sessions, 2 hours per session, weekly, to determine whether this modality can provide any
      benefit to OCD symptoms, mood, sense of social connectedness, sense of identity, and/or
      quality of life in individuals living with treatment-resistant OCD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many patients referred to the Thompson Centre at Sunnybrook have severe OCD, and have
      significant and disabling symptoms even after completing our treatment protocols, including
      our intensive and residential programs. These patients have already undergone traditional
      cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and exposure and response prevention (ERP), as well as
      pharmacotherapy. Patients voice distress at their poor quality of life and high symptom
      burden, and can feel hopeless, if they have exhausted numerous evidence-based treatment
      options without significant improvement. Narrative therapy is a unique approach, based on the
      premise that language reflects a social construction of reality. Individuals with severe
      mental illness hold within themselves life narratives that reinforce their painful beliefs
      about themselves, the world, and others. Evidence indicates that narrative therapy can help
      to create a more cohesive identity and a more flexible view of the self and the future.

      Our primary goal is to determine whether narrative therapy could improve OCD symptom burden
      and quality of life in a highly treatment-resistant population. Domains such as mood,
      identity, and interpersonal connectedness are secondary measures. The research questions are:
      could narrative therapy lead to symptomatic improvement in treatment-resistant OCD? And could
      narrative therapy improve the domains of mood, interpersonal connectedness, and/or identity
      in patients with treatment-resistant OCD?
