      The purpose of the present study is to investigate the effect of pilates training on
      cognitive functions in patient with stroke

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke remains a primary cause of morbidity throughout the world mainly because of its effect
      on cognition. Individuals can recover from physical disability resulting from stroke, but
      might be unable to return to their previous occupations or independent life because of
      cognitive impairments.

      Post-stroke cognitive impairment is not a unitary syndrome but incorporates a variety of
      deficits in multiple domains such as attention, executive functions , memory, language and
      visuoperceptual abilities. Cognitive impairment occurs in up to 64% of people who have had a
      stroke and has been associated with a 3-fold increase in risk for mortality,
      institutionalization and decreased instrumental activities of daily living function.

      Pilates training was developed by Joseph H. Pilates .It belong to a group of so-called
      Body-Mind Exercises, where the focus is on controlled movement, posture, and breathing
      .Pilates (pronounced: puh-lah-teez) improves mental and physical well-being , increases
      flexibility through controlled movements done as mat exercises.

      Pilates training improve cognitive functions through increasing blood and oxygen flow to the
      brain , support neuronal survival in the developping brain ,Generate new neurons ,Provides
      mood enhancement ,Increases neurotransmitters and Neurotrophins assure the survival of
      neurons in areas responsible for learning, memory and higher thinking.
