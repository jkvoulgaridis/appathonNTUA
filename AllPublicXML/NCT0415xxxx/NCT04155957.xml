  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, non-blinded, parallel assignment, clinical trial for the evaluation of
      safety and efficacy of ReHub, a telerehabilitation system made up of a cloud platform and an
      exercise kit with smart sensors, for performing rehabilitation exercises after a primary
      Total Knee Arthroplasty.

      Primary TKA patients are allocated randomly to the control arm or the experimental arm with a
      1:1 ratio. Both arms follow the usual rapid recovery protocol for TKA surgeries at Hospital
      Clínic de Barcelona, which includes discharge after 2-3 days from the surgery, the
      prescription of a daily plan of 5 exercises for autonomous rehabilitation and domiciliary
      visits by a physiotherapist starting approximately 2 weeks after the surgery. The
      experimental arm participants use ReHub to do their exercises instead of working
      independently and physiotherapists monitor their performance and adherence remotely.

      Outcomes assessment is performed at hospital discharge (baseline), at stitch removal (2 weeks
      after baseline) and 2 weeks after stitch removal (4 weeks after baseline).

    <description>Usual intervention at Hospital Clínic de Barcelona for post-operative rehabilitation of TKA patients. Participants, already at home after hospital discharge, must perform 5 different exercises 4 times a day (twice in the morning, twice in the afternoon).
Participants are also encouraged to walk and stretch their legs. Domiciliary visits by a physiotherapist start at approximately 2 weeks after the surgery to help participants do the exercises.</description>

    <description>Participants use a telerehabilitation platform, ReHub, as a guide to perform the TKA rehabilitation exercises of the Rapid Recovery Rehabilitation Programme intervention.
The exercise plan in ReHub is carried out by a site physiotherapist on the first day after discharge by using ReHub to acquire the participant's movement pattern with a wearable inertial sensor that transmits data to the platform.
The wearable inertial sensor participants must wear tracks movement while they do the TKA rehabilitation exercises. Movement is analysed and feedback is given in real time. At the end of each exercise, participants can select if they have felt pain in a scale from 1 to 10. A physiotherapist monitors the participants' progress remotely.</description>
