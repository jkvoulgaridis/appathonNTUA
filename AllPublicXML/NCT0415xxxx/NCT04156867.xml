      The study was to explore the clinical outcomes of discectomy with dynamic neutralization
      system(Dynesys) on treatment of single-segmental lumbar disc herniation(LDH) versus simple
      discectomy. 128 patients with single-segmental LDH were randomly divided into discectomy with
      Dynesys group(group A) and simple discectomy group(group B). Both groups were evaluated by
      Visual Analogue Score(VAS), Oswestry Disability Index(ODI), radiological evidence of
      intervertebral height and range of motion(ROM) of the treated segment at pre- and
      post-operation. Operation duration and blood loss was recorded. The clinical outcomes and
      complications were evaluated afterwards. All patients received a 2-year follow-up.

    <measure>Oswestry Disability Index</measure>
    <time_frame>2 year</time_frame>
    <description>Oswestry Disability Index is for movement function, Questionnaire examines perceived level of disability in everyday activities of daily living. The ODI score (index) is calculated as: For example: If all 10 sections are completed, the score is calculated as follows: if 16 (total scored) out of 50 (total possible score) x 100 = 32%; If one section is missed (or not applicable), the score is calculated: If 16 (total scored) / 45 (total possible score) x 100 = 35.5%.</description>
