  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research evaluates a tool designed for measurement-based care in addiction treatment.
      Patients in addiction treatment will be invited to complete weekly measures indicating
      treatment progress and goals. For half the patients, their addiction treatment clinician will
      be able to view their weekly progress and goals via a secure dashboard. The research will
      test the feasibility and acceptability of the measurement-based care tool and will evaluate
      its impact on within-session discussion topics and clinical outcome measures.

    <description>Self-reported amount of time spent discussing topics measured in the weekly progress measure. This will be measured via a self-report questionnaire (&quot;In-Session Discussion Topics&quot; questionnaire), which was generated for the current study. The measure will assess the extent to which they discussed each of the following topics in their most recent treatment session: Drinking/drug use, cravings, coping strategies, abstinence self-efficacy, outlook on life, mental health, therapeutic alliance, and treatment goals. Each item is reported on a 4-point Likert scale (minimum value = 0 &quot;did not discuss&quot;, maximum value = 3 &quot;discussed extensively&quot; -- higher scores do not necessarily indicate &quot;better&quot; clinical outcomes; however, we hypothesize that the measurement-based care tool will increase the in-session discussion of these topics, and therefore higher outcomes in the measurement-and-feedback group would be consistent with our hypothesis).</description>

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported responses to the weekly progress measure will be evaluated using longitudinal growth curve models. The check-in measure was developed for the current study and consists of items drawn from several existing measures, including the Substance Use Recovery Evaluator, Alcohol Abstinence Self-Efficacy scale, Working Alliance Inventory, and Patient Health Questionnaire-2. The measure is called &quot;The Weekly Check-In&quot; and it provides a &quot;total recovery score&quot; ranging from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better outcomes.</description>

    <description>The measurement system collects information about patients' treatment progress and goals in key areas that are associated with long-term clinical outcomes (e.g., substance use, craving, coping skills, self-efficacy, life satisfaction, depression). Patients complete the measure up to once per week for up to six months.</description>
