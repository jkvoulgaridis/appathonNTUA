  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a descriptive cohort study of intranasal ketamine as the initial analgesic for
      children with sickle cell disease who present to the pediatric emergency department with
      vaso-occlusive crisis and are awaiting intravenous line placement.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective observational cohort involving patients 3 to 25 years of age who
      present to the Pediatric Emergency Department (PED) at Jacobi Medical Center with
      vaso-occlusive episode (VOE) in moderate-severe pain (FACES or numeric rating scale â‰¥5) as
      determined at triage. Currently, the standard of treatment for VOE at our institution is
      intravenous (IV) line placement and IV opioid analgesia. The patient will receive intranasal
      (IN) Ketamine as the first parental analgesic, so as to provide more immediate pain relief
      while they wait for IV placement and IV analgesia, for opioid pain control, which is
      currently the standard of care at our institution. The primary objective of this study is to
      describe the analgesic effect of IN ketamine in treating moderate-to-severe pain due to VOE
      in the pediatric ED as measured by a pain scale rating at various time intervals following
      administration. Secondary objectives are to describe the effect of IN ketamine on the need
      for additional doses of opioid medications, patient satisfaction and disposition.
