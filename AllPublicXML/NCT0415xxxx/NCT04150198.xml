  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Alzheimer's disease and with early onset of symptoms (&lt;65 years) (AD-Y) have a
      multi-domain cognitive deficit, whereas memory disorders (typical of the elderly patient's
      AD) are less often in the foreground. In addition, some MA-J have an atypical phenotype
      indicating focal brain damage, although they have the same pathological lesions: amyloid
      deposits and tau protein deposition (DNF). This is the case of posterior cortical atrophy
      (PCA) characterized by complex visual disturbances and atrophy affecting the more posterior
      regions of the brain. Based on the clinical profile of PCA patients, a more refined
      anatomo-clinical classification was proposed, distinguishing a rather &quot;ventral&quot; form and a
      rather &quot;dorsal&quot; form. The recent arrival of tau-specific PET tracers now makes it possible to
      evaluate in vivo fibrillary neurodegeneration (FND), which is well correlated with the
      severity of cognitive disorders. Advances in MRI have shown that each neurodegenerative
      syndrome targets a large-scale neural network, which in turn shows a vulnerability for a
      specific biological disease. In the case of AD, the reason for such a difference in cognitive
      and anatomical impairment between patients with diffuse involvement and others with more
      focal involvement is not known. One possible explanation is the existence, in focal forms, of
      neuronal mechanisms that oppose vulnerability. These mechanisms may correspond to the
      so-called &quot;resilience&quot; phenomenon, defined as resistance to a neuropathological process by
      the ability to optimize cognitive performance via the efficient recruitment of neural
      networks. The mechanisms underlying resilience in neurodegeneration are unknown. Their
      identification is very important for the management and treatment of AD.

      Working hypotheses We hypothesize that &quot;focal&quot; patients (PCA) versus &quot;diffuse&quot; patients
      (AD-Y) have (i) less severe white matter involvement; (ii) effective reorganization of the
      functional brain networks; iii) pathologically, a different topography and lesion load.

      This project has no redundancy with the work already done in our team and in other teams at
      the international level.

      Expected benefits This study will highlight the neural mechanisms underlying resiliency in a
      group of AD patients who, although having the same disease, present with a very different
      clinical and cognitive profile. Demonstration of these specific mechanisms of resilience in
      the diseased brain is essential to better understand the pathophysiological processes of AD.
      We consider that the pharmacological approach and the functional reeducation to this disease
      depend essentially on a better knowledge of both the topographic distribution of the
      underlying histopathology (in particular, the tau protein), and the response capacity from
      the brain to these lesions (state of connection of networks, functional reorganization). In
      addition, when treatments for AD are available, a precise definition of phenotypic variants
      will be essential for the selection of patients for these therapies and for therapeutic
      follow-up. In the longer term, resilient neural circuits could be modulated and strengthened
      through transcranial stimulation. Indeed, promising results have been obtained showing that
      these techniques can improve the performance of altered cognitive functions in patients with
      dementia.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. For all subjects:

               -  Affiliation to a social security insurance or beneficiary

               -  Informed consent form signed by the participant or his / her legal representative

               -  Participants aged 40 to 80 years.

          2. Selection of AD-Y group

             - In vivo proof of Alzheimer's pathology:

               -  Determination of specific proteins on the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF, a routine
                  care procedure). The values considered pathological (AD) are Aβ1-42 peptide &lt;500
                  (μg / ml), and / or tau protein&gt; 450 and phosphorylated tau protein&gt; 60, IATI
                  index &lt;1, tau / Aβ protein ratios &gt; 1.23 as well as phosphorylated tau protein /
                  Aβ1-42&gt; 0.211.

               -  And / or a positive PET-amyloid imaging test.

               -  Early-onset episodic memory deficit (&lt;65 years), progressive onset with evidence
                  of hippocampal amnesic syndrome at neuropsychological assessment.

             In memory tests, the amnesic hippocampal syndrome is defined by: a deficit of the free
             recall despite a reinforced encoding, an effectiveness of the indexing or an
             impairment of the recognition capabilities, the presence of intrusions. The presence
             during the tests of false memories spontaneous (intrusions) or provoked (false
             recognitions) is also very contributive to the definition of amnesic syndrome of the
             hippocampal type.

          3. PCA group selection

             Patients with a clinical and cognitive profile suggestive of PCA, characterized by:

               -  an in vivo proof of the Alzheimer pathology (see selection of the AD-Y group)

               -  a specific impairment of neuro-visual abilities, in the absence of major
                  disorders of episodic memory (hippocampal) and executive functions.

             Two possible variants:

               -  occipito-temporal variant: visuo-perceptive deficit in the foreground, early
                  onset and progressive worsening; lack of visual identification of objects,
                  symbols, words or faces;

               -  biparietal variant: visuospatial deficit in the foreground, early settlement and
                  progressive worsening; Gerstmann syndrome; Balint syndrome; gestural apraxia;
                  visual-spatial neglect.

          4. Selection of the control subjects group

               -  Normal neurological and neuropsychological examinations.

               -  Control subjects will be matched in age to patients.

             For precautions of safety of use of the radiopharmaceutical, a blood sample allowing
             to check the renal and hepatic functions will be realized before imagery. The delay
             between the sampling and the neuroimaging visit is left to the investigator's
             discretion based on the patient's biological results. In particular, the glomerular
             filtration rate will be calculated from the results obtained.

             In the event of renal insufficiency (GFR 30mL / min / 1.73m2), hepatic insufficiency
             or any other biological anomaly of grade 3 or higher detected during these analyzes,
             the participant will not be able to carry out PET imaging. In this case, the results
             of the analyzes will be sent to the doctor indicated by the participant. This
             evaluation, which involves a determination of serum creatinine, is part of the
             standard routine biological assessment performed in the context of cognitive disorders

                  active substance or to any of the excipients, renal impairment (GFR 30mL / min /
                  1.73m2), hepatic insufficiency or any other biological abnormality of grade 3 or
                  higher

               -  Person suffering from claustrophobia.

               -  Pregnancy (for women of childbearing age, a urine pregnancy test will be
                  performed on the day of the inclusion visit and the PET-MRI examination).

               -  Any symptoms or biological values suggestive of a systemic disorder (renal,
                  hepatic, cardiovascular, pulmonary) or any other medical conditions that could
                  interfere with the interpretation of test results or compromise the health of
                  patients.

               -  Person subject to a legal safeguard.

          2. Specific non-inclusion criteria for AD-Y and PCA patients:

               -  Sudden appearance of cognitive deficits.
