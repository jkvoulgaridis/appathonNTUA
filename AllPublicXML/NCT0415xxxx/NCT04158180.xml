      Introduction Abdominal diastasis is defined as the presence of divergence between the rectus
      abdominis muscles along the linea alba. Some authors describe a prevalence of 40% in women up
      to one year postpartum. Some studies suggest that the presence of abdominal diastasis can be
      related to the appearance of low back, pelvic and abdominal pain and even urinary
      incontinence. These factors can significantly affect the quality of life of women with
      diastasis both socially, sexual and personal level. According to several studies, this
      pathology is related to higher rates of depression and an alteration in the self-perception
      of body image that makes these women to look to specialized medical care.

      At present, the quantitative evaluation of abdominal diastasis is performed purely
      anatomically. This evaluation consists in measuring the separation between the two rectus
      abdominis. Currently there is no consensus as to the protocol that should be used for this
      measurement.

      So far, no instrument is able to quantitatively measure the consequences of abdominal
      diastasis. These consequences should include relevant parameters such as quality of life,
      perception of body image and secondary functional limitations.

      The objective of this study is the creation and validation of a specific questionnaire to
      evaluate the signs and symptoms of diastasis of the rectus abdominis.

      Material and methods A) Creation of the questionnaire

        1. Literature review

        2. Online survey

        3. Expert panel

        4. Pilot questionnaire test

      B) Validation of the questionnaire The psychometric properties of the questionnaire will be
      evaluated in a sample of patients with abdominal diastasis. The sample will be composed of a
      group of women who present a separation of the rectus abdominis that come to the consultation
      of a specialized professional
