  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Term pregnancies within their 37-41 gestational week, who were planned to undergo induction
      of labor, were included in the study. Prior to initiation of the induction of labor, all
      included pregnant women underwent an assessment of Doppler flow indices, which included fetal
      umblical artery PI (pulsatility index) and fetal middle cerebral artery (MCA:Middle cerebral
      arter) PI. Cerebroplacental Ratio (CPR) was calculated by dividing MCA PI value to umbilical
      artery PI (MCA PI/UA PI=CPR).Included pregnant women were categorized as Group 1 and Group 2,
      which comprised of those with CPR value below 1.0 and above 1.0, respectively. Route of
      delivery and fetal complications, described as umbilical cord pH&lt;7.20, APGAR score at 5
      minutes &lt;7, meconium aspiration syndrome, newborn intensive care unit admission, neonatal
      sepsis and neonatal death.

      Term pregnancies within their 37-41 gestational week, who were planned to undergo induction
      of labor, were included in the study. Prior to initiation of the induction of labor, all
      included pregnant women underwent an assessment of Doppler flow indices, which included fetal
      umblical artery PI (pulsatility index) and fetal middle cerebral artery (MCA:Middle cerebral
      arter) PI. Cerebroplacental Ratio (CPR) was calculated by dividing MCA PI value to umbilical
      artery PI (MCA PI/UA PI=CPR).Included pregnant women were categorized as Group 1 and Group 2,
      which comprised of those with CPR value below 1.0 and above 1.0, respectively. All women who
      were considered appropriate for induction of labor were performed an pelvic examination and
      their Bishop scores were calculated. Those with a Bishop score equal to or below 5 were
      included in the study. Vaginal misoprostol (prostoglandin E1, 25 mcg) and dinoproston
      (prostoglandin E2, 10 mg) were used for induction of labor. Repeat doses were implemented in
      case of insufficient cervical ripening. Oxytocin was not used at the initial stages of
      labour, while it was used at the latter stages when necessary.

      Route of delivery and fetal complications, described as umbilical cord pH&lt;7.20, APGAR score
      at 5 minutes &lt;7, meconium aspiration syndrome, newborn intensive care unit admission,
      neonatal sepsis and neonatal death.
