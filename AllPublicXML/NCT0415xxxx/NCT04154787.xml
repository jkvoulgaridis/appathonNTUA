  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, treatment open-label, dose-blinded parallel group, three arm,
      proof-of-concept, non-confirmatory study evaluating the efficacy and safety of LNP023
      compared with rituximab in subjects with MN who are at high risk of disease progression
      defined on the basis of antibody anti-PLA2R titre and proteinuria. The screening period will
      last up to 12 weeks and the whole study will last up to 65 weeks. Approximately 72 subjects
      will be randomized to one of three arms. Treatment with LNP023 or rituximab is open label,
      although dose of LNP023 will be blinded for subjects, investigators and sponsor. Both of the
      low and high-dose LNP023 arms have a 4-week period of initial dose treatment, followed by a
      20-week period of full dose treatment to evaluate the effect of the different LNP023 doses on
      complement biomarkers. Efficacy will be evaluated at the end of the 24-week treatment period.
      The randomization ratio is 1:1:1; low-dose (regimen A) LNP023: high dose (regimen B) LNP023:
      rituximab.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Female or male adult (≥18 years) subjects at screening visit with a diagnosis of
             idiopathic (primary) MN confirmed by renal biopsy within 24 months prior to screening.
             A renal biopsy may be taken at any time during the run-in period to confirm the
             diagnosis of MN and facilitate subject eligibility, if the most recent biopsy was
             performed greater than 24 months prior to the screening visit.

          -  Anti-PLA2R antibody titer of ≥ 100 RU/mL at screening visit

          -  Urine protein ≥ 3.5 g/24h at screening and baseline visits

          -  ≤50% reduction in both anti-PLA2R level and 24h urine protein between screening and
             baseline

          -  Estimated GFR (using the CKD-EPI formula) ≥ 45 mL/min per 1.73 m2 at screening

          -  Receiving stable dose at the maximum recommended dose according to local guidelines or
             maximum tolerated dose of ACEi and/or ARB and/or statins and/or diuretics for at least
             8 weeks prior to Day 1

          -  Vaccination against Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus
             influenzae (in accordance with local guidelines) at least 28 days prior to Day 1 and
             no longer than 5 years prior to Day 1.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Secondary causes of MN, e.g. systemic autoimmune diseases, solid or haematological
             malignancies, infections or chronic intake of drugs (e.g. gold salts, NSAIDs,
             penicillamines)

          -  Diagnostic renal biopsy showing evidence of crescent formation in glomeruli,
             suggestive of an alternative or additional diagnosis to primary idiopathic MN.

          -  Previous treatment with B-cell depleting or B-cell modifying agents such as, but not
             limited to rituximab, belimumab, daratumomab or bortezomib.

          -  Previous treatment with immunosuppressive agents such as cyclophosphamide,
             chlorambucil, mycophenolate mofetil (or equivalent), cyclosporine, tacrolimus or
             azathioprine within 90 days prior to Day 1. Low dose systemic corticosteroid therapy
             is permitted, though the subject should have been on stable dose equivalent to ≤10 mg
             prednisolone for at least 90 days prior to Day 1.

          -  Previous treatment with gemfibrozil or strong CYP2C8 inhibitors such as clopidogrel
             within 7 days prior to Day 1

          -  Presence or suspicion (based on judgment of the investigator) of active infection
             within 30 days prior to Day 1, or history of severe recurrent bacterial infections

          -  Known contra-indications for the use of rituximab, including hypersensitivity to the
             active substance or to murine proteins, or to any of the excipients (sodium citrate,
             polysorbate 80, sodium chloride, sodium hydroxide, hydrochloric acid, water for
             injections). Other contra-indications for the use of rituximab, including active,
             severe infection, patients in a severely immunocompromised state, severe heart failure
             (NYHA Class IV) or severe, uncontrolled cardiac disease.
