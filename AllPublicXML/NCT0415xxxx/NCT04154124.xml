  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of the novel recently introduced PET/MR scanner is believed to be promising in RC
      management, providing great anatomical details and detailed metabolic characterization.
      Preliminary data indicate it may become a strong imaging modality for staging of RC and has
      the potential to be used as a predictive tool guiding individualized therapy in patients
      receiving nT, but confirmation on prospective studies is mandatory. The use of radiomics as
      analysis approach may assist in achieving a better understanding of the obtained image data,
      and thus a more accurate disease assessment.

      Objectives

        1. To preliminary assess the potential diagnostic value of single PET/MR scan in RC staging
           and compare it to that of MRI alone, PET/CT alone, and combined MRI and PET/CT.

        2. To preliminary assess the potential value of PET/MR in predicting pMR to nT.

        3. To use radiomics analysis of PET/MR data to develop a quantification clinical tools that
           allow a more accurate and comprehensive assessment of RC patients.

    <description>whole-body PET/CT scan and pelvic PET/MR scan (MR protocol will include three plane fast spin echo T2 weighted, DWI and dynamic contrast enhanced imaging). The ad interim assessment will use a pelvic PET/MR scan only (without PET/CT), to avoid the radiation associated with whole body CT. In the staging and post-nT assessment, the addition of PET/MR to the standard use of PET/CT adds no radiation exposure.</description>
