      Researchers are trying to determine if heart injury occurs in subjects with cardiac
      implantable electronic device (CIED), such as a pacemaker or implantable cardioverter
      defibrillator (ICD), who undergo a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

      With an aging population and growing indications for both MRI and CIEDs, it is estimated that
      patients with a CIED will have up to a 75% likelihood to meet some indication for MRI during
      their lifetime. MRI in patients with CIEDs has been increasingly shown to be a viable option
      in a variety of clinical circumstances under strict protocols and close monitoring. It is
      uncertain if MRI results in myocardial injury. Injury could occur due to heating of the
      lead(s) with myocardial heating and injury occurring at the lead tip.

      A previous Mayo study published in 2016 showed no significant changes in cardiac troponin
      levels in the majority of patients with a CIED when MRI was performed. This study however was
      done using the older, less sensitive troponin assay. Unpublished data from the Mayo ED showed
      an increase in diagnosis of acute myocardial injury from 39% to 62% after implementation of
      the new hs-cTnT assay, reflecting its increased sensitivity. The previous Mayo study was also
      a retrospective study, and thus the data gathered was not as rigorously controlled as might
      be ideal.

      Serum or plasma samples remaining after initial analysis will be frozen and stored at -80
      degrees Celsius for 120 months (10 years). These samples may be used if there are new and
      more sensitive biomarkers of myocardial injury that become available.
