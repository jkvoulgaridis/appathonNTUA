  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify patient and provider-chosen factors that put
      patients at risk for the development of hypoxemia (oxygen saturation &lt; 90% for 5 seconds)
      during endoscopy and to use this knowledge to develop a treatment protocol for specific
      causes of hypoxemia in adult esophagogastroduodenoscopy outpatients.
