  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The first-in-human study of [18F]GP1 positron emission tomography/computed tomography
      (PET/CT) showed that [18F]GP1 is safe and promising novel PET tracer for imaging acute venous
      thromboembolism with favorable biodistribution and pharmacokinetics in patients. The goal of
      this phase 2 study is to evaluate whether [18F]GP1 PET/CT is sensitive and specific for the
      diagnosis of acute deep vein thrombosis in the appropriate patient population and clinical
      setting. This study will provide preliminary evidence of efficacy and expand the safety
      database in a larger group of patients who were suspected of having acute deep vein
      thrombosis. This study will further optimize image acquisition techniques, and develop
      methods and criteria by which [18F]GP1 PET/CT will be evaluated. Other critical questions
      about [18F]GP1 biodistribution including [18F]GP1 uptake in pulmonary and systemic arteries
      will be evaluated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is an open label, non-randomized, single center, intervention study. An estimated
      63 symptomatic subjects with a pretest score of deep vein thrombosis likely (Wells score ≥ 2)
      or a positive D-dimer test will receive [18F]GP1 PET/CT to evaluate the diagnostic validity
      of [18F]GP1 PET/CT for detecting deep vein thrombosis foci in lower extremities.

      The study comprises 3 periods: screening, treatment, and follow-up. The screening period
      starts with the patient's signature on the informed consent form and ends with assignment to
      treatment that is inclusion of the subject for treatment. The treatment period starts with
      baseline measurements, and ends with the last measurement/procedure on the day of intravenous
      injection of 250 MBq of [18F]GP1. The follow-up period contains the end-of-study interview.
      Key measurement is the PET/CT image acquisition about 120 minutes after the single injection
      of [18F]GP1 This study includes venous ultrasonography of deep vein thrombosis as a valid
      reference standard. [18F]GP1 PET/CT will be assessed qualitatively and quantitatively by
      three experienced readers.

      This study will be monitored regularly by a clinical research associate from the sponsor or a
      designated contract research organization. Data quality and study integrity will be assessed.
      The investigator will document the items that are required to evaluate the study in the
      subject files. Data required according to this protocol are to be recorded on the case report
      forms provided by the sponsor as soon as possible.

                  impossible.

               -  Additive-related precautions: This investigational product contains sodium
                  bisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including
                  anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in
                  certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the
                  general population is unknown and probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more
                  frequently in asthmatic than in nonasthmatic people.
