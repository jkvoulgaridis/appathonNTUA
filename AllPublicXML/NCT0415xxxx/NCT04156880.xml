  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer among women in worldwide and the second leading
      cause of cancer-related death.

      As the corner stone of BC screening, mammography is recognized as one of useful imaging
      modalities to reduce BC mortality, by virtue of early detection of BC. However, mammography
      interpretation is inherently subjective assessment, and prone to overdiagnosis.

      In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI)-Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems,
      characterized by embedded deep-learning algorithms, have entered into the field of BC
      screening as an aid for radiologist, with purpose to optimize conventional CAD system with
      weakness of hand-crafted features extraction. For now, stand-alone performance of novel
      AI-CAD tools have demonstrated promising accuracy and efficiency in BC diagnosis, largely
      attributed to utilization of convolution neural network(CNNs), and some of them have already
      achieved radiologist-like level. On the other hand, radiologists' performance on BC screening
      has shown to be enhanced, by leveraging AI-CAD system as decision support tool. As increasing
      implementation of commercial AI-CAD system, robust evaluation of its usefulness and
      cost-effectiveness in clinical circumstances should be undertaken in scenarios mimicking real
      life before broad adoption, like other emerging and promising technologies. This requires to
      validate AI-CAD systems in BC screening on multiple, diverse and representative datasets and
      also to estimate the interface between reader and system. This proposed study seeks to
      investigate the breast cancer diagnostic performance of AI-CAD system used for reading
      mammograms. In this work, we will employ a commercially available AI-CAD tool based on
      deep-learning algorithms (IBM Watson Imaging AI Solution) to identify and characterize the
      suspicious breast lesions on mammograms. The potential cancer lesions can be labeled and
      their mammographic features and malignancy probability will be automatically reported. After
      AI post-processing, we shall further carry out statistical analysis to determine the accuracy
      of AI-CAD system for BC risk prediction.

        This is a single institutional retrospective cohort study of patients with mammographic
        examinations. All patients' data will be retrieved via the electronic patient database of
        our institution. Patient demographics, imaging and histological data, disease and treatment
        history will be recorded, including age at onset, details of chemotherapy, time interval of
        metastasis from diagnosis, surgery for the primary tumor, the length of survival, clinical
        outcome and so on.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women who had undergone standard mammography including craniocaudal (CC) and
             mediolateral oblique (MLO) views..

          -  Histopathology-proven diagnosis is available for patients with breast malignancy,
             including invasive breast cancer, carcinoma in situ, and borderline lesion et al.

          -  As reference standard of benign nature, results from pathology or clinical long-term
             follow-up (&gt;=2 years) examinations are available for cases without breast malignancy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with concurring lesions on mammograms that may influence subsequent AI
             post-process.

          -  Patients without available pathologic diagnosis or long-term follow-up (&gt;=2 years)
             examinations.

          -  Patients who had undergone breast surgical intervention (e.g. lumpectomy and
             mammoplasty) prior to first mammography.

          -  Patients diagnosed with other kinds of malignancy, concurrent with metastasis or
             infiltration/invasion to breast.
