      The study was conducted to assess the influence of aerobic exercise on inhibitory control of
      executive functions in spastic hemiplegic cerebral palsy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inhibitory control of executive functions (EF) is one of the main specific cognitive
      impairments that affect children with cerebral palsy, cognitive skills begin to develop in
      infancy and continuing through the pre-school years, childhood and into adolescence it
      changes across the lifespan of an individual and has great effect on their participation and
      quality of life. The aim of study was to assess the influence of aerobic exercise on
      inhibitory control of executive functions in spastic hemiplegic cerebral palsy. Sixty
      children with spastic hemiplegic cerebral palsy were enrolled in this study and were assessed
      for eligibility. Their aged ranged from seven and eleven years. They were assigned randomly
      into two equal groups. Group (A) the study group received aerobic exercise in addition to
      selected physical therapy program. And group (B) the control group received the same selected
      physical therapy program only. The treatment was conducted for one hour, three times / weak
      for three successful months. Eriksen flanker test and Stroop Color-Word test were used to
      assess inhibitory control of EF pre and post treatment.

    <description>the Eriksen flanker task is a set of response inhibition tests used to assess the ability to suppress responses that are inappropriate in a particular context. The target is flanked by non-target stimuli which correspond either to the same directional response as the target (congruent flankers), to the opposite response (incongruent flankers), or to neither (neutral flankers).</description>

    <time_frame>Stroop Color-Word test was assessed at day 0, 90.</time_frame>
    <description>The Stroop Color and Word Test (SCWT) is a neuropsychological test extensively used to assess the ability to inhibit cognitive interference that occurs when the processing of a specific stimulus feature impedes the simultaneous processing of a second stimulus attribute, well-known as the Stroop Effect.</description>

    <description>Aerobic exercise refers to exercise that involves or improves oxygen consumption by the body. It is the type of activity that uses large muscle groups. Its performance is in a continuous and rhythmic way with a main goal to make the heart and lungs work harder than they do when the person at rest</description>
