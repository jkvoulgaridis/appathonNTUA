  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is growing interest in the utilization of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) as a
      novel, non-pharmacologic approach to decreasing alcohol use among treatment-seeking
      individuals with Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD). The results of this study will be used to
      determine which of the 2 proposed TMS strategies has a larger effect on drinking behavior (%
      days abstinent, % heavy drinking days) as well as alcohol cue-reactivity in a 4 month period.
      These data will pave the way for TMS to be used as an innovative, new treatment option for
      individuals with AUD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is prevalent, devastating, and difficult to treat. The majority of
      the therapeutic approaches available to date have relied on pharmaceutical modulation or
      and/or psychotherapy. With a growing knowledge of the neural circuits that contribute to
      relapse in AUD, there is an emerging interest in developing a novel, neural-circuit specific
      therapeutic tool to enhance AUD treatment outcomes. The long term goal of the
      multidisciplinary research team is to develop an evidence-based brain stimulation treatment
      protocol which will improve AUD treatment outcomes. The competing neurobehavioral decision
      systems (CNDS) theory posits that in addiction, choice results from a regulatory imbalance
      between two decision-making systems (impulsive and executive) (25-27). These behavioral
      systems are functionally linked to two discrete frontal- striatal circuits which regulate
      limbic and executive control (28). Modulating these competing neural circuits (e.g. either
      dampening the limbic/impulsive system or amplifying the executive control system) may render
      alcohol users less vulnerable to relapse (43). These two frontal-striatal neural circuits -
      the limbic loop (ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC)-ventral striatum), and executive
      control loop (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC)-dorsal striatum) can be differentially
      stimulated by theta burst stimulation (TBS), a patterned form of transcranial magnetic
      stimulation (TMS) (15). Continuous TBS (cTBS) results in long term depression (LTD) of
      cortical excitability and intermittent TBS (iTBS) results in long term potentiation (LTP)
      (14).

      Over the past 7 years, through the scaffolding of a National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and
      Alcoholism (NIAAA) P50 Center and a strong Brain Stimulation Research program, the
      multidisciplinary group of clinicians and neuroscientists have demonstrated 1) it is possible
      to differentially activate these circuits through TMS/Blood oxygenation level dependent
      (BOLD) imaging (15), 2) LTD-like TMS (cTBS) to the vmPFC (Strategy 1) decreases orbitofrontal
      cortex and ventral striatal/accumbens BOLD signal in heavy alcohol users (14), 3) cTBS also
      decreases alcohol cue reactivity in this population (17), and 4) in AUD patients currently
      enrolled in intensive outpatient treatment, 10 days of cTBS to the vmPFC is feasible,
      well-tolerated, increases 1 and 2 month retention rates, and attenuates limbic brain
      reactivity to alcohol cues after 1 month (17). While these studies provide a strong
      foundation for pursuing a larger multisite trial of cTBS, the CNDS theory and other alcohol
      TMS studies suggests that the dlPLC may also be a fruitful treatment target (25-27).
      Recently, a sham-controlled pilot study compared the efficacy of vmPFC cTBS (Strategy 1) to
      dlPFC iTBS (Strategy 2), and demonstrated that a single session of dlPFC iTBS had a greater
      effect on the brain response to alcohol cues that vmPFC cTBS (15). To resolve this gap in the
      literature, this protocol will propose a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled clinical
      trial to evaluate the relative efficacy of these 2 strategies as novel tools to improve AUD
      treatment outcomes (e.g. percent days abstinent up to 4 months after treatment initiation).
      These outcomes will be measured with urine ethyl glucuronide (ETG) and carbohydrate-deficient
      transferrin (CDT) measurements. The brain reactivity to alcohol will also be used to evaluate
      the effect of these TBS treatments. The long-term vision is that TBS would be used as an
      adjuvant to behavioral treatment, enabling individuals to maximize the likelihood of
      behavioral change.

      180 treatment-seeking men and women enrolled in Wake Forest University (WFU) associated
      clinics, including the Department of Psychiatry Outpatient Program and Comprehensive Cancer
      Center, will be randomized to receive 20 sessions (2x/day; 10 days, 20 min intersession
      interval) of either real or sham TBS to the vmPFC (Aim 1, Strategy 1) of left dlPFC (Aim 2,
      Strategy 2) while they are enrolled in the outpatient treatment program. Randomization will
      occur during the 1st week of the outpatient program. Real/Sham TBS will be delivered
      immediately before their outpatient therapy visit during weeks 2 &amp; 3 of the program.
      Quantitative ETG will be collected daily. ETG and CDT will be collected monthly for 4 months.
      Additional assessments and brain reactivity to alcohol cues will be measured at 4 time
      points: before TMS treatment (Outpatient program, week 1), after TMS treatment (week 5), and
      at the 3 monthly Follow Up visits. Building on recent pilot data, the investigators will test
      the hypotheses that for both Strategy 1 &amp; 2, real TBS will improve AUD treatment outcomes
      significantly more than sham. Analysis will be performed using repeated measures analysis of
      variance (ANOVA) on change scores from baseline for each visit. The main independent variable
      in the ANOVA will be time (visits on day 1, 6, 10), group (vmPFC vs. dlPFC TBS vs. sham) and
      their interaction.

      Aim 1 (Strategy 1): Modulating the limbic system: vmPFC cTBS. The investigators will evaluate
      effect of vmPFC cTBS, relative to sham, on number of days abstinent (primary outcome) and
      heavy drinking days in 30 day intervals for 4 months. Participants will receive stimulation
      over the left frontal pole (EEG 10-20 system: FP1). This location has been used in previous
      studies in alcohol users which demonstrate vmPFC target engagement.

      Aim 2 (Strategy 2): Modulating the executive system: dlPFC iTBS. The investigators will
      evaluate the effect of dlPFC iTBS, relative to sham, on the parameters listed. iTBS will be
      delivered over the left dlPFC (EEG 10-20 system: F3) as this location has also been validated
      to reliable result in target engagement by the investigators.

      Exploratory Aim- Baseline alcohol cue reactivity as a mediator of TBS clinical response. The
      investigators will test the hypotheses that individuals with a higher ratio of
      (dlPFC-striatal)/(vmPFC-striatal) response to alcohol cues will be more likely to have a
      change in drinking after Strategy 2.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age 21- 65 (to maximize participation from the cohort of individuals seeking alcohol
             treatment through intensive outpatient programs: Scalp- to-Cortex distance will be
             included as a covariate to calculate adjusted TMS dose given expected cortical atrophy
             in heavy alcohol users and older adults).

          2. Meets the DSM V criteria for having a current AUD, determined by DSM- V criteria,
             using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-V.

          3. Currently enrolled or scheduled to enroll in intensive outpatient program affiliated
             with Wake Forest University (WFU). Subjects who withdraw from the treatment program
             will no longer be allowed to participate in the study.

          4. Consumption of more than 14 drinks (women) or 21 drinks (men) per week, with at least
             2 heavy drinking days (defined as ≥ 4 drinks for women and ≥ 5 for men) during the
             30-days prior to enrolling in the intensive outpatient program.

          5. Able to read and understand questionnaires, assessments, and the informed consent.

          6. No elevated risk of seizure (i.e., CIWA questionnaire &lt;5, does not have a history of
             seizures, is not currently prescribed medications known to lower seizure threshold).

          7. Not currently prescribed chlorpromazine, clozapine, olanzapine, aminophylline,
             pethidine, fentanyl due to their effects on cortical excitability.

          8. No presence of metal objects in the head/neck.

          9. No history of traumatic brain injury, including a head injury which resulted in
             hospitalization, loss of consciousness for more than 10 minutes, or having ever been

             symptoms of anxiety.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Currently meets DSM V criteria for moderate or severe substance use disorder in the
             past six months for any psychoactive substance other than alcohol.

          2. Any psychoactive substance use (except marijuana and nicotine) within the last 30 days
             by self-report and urine drug screen. For marijuana, no use within the last seven days

             psychotic disorder or organic mental disorder. [Note: The inclusion of subjects with
             affective and anxiety disorders is essential because of the marked frequency of the
             co-existence of mood and other anxiety disorders among patients with AUD at large
             (including those in the outpatient program).

             exclusionary criterion is for scientific rather than safety or patient comfort
             reasons. Although some physicians involved in intensive outpatient programs prescribe
             naltrexone as applicable to patients, many individuals are not interested in
             medication management. In the pilot study included in the Research Strategy only 2 of
             the 42 individuals who enrolled in the study were given naltrexone at any point during
             the outpatient program or in aftercare].

         12. History of claustrophobia.

         13. History of traumatic brain injury, including a head injury that resulted in
