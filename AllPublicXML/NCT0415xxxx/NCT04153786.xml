  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Certain patients with congestive heart failure are treated both by implantation of an LVAD,
      as well as implantation with a biventricular pacemaker. Both of these devices, individually,
      have been shown to improve the health of patients with heart failure. However, only a small
      number of patients have both an LVAD and a biventricular pacemaker at the same time.

      Pacemakers have many different settings. However, there is little data to inform physicians
      which of these different settings is best for the flow of an LVAD. This study is evaluating
      patients who have both a biventricular pacemaker and an LVAD. Investigators will operate the
      pacemaker at multiple different settings and monitor the LVAD's function to determine which,
      if any, setting is best for the LVAD's flow.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) with a biventricular pacemaker has been
      well-validated to improve symptoms and reduce death in select patients with heart failure. In
      healthy adults, the two chambers of the heart which pump blood throughout the body (the left
      and right ventricles) activate and contract together in synchronous fashion. In certain
      patients with heart failure (specifically, those with a reduced ejection fraction), the left
      and right ventricles no longer activate and contract synchronously. CRT restores ventricular
      synchrony by simultaneously activating the left (LV) and right ventricles (RV) with
      electrical pacing.

      Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are used to provide mechanical support to patients
      with more advanced, often end-stage, heart failure. In these cases, the heart's ventricles
      function so poorly that even despite all standard therapies (including CRT), patients
      experience symptoms of congestive heart failure even at rest. The LVAD suctions blood from
      the ventricle and propels it into the aorta, offloading the ventricle and assisting its
      function.

      Due to the similar reasons for using each therapy, a number of patients already possess a
      biventricular pacemaker at the time of LVAD implantation. Individually, each intervention is
      known to improve both patient survival and functional status. However, there is sparse data
      to evaluate the effectiveness of using both devices simultaneously. Specifically, no data is
      yet available assessing the effect of CRT on the functional parameters of the LVAD.

      This protocol will operate the biventricular pacemaker at various settings and assess for
      changes in the LVAD's function in response to those settings. &quot;Fine-tuning&quot; and identifying
      the ideal the pacemaker settings will maximize clinical benefit in patients with both
      devices.

    <description>During the patient's routine clinic visit, investigators will adjust the patient's pacemaker to four different settings and monitor for any changes in the function of the LVAD.
The pacemaker will be set to each new setting for 2-5 minutes. After this, the pacemaker will be returned to its original / pre-existing setting, and the patient will leave the clinic with no overall changes to the settings of either the pacemaker or LVAD.
However, if investigators find that one of the four pacemaker settings results in a clear improvement in the LVAD function, the patient will be given the option of resetting their pacemaker to that new setting before leaving the clinic. In either case, the LVAD settings will not be altered at all. The adjustments will be made by the regular device staff who routinely see the patients and maintain their devices during their regular follow-up clinic visits.</description>
