  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is uncontrolled, interventional feasibility study for determining the effects medical
      music on anxiety levels in subjects with ILD. Enrolled subjects will be asked to complete
      questionnaires and undergo physiologic measurements prior to listening to medical music. The
      music intervention will be for approximately 30 minutes. Post intervention questionnaires and
      physiologic measurements will be done.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Medical Music intervention includes playlists that contains songs specifically designed,
      recorded, and optimized through the provisionally-patented methods, to treat their co-morbid
      anxiety. The duration of the medical music playlist is 30 minutes.

      Enrolled subjects will be asked to complete questionnaires to assess anxiety, a questionnaire
      related to their music preferences, and undergo physiological measurements (vital signs,
      galvanic skin response, and heart rate variability) before and after the intervention.

    <description>The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory Questionnaire is a psychological inventory based on a 4-point Likert scale and consists of 40 questions on a self-report basis. It measures two types of anxiety - state anxiety, or anxiety about an event, and trait anxiety, or anxiety level as a personal characteristic.</description>

    <description>The VAS-A is a psychometric response scale to measure respondents level of anxiety and stress by indicating a position along a continuous line between two end-points (&quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;extremely&quot;).</description>
