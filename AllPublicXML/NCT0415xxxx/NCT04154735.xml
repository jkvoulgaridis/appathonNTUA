      This study is a new Phase II trial to assess the toxicity and efficacy of autologous
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) utilizing a new non-myeloablative conditioning
      regimen in patients with high-risk Crohn's disease (CD). The regimen will include low-dose
      immunosuppressive therapy and a targeted antibiotic for six to twelve months post-HSCT.

      The autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in this study utilizes a new
      non-myeloablative conditioning regimen in patients with high-risk Crohn's disease (CD). The
      regimen includes two types of chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide and fludarabine) as well as
      alemtuzumab. The regimen will include low-dose immunosuppressive therapy with tacrolimus
      (Prograf) for one year post-HSCT in attempt to prevent relapse and improve long-term
      remission. Patients will also receive rifaximin (Xifaxan) for six months post-HSCT to target
      abnormal intestinal microbiota that may trigger intestinal inflammation. The ability of these
      experimental treatments to stop relapses and progression (worsening) of Crohn's disease will
      be assessed.

    <description>Hematopoietic Stem Cell Therapy will be performed as follows: Autologous stem cells will be infused after conditioning with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, mesna, and alemtuzumab. Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) will be administered post-transplant until engraftment. Rifaximin and tacrolimus will be administered for 6 and 12 months, respectively, beginning one day before the infusion of stem cells.</description>

             Disease

         13. Major hematological abnormalities such as platelet count &lt; 100,000/ul or absolute
             neutrophil count (ANC) &lt; 1500/ul

             gastrointestinal function is inadequate to maintain nutrient and hydration status
             without intravenous or enteral supplementation.

         18. History of anorexia nervosa (serum albumin ≤ 20 g/L, body mass index ≤ 18)

             will require urgent surgery. The presence of intestinal stomas, strictures, or
             fistulae does not exclude the patient from study.
