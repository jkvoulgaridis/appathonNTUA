    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well bendamustine and rituximab in combination with copanlisib work in
      treating patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma. Drugs used
      in chemotherapy, such as bendamustine and rituximab, work in different ways to stop the
      growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by
      stopping them from spreading. Copanlisib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some
      of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving bendamustine and rituximab with copanlisib may
      work better than bendamustine and rituximab alone in treating chronic lymphocytic leukemia or
      small lymphocytic lymphoma.

      This is a dose de-escalation study of copanlisib.

      Patients receive copanlisib intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15 or days 1 and
      15 (depending on dose level). Patients also receive rituximab IV on day 1 and bendamustine IV
      on days 1 and 2 of cycles 1-4. Patients who achieve at least a partial response
      (MRD-positive) continue on treatment for 2 additional cycles. Treatment repeats every 28 days
      for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning
      cycle 7, patients receive copanlisib IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 15 for an additional 6
      cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 14 days, then periodically
      for up to 3 years.
