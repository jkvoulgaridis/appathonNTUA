  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 study to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of V937 administered
      both intratumorally (IT) and intravenously (IV) as combination therapy with pembrolizumab
      (MK-3475) versus pembrolizumab alone in anti-programmed cell death ligand 1
      (anti-PD-L1)-treatment-naive participants with advanced/metastatic melanoma. The primary
      hypothesis of the study is that V937 administered either IT or IV in combination with
      pembrolizumab results in a superior objective response rate (ORR) per Response Evaluation
      Criteria In Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) based on blinded independent central review
      (BICR), compared to pembrolizumab alone.
