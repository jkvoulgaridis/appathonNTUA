  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common complication of malignancies, in particular to lung
      cancer. Patients with lung cancer in surgical and medical departments are at high risk of VTE
      development. Prophylaxis is one major way to to prevent it. Currently, VTE prophylaxis is
      mainly based on VTE-risk assessment. However, all patients hospitalized for cancer are at
      intermediate or high risk of VTE but their bleeding risk vary. To improve effect of VTE
      prophylaxis and reduce bleeding events in patients with lung cancer, we will conduct an
      open-label parallel randomized clinical tria to assess the effect of bleeding risk based
      prophylaxis strategy among lung cancer patients. We hypothesize that VTE prophylaxis based on
      bleeding risk assessment with a short post-discharge treatment course is superior to VTE
      propohylaxis based on VTE risk assessment among hospitalized patients with lung cancer

      A sample of 3200 eligible patients will be randomized into experimental or control group with
      an allocation rate of 1:1. Stratified by medical/surgical units, block randomization with a
      varying block size of 4 or 6 will be adopted to randomize patients into experimental or
      control group. In experimental group, patients will undergo bleeding risk assessment and
      receive prophylaxis according to bleeding risk during hospitalization, and they will also
      receive an extended pharmacological prophylaxis of 5mg Rivaroxaban once daily for up to 15
      consecutive days after discharge. In control group, patients will receive routine VTE
      prophylaxis, VTE risk assessment and prophylaxis if indicated during hospitalization
      according to current policies for hospitals in China but no further treatment prophylaxis
      after discharge.

      Patients in both groups will be followed up for 30 days. The primary outcome is symptomatic
      and asymptomatic objectively proven VTE (deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and/or pulmonary embolism
      (PE)) within 30 days after initiation of randomization. Ultrasound and CTPA will be performed
      to detect DVT and PE, respectively. Clinically relevant bleeding (non-major clinically
      relevant and major bleeding, HIT) and death are secondary outcomes.

      Randomization and sequence generation A computerized random-number generator will be used to
      generate the allocation sequence. In this multicenter trial involving 10 hospitals,
      randomization procedures will be organized centrally.

      Stratified block randomization with a varying block size of 4 or 6 will be used to allocate
      patients into experimental or control group. Patients with lung cancer will be stratified
      into those under planned medical or surgical treatments.

      In each stratum, patients will be blocked according to their admission sequence. Four or six
      patients consecutively admitted will be one block depending on the block size. In each block,
      patients will be randomly allocated into experimental or control group according to sequence
      generated in advance by software.

      Allocation concealment/Blinded randomization Patient assignments will be enclosed in a
      sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes (SNOSE). Clinicians in charge of patient
      enrollment will not know the allocation sequence until eligible patients who meet inclusion
      and exclusion criteria are enrolled.

      An independent statistician will generate the random allocation sequence. Physicians will
      enroll participants and assign interventions in experimental or control group.

      Blinding/Open label This is an open-label trial that patients, clinicians and researchers
      will know allocation assignments after enrollment. But imaging experts providing the duplex
      ultrasound and CTPA results will be blinded in order to objectively assess the 30-day
      CTPA-proven VTE incidence and other outcomes in both groups. An independent data monitoring
      board will evaluate the trial data and safety.

    <description>Patients will undergo a bleeding risk assessment to determine their entering VTE prophylaxis. Low bleeding risk patients will have once daily sc LMWH prophylaxis. Intermediate bleeding risk patients will have q 12 h sc low dose unfractionated heparin prophylaxis. High bleeding risk patients will have mechanical prophylaxis. Assigned prophylaxis can be interrupted as clinical judgement requires, e.g., for peri-procedural reasons. When patients are discharged, if they have low risk of bleeding at the time of discharge, whatever their bleeding risk assessment at the time of randomization, will begin 5 mg rivaroxaban prophylaxis (two 2.5 mg tablets) once daily with food, starting on the day of discharge, for 15 days.</description>
