  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study aims at comparing the bioavailability of three different formulations of the
      omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). The three
      formulations are ethyl ester (EE), triglyceride (TG) and monoglyceride (MAG). Thirty six (36)
      subjects will be divided in three groups of twelve subjects each equally divided in two study
      sites. Each group will be taking one of the three different formulations of EPA+DHA at a
      daily dose of 1.5g for a period of 12 weeks. Bioavailability will be measured through omega-3
      index (total content of EPA + DHA in red blood cell membranes) at baseline and every four
      weeks during treatment.

      This pilot study aims at comparing the bioavailability of three different formulations of a
      combination of omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)
      in a standardized proportion of 460:200. The three formulations are ethyl ester (EE),
      triglyceride (TG) and monoglyceride (MAG) versions of these fatty acids. The formulations are
      prepared in a way to be similar in proportion of EPA/DHA, in dose and in appearance. Thirty
      six (36) subjects will be divided in three groups of twelve subjects each, equally divided in
      two study sites. The study will be randomized and double blinded. Each group will be taking
      one of the three different formulations of EPA+DHA at a daily dose of 1.5g for a period of 12
      weeks. Bioavailability will be measured through omega-3 index (total content of EPA + DHA in
      red blood cell membranes) at baseline and every four weeks during treatment. After
      recruitment, subjects will be seen in clinic every four weeks for a total of four (4) study
      visits during which a blood sample will be taken for analysis of the omega-3 index, the
      investigational product will be returned and dispensed and finally, adverse events will be
      noted and followed. Treatment will be self-administered by subjects at home. They will be
      asked to keep a journal of adverse events, concomitant medication and to note every missed
      dose as well as significant changes in life habits (smoking, alcohol, sports, food diet and
      natural health products intake).

    <time_frame>12 weeks per subject</time_frame>
    <description>The Omega-3 index (ratio of EPA + DHA content on total fatty acids in red blood cells) will be measured throughout the study (at baseline and every four weeks afterwards) for each subjects. The average value in canadian population is 4.5%, however, for an optimized health, the desired index should be between 8 and 12% of omega-3 in cell membranes. The average omega-3 index curves obtained for each group will be compared to determine which formulation offers the best absorption of omega-3 in the organism.</description>

    <description>Subjects will be questioned about any changes in their health status throughout the study, and for the 30 days following the end of treatment. All adverse events will recorded and evaluated for severity, causality and expectedness. All serious adverse events will be reported as required.</description>
