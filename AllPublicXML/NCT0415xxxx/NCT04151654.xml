  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Proper footwear serves to protect the foot against external factors. Balance and functional
      performance are affected by the level of footwear suitability. This study was designed to
      investigate the effects of footwear suitability on functional performance levels and balance
      in the elderly.

    <textblock>
      The function of proper a footwear is to protect the foot against external factors. Balance
      and functional performance are affected by the level of footwear suitability. Particularly in
      elderly who have generally balance disorders and falling, footwear suitability is very
      important. Thus this study was designed to investigate the effects of footwear suitability on
      functional performance level and balance in elderly. The Footwear Assessment Score was used
      to assess parameters such as the design materials for footwear (upper and base), bending
      point, width, height of the toe box, getting out of the foot when walking, heel height,
      footwear style, wearing of the heel, and the distance between the longest toe and the end of
      the footwear. Thus, footwear was evaluated in many parameters.

      In the literature, there are studies in which footwear was evaluated in only parameter such
      as height of heel.

    <intervention_model_description>The demographic information of the individuals (age, gender, height, body weight, body mass index (BMI), educational status) were recorded. Footwear suitability was evaluated with the Footwear Assessment Score. Subjects were assessed using the Sharpened Romberg test and Single Leg Stance test for static balance, Berg Balance Scale for dynamic balance, and Timed Up and Go test for functional performance. Balance and performance tests were done with and without footwear in all individuals. The wearing duration of footwear and accompanying disease was also recorded, and crossover methods were used for assessing balance and functional tests, with and without footwear.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>It was used to assess parameters such as the design materials for footwear (upper and base), bending point, width, height of the toe box, getting out of the foot when walking, heel height, footwear style, wearing of the heel, and the distance between the longest toe and the end of the footwear. A score of 30 on the scale represents the highest suitability level and the score taken from the scale indicates the suitability level of the footwear.</description>

    <measure>Berg Balance Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, average one hour</time_frame>
    <description>Test was used to evaluate participants' ability to maintain their balance when performing functional activities. A BERG score of 0 and 4 points for each variable assessed represents safe and independent execution of assigned tasks (normal performance), and unsafe and dependent execution of assigned tasks (unable to perform a task), respectively. This amounts to a total score of 56 points.The Turkish version of the scale was used and a cumulative score of 0-20 indicates high risk, 21-40 moderate risk and 41-56 low risk. The test was repeated twice; with and without footwear.</description>

    <measure>Functional Performance Evaluation</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, average one hour</time_frame>
    <description>Timed Up and Go test (TUG) was used for evaluation of the functional performance. This test is important in terms of the assessment of mobility and balance. The participants were asked to stand from a sitting position, walk 3 m, turn back and sit back to the chair again. The test shows that it is an independent and reliable, as it involves most activities in everyday life. Duration of test was recorded. the performance duration was defined as normal balance (up to 12 s), good balance (up to 10 s) impaired balance (11-20 s) impaired balance-low risk of falling (11-20 s), and high risk of falling (longer than 20 s).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sharpened Romberg</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, average one hour</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were asked to remain standing, on a straight line with one leg behind the other leg, leaving the arms sagging and without impairing the balance. Four measurements involving; right foot at behind with footwear, right foot at behind without footwear, left foot at behind with footwear, and left foot at behind without footwear were taken. Duration stop criteria were defined as the time it took a participant to dislocate the foot, reach the maximal duration of 30 sec, and contact the observer to avoid falling. h-Higher scores mean a better outcome.</description>

    <description>Duration of standing was measured in participants standing with dangling arms, with and without footwear. Maximal duration of test is 30 sec. Higher scores mean a better outcome.</description>
