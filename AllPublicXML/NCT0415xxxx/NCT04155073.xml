  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this work is to develop, refine, and pilot test an electronic visit (e-visit) to:
      1) deliver smoking cessation treatment to adults at risk for COPD and 2) to improve rates of
      COPD early detection and accurate diagnosis. The investigators will conduct a pilot RCT of
      the COPD/smoking cessation e-visit as compared to treatment as usual (TAU), with primary
      objective to provide effect size estimates for a larger RCT.

    <description>This group will be sent 1) an invitation to complete an electronic visit (e-visit) focused on cigarette smoking, quitting smoking, and respiratory symptoms, 2) an invitation to complete a follow-up e-visit one-month after the initial e-visit, and if needed, 3) a home spirometry test with instructions on how to video themselves completing a lung functioning test via the device within an additional e-visit.</description>
