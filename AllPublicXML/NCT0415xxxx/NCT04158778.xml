      The Safety, Tolerability and Role of MDMA-Assisted Psychotherapy for the treatment of
      detoxified patients with Alcohol Use Disorder.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label within-subject feasibility study, in 20 patients with Alcohol Use
      Disorder who have recently undergone detoxification. All patients will receive MDMA-Assisted
      drug therapy. This study aims to assess if MDMA-Assisted Psychotherapy can be delivered
      safely and can be tolerated by patients with alcohol use disorder post-detoxification.
      Outcomes regarding abstinence from alcohol, quality of life and psychosocial functioning will
      be evaluated.

          -  Be able to identify in advance a supportive significant other(s):

               -  who could accompany the patient to study visits if required -who can be contacted
                  by the study team in order to remind the patient about follow- up appointments or
                  collect outcome data (such as drinking behaviour) in the event that the patient
                  themselves cannot be contacted.

          -  Proficient in speaking and reading English.

          -  Agree to comply with requirements of protocol.

          -  Present a serious suicide risk; this will be determined using the clinical judgement
             of the qualified mental health professionals within the research team. They will use
             information from the Columbia-Suicide Severity Risk Scale (C-SSRS) which allows
             classification of severity of suicidal ideation and behaviour. This scale classifies
             severe risk as a) current suicidal ideation with intent and/or plan; b) suicidal
             behaviour in the last 3 months. A clinical judgement regarding the level of risk and
             subsequent decisions regarding eligibility and care would use a combination of the
             information provided by the C-SSRS, the participant's history of previous risk
             behaviours, any presenting mental health difficulties and environmental and clinical
             factors. A final decision would usually include a discussion with qualified mental
             health professionals within the research team.

          -  Currently taking or unwilling/unable to stop any medications inhibiting CYP 2D6, and
             the following medications Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors, Ritonavir (HIV treatment),
             paroxetine, fluoxetine, citalopram, regular benzodiazepines or any other medications
             likely to interact with MDMA the opinion of the investigators, during 8 week MDMA
             assisted therapy only

          -  Regular use of/dependence on other drugs such as benzodiazepines, synthetic
             cannabinoids, cocaine and heroin.

          -  For females of childbearing age/potential

               -  Must use an effective form of birth control for at least six days after

          -  For males with partners of childbearing age/potential

               -  Must themselves confirm use of an effective form of birth control for at least
                  six days after administration of MDMA and confirm their partner will also,
                  defined in detail in protocol.

          -  Taken part in a study involving an investigational product in the last three months

          -  Patients that might face additional risks from immunosuppression (for example patients
             with immunological diseases, patients with active infection or history of infections
             within 4 weeks of MDMA administration, etc).
