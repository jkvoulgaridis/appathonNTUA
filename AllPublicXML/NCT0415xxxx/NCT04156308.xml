  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Spain cervical pain affects practically 20% of the population annually, while globally it
      is estimated that between 22% and 77% of the population will suffer cervical pain at some
      point in their life. Prevalence increases with age, and is more common in women than in men
      (1.6: 1). Although the natural evolution of cervical pain tends to improve, the rates of
      recurrence and chronicity are high. And therefore it becomes an anatomical region of interest
      in relation to the assessment of the effectiveness and / or effectiveness of the osteopathic
      therapeutic approach. Different studies prove the efficacy of various manual therapy
      techniques applied on the cervical and / or upper dorsal region, suggesting significant
      positive changes in cervical pain and mobility levels in patients with nonspecific cervical
      pain. It is necessary to bear in mind that the reality of the osteopathic approach to the
      patient is not limited to the use of a single technique, but that the treatment is formed
      from a set of them. The ultimate goal is to restore mobility and functionality to a specific
      region, especially taking into account the concepts of individuality and holism.

      A pragmatic experimental comparative trial with three branches of study (osteopathic
      treatment with 2 different dosages versus active muscle exercise) is proposed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At the beginning of the 1st session, a battery of questions will be made as an anamnesis with
      the objective of evidencing possible risk factors at the therapeutic level. The presence of
      one or more risk factors will suppose the exclusion of the patient from the study.

      Next, a brief osteopathic musculoskeletal evaluation will be made to the patient. This
      exploration will follow a standardized protocol for all patients in the experimental groups
      (1 and 2).

      The tests to be carried out will be:

        -  Observation (standing patient):

             -  Assessment of the anterior projection of the head

             -  Assessment of the variation in the physiological curves of the spine

        -  Active test of the cervical spine with the patient in a sitting position.

           o Flexo-Extension / Rotations / Lateral inclinations

        -  Segmental test of joint mobility of the cervical and dorsal spine (patient in sitting
           and supine position)

        -  Passive mobility test of the cervical spine (patient in the supine position):

             -  Flexo-Extension / Rotations / Lateral inclinations

      The combination of exercises scheduled at home for all groups is based on the conclusions of
      different studies, and will consist of:

        -  Self-resisted active exercise in flexion, rotations and inclinations of the cervical
           spine.

        -  Active mobility in its maximum travel (without forcing pain) in flexion, rotations and
           inclinations of the cervical spine.

        -  Stretching upper trapezius muscles and scalenes.

        -  Active mobility in circumferential joints of the glenohumeral joint, and in
           flexo-extension of the thoracic spine.

      The work schedule will be carried out for 7 weeks, at a rate of 5 sessions per week.

      It will be the patient himself who will keep a diary record of the activity carried out
      during the weeks that the trial lasts. The diary will be facilitated by the therapists, and
      in it the exercises to be performed will be indicated.

      For groups 1 and 2, a total of 3 techniques selected from a list of 7 available techniques
      common to all centers will be applied in each session. The choice of techniques will be based
      on the results of the examination performed, the particularities of the patient and the
      clinical experience of the osteopath. In each session the techniques can change under the
      criteria of the osteopath. However, they will always be 3 and always within the list of
      available techniques.

      available techniques.

      The OMT (Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment) techniques that may be applied will be the
      following:

        1. Technique of Inhibition of the suboccipital muscles

        2. Functional technique for the middle and deep cervical fascia

        3. High-speed cervical spine technique (Cervical wheel C1-C6)

        4. High-speed technique in the cervico-dorsal junction (prone position)

        5. High speed technique in dorsal column (D1-D12) - (Dog Technique)

        6. Muscle stretching technique of the diaphragm (supine decubitus)

        7. Thorax joint mobility technique (long lever)

      Main Variable:

      o Neck Disability Index (NDI). The investigators establish the minimum change to be detected
      (minimum clinically relevant change) at 5 points. The Spanish version of the NDI will be
      used, validated by Andrade Ortega et al.24

      Secondary Variable:

      o Degree of general quality of life, through the &quot;SF-36&quot; Health Survey25.

      The data will be reported in the form of a report by the patient himself, who will receive
      via e-mail (whenever possible) or in printed form the questionnaire to be completed and will
      deliver to the same center in which the intervention has been carried out.

    <masking_description>A double masking is proposed. Three active interventions are compared. The patients will be blinded in relation to the study group they belong to, ensuring the masking of the participants.
The data that is intended to be obtained for its analysis are of a self-reported nature and will be collected and administered by an external investigator not linked to the interventions, ensuring the masking of the evaluator.
Due to the nature of the interventions, masking of therapists is not possible.</masking_description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The sample will be formed by patients between the ages of 18 and 75 years, who present
             cervical pain of any intensity and duration, and with a minimum score of 10 points on
             the Neck Disability Index (NDI)14,15.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who present at the time of recruitment other pathologies or elements that may
             condition cervical pain, such as: acute shoulder tendinopathy, cervical radiculopathy,
             chronic diseases of general musculoskeletal involvement (Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and
             / or Fibromyalgia). Similarly, patients suffering from any type of vertiginous
             syndrome, who have suffered a whiplash in the last year or who are or have been under
             treatment for cervical pain in the last 3 months will also be excluded.

        The taking of anti-inflammatories by the patient is not taken as a measure of exclusion. If
        the patient is under pharmacological treatment, it will be recorded and will be taken into
        account as a co-intervention. However, this treatment will not be modified under any
        circumstances nor will it be grounds for exclusion from the study.
