      This Open-label, Randomized, Multicenter, Controlled, Parallel, Comparative Study will
      compare the efficacy and safety of intravenous treatment with Isoniazid, Rifampicin,
      Ethambutol first two months of intensive phase of tuberculosis treatment and the treatment
      with the oral forms of Isoniazid, Rifampicin, Ethambutol first two months of intensive phase
      of tuberculosis treatment for Patients With Widespread Destructive Pulmonary Tuberculosis
      With Bacterial Excretion.

    <textblock>
      There are two groups of patients with first diagnosed widespread destructive pulmonary
      tuberculosis with bacterial excretion. The first group receives intravenous treatment with
      Isoniazid, Rifampicin, Ethambutol first two months of intensive phase of tuberculosis
      treatment. The second group gets oral forms of Isoniazid, Rifampicin, Ethambutol first two
      months of intensive phase of Tuberculosis treatment. Then both groups receive oral treatment
      of tuberculosis according to the known scheme.

      Up to 318 participants will be randomized into this study, with 159 participants being
      randomized to the control arm and 159 participants being randomized to the experimental arm.
      It Supposed that not less than 254 participants will finish the study (about 127 participants
      in each arm) and their results will be included in the statistical analysis.

      While the intensive phase participants of both arms will be hospitalized in the Tuberculosis
      Dispensary.
