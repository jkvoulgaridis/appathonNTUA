  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the effects of smartphone-based lifestyle medicine (LM) for
      alleviating depressive and anxiety symptoms in Chinese population. Since a range of lifestyle
      factors are involved in the pathogenesis and progression of depression and anxiety, modifying
      different lifestyle factors simultaneously, for example, diet, exercise, stress and sleep
      which are empirically supported by previous reviews, may be effective to reduce depressive
      and anxiety symptoms. Traditional Chinese medicine concepts will be integrated into the app
      to increase the acceptability towards mental health treatment. Through this study, we aim to
      promote evidence-based patient care and to improve help-seeking and access to evidence-based
      interventions for depression and anxiety.

      This study will be a randomized controlled trial on the effects of a culturally adapted
      self-help smartphone-based lifestyle medicine for reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms in
      Chinese population. Prior to all study procedures, eligible participants will be required to
      complete an online informed consent (with telephone support). With an estimation of 30%
      withdrawal, around 124 eligible participants will be randomly assigned to either
      smartphone-based lifestyle medicine (LM group) or the waitlist control group (WL group) in a
      ratio of 1:1.
