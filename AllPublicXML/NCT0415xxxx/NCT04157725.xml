      Infertility is of increasing significance affecting almost 48.5 million couples around the
      world. Anovulation is a major cause of infertility in women with polycystic ovary syndrome
      (PCOS) accounting for about 80% of women with anovulatory infertility. Ultrasound
      morphological features of PCOS include the presence of 16 or more follicles measuring 2-9 mm
      in diameter, and/or an overall large ovarian volume of &gt;10mm3. Women with PCOS ultrasound
      features exhibit an exaggerated response to controlled ovarian stimulation.

      Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation is an established prerequisite to assisted reproductive
      techniques with the aim of obtaining a higher yield of oocytes and ultimately increasing
      success rates. According to the ESHRE/ASRM consensus on infertility treatment related to
      polycystic ovary syndrome, IVF seems to represent a reasonable treatment option as the risks
      of multiple pregnancies and ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome may be kept to a minimum. The
      optimal stimulation protocol however is still debatable. Recently, patient-friendly
      stimulation protocols for assisted reproductive technology were introduced aiming at
      minimizing overall treatment costs and health hazards to the patient. Mild stimulation
      protocols are considered relatively novel protocols. They consist of combining oral
      stimulation agents (clomiphene citrate or letrozole) with low-dose gonadotropins as effective
      alternatives to conventional gonadotropin-only stimulation protocols. Mild stimulation
      protocol has been associated with better tolerance, ease of use, and comparable livebirth
      outcomes. The investigators aim to test the hypothesis that mild stimulation protocols could
      produce a similar proportion of term livebirths to conventional treatment, while reducing
      treatment costs and health hazards.

      This is a prospective non-randomized controlled trial comparing a mild ovarian stimulation
      protocol to conventional treatment for assisted reproductive technology at the Division of
      Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility - Haifa Idriss Fertility Center - American
      University of Beirut Medical Center.

      Infertility is a medical condition of increasing significance with an estimated 48.5 million
      affected couples around the world . Anovulation is a major cause of infertility in women with
      polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) accounting for about 80% of women with anovulatory
      infertility. The prevalence of PCOS varies widely among different ethnic populations and is
      highest in the Middle East. One way to diagnose PCOS is on the basis of the Rotterdam
      criteria, according to which women should satisfy 2 of 3 criteria including anovulation,
      polycystic ovarian morphology on ultrasound and hyperandrogenism (either clinical or
      biochemical). Trans-vaginal ultrasound evaluation is an important tool to assess ovarian
      features and determine the risk for ovarian hyper-response to follicle stimulation.

      Ultrasound morphological features of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) include the presence of
      16 or more follicles measuring 2-9mm in diameter, and/or an overall large ovarian volume of
      &gt;10mm3. Women with PCOS ultrasound features exhibit an exaggerated response to controlled
      ovarian stimulation . It was demonstrated that the number of baseline follicles seen on
      ultrasound strongly correlates with the number of recovered oocytes, and that was especially
      documented in women with a baseline number of pre-antral follicles exceeding 15 who were
      found to be at increased risk for ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome .

      Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation is an established prerequisite to assisted reproductive
      techniques with the aim of obtaining a higher yield of oocytes and ultimately increasing
      success rates. According to the ESHRE/ASRM consensus on infertility treatment related to
      polycystic ovary syndrome (2008), IVF seems to represent a reasonable treatment option as the
      risks of multiple pregnancies and ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome may be kept to a
      minimum. The optimal stimulation protocol however is still debatable.

      The investigators plan to conduct a prospective non-randomized controlled trial comparing a
      mild ovarian stimulation protocol to conventional treatment for assisted reproductive
      technology at the Division of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility - Haifa Idriss
      Fertility Center - American University of Beirut Medical Center.

      Interest in embryo cryopreservation will be discussed with candidates before the start of IVF
      treatment. Women meeting the inclusion criteria who show no interest in embryo
      cryopreservation and in obtaining supernumerary embryos will be allocated to the mild
      stimulation (group A) protocol. Alternatively, women interested in obtaining a high number of
      embryos for the purpose of cryopreservation will be allocated to the conventional stimulation
      (group B) protocol.

    <description>Group A (mild stimulation protocol) will receive oral Clomiphene Citrate (Clomid®) 150 mg/day for 5 days (starting on the 2nd of menses), followed by FSH/HMG (human menopausal gonadotropins) at a daily dose of 150-225 IU starting from the 6th day of the menstrual cycle. GnRH antagonist (Cetrotide®, Merck-Serono, Switzerland) 0.25 mg subcutaneously daily will be started once a dominant follicle becomes ≥14 mm until the day of final follicle maturation. Once 3 leading follicles reach 18mm in diameter, final follicle maturation will be triggered using HCG (Choriomon® 10,000 IU) in the presence of 14 or less pre-ovulatory follicles or GnRH agonist (Triptorelin-Gonapeptyl® 0.3mg single dose) in the presence of 15 or more follicles. The choice of the starting FSH/HMG daily dose will be tailored to BMI: 150 IU/d for BMI less than 25 and 225IU/d for BMI 25 and above.</description>
