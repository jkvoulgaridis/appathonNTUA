  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized crossover trial aims to examine the effects of Flotation-REST (Reduced,
      Environmental, Stimulation, Technique/Therapy) compared to laying in a dark room (with
      reduced environmental stimulation) for those with chronic musculoskeletal pain. This design
      will allow for comparisons between the two interventions on daily diary assessments of pain,
      stress, and sleep, both between groups and within individuals.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain is a prevalent and significant health problem. Previous research shows that
      Flotation-REST may be an effective treatment for reducing pain but little is known about the
      short-term effects of a single session of Flotation-REST on the day-to-day variability of
      pain, stress, and sleep. Sleep, stress, and pain are all bidirectionally related to each
      other, and previous research shows that Flotation-REST may positively influence all three of
      these outcomes. Therefore, the primary aim of this study is to examine changes in pain,
      stress, and sleep following Flotation-REST. The secondary aim is to investigate whether
      various subjective experiences during the intervention are associated with changes in pain,
      stress, and sleep following the interventions.
