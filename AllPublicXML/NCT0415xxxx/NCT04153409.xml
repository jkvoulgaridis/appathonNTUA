  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised, placebo controlled, double blind, crossover proof of concept study to
      investigate the efficacy and safety of oral LAT8881 in acute migraine, with or without aura.

      Subjects enrolled in the study will be randomised to receive investigational medicinal
      product (LAT8881 60 mg or placebo), to be taken at the onset (within one hour from the onset
      of pain) of a migraine headache of moderate to severe intensity [Numeric rating scale greater
      than 4]. Rescue medication should not be taken until at least 2 hours post dose. Subjects
      will be given a single dose of either active or placebo, to treat one migraine headache.

      After treatment of one migraine headache (or a maximum 28 days) the subject will return to
      the clinic for re-evaluation and crossover to the second treatment. After treatment of one
      migraine headache in the second treatment period or a maximum of 28 days from commencement of
      the second treatment period, the subject will return to the clinic for re-evaluation. An End
      of study visit (telephone) will occur 7 days after the end of the second treatment period.
