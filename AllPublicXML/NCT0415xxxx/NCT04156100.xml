      This study is an open-label, Phase 1 study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, and
      pharmacodynamic profiles of AGEN1223 and to assess the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in
      subjects with advanced solid tumors. This monotherapy study will also determine the RP2D of
      the monotherapy. This Phase 1 study will be conducted in an accelerated titration (for the
      first two dosing cohorts) and standard 3+3 dose escalation format. AGEN1223 will be
      administered on Day 1 of each 3-week cycle for 2 years or until any progressive disease (PD)
      or unacceptable toxicity is reported. The safe starting dose will be at the estimated
      minimally anticipated biological effect level (MABEL). The treatment phase is divided into
      3-week cycles with associated evaluations and procedures that must be performed at specific
      timepoints. Tumor assessments will be conducted every 6 weeks (±3 days) from first dose until
      treatment discontinuation. Each cycle begins with the administration of AGEN1223 on Day 1 of
      a 3-week cycle (timing of doses may be adjusted for management of adverse events [AEs]).
      Subjects will be treated for up to 2 years or until PD or unacceptable toxicity occurs. A
      Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) will be established to assess safety and decide on dose
      escalation

             potentially curative therapy with no evidence of disease recurrence for 5 years since
             initiation of that therapy.

        8 Subjects must provide a sufficient and adequate formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE)
        tumor tissue sample preferably from the most recent biopsy of a tumor lesion, collected
        either at the time of or after the diagnosis of advanced or metastatic disease has been

        biopsy will be required.

        9. Female subjects of child-bearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at
        screening (within 72 hours of first dose of study medication). Non-childbearing potential

          -  ≥45 years of age and has not had menses for greater than 1 year,

          -  Amenorrheic for ≥2 years without a hysterectomy and oophorectomy and a
             folliclestimulating hormone (FSH) value in the postmenopausal range upon pretrial
             (screening) evaluation,

          -  Whose status is post hysterectomy, oophorectomy, or tubal ligation. 10. Female
             subjects of child-bearing potential must be willing to use highly effective
             contraceptive measures starting with the screening visit through 120 days after the
             last dose of study treatment.

        Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the established and preferred contraception for
        the subject.

        11. Male subjects with a female partner(s) of child-bearing potential must agree to use
        highly effective contraceptive measures throughout the trial starting with the screening
        visit through 120 days after the last dose of study treatment is received. Males with
        pregnant partners must agree to use a condom; no additional method of contraception is
        required for the pregnant partner.

        Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the established and preferred contraception
        method for the subject.

        12. Willing and able to comply with the requirements of the protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Currently participating and receiving study therapy or has participated in a study of
             an investigational agent and received study therapy or used an investigation device
             within 3 weeks of the first dose of current study drug.

          2. Prior therapy with any monoclonal antibody (mAb) or agent binding the same targets as
             AGEN1223.

          3. Systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy, biological therapy, or major surgery within 3 weeks
             prior to first dose of study drug; a 1-week washout is permitted for palliative
             radiation to non-central nervous system (CNS) disease with Sponsor approval.

          4. Persisting toxicity with Grade &gt;1 severity related to prior therapy based on National
             Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 5.0
             (NCI-CTCAE).

             Note: Sensory neuropathy or alopecia of Grade ≤2 is acceptable.

          5. Is expected to require any other form of systemic or localized antineoplastic therapy
             while on trial (including maintenance therapy with another agent, radiation therapy,
             and/or surgical resection).

          6. Known severe hypersensitivity reactions (NCI-CTCAE Grade ≥3) to fully human mAbs or
             severe reaction to immuno-oncology agents, such as colitis or pneumonitis, requiring

             history of anaphylaxis, or uncontrolled asthma.

          7. Systemic corticosteroid therapy 1 week prior to the first dose of study drug or
             receiving any other form of systemic immunosuppressive medication (corticosteroid use
             as a premedication for intravenous (IV) contrast allergies/reactions is allowed).
             Subjects who are receiving daily corticosteroid replacement therapy are an exception
             to this rule. Daily prednisone at doses of up to 7.5 mg or equivalent hydrocortisone
             dose are examples of permitted replacement therapy.

          8. CNS tumor, metastasis(es), and/or carcinomatous meningitis identified either on the
             baseline brain imaging obtained during the screening period or identified prior to
             consent.

             Note: Subjects with history of brain metastases that have been treated may participate
             provided they show evidence of stable supra-tentorial lesions at screening (defined as
             2 brain images, both of which are obtained after treatment to the brain metastases.
             These imaging scans should both be obtained ≥4 weeks apart). In addition, any
             neurologic symptoms that developed either as a result of the brain metastases or their
             treatment must have returned to baseline or resolved. Any steroids administered as
             part of this therapy must be completed ≥3 days prior to the first dose of study

             Note: Subjects with diabetes type 1, vitiligo, psoriasis, hypo-, or hyperthyroid
             disease not requiring immunosuppressive treatment are eligible.

             angina, congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association class ≥II), or serious
             uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication.

         16. History or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that
             might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's participation
             for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of the subject to
             participate, in the opinion of the treating Investigator.

         17. Psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with
             the requirements of the trial.
