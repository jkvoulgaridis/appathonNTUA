      In a randomized controlled trial, the effects of a nurse-driven post-discharge intervention
      for patients with liver cirrhosis compared with standard follow-up will be investigated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since 1970 the mortality from cirrhosis has increased with 26.7 %, with a 50% mortality rate
      within 2 years of diagnosis. Grave complications result in functional impairment and reduced
      quality of life. 20-37 % of patients with liver cirrhosis are readmitted less than 30 days
      after a hospitalization for decompensation. These patients have a higher 90-day mortality
      rate than those who avoid readmission. Re-admissions have great personal-, societal- and
      economic consequences.

      In a randomized controlled trial, the effects of a nurse-driven post-discharge intervention
      for patients with liver cirrhosis, compared with standard follow-up will be investigated.

      The intervention, based on concepts from Family Nursing, will comprise three home-visits
      within eight weeks after discharge including therapeutic conversations focusing on
      strengthening participants' family relationships and social networks, disease education and
      help to initiate contact to municipal offers. After 12 weeks the participants will be
      followed-up by telephone.

    <description>Home visits based on the concepts of Family Nursing:
The participants will receive three home visits by a nurse who is trained in the Family Nursing principles during the first 12 weeks after discharge.
The home visits will comprise of:
Filling in the Chronic Liver Disease Questionnaire.
Therapeutic conversations including drawing and review of genogram and eco-map.
Information about- and help to initiate contact to relevant municipal offers.
Evidence-based information based on the patient's current problems or symptoms, base-line knowledge and receptiveness.
Follow-up telephone calls:
• After the first 12 weeks participants will be followed-up by telephone monthly during the following 12 weeks.
Pamphlet:
• All participants will receive a pamphlet with brief information regarding preventive measures and early signs of decompensation as well as relevant contact details. The pamphlet will be handed out before discharge</description>
