  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to find out if a study agent called Lumason® microbubbles may be
      helpful for people with lesions in the liver. It is possible it may help determine an early
      response to radioembolization and/or help demonstrate radiation toxicity to the surrounding
      liver.

    <description>Dynamic CEUS imaging will demonstrate perfusion characteristics that will predict early tumor response to Transarterial Y90 embolization in Hepatocellular Carcinoma. A change in intra-tumoral arterial flow will be predictive of early response. This will be evaluated immediately following hepatic artery embolization (day 0), at 4 weeks (follow-up 1), 12 weeks (follow-up 2) and 24 weeks (follow-up 3). A modified RECIST will be used to measure early tumor response.</description>
