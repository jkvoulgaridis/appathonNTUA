      Although most of the information focuses on understanding how the ventilator produces lung
      damage, the pulmonary factors that predispose to ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) have
      been less studied. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) can adopt different
      morphological phenotypes, with its own clinical and mechanical characteristics. This
      morphological phenotypes may favor the development of VILI for same ventilatory strategy

      The lung in acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS) is a heterogeneous viscoelastic system,
      in which areas with different time constants coexist, causing tidal volume to be distributed
      unevenly within an anatomically and functionally reduced lung. The administration of a
      disproportionately high tidal volume for this lung predisposes to the over-distension of the
      better ventilated alveoli and to the injury by tidal opening and closing of the alveoli more
      unstable. In this sense, using low tidal volume and homogenizing the lung by means of the
      prone position have proven beneficial in ARDS.

      Tidal volume, driving pressure, inspiratory flow and respiratory rate have been identified as
      responsible for mechanical ventilation-induced lung injury (VILI). These factors together
      represent the mechanical power, the insulting energy which is repeatedly applied to a
      vulnerable lung parenchyma.

      Although most of the information focuses on understanding how the ventilator produces lung
      damage and/or amplifies the existing one, the pulmonary factors that predispose to VILI have
      been less studied. Acute respiratory distress syndrome can adopt different morphological
      phenotypes, with its own clinical and mechanical characteristics. Understanding how each
      subgroup of ARDS responds to the protective ventilatory strategy could help to personalize
      treatment.

      Objectives: To compare the risk of VILI in two groups of ARDS with different morphological
      phenotypes (focal and non-focal), ventilated with the same protective strategy.

      Design: Patients with ARDS were ventilated under the same conditions of both tidal volume
      (TV) and plateau pressure (PPlat). Positive End Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) was adjusted to
      reach 30 cmH2O of PPlat. A CT was performed in inspiration and expiration. Transpulmonary
      pressures (TP) were measured and lung volumes calculated (Volume Analysis Software,Toshiba,
      Japan). Stress was defined as TP at the end of inspiration (TPinsp) and strain: tidal
      volume/End Expiratory Lung Volume Patients were classified into focal and non-focal according
      to the distribution of aeration loss in CT. Mann - Whitney U test was used to compare
      variables and Pearson correlation coefficient to compare its correlation. Significant: p

    <time_frame>One year</time_frame>
    <description>Twelve patients with ARDS were studied (six from each group). A balloon catheter was placed at the distal end of the esophagus to measure esophageal pressures. A pneumotachograph was used to record and quantify esophageal pressures during the ventilatory cycle. Esophageal pressure is considered as equivalent of pleural pressure. Pulmonary distention pressure (transpulmonary pressure) is obtained by measuring the difference between the pressure of the respiratory system (supplied by mechanical ventilation) and esophageal pressure. Stress was defined as the transpulmonary pressure measure at the end of an inspiratory pause (in zero flow conditions). Pulmonary stress was quantified in cmH2O. There is a linear relationship between stress and lung damage (VILI). Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare variables. Significant p &lt; 0.05.</description>

    <time_frame>One year</time_frame>
    <description>Twelve patients with ARDS were studied (six from each group). A chest tomography was performed during an expiratory and inspiratory pause. Using a specific software (Lung Volume Analysis Software.Toshiba, Japan), the amount of lung volume was calculated in expiration and inspiration air (expressed in ml). The strain was defined as the relationship between the amount of volume supplied by mechanical ventilation (tidal volume) and the lung's ability to receive that volume (EELV: end expiratory lung volume). This ratio was expressed as a percentage. There is a direct relationship between strain and lung damage (VILI). Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare variables.

    <time_frame>One year</time_frame>
    <description>Twelve patients with ARDS were studied (six from each group). Three lung regions were studied on tomography: Basal, middle and apical. A specific software quantified the amount of airless lung (100 to - 100 HU), both in expiration and inspiration. This amount was expressed in numbers of pixels. A lesion due to cyclic opening and closing of the alveoli was defined as the difference between the size of the airless lung between both respiratory times, in relation to the basal condition (lung without air at expiration). This ratio was expressed as a percentage. There is a direct relationship between this mechanism of damage and the risk of VILI. Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare variables. Significant p &lt; 0.05.</description>

    <description>Twelve patients with ARDS were studied (six from each group). Lung regions were studied on tomography: Basal, middle and apical. A specific software was quantified the amount of excess air (hyperinflation:-900 to - 1000 HU). Hyperinflation was expressed in relation to the total lung volume as a percentage. There is a direct relationship between hyperinflation and the risk of VILI. Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare variables. Significant p &lt; 0.05.</description>

    <description>Patients with ARDS were included. We excluded patients with emphysema, asthma, pneumothorax, or serious conditions of instability: oxygen saturation â‰¤ 88%; severe shock, ventricular arrhythmia, or myocardial ischemia.
To allow comparison between groups, patients were ventilated in volume control under similar conditions of tidal volume (TV; 6 ml/kg-PBW), plateau pressure (PPlat 30 cmH2O), respiratory rate (18 bit/min) and constant flow. PEEP was adjusted to reach objective PPlat.
Transpulmonary pressures (TP) were measured and a chest CT scan performed during an expiratory and inspiratory pause. Global and regional volumes of lungs were measured using specific software (Volume Analysis Software,Toshiba, Japan). Three regions were identified: basal (from the diaphragm to the carina), middle (from the carina to the aortic arch) and apical (above the aortic arch).</description>

        Patients with moderate to severe ARDS diagnosis were studied according to the Berlin
        definition. The AECC defined ARDS as the acute onset of hypoxemia (arterial partial
        pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen [PaO2/FIO2] â‰¤ 200 mm Hg) with bilateral
        infiltrates on frontal chest radiograph, with no evidence of left atrial hypertension.
