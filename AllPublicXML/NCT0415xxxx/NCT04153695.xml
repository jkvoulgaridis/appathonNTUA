  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of music as a therapy for the psychological and emotional improvement of pregnant
      women has been well studied. Our hypothesis is that flamenco music can also involve
      psycho-emotional improvements in pregnant women

      The objective of the study is to analyze the effects of a flamenco musical intervention on
      the stress and anxiety of pregnant women in five Management Units of the Sanitary District in
      Bahía de Cádiz-La Janda (Spain).

      50 pregnant women will voluntarily participate in this study (25 in a control group and 25 in
      the experimental group) The psychological health assessment will be measured through the
      Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (S-STAI) and the Edinburgh
      Postnatal Depression Scale (EDPS) pre and post exposure.

    <description>Perceived Stress Scale is used in order to measure anxiety in adults. It clearly differentiates between the temporary condition of &quot;state anxiety&quot; and the more general and long-standing quality of &quot;trait anxiety&quot;. It consists of fourteen questions that refer to the feelings and thoughts of the person surveyed during the last month.
It consists of fourteen questions that refer to the feelings and thoughts of the person surveyed during the last month. The answer format of each question is a Likert scale with five possible options. The minimum value is 0 (never) and maximun is 4 (very often). Higher score means the worse outcome.</description>

    <measure>State-Trait Anxiety Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>It is a psychological inventory based on a 4-point Likert scale (from 0 or &quot;Almost Never&quot; to 3 or &quot;Almost Always&quot;) and it consists of 20 questions on a self-report basis. The STAI measures two types of anxiety - state anxiety, or anxiety about an event, and trait anxiety, or anxiety level as a personal characteristic. Higher scores are positively correlated with higher levels of anxiety, so the worse outcome.</description>

    <measure>Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>4 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale is a set of 10 screening questions that can indicate whether a parent has symptoms that are common in women with depression and anxiety during pregnancy and in the year following the birth of a child. This is not intended to provide a diagnosis - only trained health professionals should do this.
Each question has four items and is evaluated from 0 to 3, according to the increase in the severity of the symptom. Questions 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 rank in reverse order. The total score can range from 0 to 30, with 0 being the best result and 30 the worst.</description>
