      To investigate whether 24 months of idebenone may reduce the progression from Prodromal
      Parkinson disease (PPD) to Parkinson disease (PD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Number of people suffered from Parkinson disease (PD) is increasing every year. Contemporary
      medication has little neuroprotective effect, which may due to delayed treatment as over 50%
      neurons have lost when clinical diagnosed PD emerges. The concept of Prodromal Parkinson
      disease (PPD) is emphasized as it has become evident that there are several risk and clinical
      markers may occur years before the cardinal motor symptoms which allow clinical diagnosis.
      Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder and olfactory dysfunction are the most
      common PPD, and more than one third of patients may progress to PD and other
      neurodegenerative diseases. Mitochondrial injury is one of the pathogenesis of PD. Thus we
      design this trial to investigate whether idebenone, potent coenzyme Q10 analogue, could
      protect PPD develops into PD.
