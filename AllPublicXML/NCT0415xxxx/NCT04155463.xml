  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to understand whether and how pregnant women may be exposed
      to glyphosate, the active ingredient in a common herbicide. The researchers aim to assess
      glyphosate exposure among pregnant women in Idaho, and to attribute that exposure to
      agricultural and dietary sources. Pregnant women who live either near or far from
      glyphosate-treated fields will be recruited for study inclusion, and exposure will be
      assessed via urinary biomonitoring on a weekly basis throughout pregnancy. Each participant
      will also take part in a two-week dietary intervention, during which they will receive one
      week of organic food and one week of conventional food, in a crossover design. Urinary
      biomonitoring will occur on a daily basis during the dietary intervention phase. The
      researchers hypothesize that women who live near agricultural fields treated with glyphosate
      will have higher exposures than those who live in non-agricultural regions, and that
      consumption of an organic diet will reduce exposures in both groups.

      This study focuses on human exposure to glyphosate, the single most commonly applied
      agricultural chemical in the world. Glyphosate is an herbicide, and is most commonly known as
      the active ingredient in &quot;Round Up&quot;. Glyphosate has been declared a probable human carcinogen
      by the International Agency for Research on Cancer and multiple toxicological studies have
      further suggested potential neurological and developmental effects of glyphosate exposure at
      environmentally-relevant levels. However, despite its extensive use, frequent presence in
      food and environmental media, and potential toxicity, current exposure levels in human
      populations are not well documented. This proposed study aims to assess glyphosate exposure
      among a cohort of pregnant women and to quantify the relative contribution of agricultural
      and dietary sources of this exposure. Specifically, this project has two main aims. Under Aim
      1, a cohort of 40 pregnant women will be recruited from urban areas &gt;10 miles from the
      nearest glyphosate-treated field and agricultural areas &lt;1 mile from the nearest
      glyphosate-treated field. Urinary analysis from these women will be used to indicate the
      number of repeated spot urine samples necessary to characterize glyphosate exposure over one
      trimester of pregnancy, and to quantify the effect of residential proximity to
      glyphosate‐treated fields on exposure. Under Aim 2, these same 40 participants will then take
      part in a two week-long randomized cross-over design dietary intervention, during which
      participants will receive one week of exclusively organic food (grown without the use of
      synthetic pesticides, including glyphosate) and one week of exclusively conventional food, in
      random order. During the intervention, the researchers will collect daily spot urine samples
      from each participant to analyze for glyphosate exposure. The researchers hypothesize that
      during the time of year when glyphosate is actively applied, women living near
      glyphosate‐treated fields will have higher exposures than those living further away. They
      also hypothesize that glyphosate exposure will be reduced among participants during
      randomization to the organic diet, but that this decrease will be larger among urban women
      than among those living near glyphosate‐treated fields.
