  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is a 2-phase, randomized clinical trial that includes 7 days of unilateral leg
      disuse (Phase 1), immediately followed by 14 days of bilateral leg rehabilitation (Phase 2).
      The investigators will recruit cohorts of healthy middle-aged men and women to address their
      aims:

        -  Demonstrate the sex-specific effects of skeletal muscle disuse (Phase 1)

        -  Identify key molecular determinates of susceptibility of skeletal muscle atrophy (Phase
           1)

        -  Map the early, sex-specific molecular time-course of rehabilitation (Phase 2)

        -  Determine if disused and healthy muscle respond similarly to exercise (Phase 2)

      Healthy, middle-age men and post-menopausal women (50-65 years) will be recruited from the
      greater Houston/Galveston area. This under-represented research demographic demonstrate few
      negative metabolic or phenotypic signs of advanced age, but are at increased risk of being
      hospitalized and experiencing accelerated loss of lean mass and muscle function that
      parallels a much older population.

      The goal of this study is to characterize phenotypic and molecular skeletal muscle changes in
      middle-aged men and women during critical periods of disuse and rehabilitation and ultimately
      direct the development of targeted and effective prevention and treatment strategies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The negative health consequences of muscular disuse in aging populations are unequivocal.
      While descriptive, outcome data on disuse and recovery are abundant, key knowledge gaps limit
      researcher's ability to implement evidence-based, rehabilitation strategies. Limiters
      include: i) an inability to identify individuals most susceptible to disuse, ii) insufficient
      information to differentiate between, and respond to, disuse atrophy in men and women, iii)
      limited insight into the mechanisms driving adaptation to early rehabilitative exercise, and
      iv) the assumption that disused and healthy skeletal muscle will have a similar, positive
      response to resistance exercise. The investigators will complete a 2-phase, randomized
      clinical trial at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB). The protocol includes 7-days
      of unilateral leg disuse (ULD; Phase 1), immediately followed by 14-days of bilateral leg
      rehabilitation (Phase 2). Healthy, middle-aged men (n=40) and (post-menopausal) women (n=40),
      (50-65 y) will be recruited; a neglected research demographic who present with a largely
      youthful phenotype, but are at risk of accelerated disuse atrophy.

      This project will provide a highly powered, detailed phenotypic characterization of the
      continuum of adults most and least susceptible to muscular disuse. Clinical outcomes will be
      supported by RNA deep sequencing and pathway analysis to establish a platform that: i)
      improves scientists' ability to identify higher-risk individuals and ii) provides insight
      into time-sensitive, sex-specific and effective rehabilitation strategies. Findings and
      reposed molecular data from this study, may help identify future therapeutic targets and
      serve as an uncomplicated/comorbidity-free baseline for clinical trials in populations
      experiencing disuse atrophy.
