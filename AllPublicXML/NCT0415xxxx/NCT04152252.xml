  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the quality of cardio-pulmonary
      resuscitation(CPR) delivered by EMS professionals and whether this quality can be improved by
      implementing real-time feedback during the event and an oral post-event debriefing procedure
      based on the actual event performance data.

      The aim of this study is to investigate whether CPR quality can be improved by implementing
      real-time feedback and immediate oral structured post-event debriefing in out-of-hospital
      cardiac arrest (OHCA).

      The objectives of this study is to assess the current quality of CPR delivered by emergency
      medical services (EMS) during OHCA events in the Capital Region of Denmark. Furthermore, to
      investigate if CPR quality can be improved by applying real-time feedback during OHCA
      resuscitation attempts and to investigate if structured oral post-event debriefing delivered
      immediately after a resuscitation attempt and based on data from the defibrillator can
      further improve CPR quality

      The hypothesis of this study is that adding real-time and post event feedback can improve the
      compression rate, compression depth, overall CPR hands-on time (CPR fraction), and recoil
      with at least 15% in total for both interventions.

      Using a prospective study design data is retrieved from the standard defibrillator (ZOLL X
      series) through ZOLL RescueNetÂ® Case Review (software for post-event review, analysis, and
      debriefing) from ZOLL Medical Corporation, Massachusetts, United States of America.

      The study consists of three consecutive phases. Phase one with no feedback / debriefing
      available for EMS. Phase two with real-time feedback during the event and phase three which
      adds post-event debriefing to real-time feedback. We expect to be able to include at least
      500 cases in each phase.
