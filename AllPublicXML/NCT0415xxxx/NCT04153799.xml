  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a clinical study on the safety, efficacy and I phase of single center, single
      arm, open-dose climbing, intravenous infusion of Anti- Epidermal growth factor receptor(EGFR)
      Chimeric Antigen Receptor(CAR) T cells modified by C-X-C Chemokine receptor type 5(CXCR 5) in
      patients with advanced adult non-small cell lung cancer(NSCLC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the dose(number of cells by body weight) and time of infusion should be
      recorded in detail according to the dosage of slope climbing and single infusion. The safety
      of chimeric antigen receptor T(CAR-T) cells treatment was evaluated by observing the adverse
      events after cell therapy. The effectiveness of CAR-T treatment was initially assessed
      compared with the results of the patient's own previous standard treatment plan. Blood was
      collected before and within 12 months after infusion to detect the number and activity of
      CAR-T cells and evaluate the pharmacokinetic characteristics of CAR-T cells.
