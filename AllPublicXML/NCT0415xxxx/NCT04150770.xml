  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is designed to test the hypothesis that infliximab is clinically useful for
      patients with refractory childhood uveitis.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approval of the study was obtained from the hospital's ethical committee. The study design
      and methodology followed the tenets of Declaration of Helsinki. All patients were provided
      with written informed consent and received a thorough explanation of the study design, aims,
      and the off-label use of infliximab, its potential risks and benefits. This is a prospective
      non-comparative interventional study.

      Participants will receive intravitreal injections of suggested dose of infliximab (5
      mg/kg/dose) and data will be collected prospectively with regard to ophthalmologic outcomes.
      Study participants will be followed for up to 10 months to determine efficacy and side
      effects, and an additional 30 days for safety reports. Descriptive statistics will be
      gathered on participant demographics, uveitis characteristics, change in immunosuppressive
      medications, number of responders, ophthalmologic measures and change in corticosteroid dose
      during the study period.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change In LogMAR Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) From Baseline to Each Visit.</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participant's best corrected visual acuity was measured using an Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) logMAR chart. On the logMAR scale, 0 is equivalent to 20/20 visual acuity, the range of normal vision is considered to be from -0.2 - 0.1; higher values indicate visual impairment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Anterior Chamber (AC) Cell Grade From Baseline to Each Visit.</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Slit lamp examinations were conducted at each visit to assess AC cell count. The number of AC cells observed within a 1 mm Ã— 1 mm slit beam was used to determine the grade according to the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) criteria:
Grade 0 = &lt; 1 cell Grade 0.5+ = 1 - 5 cells Grade 1+ = 6 - 15 cells Grade 2+ = 16 - 25 cells Grade 3+ = 26 - 50 cells Grade 4+ = &gt; 50 cells.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Vitreous Haze (VH) Grade From Baseline to Each Visit.</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Vitreous haze was measured using dilated indirect ophthalmoscopy (DIO) and assessed by the Investigator according to National Eye Institute (NEI) and SUN criteria:
Grade 0: No evident vitreous haze; Grade 0.5+: Slight blurring of the optic disc margin because of the haze; normal striations and reflex of the nerve fiber layer cannot be visualized; Grade 1+: Permits a better definition of both the optic nerve head and the retinal vessels (compared to higher grades); Grade 2+: Permits better visualization of the retinal vessels (compared to higher grades); Grade 3+: Permits the observer to see the optic nerve head, but the borders are quite blurry; Grade 4+: Optic nerve head is obscured.</description>
