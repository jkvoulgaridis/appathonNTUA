    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, multi-center, non-inferior, randomized controlled clinical
      trial, aims to use optical Coherence tomography to observe the the early- and mid-stage
      vessel repair and neointimal proliferation. And to assess the safety and effectiveness of the
      Firehawk™ sirolimus target-eluting coronary stent system with abluminal grooves containing a
      biodegradable polymer (Firehawk™) comparing the XIENCE everolimus-eluting coronary stent
      system in the treatment of subjects with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).

    <description>Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), also known as coronary angioplasty, is a nonsurgical procedure that improves blood flow to your heart.PCI requires cardiac catheterization, which is the insertion of a catheter tube and injection of contrast dye, usually iodine-based, into your coronary arteries. Doctors use PCI to open coronary arteries that are narrowed or blocked by the buildup of atherosclerotic plaque. PCI may be used to relieve symptoms of coronary heart disease or to reduce heart damage during or after a heart attack.</description>
