  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Central nervous system lymphoma (CNSL) is a rare brain tumor constituting 3% of all newly
      diagnosed brain tumors, and 2% to 3% of all cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. There are two
      subtypes of CNSL. Owing to its low incidence, there is limited prospective and/or randomized
      data to guide the therapy of CNSL. Current knowledge about optimal diagnostic, prognostic and
      therapeutic strategies of CNSL is urged.

      The immune system plays a fundamental role in controlling and eradicating cancer but is held
      in check by inhibitory receptors and ligands. These immune checkpoint pathways, which
      normally maintain self-tolerance and limit collateral tissue damage during anti-microbial
      immune responses, can be co-opted by cancer to evade immune destruction. A plethora of
      regulatory molecules have been identified. Among them, three have been studied most
      intensively: cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4) binding to CD80 or CD86, programmed
      cell death protein 1 (PD-1) binding to PD-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) or PD-L2, and SIRPαbinding to
      CD47. Agents inhibiting CTLA-4, PD1, PD-L1 and CD47 are showing compelling antitumor activity
      in several solid and hematological cancers. Exploring the role of immune checkpoint pathways
      in CNSL may help us to establish the rational targeted therapies.

      In this study, the investigators will investigate the protein expression of several specific
      molecules in immune checkpoint pathways such as PD-L1, PD-L2 and CD47 in the large
      neurological resection specimens by immunohistochemical staining of patients with CNSL.
      Besides, the concentrations of above molecules and other prognostic relevant factors such as
      chemokine CXCL13, Interleukin-10 and soluble CD19 in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) at initial
      diagnosis and after treatment will be evaluated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.
      About 200 patients with CNSL will be recruited. The protein expression of the above molecules
      will be correlated with the clinical outcome of patients with CNSL. The feasibility of
      adopting these CSF molecules as useful diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers in CNSL will also
      be investigated.

      Goal The goal and purpose of this study is to investigate the clinical implications and
      functional roles of immune checkpoint pathways in CNSL.

      There are two specific aims:

        1. The adoption of protein expression of immune checkpoint pathways (CTLA-4, PD-L1, PD-L2,
           CD47) as a prognostic factor in patients with PCNSL. To fulfill this aim, the protein
           expression of CTLA-4, PD-L1, PD-L2, and CD47 in the neurosurgical resection specimens of
           patients with PCNSL will be evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) techniques. The
           results will be correlated with clinical features and outcome of the patients with CNSL.
           Once parameters for these tissues are established it will be possible to speculate about
           the tumor grade, survival and response to treatment of these patients.

        2. The feasibility of adopting CSF CTLA-4, PD-L1, PD-L2, and sCD47 as useful diagnostic and
           prognostic biomarkers in patients with CNSL. To fulfill this aim, the concentrations of
           CSF CTLA-4, PD-L1, PD-L2 and sCD47 will be evaluated at the timings of initial diagnosis
           and after each cycle of systemic chemotherapy by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays
           (ELISAs). The concentrations of these CSF molecules at initial diagnosis will be
           correlated with the prognosis of patients with CNSL. Besides, the investigators will
           compare the serial follow-up concentrations of these markers after each cycle of
           systemic chemotherapy to find out whether the presence of decreased concentrations will
           response to therapy.

      This may help to discovery new diagnostic, prognostic and potential therapeutic strategies
      for patients with CNSL.
