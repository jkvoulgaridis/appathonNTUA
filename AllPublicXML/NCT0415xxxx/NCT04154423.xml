  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized comparative effectiveness study of two forms of enhanced prenatal care
      among 2,600 Medi-Cal eligible pregnant women in Fresno, California. The goal is to see
      whether group prenatal care with wrap around services versus individual prenatal care
      supplemented by services covered by the California Department of Public Health Comprehensive
      Perinatal Services Program (CPSP) results in lower rates of preterm birth, less depression
      and anxiety, and more respectful and greater satisfaction with prenatal care.

    <description>Glow! is an enhanced group prenatal care model that offers co-located social services provided by established community programs with independent funding streams targeting low-income families. The Glow! group prenatal care model pairs a trained facilitator with a licensed prenatal care practitioner from a practice site to provide billable prenatal care to the practice's own patients. Over the course of 8-10 sessions, 10-12 women (within a 6- week gestational age range) receive prenatal medical care, risk assessments, and social support, and gain knowledge and skills related to pregnancy, birth, and parenting.</description>
