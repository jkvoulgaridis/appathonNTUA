  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The utilization of doxycycline for SBP prophylaxis is a novel practice at MDMC. Therefore, an
      assessment of safety and efficacy is needed in order to generalize this practice. The
      publication of this study can potentially introduce a new alternative to guideline-directed
      therapies for secondary prevention of SBP. Doxycycline is non-inferior to guideline-directed
      therapies regarding safety and efficacy in primary and secondary prophylaxis for SBP.

      Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a common and serious complication in cirrhotic
      patients with a reported mortality rate of 20 to 30%.1-3 A SBP diagnosis requires abdominal
      paracentesis and is made in the presence of an elevated ascitic fluid absolute
      polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) count without an evident intra-abdominal, surgically
      treatable source of infection.2,3 Common pathogens associated with SBP are Gram-negative
      colonic organisms. However, in recent years, Gram-positive pathogens have become more common,
      suggesting the need to evaluate SBP management.1,4-6 The recurrence rate of SBP after an
      initial episode has been reported to be as high as 70%.1-3 Currently, the American
      Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) and European Association for the Study of
      the Liver (EASL) guidelines recommend the use of sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, norfloxacin,
      or ciprofloxacin for the prevention of recurrent SBP. Fluoroquinolones as a class have had
      increased black box warnings in recent years, making ciprofloxacin fall out of favor for
      long-term prophylaxis.5 Sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim is extensively metabolized by the liver
      and is contraindicated in marked liver impairment.8 Therefore, it is necessary to search for
      a prophylaxis alternative with similar efficacy and a better safety profile.

      Doxycycline is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that covers Gram-positive bacteria, including
      Streptococcus spp., resistant strains of Staphylococcus and Enterococcus, and Gram-negative
      bacteria, including Enterobacteriaceae. One randomized trial in cirrhotic patients with a
      previous episode of SBP showed that doxycycline was associated with a reduction in
      inflammatory markers, such as interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein, suggesting potential
      benefits of doxycycline in this patient population.7 At Methodist Dallas Medical Center
      (MDMC) and the Liver Institute at MDMC, doxycycline has been utilized for both primary and
      secondary prevention of SBP. In order to compare doxycycline with guideline-directed
      therapies for SBP prevention in cirrhotic patients, a retrospective, cohort study was
      designed to review patients who meet the criteria from July 2014 to July 2018. This study
      aims to compare the efficacy of doxycycline with that of guideline recommended therapies for
      primary and secondary SBP prophylaxis, the safety of doxycycline with that of guideline
      recommended therapies for primary and secondary SBP prophylaxis, and identify the association
      between chemoprophylaxis and the risk of infections from multidrug resistant organisms
      (MDROs) in SBP.
