  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an open labelled Phase I/II clinical trial, designed to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of an oral cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor antagonist, proglumide, at escalating
      doses in subjects with NASH.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1single ascending dose study in 18 patients with ultrasound evidence of fatty
      liver disease AND increased hepatic transaminases. Proglumide will be using the single
      ascending dose study design in a Phase 1 fashion to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose
      (RP2D). Dose levels of proglumide will be: 400mg BID (twice daily); 400 mg TID (three times
      daily); 800 mg BID (twice daily).

      Six patients will be enrolled in each cohort starting with the lowest dose of 400mg po BID
      (Twice daily)for 12 weeks.

      Patients will be monitored for safety and toxicity by laboratory blood testing, physical
      examinations. Blood level for proglumide will be done at before proglumide at screening or
      baseline, week 2 and then week 4 and week 12.

      Safety and toxicity will be monitored using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
      Events v 5 and 'efficacy 'of the treatment will be evaluated by assessment of liver enzymes
      and fibroscan. The Phase 1 study design, we will follow the dose escalation scheme, where the
      dose increases after 6 subjects if a drug limiting toxicity (DLT) does not occur.
