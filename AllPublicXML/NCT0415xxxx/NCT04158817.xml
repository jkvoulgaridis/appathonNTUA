  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the dosimetry, safety and the detection rate of 68Ga-THP-PSMA PET/CT for
      identifying the site of prostate cancer metastasis and relapse. It is also to evaluate the
      association of clinical/pathologic features and 68Ga-THP-PSMA PET/CT detection rate and
      compare 68Ga-THP-PSMA PET/CT with other imaging procedure.

    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Visual analysis will be carried out by 4 experienced nuclear medicine physicians to observe the uptake of 68Ga-THP-PSMA in prostate malignant lesions. A 4 point method will be used to interpret the scans for abnormalities. It is categorized as such: score 0, no abnormal increased uptake; score 1, low increased uptake; score 2, moderate increased uptake; score 3, high increased uptake. The lesion will be considered positive for malignancy if the score is 2 or higher.</description>

    <measure>The dosimetry assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the dosimetry of 68Ga-THP-PSMA, patients (n = 5) will undergo whole-body planar imaging at different time points (10 min, 1 h, 2 h and 3 h after injection) to obtain radiation dosimetry data. A calibration source of 37 MBq at injection time will be placed above the head of each patient to provide quantitative calibration of counts to activity.</description>
