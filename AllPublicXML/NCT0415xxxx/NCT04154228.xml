  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      18F-FDG PET/MR imaging protocol integrating advanced MR vascular imaging sequences, along
      with computerized quantitative methods for data analysis, is expected to serve as an
      objective tool for assessment of lymphoma patients. The aim of this prospective study is to
      develop an automatic artificial intelligence-based tool for the assessment of early response
      to treatment and evaluation of residual masses in patients with lymphoma. Specific objectives
      are:

        1. To evaluate the added value of 18F-FDG PET/MRI compared with PET/CT in imaging lymphoma.

        2. To optimize PET/MR imaging protocol for lymphoma assessment.

        3. To develop an automated tool for staging patients with lymphoma.

        4. To develop an automated method for early prediction of response to therapy and prognosis
           in patients with lymphoma.

        5. To develop an automated non-invasive tool for discriminating benign from active residual
           masses at end of treatment in patients with lymphoma.

    <description>Patients will undergo 18F-FDG PET/CT scans before therapy initiation, interim after 2/3 treatment cycles and end of treatment after therapy completion, as part of their routine evaluation, as well as additional follow-up scans, as clinically indicated and requested by referring physicians. Given signed written informed-consent forms, patients will undergo at each time point, immediately after completion of PET/CT, a PET/MR scan, following the same single injection of 18F-FDG. Standard preparation and acquisition protocols for FDG PET imaging will be employed.
PET/MR imaging will include conventional sequences as T1, T2, diffusion weighted imaging, and advanced vascular imaging (DCE-MRI).</description>
