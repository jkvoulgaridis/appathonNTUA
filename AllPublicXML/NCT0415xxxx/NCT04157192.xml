  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acupuncture has been a means of treating headaches and migraine since 2002 and is now a World
      Health Organisation-recognized prophylactic treatment for migraine. Brain
      activation/de-activation via acupuncture modifies the haemodynamic responses in the brain
      which may impact the sensorial, cognitive and affective dimensions of pain. Randomized
      studies on patients suffering from aura-free migraine have shown that the painkilling effect
      of regular acupuncture sessions on the cerebral substratum, compared with simulated sham-type
      acupuncture, can reduce the frequency of bouts of migraine, number of days with headaches and
      also their intensity.

      Modifications to the white matter (WM) and grey matter (GM) occur after repeated sessions of
      acupuncture treatment for pain and these are observable via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
      It is a very sensitive technique and often used to detect functional and structural brain
      changes.

    <textblock>
      Since 2002, acupuncture has been employed as a method for treating headaches and migraine. It
      is recognized by the World Health Organisation (WHO), and is now part of the prophylactic
      treatments for migraine. Brain activations/de-activation via acupuncture lead to a
      modification of haemodynamic responses in the brain which may impact the sensorial, cognitive
      and affective dimensions of pain. Randomized studies on patients who suffer from migraine
      without aura have shown that the painkilling effect of repeated acupuncture sessions on the
      cerebral substratum, compared with simulated sham-type acupuncture, make it possible to
      reduce the frequency of bouts of migraine, the number of days of headaches, and the intensity
      of the bouts.

      Following repeated sessions of acupuncture treatment for pain, modifications occur in the
      white matter (WM) and in the grey matter (GM) and these may be observed by magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) which is a highly sensitive technique and very often used to detect functional
      brain changes and/or subtle abnormalities.

In this study, the subjects will not know whether they are getting true acupuncture or not. In the placebo group, the acupuncture needles will not actually be inserted into the skin. Placebo needles consisting of a sliding tube and a retractible needle are applied to the acupunture reference point (marked by a pastille stuck on the skin). The patient should not be able to feel the difference between real acupuncture and sham acupuncture.</description>
