  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on the overwhelming positive response to this survey and the large number of patients
      being treated with PD-1/PD-L1 therapy in the UPMC system, the investigators are proposing a
      trial that will randomize patients who have disease stability to stop treatment at 1 year or
      continue treatment until disease progression. The investigators anticipate that the results
      of this study will answer questions regarding the optimal duration of treatment. therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Within the UPMC system, approximately 2,300 patients received PD-1/PD-L1 therapy for a
      variety of advanced solid tumors within the past year. It is anticipated that this number
      will increase as the clinical indications for treatment with these agents also increase. The
      investigators conducted a survey of 60 Medical Oncologists within the UPMC system regarding
      their interest in a trial that will attempt to address the question of optimal length of
      PD-1/PD-L1 treatment. Fifty-two (86.7%) physicians indicated that they would participate in a
      clinical trial that had a primary goal of determining whether it was feasible to stop
      immunotherapy after 1 year of treatment.
