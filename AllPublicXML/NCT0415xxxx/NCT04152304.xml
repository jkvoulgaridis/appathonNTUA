  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An optimal treatment for traumatic anterior shoulder instability (TASI) remains to be
      identified. A shoulder instability neuromuscular exercise (SINEX) program has been designed
      for patients with TASI, but has not yet been tested in patients eligible for surgery. The
      purpose of this study was to investigate and evaluate the feasibility and safety of the SINEX
      program for patients diagnosed with TASI and eligible for surgery.

      A feasibility study with an experimental, longitudinal design using both quantitative and
      qualitative research methods. Participants undergo the SINEX program, a twelve week exercise
      program including physiotherapist supervised sessions. Feasibility data on recruitment,
      retention, compliance, acceptability and safety was collected through observation and
      individual semi-structured interviews. Clinical tests and self-report questionnaires were
      completed at baseline and 12 weeks follow-up. Clinical assessments included apprehension and
      relocation tests, shoulder joint position sense (SJPS), shoulder sensorimotor control
      measured by center of pressure path length (COPL) on a force platform, isometric strength
      measured by Constant Score - Isometric Maximal Voluntary Contraction (CS-iMVC), self-report
      questionnaires included Western Ontario Shoulder Instability Index (WOSI), Tampa Scale of
      Kinesiophobia (TSK) and Global Perceived Effect questionnaire (GPE).
