  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      All subjects will complete a 49-day, multi-phase feeding study to evaluate the effect of pea
      fiber supplementation on gut community structure and features of host biological state
      (plasma proteome/ metabolome). Subjects will be asked to continue to consume their habitual
      diet (free diet phase) for 4 days prior to being provided with a diet high in saturated fat
      (HiSF) and low in fruits and vegetables (LoFV) in the form of packed-out meals and snacks to
      consume for the following 45 days. Ten days after starting to consume the HiSF-LoFV diet,
      subjects will supplement their diet with pea fiber for a total of 21 days; the energy
      contribution from the HiSF-LoFV diet will be reduced accordingly to maintain energy needs
      during this time. After completing the pea fiber supplementation phase of the study subjects
      will revert back to consuming the HiSF-LoFV only diet for the final 14 days. Stool, urine and
      blood will be sampled periodically throughout.
