  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AMBRE is a phase III study comparing two standard treatments as initial metastatic treatment
      in ER+/HER2- breast cancer (BC) patients with visceral metastasis and high burden disease:
      Chemotherapy and combination of endocrine therapy with abemaciclib.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to compare the efficacy of standard endocrine therapy + abemaciclib
      combination versus standard chemotherapy based on progression-free survival (PFS) within 24
      weeks, in patients with visceral metastases of ER+/HER2- breast cancer and high tumor burden.

      Patients will be randomly assigned to receive either:

        -  Standard chemotherapy regimen physician's choice either (paclitaxel or capecitabine)

        -  Standard endocrine therapy regimen physician's choice + abemaciclib (Letrozole or
           anastrozole for patients nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor (NSAI) naïve or relapsing &gt;1
           year after the end of adjuvant endocrine therapy, and fulvestrant for patients relapsing
           on adjuvant or less than one year after completion of adjuvant NSAI)

    <measure>Patients' quality of life by the Quality of life questionnaire - Core 30 (QLQ-C30)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and every 6 weeks during 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Developed by the EORTC, this self-reported questionnaire assesses the health-related quality of life of cancer patients in clinical trials.
The questionnaire includes five functional scales (physical, everyday activity, cognitive, emotional, and social), three symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea and vomiting), a health/quality of life overall scale, and a number of additional elements assessing common symptoms (including dyspnea, loss of appetite, insomnia, constipation, and diarrhea), as well as, the perceived financial impact of the disease.
All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level.</description>

    <measure>Patients' quality of life by the Quality of Life Questionnaire - Breast cancer module (QLQ-BR23)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and every 6 weeks during 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This EORTC breast cancer specific questionnaire is intended to supplement the QLQ-C30.
The QLQ-BR23 contains 23 items incorporating five multi-item scales to assess systemic therapy side effects, arm symptoms, breast symptoms, body image and sexual functioning. In addition, single items assess sexual enjoyment, hair loss and future perspective. All items are rated on a four-point Likert-type scale (1 = &quot;not at all&quot;, 2 = &quot;a little&quot;, 3 = &quot;quite a bit&quot;, and 4 = &quot;very much&quot;), and are linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale. For all items but sexual functioning and sexual enjoyment, higher scores indicate more severe symptoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patients' quality of life by the Quality of Life G8</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The G8 questionnaire is a 8-item screening tool developed specifically for older patients (&gt;70 years old) leaving with cancer. This tool, addressed by the clinician, covers multiple domains, focusing on nutritional status, weight loss, body mass index, mobility, neuropsychological problems, medication use, self-rated health status, and age. The score ranges from 17 (not at all impaired) to 0 (heavily impaired).</description>
