  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will look at how two different semaglutide versions reach and stay in the blood
      after injection. The study aims to show similar levels of semaglutide in the blood when using
      the different semaglutide versions. Participants will get 1 of the 2 versions of semaglutide.
      Which version participants get is decided by chance. One version is the one that doctors
      already can prescribe and the other is the new version. Participants will get the medicines
      as an injection under the skin of the stomach with the use of a pen-injector. The type of
      pen-injector is different for the two versions of semaglutide. The study will last for about
      80-99 days. Participants will have 24 study visits with the study doctor. For 2 of the
      visits, participants will stay in the clinic for 4 days and 3 nights. Participants may have
      to stop the study if the study doctor thinks that there are risks for their health. Women
      cannot take part if pregnant, breast-feeding or planning to become pregnant during the study
      period.
