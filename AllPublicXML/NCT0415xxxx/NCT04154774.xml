    <measure>Area Under Concentration-time Curve from Time 0 to Infinite Time (AUC[0-infinity]) of Apalutamide</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 57</time_frame>
    <description>The AUC (0-infinity) is the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to infinite time, calculated as the sum of AUC(last) and C (last)/ lambda(z); wherein AUC(last) is area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to the time of the last measurable concentration, C(last) is the last observed quantifiable concentration, and lambda(z) is elimination rate constant.</description>

    <measure>Area Under Concentration-time Curve from Time 0 to the Time of the Last Concentration (AUC[0-last]) of Apalutamide</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 57</time_frame>
    <description>AUC(0-last) is defined as the time 0 to the time of the last measurable (non-below quantification limit) concentration of apalutamide calculated by linear-linear trapezoidal summation.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Peak Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of Apalutamide</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 57</time_frame>
    <description>Cmax is defined as peak observed plasma concentration of the drug.</description>

    <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical event that occurs in a participant administered an investigational product, and it does not necessarily indicate only events with clear causal relationship with the relevant investigational product.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants must not have hepatic encephalopathy greater than or equal to (&gt;=) Grade
             3 (for participants with severe hepatic impairment) where the participant lacks the
             capacity to provide informed consent as judged by the investigator. Mild or moderate
             hepatic encephalopathy that would not impede informed consent in the investigator's
             judgment is permitted

          -  Participants with normal hepatic function must be in good health with no clinically
             significant findings from medical history, physical examination, vital signs, and
             laboratory evaluation, unless deemed not clinically significant by the investigator

          -  Participants with normal hepatic function must have serum creatinine within normal
             limits and Creatinine Clearance (CrCL) greater than (&gt;) 60 milliliter per minute per
             1.73 meter square (mL/min/1.73 m^2) as calculated per Chronic Kidney Disease
             Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) Creatinine Equation

          -  Participants with severe hepatic impairment must have a total Child-Pugh score of 10
             to 15 inclusive, as determined by the investigator during screening and on Day -1
             prior to study drug administration. Source documents to substantiate the clinical
             diagnosis (for example, ultrasonography, liver biopsy, liver/spleen scan, laboratory
             results or clinical findings), and medical history will be reviewed and signed by the
             investigator

          -  Participants with severe hepatic impairment must have CrCL) &gt;= 45 mL/min/1.73 m^2 as
             calculated per CKD-EPI Creatinine Equation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any participant with screening thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level &gt; upper limit
             of normal (ULN)

          -  Participants with normal hepatic function with presence of sexual dysfunction
             (abnormal libido, erectile dysfunction, etc.) or any medical condition that would
             affect sexual function

          -  Participants with normal hepatic function who have Hepatitis A immunoglobulin M
             positivity, Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positivity, positive serology for
             Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C antibodies. Hepatitis B surface antibody positivity is not
             exclusionary if participant can provide evidence of Hepatitis B vaccination

          -  Participants with severe hepatic impairment who have acute or exacerbating hepatitis,
             fluctuating or rapidly deteriorating hepatic function as indicated by widely varying
             or worsening of clinical and/or laboratory signs of hepatic impairment in the judgment
             of either the investigator or the sponsor's medical monitor

          -  Participants with severe hepatic impairment previously diagnosed with hepatocellular
             carcinoma
