  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to integrate an intervention into an ongoing study and
      evaluate its clinical feasibility and estimated effects on participants' experiences of
      respect, trust, and willingness to enroll in current and future studies. This intervention
      will be developed based on preliminary interview and focus group findings. The investigators
      will integrate the intervention into the study enrollment process of a partner study and
      measure it with a brief survey. In this feasibility study, the investigators will learn if
      this intervention can successfully be integrated into a clinical trial, gather preliminary
      data to determine if it should be tested in a future efficacy study, and estimate sample size
      for future study. The investigators hypothesize that the intervention will increase perceived
      respect, trust, and willingness to enroll.

    <description>Scores on 4-item Trust in Medical Researchers scale (Hall et al. Measuring Trust in Medical Researchers. Medical Care 2006;44(11):1048-53) among individuals exposed to the intervention versus not exposed. Each question is scored on a 1-5 scale (including one reverse-coded negative question), for a minimum score of 4 and maximum of 20, with higher scores indicating higher trust.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participant-reported perception of respect among individuals exposed to the intervention versus not exposed. No validated measures exist for this outcome so it will be assessed with a single item, &quot;I felt respected in this study&quot; (precise wording to be finalized after cognitive testing), scored on a 1-5 scale from &quot;strongly disagree&quot; to &quot;strongly agree,&quot; with higher scores indicating higher perceived respect.</description>

    <description>Participant-reported willingness to enroll in future studies among individuals exposed to the intervention versus not exposed. No validated measures exist for this outcome so it will be assessed with a single item, &quot;I would be willing to join another study in the future&quot; (precise wording to be finalized after cognitive testing), scored on a 1-5 scale from &quot;strongly disagree&quot; to &quot;strongly agree,&quot; with higher scores indicating greater willingness to enroll.</description>

    <description>This intervention will be designed based on outcomes from interviews and focus groups that will identify specific actions with the potential to demonstrate respect in the recruitment and consent process. Potential interventions include but are not limited to: research staff training, messaging related to inclusivity, messaging related to voluntariness, additional ethical oversight or other autonomy protections, and guidelines for researchers about study design.</description>
