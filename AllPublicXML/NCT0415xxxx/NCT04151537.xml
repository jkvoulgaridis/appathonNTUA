  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Personal Activity Intelligence (PAI) is a novel metric developed to quantify the amount of
      routine physical activity (PA) needed to improve health and reduce cardiovascular (CV)
      mortality. The PAI metric can be integrated in PA monitors to promote and track PA. The
      present pilot study is a 12-week randomized controlled trial designed to test the efficacy of
      PAI in the treatment of high blood pressure. The primary aim is to investigate how routine PA
      (expressed as PAI level) affect ambulatory blood pressure by comparing the effect of the
      intervention (≥100 PAI per week) with a control recommended to follow national PA guidelines.
      The secondary aims are to investigate the effect on a comprehensive CV risk profile, and to
      model the effect of PAI level on multiple CV parameters. The CV risk profile includes office
      BP, arterial stiffness, stroke volume, heart rate, cardiac output, systemic vascular
      resistance, cardiorespiratory fitness, body composition, blood lipid profile and serum
      markers of glucose metabolism, kidney failure and systemic inflammation.

      The PAI metric incorporates all aspects of an exercise dose and accounts for age, sex,
      resting and maximum heart rate (HR), and translates individual HR patterns during PA into one
      continuous, easily understandable and personalized metric of PA. Furthermore, the PAI metric
      can be integrated in HR monitors to promote and track PA (PAI monitor).

      In apparently healthy adults, obtaining a high PAI level (≥100 PAI per week), in comparison
      to being physically inactive (0 PAI per week), has been associated with a longer life (~4.7
      years), a lower prevalence of hypertension and other CV risk factors, and a reduced risk of
      premature death from any cause (13-17%) and from CV disease (17-23%) [Nes et al, 2017].
