  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vibro-tactile feedback may be beneficial for some patients, who have positional obstructive
      sleep apnoea (OSA).

      Aim: to determine whether Positional Therapy, applied by a discrete neck-worn vibro-tactile
      feedback device, is an effective treatment for positional OSA, in reducing the disease
      severity and associated symptoms, compared to Sham-Positional Therapy. The interaction
      between treatment and age will also be assessed, since pathophysiology, symptoms and
      treatment tolerance varies with age.

      Methods: A prospective randomised, parallel, double-blinded trial comparing Positional
      Therapy (Night Shift™; Advanced Brain Monitoring, USA) with Sham-Positional Therapy,
      performed in older (&gt;65 years) and younger patients with positional OSA (apnoea/hypopnea
      index (AHI)&gt;5 events/hour, 2:1 when supine). The primary endpoint, AHI at 3 months, will be
      measured by a repeat study with the device in situ, and compared between Positional Therapy
      and Sham-Positional Therapy. Patients' subjective symptoms, wellbeing and quality of life,
      will be assessed by questionnaires at baseline and 3 months. Adherence to therapy will be
      measured.

    <description>Apnoea-hypopnea Index (AHI) (events/hour) measured by overnight polygraphy; 0 to &lt;5 events/hour is no OSA, &gt;=5 to &lt;15 events/hour is mild OSA, &gt;=15to &lt;30 events/hour is moderate OSA, &gt;=30 events/hour is severe OSA; Lower AHI is an improvement in disease</description>

    <measure>Change in AHI (events/hr) in younger (18-&lt;65yrs) compared to older (&gt;=65years) patients: Final AHI after 3 months (adjusted for baseline AHI) of patients treated with Positional Therapy, compared to Sham-Positional Therapy, in older compared to younger</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Apnoea-hypopnea Index (AHI) (events/hour) measured by overnight polygraphy; 0 to &lt;5 events/hour is no OSA, &gt;=5 to &lt;15 events/hour is mild OSA, &gt;=15to &lt;30 events/hour is moderate OSA, &gt;=30 events/hour is severe OSA; Lower AHI is an improvement in disease</description>

    <measure>Changes in Subjective sleepiness: Final scores after 3 months (adjusted for baseline scores) of patients treated with Positional Therapy, compared to sham-treated controls, in Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Epworth Sleepiness Scale; 8 scenarios with the likeliness of falling asleep scored in each scenario from 0-3. The 8 Likert response items are summed to calculate a total score. Score range is 0 -24, with higher scores indicating greater daytime sleepiness. Scores &gt;=11 are generally considered abnormal, or positive for excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS).</description>

    <measure>Changes in Quality of Life - measured by Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ); Final scores after 3 months (adjusted for baseline scores) of patients treated with Positional Therapy, compared to sham-treated controls, in FOSQ</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ) contains 30 items with 5 subscales (scored from 0-4 or 0-6 each). an average score is calculated for each subscale, and the 5 subscales are totaled to produce a total score.Score range is 5-20 points, with higher scores indicating better functional status.</description>

    <measure>Changes in Anxiety and Depression: Final scores after 3 months (adjusted for baseline scores) of patients treated with Positional Therapy, compared to sham-treated controls, in the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) is a fourteen item scale. Seven of the items relate to anxiety and seven relate to depression. Each item on the questionnaire is scored from 0-3 and this means that a person can score between 0 and 21 for either anxiety or depression. Scores of 8-10 indicate mild disease; 11-14 moderate and 15 to 21 severe. A reduction is considered an improvement in Anxiety or Depression.</description>

    <measure>Changes in Independent Functioning: Final scores after 3 months (adjusted for baseline scores) of patients treated with Positional Therapy, compared to sham-treated controls, in Townsend Disability Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Townsend disability scale (McGee et al., 1998) is a short index of activities that assesses physical ability in social terms. The scale consists of nine questions or 'items'. The valid responses — 'yes, with no difficulty', 'yes, with some difficulty' and 'no, needs help'—score 0, 1 and 2 respectively. The scale gives equal weighting to each item. Townsend formed groups to interpret the scale (Townsend, 1979): a total score of 0 was regarded as indicating no disability, 1-2 being slightly affected, 3-6 having some disability, 7-10 having appreciable disability, 11-14 having severe disability and 15-18 having very severe disability.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Quality of Life measured by the Short-form 36 (SF-36); Final scores after 3 months (adjusted for baseline scores) of patients treated with Positional Therapy, compared to sham-treated controls, in SF-36</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 questionnaire has 36 items dividing into 8 scales and then again into 2 components (mental and physical). The SF-36 consists of 8 scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability. To calculate the scores it is necessary to purchase special software. Sores out of 100 are presented for the 8 scales and 2 components</description>

    <measure>Changes in subjective sleep quality and bed partner's perspective: Final scores after 3 months (adjusted for baseline scores) of patients treated with Positional Therapy, compared to sham-treated controls, in Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI): 19 items across 7 components are included in scoring. 5 additional items, to be completed by a bed partner, are included in the questionnaire but are not used for scoring. Each of the 7 component scores is determined based on scoring algorithms, with the 7 component scores each yielding a score of 0 -3. A PSQI global (total) score is obtained by summing each of the 7 component scores. Scoring algorithms for each component involve a mixture of averaging Likert response scores, categorization of free text responses (e.g., sleep latency of 15-30 minutes = 1 point), and arithmetic determination of sleep efficiency based on free-text responses. Score range is 0 -21 points, with higher scores indicating better sleep quality.</description>
