      This study attempts to validate the Greek version of the CAM Diagnostic Algorithm and Nu-DESC
      in patients undergoing surgery under general anesthesia.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Accurate diagnosis for Greek speaking patients suffering from postoperative delirium is
      limited by the need for a translation of standardized tools that were investigated for their
      inter-rater reliability/agreement.

      Our primary aim is to validate the Greek version of the CAM Diagnostic Algorithm and Nu-DESC
      in patients undergoing surgery under general anesthesia. Our secondary aim is to estimate the
      diagnostic accuracy of NuDESK in our population.

      This study will provide the first official Greek translation of CAM and Nu-DESC, according to
      the ISPOR guidelines, and the first evaluation of their inter-rater agreement.

    <description>Two trained raters, who are blinded and have no access to each other's evaluation, administer the CAM and Nu-DESC questionnaires in each shift, during the first postoperative day after the discharge from the post-anaesthesia care unit, independently. The two assessments are completed within 60 minutes of each other. If the research team set the diagnosis of POD, the appropriate treatment will be initiated, according to the Hospital's protocol</description>
