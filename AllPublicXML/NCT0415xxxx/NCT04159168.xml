    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to test a novel intervention for children ages 6-9 with elevated
      callous-unemotional (CU) traits. Conduct problems are among the most prevalent and costly
      mental health conditions of childhood, and a common antecedent to adult psychiatric
      disorders. An established risk factor for early, persistent, and severe youth misconduct is
      the presence of CU traits. CU traits (e.g., lack of empathy or guilt, shallow affect) are
      analogous to the core affective features of adult psychopathy, interfere with child
      socialization, and predict poorer outcomes, even with well-established treatments for
      disruptive behavior disorders. Thus, novel intervention approaches are needed to target CU
      traits. Youth with elevated CU traits show deficits in facial emotion recognition (FER) for
      distress-related expressions, particularly fear or sadness. The central hypothesis is that
      impaired sensitivity for emotional distress cues (fear and/or sadness) is mechanistically
      linked to CU traits in children, and that, by targeting affect sensitivity directly,
      intervention can exert downstream effects on CU traits. A gap in the field regards how to
      remediate these neurocognitive deficits. This project will directly target affect sensitivity
      in high-CU youth. The investigators propose an experimental therapeutics approach to develop
      a novel neurocognitive intervention for CU traits, in which a clearly identified target,
      facial affect sensitivity (FAS), will be engaged and assessed via primary (distress FER
      accuracy and/or heightened eye gaze) and secondary (electroencephalograph event-related
      potential) neurocognitive and behavioral processes. If investigators can demonstrate
      engagement of the target (FAS) in the initial R61 phase, then in the R33 phase, this finding
      will be replicated with a new, larger sample, and feasibility and preliminary efficacy of
      FAST on CU traits will be examined. The long-term goal is to examine FAST impact on
      behavioral outcomes and to potentially apply this targeted intervention to the wider range of
      problems associated with CU traits.

      This project will directly target affect sensitivity in high-CU youth. Per the National
      Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Strategic Plan (Objective 3.1), the investigators propose
      an experimental therapeutics approach to develop a novel neurocognitive intervention for CU
      traits, in which a clearly identified target, facial affect sensitivity (FAS), will be
      engaged and assessed via primary [distress facial emotion recognition (FER) accuracy,
      heightened eye gaze] and secondary (EEG event-related potential) neurocognitive and
      behavioral processes. The long-term goal is to apply this targeted intervention to the wider
      range of problems associated with CU traits. The R61 phase Specific Aims are as follows:
      Investigators will first demonstrate, in a preliminary randomized controlled trial (RCT; N=84
      children), that a new neurocognitive intervention (Facial Affect Sensitivity Training: FAST)
      can improve FAS [target engagement] in children with elevated CU traits. FAS will be measured
      primarily by FER accuracy for distress expressions and/or heightened attention to the eye
      region (eye gaze), and secondarily by neural activity [specifically, N170 and P200
      event-related potential (ERP) components]. Objective 1: Establish that distress FER accuracy
      and/or eye gaze can be altered in a reliable manner among young children with elevated CU
      traits. Objective 2: Determine whether FAST improves secondary neural indices of FAS (brain
      activity during processing of emotional faces). Objective 3: Refine FAST for subsequent
      evaluation by determining optimal dose parameters with regard to number of sessions for FER
      and/or eye gaze improvement via a nonlinear mixed model for small samples (e.g., timing of
      local bump or decay, amount of change, when maximal change occurs), and participant
      satisfaction with session frequency, length, and number. Objective 4: Deliver a computerized
      training program (FAST) capable of providing real-time automated feedback and reinforcement
      of accurate FER performance. Milestones (Go/No-Go Criteria): (1) FAST will engage the target
      (FAS), indexed by enhancing distress FER accuracy and/or eye gaze in high-CU youth. The
      investigators will examine individual growth rates and test slope differences between
      conditions (FAST v control). Target engagement will be defined as medium effect size (defined
      as Cohen's d value = .50) in the comparison of FAST vs. no-treatment control on the primary
      target (distress FER and/or eye gaze). The R33 phase Specific Aims are as follows: The
      investigators aim to replicate target engagement with a new, larger high CU sample and
      evaluate feasibility and preliminary efficacy of FAST, in the context of an RCT (N = 84) in
      which FAST is compared to an active control condition (ACC; implicit eye gaze training). In
      addition, this phase will validate the functional role of FAS by examining downstream change
      in CU as a result of FAST. FAST will produce reliable increases in FER accuracy for distress
      cues in others. Furthermore, FAST completers will show greater improvement in CU/empathic
      behaviors than ACC completers. Objective 5: Replicate target engagement of FAS. Objective 6:
      Determine if improved FAS leads to reduction in CU traits. The investigators will also
      consider in a preliminary fashion whether CU trait reductions are clinically significant
      (more than .5 pre-test standard deviation on 2 target CU indices or more than 1.0 standard
      deviation on one CU measure). If the FAST intervention improves FER and reduces CU traits,
      such training in early childhood could help interrupt the developmental cascade toward
      antisocial outcomes.

    <intervention_model_description>This study utilizes a randomized controlled trial design to test whether a new neurocognitive intervention (Facial Affect Sensitivity Training: FAST) can improve facial affect sensitivity (FAS) in children with elevated CU traits. In FAST, which uses exogenous incentives to train FAS, a series of emotional facial expressions are presented on a computer monitor. Child participants are instructed to look at the eyes of the emotional expressions they view, and must select from a list of emotions the one that matches the facial expression they saw on each trial, which results in reinforcement of correct responses via auditory reward tone. Correct responses also earn points toward incrementally &quot;priced&quot; small toys given at the end of each session. The objective is to make appropriate eye gaze more automatic during FER (thus improving facial affect sensitivity) by repeatedly pairing correct responses with a reward.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>This computerized task was developed to target implicit training of eye gaze but not facial emotion recognition per se via real-time feedback and incentives. On each trial, a fixation cross is followed by an emotional face with eyes directed either left, straight ahead, or right (balanced across expressions), followed by a response key. The child's task is to say which direction the eyes are looking (e.g., &quot;1&quot; or &quot;left&quot;). Stimuli are black and white standardized photographs of men and women models from the Ekman Pictures of Facial Affect each displaying the 3 gaze directions for 6 emotion expressions.</description>
