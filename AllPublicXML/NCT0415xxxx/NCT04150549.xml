  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a placebo-controlled, double-blinded, randomized trial design, whereby all patients
      are eligible to start an injectable therapy, and then randomized to either placebo or FMT for
      approximately 1 year.

      Fecal Microbiome Transplants: Patients will undergo pretreatment with Amoxicillin/Clavulinate
      (or matched placebo) for 5 days followed by a bowel cleanse with PEGLYTE. Patients will
      undergo allogeneic or autologous fecal transplants. Patients will be dosed with FMT oral
      capsules approximately 48 hours after antibiotic treatment has stopped. Following the FMT
      capsule treatment on day 1, patients will be administered a repeat oral capsule or placebo
      dose at 3 weeks. Oral omeprazole or omeprazole placebo will be given 1 hour prior to the
      baseline and 3 week dose. This will be done to ensure full engraftment of the transplant.

      Participants will be seen at baseline, 3 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months. A
      series of neurological tests will be performed for safety measures. In addition to this, MRIs
      will be completed at baseline, 6 weeks and 12 months. Blood, urine and stool samples will
      also be collected for data analysis and safety measures.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neurofilament Light Serum Levels</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 weeks, 3 months, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>As a biomarker of neuronal damage neurofilament light chain levels will be detected. Peripheral blood will be collected in appropriate tubes at baseline, 6 weeks, 3 months and 12 months and processed for serum.
Once collected all samples will be sent to the University of Ottawa where a Simoa NfL assay will be undertaken on their Simoa Analyzer.
Patients with multiple sclerosis have been shown to have increased intestinal permeability, likely due to a reduction in butyrate-producing bacteria. A decrease in butyrate producing bacteria has been shown to be associated with increased intestinal permeability. Relapsing-remitting MS patients have been shown to have increased intestinal permeability, which may allow dietary and microbial antigens from the intestinal lumen to pass into the blood stream and cause autoimmune responses in MS patients. This may prime the immune system to develop a humoral response to certain bacteria.</description>

    <measure>Intestinal Permeability</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 weeks, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Small Intestine Permeability: Mannitol/Lactulose administration will be used and urine will be collected to measure small intestine permeability. For small intestine permeability patients will be instructed to drink lactulose solution and collect the urine throughout the night and first thing in the morning. A proper collecting bottle will be provided. Once the urine sample bottle reaches the laboratory University Hospital the total volume will be measured and an aliquot of 30mL total, 10mL in each sterile urine container (no other additives) will be separated and stored at -20C and sent on dry ice to Dr. Meddings laboratory at Calgary, Alberta. All biological material will be transported according to biosafety regulations.</description>

    <measure>IgA Microbiota</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 weeks, 6 weeks, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>IgA Microbiota analysis: IgA bound bacteria will be detected and sorted (magnetic beads or flow cytometry) using anti-IgA (pan-IgA, detect monomer and secreted multimer (Miltenyi clone: IS11-8E10). Sorted IgA bound bacteria will be stored, and the DNA extracted in one batch at the end of the study. Changes in the composition of IgA bound bacteria for each patient will be determined using the previously mentioned methods. (Rojas, et al. 2018; Planer, et al. 2016)</description>

    <measure>Stool Microbiome</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Gut microbiota analysis before and after FMT: Toilet paper samples will be collected from patients' at baseline and 1-2 days before each scheduled appointment (Al et al. 2018). Patients will store the toilet paper inside of DNA free plastic bags and keep them at 4 Â°C in the refrigerator until the time of their appointment (alternatively, the samples can be mailed in to the lab, but one method must be chosen for all of the samples collected). Toilet paper samples will be collected from the FMT donor every time they drop off a stool sample for donation. DNA from the toilet paper samples will be extracted in one batch at the end of the study and sent for Illumina Mi-Seq next-generation sequencing of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Changes in the composition of gut bacteria will be determined using custom R scripts.</description>

    <measure>Metabolomics</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Metabolomics: Serum will be collected for metabolomic analysis. Metabolomics can be used to identify biomarkers of MS and may provide us with information about which patients are more likely to respond to FMT therapy. Butyrate producing bacteria have been shown to be in lower relative abundance in MS patients and concentrations of short-chain fatty acids in stool and will be investigated before and after FMT.</description>
