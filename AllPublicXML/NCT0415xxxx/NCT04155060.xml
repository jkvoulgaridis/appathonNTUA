  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host
      response to infection. Early diagnosis of sepsis and identification of more severe sepsis is
      important to improve the outcomes .Therefore, reliable markers are required to early identify
      the high-risk patients. Currently, lactate is widely applied as the marker for evaluating the
      severity of sepsis and for outcome predicting. DM affects lactate balance and raised baseline
      lactate. The objective of this study was to compare the different prognostic value of
      admission lactate for sepsis patients with or without DM.

      Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host
      response to infection. Early diagnosis of sepsis and identification of more severe sepsis is
      important to improve the outcomes .Therefore, reliable markers are required to early identify
      the high-risk patients.

      Currently, lactate is widely applied as the marker for evaluating the severity of sepsis and
      for outcome predicting.Nevertheless, the value of lactate for predicting sepsis is still
      controversial.The reasons for the different cutoff value may be due to the fact that sepsis
      is a heterogeneous disease which has already been defined by a number of clinical, laboratory
      and radiologic criteria, rather than specific pathologic findings. Therefore, we hypothesized
      that the discrepancy clinical value of lactate may be resulted from the heterogeneous feature
      of sepsis.

      DM affects lactate balance and raised baseline lactate. The objective of this study was to
      compare the different prognostic value of admission lactate for sepsis patients with or
      without DM.
