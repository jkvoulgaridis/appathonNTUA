    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and efficacy of ASTX660 when given alone and
      in combination with ASTX727 in participants with relapsed/refractory (R/R) acute myeloid
      leukemia (AML). The duration of the study is expected to be approximately 30 months.

    <textblock>
      This is a three-part dose escalation and dose expansion Phase 1 study of ASTX660 alone and in
      combination with ASTX727 in adults with R/R AML.

      Part 1 is an open-label, single arm, dose escalation with ASTX660 in combination with ASTX727
      at the standard fixed dose combination (FDC).

      Part 2 is an open-label, randomized, dose escalation intended to evaluate ASTX660 as a
      monotherapy and ASTX660 in combination with ASTX727 FDC.

      Part 3 is an exploratory single arm dose expansion to further expand the number of
      participants treated with ASTX660 in combination with ASTX727 FDC.

         14. Treated with any investigational therapy within 2 weeks of the first dose of study
             treatment.

         15. Prior treatment with hypomethylating agent (ie, decitabine or azacitidine) for more
             than 2 cycles.
