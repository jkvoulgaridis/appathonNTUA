  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators conducted a prospective, block-randomized study to determine whether and to
      what extent changes in the default settings in the electronic medical record (EMR) affect
      opioid prescriptions for patients discharged from emergency departments (EDs).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In two large, urban emergency departments, we randomly altered the pre-populated dispense
      quantities of discharge prescriptions for commonly-prescribed opioids over a series of five
      4-week blocks. These changes were made without announcement, and providers were not informed
      of the study itself.
