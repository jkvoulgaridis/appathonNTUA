  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Trials comparing PCT-guided antibiotic algorithms to standard management show a significant
      reduction in antibiotic exposure without an increase in mortality or treatment failure.
      Despite this strong evidence from multiple studies a recent prospective multicentric
      interventional trial in the US fell short of demonstrating antibiotic reductions by
      PCT-guided antibiotic management. Amongst other limitations the authors of that study
      concluded that successful implementation of PCT may require closer educational oversight. As
      such, this study will compare effectiveness and safety of antibiotic prescription guided by a
      PCT-algorithm via a Stewardship Team over standard guidelines in hospitalized adult patients
      with suspected or confirmed LRTI (including sepsis with respiratory focus).
