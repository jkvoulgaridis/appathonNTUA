  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to evaluate the pharmacokinetic and adhesion performance of
      ZTlido (lidocaine topical system) 1.8% during physical exercise, application of heat, and
      under normal conditions.

    <textblock>
      In this open-label, three-period crossover study, 12 healthy, adult male and female subjects
      are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment sequences. During each treatment period, subjects have
      three lidocaine topical systems applied to their back for 12 hours with 7-day washout between
      treatments. In each treatment period, the subject will either exercise (Treatment A), apply a
      heating pad (Treatment B), or refrain from these activities (Treatment C) while wearing the
      topical system. Blood samples for lidocaine PK will be collected pre-dose until 48 hours.
      Adhesion will be monitored throughout the wear time and skin irritation will be assessed the
      topical system is removed.

    <description>Adhesion to skin assessed by FDA 0-4 scoring system. The scoring for adhesion of patches is indicated as follows: 0 = ≥ 90% Adhered (essentially no lift off the skin), 1 = ≥ 75% to &lt; 90% Adhered (some edges only lifting off the skin), 2 = ≥ 50% to &lt; 75% Adhered (less than half of the patch lifting off the skin), &gt; 0% to &lt; 50% Adhered but not detached (more than half of the patch lifting off the skin without falling off), and 4 = 0% adhered (patched completely detached). The cumulative adhesion score is calculated as the sum of scores at each assessment time point.</description>

    <measure>Dermal Response Score</measure>
    <time_frame>12.5 and 14 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Product tolerability is assessed by Dermal Response Score. The application site is evaluated 30 minutes and 2 hours after product removal (12.5 and 14 hours post-dose, respectively). Response score from 0 to 7; 0= No evidence of irritation, 1= Minimal erythema, barely perceptible, 2= Definite erythema, readily visible; minimal edema or minimal papular response, 3= Erythema and papules, 4= Definite edema, 5= Erythema, edema and papules, 6= Vesicular eruption, 7= Strong reaction spreading beyond test (i.e., application) site.</description>
