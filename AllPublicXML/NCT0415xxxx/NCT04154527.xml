      This study evaluates the bladder base displacements during abdominal and pelvic floor
      exercises in postpartum women comparing to nulliparous women

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postpartum women are at increased risk of suffering pelvic floor dysfunctions. However, only
      a few researches are focused on the exercises physiological effect at the postpartum recovery
      period.

      A prospective observational study was designed to evaluate the protective or the prolapsed
      effect of abdominal and pelvic floor exercises in postpartum women.

      Two groups were established: Group A was composed of primiparous women during postpartum
      period and group B of nulliparous women. Both groups practiced the same set of 6 abdominal
      and perineum exercises. The bladder descent was registered by ultrasonography, and the
      correct execution was controlled in both groups by superficial pelvic floor and abdominal
      electromyography.

      A Graphical User Interface on MATLAB software has been developed for aiding in offline
      measurement process.

    <arm_group_label>postpartum women with no pelvic floor disorders</arm_group_label>
    <description>This group realised a set of 6 abdominal and pelvic floor exercises, with a muscle recruitment of 25% of maximum force.
Exercise A: Pelvic Floor contraction Exercise B: Pelvic Floor and Deep Abdominal muscles contraction Exercise C: Pelvic Floor, Deep Abdominal muscles contraction, and axial Stretching Exercise D: Pelvic Floor, Deep and Superficial Abdominal muscles contraction Exercise E: Abdominal Crunch Exercise Exercise F: Low pressure Abdominal Exercise The correct muscle contraction execution was controlled by superficial pelvic floor and abdominal electromyography.
The bladder base and neck displacement was registered by Transabdominal Ultrasound (TAUS) and Transperineal Ultrasound (TPUS) respectively. To image the bladder base and the bladder neck a 3.5 MHz (megahertz) curved linear array ultrasound transducer was used (LOGIQe Ultrasound,General Electric Healthcare, USA) with the ultrasound unit set in B mode.</description>
