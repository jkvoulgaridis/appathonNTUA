    <description>If the subject is enrolled in this clinical trial, the test and control devices will be applied at baseline. All subjects will receive a urinary catheter at the site of the artificial bladder and the urethra after surgery, and temporary urinary replacement should be selected by the investigator at each institution in preparation for the possibility of postoperative blockage of the urinary catheter.
After surgery, urine analysis and culture are performed on the 4th and 7th day, and urine analysis and culture are performed before the urethral catheter removal on the 14th (2 weeks) and the urethral catheter is removed. At this time, the urethral catheter tip is cut about 5-8 cm and cultured.</description>
