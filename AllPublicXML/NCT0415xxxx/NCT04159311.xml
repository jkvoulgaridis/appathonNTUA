      Type : interventional, randomized single blind study Aim : to evaluate 3 sessions of
      osteopathy on IBS-like symptoms associated with ulcerative colitis in remission Number of
      patients : 50 (randomization 1:1) Duration of the inclusion period : 2 years Primary
      end-point : Irritable Bowel Syndrome Severity Scoring System (IBS SSS) at 3 months

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Osteopathy has been shown to be effective in IBS patients in few studies and to improse
      IBS-like symptoms in a short series of Crohn patients. IBS-like symptoms are frequent in
      patients with ulcerative colitis in remission (about 20 %).

      The aim of this interventional, randomized single blind study is to evaluate the impact of 3
      sessions of osteopathy on Irritable Bowel Syndrome symptoms in 50 patients (randomisation
      1:1) with ulcerative colitis in remission (defined by fecal calprotectin &lt; 200 µg/g).

      The two group of patients will have 4 sessions of osteopathy (M0, M1, M2, M3). The &quot;treated
      group&quot; will have 3 sessions of osteopathy testing followed by osteopathy treatment (M0, M1,
      M2) and a final testing session at M3. The &quot;untreated group&quot; will have 4 sessions of only
      testing osteopathy (M0, M1, M2, M3).

      Primary end-points : Irritable Bowel Syndrome Severity Scoring System (IBS SSS) at 3 months
      (M3) Secondary end-points : Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire ol, Functional
      Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue at M3, evaluation of osteopathic dysfunctions
      between M0 and M3, questionnaire for use of medication for IBS between M0 and M3

    <description>it will be interesting to see if patients with remission-prone RCH have similar osteopathic dysfunctions at the beginning of the study, and then if the management during the study influences or not these osteopathic dysfunctions.
Osteopathic dysfunction is an alteration of the mobility, viscoelasticity or texture of somatic system components. It is accompanied or not by a painful sensibility.</description>
