  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a small case series, the investigators identified five patients who had an initial
      response to standard daratumumab (weekly for 2 cycles, every other week for 4 cycles, then
      monthly thereafter) either as mono- or combination therapy, who then had daratumumab
      frequency escalated when early biochemical progression was noted, an investigational
      endeavor. In this series, patients received a median of 5 additional cycles of daratumumab at
      an escalated frequency (range: 2-8). Additionally, the median change in involved paraprotein
      after one cycle of weekly-escalated dara was -40% (range: -67% to +5%), with most achieving
      prior partial response or stable disease.

      In patients who initially have at least a partial response (PR) to daratumumab, who then have
      biochemical progression following de-escalation, it is conceivable that CD38 saturation is
      not optimized at the every 4 weeks dosing interval. The investigators believe that escalating
      the frequency of daratumumab in patients with biochemical progression, in this
      investigational setting, may recapture the initial response, delay clinical progression,
      and/or delay treatment changes.

                  history of prior HBV vaccination do not need to be tested for HBV DNA by PCR.
                  During and following study treatment, subjects who have history of HBV infection
                  will be closely monitored for clinical and laboratory signs of reactivation of
                  HBV as specified in the Time and Events Schedule. Where required by local law,

             negative but positive for antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen [anti-HBc] and/or
             antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen [anti-HBs]) must be screened using real-time
             polymerase chain reaction (PCR) measurement of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA levels.
             Those who are PCR positive will be excluded. EXCEPTION: Subjects with serologic
             findings suggestive of HBV vaccination (anti-HBs positivity as the only serologic
             marker) AND a known history of prior HBV vaccination, do not need to be tested for HBV
             DNA by PCR.
