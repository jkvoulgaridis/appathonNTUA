    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to better understand how blood flow and metabolism
      change can influence brain development in the early decades of life.

      We will examine brain blood flow and metabolism using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The
      brain's blood vessels expand and constrict to regulate blood flow based on the brain's needs.
      The amount of expanding and contracting the blood vessels can do varies by age. The brain's
      blood flow changes in small ways during everyday activities, such as normal brain growth,
      exercise, or deep concentration. Significant illness or psychological stress may increase the
      brain's metabolic demand or cause other bigger changes in blood flow. If blood vessels are
      not able to expand to give more blood flow when metabolic demand is high, the brain may not
      get all of the oxygen it needs. In extreme circumstances, if the brain is unable to get
      enough oxygen for a long time, a stroke may occur. Sometimes small strokes occur without
      other noticeable changes and are only detectable on an MRI. These are sometimes called
      &quot;silent strokes.&quot; In less extreme circumstances, not having as much oxygen as it wants may
      cause the brain to grow and develop more slowly than it should.

      One way to test the ability of blood vessels to expand is by measuring blood flow while
      breathing in carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide causes blood vessels in the brain to dilate
      without increasing brain metabolism.

      During this study participants may be asked to undergo a blood draw, MRI, and potential
      neuropsychological assessments. It is also possible that the study team will use a special
      mask to control the amount of carbon dioxide the participants breathe in so they don't
      breathe in too much.

      The purpose of the study is to identify imaging biomarkers for brain tissue under high
      metabolic stress at risk for permanent injury. We will measure CBF, OEF, and CVR in children
      with and without perturbations in cerebral oxygen delivery over time to determine each
      parameter's role in clinical and radiologic neurologic outcomes. Measuring CBF and OEF can be
      done with specialized MRI sequences. Measuring CVR requires a vasoactive response, such as
      carbon dioxide. In order to delivery carbon dioxide evenly and as safely as possible, we will
      use an MRI-compatible device to prevent over-breathing carbon dioxide and allow rapid
      steady-state physiology to minimize total scan time.
