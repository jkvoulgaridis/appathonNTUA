  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers will conduct a 2-arm pilot randomized controlled trial with HIV-infected index
      patients recruited from two all-male prisons in Indonesia to assess the acceptability and
      feasibility of provider-assisted HIV partner notification (provider referral) and examine its
      potential to increase the number of partners who are tested for HIV and subsequently linked
      to prevention and treatment services.

      This study compares three options for partner notification:

        -  Option 1 (Self-tell): Participant is encouraged to disclose his HIV+ status to his
           partner(s) and given information about sites where his partner(s) can receive free HIV
           testing.

        -  Option 2 (Tell together): Participant discloses his HIV+ status to his partners with a
           counselor (project staff) present. Counselor refers the partner to HIV testing,
           including a study-affiliated HIV testing site.

        -  Option 3 (Provider referral): Project staff (nurse or peer educator) will notify the
           partner anonymously - without identifying the participant (index patient). Partners are
           offered immediate HIV testing in their home or at a study-affiliated HIV testing site.

    <description>Subjects receive counseling about partner notification and are assisted in identifying all their partners and choosing a notification method for each partner. Subjects have the option to: 1) disclose their HIV status to their partner(s) by themselves (self-tell), 2) disclose their HIV status to their partner(s) with a healthcare provider present (tell together), or 3) have their partner(s) notified confidentially by a disease notifier (anonymous provider referral), who will locate partners, notify them of potential HIV exposure, and offer them HIV testing. Partners with an initial reactive HIV screening test will be referred to care and treatment services.</description>

    <description>Subjects receive counseling about partner notification and are assisted in identifying all their partners and choosing a notification method for each partner. Subjects are responsible for contacting and notifying their partner(s) on their own. Subjects have the option to: 1) disclose their HIV status to their partner(s) by themselves (self-tell) or 2) disclose their HIV status to their partner(s) with a healthcare provider present (tell together). Subjects may decide which partners to notify and may choose the same or a different method for each partner.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria for HIV-positive Prisoners (N=65): Index patients must beat least 18
        years of age, HIV-seropositive and aware of their HIV+ status; (HIV-infection documented by
        a rapid HIV test); sexually active and/or sharing needles in the 12 months before
        incarceration; incarcerated within the past 3 years and â‰¥6 months of their prison sentence
        remaining. We will limit enrollment to index patients who are willing to notify partners
        and have 1 or more partner(s) who have not yet been notified.

        Inclusion Criteria for Partners: Eligible partners will be persons who participants (index
        patients) are able to identify by first and/or last name, residential address and/or mobile
        phone number, and physical descriptors (e.g., approximate height) and have given nurses
        permission to contact. No named partner will be excluded on the basis of religion,
