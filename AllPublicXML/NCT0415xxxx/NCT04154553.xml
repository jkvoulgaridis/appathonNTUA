  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Genetic makeup of a patient influences the efficacy and safety profile of a drug. This study
      is to summarize individual cases, where Pharmacogenetics (PGx) has been applied during
      pharmaceutical care. The primary objective is the compilation of case reports, where
      pharmacogenetic testing is applied to determine the hereditable component of the patient's
      susceptibility to experience therapy failure and/or adverse drug reactions. The experience
      with the compiled cases will be basis for the development of a reliable standard of procedure
      for pharmacogenetic testing in the community pharmacy. The cases will be supplemented with
      information on additional Parameters reported in the literature to affect efficacy or safety
      of the respective drug.

      Genetic makeup of a patient influences the efficacy and safety profile of a drug. This study
      is to summarize individual cases, where Pharmacogenetics (PGx) has been applied during
      pharmaceutical care. Health-related data of patients experiencing therapy failure (TF) or
      adverse drug reaction (ADR) is collected and will then be supplemented with pharmacogenetic
      testing during pharmaceutical care in a study pharmacy. The patient data (diagnoses,
      medications and results of pharmacogenetic testing) is harmonized in order to generate a
      compilation of case reports. The primary objective is the compilation of case reports, where
      pharmacogenetic testing is applied to determine the hereditable component of the patient's
      susceptibility to experience therapy failure and/or adverse drug reactions. The experience
      with the compiled cases will be basis for the development of a reliable standard of procedure
      for pharmacogenetic testing in the community pharmacy. The cases will be supplemented with
      information on additional Parameters reported in the literature to affect efficacy or safety
      of the respective drug.

    <description>Pharmacogenetic panel testing is conducted by Stratipharm with the DNA of the buccal swab. TaqMan® polymerase chain reaction is proceeded to express the genetic information. Stratipharm is a product offered by Humatrix Aktiengesellschaft (AG). It consists of a laboratory analysis of approximately 100 pharmacological relevant genetic variations (polymorphisms) in over 30 different genes, which code for transport proteins, metabolizing enzymes, or drug targets.</description>

      The buccal swab and the extracted DNA are destroyed after two to three weeks after the
      accomplished labor analysis. The coded ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) blood samples
      will be stored at -80°C in the Biobank of Biopharmacy Laboratory until further use.

        The patient population are patients experiencing TF and/or ADRs with substances known to be
        affected by genetic variants that influence their drug metabolism (pharmacokinetics) and/or
        the activity of the drug target (pharmacodynamics).
