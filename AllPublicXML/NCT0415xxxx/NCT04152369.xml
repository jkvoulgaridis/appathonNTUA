  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to determine optimal safe duration of antibiotic prophylaxis in
      patients undergoing endourological procedures and ESWL, presenting with asymptomatic
      bacteriuria caused by multi-drug resistant bacterial strains. In this study we compare safety
      and efficacy of a one-day vs. three-day AMP (Antimicrobial Prophylaxis) in the above
      mentioned group of patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with positive urine culture with Enterobacteriacae ESBL + resistance mechanism upon
      admission for endourological procedure or ESWL were subjected to body temperature measurement
      and laboratory tests: smear from the anus towards the presence of alarm pathogens,
      urinalysis, control urine culture, blood count, CRP (C-reactive protein), procalcitonin
      (PCT). After confirming the occurrence of asymptomatic bacteriuria, the patients were
      randomized to two groups - a one-day and three-day period lasting perioperative antibiotic
      prophylaxis. In both groups on the following day after the procedure (24 hours after the
      procedure) and after 7 days after the procedure, laboratory tests and body temperature
      measurements were performed.

    <description>To determine if a 1-day perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis is as safe and effective as 3-day perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis in patients with Enterobacteriacae ESBL+ urinary tract colonization undergoing endourological procedures. This conclusion will be based on measurements of CRP [mg/dl] as follows: one day prior to procedure, one day post and 7 days after the procedure.
