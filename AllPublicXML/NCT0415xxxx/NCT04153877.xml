  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Patellar tendinopathy is a common inflammatory condition in athletes who undergo
      large volumes of running and jumping. Kinesio-tape速 (KT) is proposed to provide pain relief;
      however, its effect has not been examined on patellar tendinopathy. Objective: To examine the
      effects of KT on pain modulation for active individuals with patellar tendinopathy during
      functional activities. Methods: Thirteen symptomatic knees from seven college-aged females (6
      bilateral; 1 unilateral) were included. Participants underwent three data collection sessions
      with KT, sham, and no tape (NT) in a randomized order. During the session, participants
      performed a maximum vertical jump, single-leg squats and isometric knee extension. The KT
      intervention was applied according to the KT manual and the sham utilized the same pattern
      without tension. Pain level was evaluated using the numeric pain scale before, during and
      after each activity. Function was assessed as maximum vertical jump height and maximum
      isometric strength.
