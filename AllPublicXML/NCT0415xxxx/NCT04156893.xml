      To determine the feasibility of matching donor red cells by RH genotype for a cohort of
      chronically transfused patients with SCD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot feasibility study in patients with Sickle Cell Disease requiring chronic red
      cell transfusions. RH genotyped donor units will be obtained from the New York Blood Center.
      Patients will be matched with donor units whose RH genotypes predict no foreign Rh protein
      exposure to the patient. This will provide red cell matching at a level above the current
      standard of care (serologic C, E, and K matching). Patients will receive RH matched red cells
      for the duration of their chronic transfusion therapy or up to five years, whichever is
      shorter. It will then be determined whether sufficient RH matched donor units can be
      identified for the patient's RH genotype. Although not powered to determine effectiveness,
      all patients's Rh alloantibody formation will be monitored.

      For subjects with a history of stroke/recurrent transient ischemic attack or other indication
      who require tight control of Hb S, and RH genotyped blood is not available, standard of care
      serologic matched blood would be administered rather than delaying transfusion and risking
      higher Hb S level.

      For all subjects, standard of care serologic matched blood would be administered rather than
      delaying transfusion beyond 7 days.

    <description>The primary objective of this study is to determine the feasibility of RH genotype matched red cells for chronically transfused patients with SCD. Approximately 20 RHD (Rhesus D) and 20 RHCE (Rhesus CE) variants have been observed in patients with SCD, and will determine whether sufficient RH genotyped units can be matched to the patient's own RH genotype.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Determine the occurrence of Rh alloimmunization</measure>
    <time_frame>5.5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary objective is to determine if there is a relationship between providing RH genotype matched red cell units to Rh alloimmunization. Although not powered to determine effectiveness, our secondary objective is to monitor for Rh alloimmunization.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects age &gt;12 months

          -  Diagnosis of SCD, all genotypes

          -  Require a period of chronic red cell transfusion therapy

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Rare RH genotype that would preclude identification of sufficient RBC units

          -  Antigen negative requirements due to alloimmunization that would preclude
             identification of sufficient RBC units

          -  Alloimmunized to D antigen

          -  Rh alloimmunized patients for whom providing RH genotype matched blood would expose
             the patient to an antigen that would not be consistent with standard of care and blood
