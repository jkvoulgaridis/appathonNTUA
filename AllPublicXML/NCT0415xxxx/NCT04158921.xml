  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm open label pilot clinical trial that will assess patient-reported blood
      glucose levels before and after using the Control:Diabetes mobile app, while collecting user
      feedback and recommendations for further improvements to the app functionality and user
      interface. This study will enroll approximately 70 individuals with insulin-treated diabetes
      mellitus. The study will include two online surveys (baseline and exit), one study initiation
      phone call, and will also collect data entered by the users into the mobile app.

      The objectives of this study are to:

        -  Test the hypothesis that patients with diabetes mellitus treated with insulin and
           elevated blood glucose will achieve better glycemic control after using the
           Control:Diabetes mobile app.

        -  Test the hypothesis that patients with diabetes mellitus treated with insulin and
           frequent hypoglycemia will achieve lower frequency of hypoglycemia after using the
           Control:Diabetes mobile app.

    <description>The Control:Diabetes app will encourage patients to: a) predict their blood glucose level at a particular time point in the future (e.g. the next morning); then b) enter their actual blood glucose levels when that time (the next morning) comes; and c) enter reasons for the discrepancy between prediction and reality, if the prediction was significantly (e.g. &gt; 20%) different from the actual measurement. We hypothesize that by repeatedly encouraging disassembly of blood glucose changes into individual reasons (cognitive task analysis) while providing an incentive in the form of being able to more accurately predict blood glucose levels (operant conditioning), the app will prompt the patient to learn how various internal and environmental factors affect their blood glucose. They will then be able to adjust their behavior and medications to improve their blood glucose control.</description>
