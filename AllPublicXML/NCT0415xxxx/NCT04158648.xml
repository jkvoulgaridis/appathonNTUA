    <description>Laboratory parameters for hematology and blood chemistry will be measured and compared with a standard reference range. Values outside the standard reference range are considered abnormalities. Not every laboratory abnormality qualifies as an adverse event. A laboratory test result will be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria: is accompanied by clinical symptoms; results in a change in study treatment or a medical intervention; or is clinically significant in the investigator's judgment.</description>
