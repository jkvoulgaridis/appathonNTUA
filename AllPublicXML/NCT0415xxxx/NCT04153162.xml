  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a common disease of the heart which causes thickening of
      the heart muscle.

      HCM primarily affects the muscle of the main pumping chamber of the heart (the left
      ventricle) and particularly the septum (this is the muscular wall which separates the right
      and left side of the heart). In a subgroup of patients, the thickened heart muscle at the
      septum prevents blood from leaving the heart during contraction (this is called obstruction).
      This form of the disease is called hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM).

      HOCM is a common cause of shortness of breath, chest pain and dizzy spells. These symptoms
      are treated with tablets and if symptoms are uncontrolled, patients are often offered
      invasive treatment to get rid of some of the thick heart muscle and reduce obstruction. This
      is achieved either by:

        1. open heart surgery (myectomy) where a surgeon cuts out the thick muscle

        2. injection of alcohol to the thick heart muscle via a tube in the wrist or groin (alcohol
           septal ablation). The alcohol thins the heart muscle at the point of obstruction,
           mimicking the effects of myectomy.

      Unfortunately, some patients are not suitable for both these procedures.

      This study will test whether radiotherapy, usually used for the treatment of tumours, can be
      used to destroy the thick heart muscle at the point of obstruction safely and effectively.
      Study patients will be monitored following the procedure and the investigators plan to
      measure the levels of heart muscle thinning, reduction of obstruction and improvement in
      symptoms and importantly document any side effects.

      Radiotherapy works by precisely targeting high energy X-rays (ionising radiation) at a
      specific area of the body with the aim of destroying abnormal tissue. CyberKnife is one of
      the latest radiotherapy delivery systems, which will deliver highly focussed and accurate
      radiotherapy.
