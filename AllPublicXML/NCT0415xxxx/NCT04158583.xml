      A Phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation study designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability
      of RO7296682 in participants with advanced and/or metastatic solid tumors. RO7296682 will be
      administered by intravenous (IV) infusion every 3 weeks. This entry-into-human study is
      divided into a dose-escalation stage (Part A) and a dose expansion stage (Part B).

             Participants whose tumors have known sensitizing mutation must have experienced
             disease progression (during or after treatment) or intolerance to treatment with a
             respective targeted therapy.

         12. Dementia or altered mental status that would prohibit informed consent.

         13. History of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, or DRESS (drug rash

         14. Active or history of autoimmune disease or immune deficiency.

         15. Prior treatment with CPIs (e.g. anti-CTLA4, anti-PD1, anti-PDL1), immunomodulatory
             monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and/or mAb-derived therapies (approved or
             investigational) is approved.

         16. Prior treatment with a CC chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4)-targeting (e.g. mogamulizumab)
             or a CD25-targeting agent (e.g. basiliximab) is prohibited.

         17. Treatment with standard radiotherapy, any chemotherapeutic agent, targeted therapy or
             treatment with any other investigational drug (defined as treatment for which there is
             currently no regulatory authority-approved indication) within 28 days or 5 half-lives
             of the drug (whichever is shorter), prior to the first RO7296882 administration on
             C1D1.

         18. Radiotherapy within the last 4 weeks before start of study drug treatment, with the
