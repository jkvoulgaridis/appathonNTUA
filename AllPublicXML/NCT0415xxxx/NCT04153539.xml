      This study aims to assess the effects of acute exposure to traffic-related air pollution and
      the underlying mechanisms.

      The investigators will conduct a randomized, crossover trial among 72 healthy young adults in
      Shanghai, China. The eligible participants will be randomly divided into 2 groups (36
      volunteers per group). During the first stage, participants will be requested to take one
      walking task (from 13:00 to 17:30). The exposed group will walk along a busy road and be
      exposed to traffic-related air pollution, while the control group will walk in a traffic-free
      park. During the first 3 hours, all participants will rest for 30 minutes after each
      15-minute walking. From 16:00, participants will stop walking and rest for 1.5 hours. Then
      both groups will enter a 2-week washout period. In the second stage, there will also be one
      walking task (from 13:00 to 17:30). The two groups will exchange their walking sites and
      repeat the previous trial. Physical examinations will be performed both before and after each
      walking task. Besides, we will ask volunteers to stay in school during the two days before
      walking.
