      ABSTRACT

      BACKGROUND:

      Breast Cancer (BC) is one of the leading causes of death among women around the world.
      Integrative oncology, together with conventional medical treatment, has proven to be an
      important support for the control of cancer symptoms, improvement of quality of life, and
      contribution to the overall patient health, providing an integrated patient care both
      physically and emotionally.

      METHODS:

      75 stage II-III breast cancer survivors were randomized (according to age, tumor stage and
      receptor status) into 2 groups: intervention and control. Within the intervention group (IG)
      a diet, exercise and mindfulness intervention was performed, while the control group (CG) did
      not receive any sort of treatment, during 6 months. Passed (at the beginning and end of the
      research) questionnaires concerning general health, quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30 and BR23),
      and diet (Mediterranean diet adherence test and 24-h-recall) and a blood and urine sample was
      collected to analyze general biochemical variables.

    <intervention_model_description>Patients between 18 and 70 years of age with breast cancer II-III operable in follow-up, seen in the Oncology service of the Virgen de las Nieves Hospital in Granada and residents in the city or metropolitan area of Granada, which had completed, in the 12 months prior to its inclusion, treatment with surgery, radiotherapy and / or systemic chemotherapy treatment (including biological treatment).
Randomized assignment was made based on age, stage, hormone receptor and her2 status, establishing two groups: a group of dietary intervention, physical exercise and mindfulness and another control group. A longitudinal follow-up was carried out for 6 months from the beginning of the intervention.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>It includes 30 items that are grouped into five scales functional (physical, social, emotional functioning, cognitive and role), three scales of symptoms (fatigue, pain, nausea and vomiting), a global scale of health / quality of life and a number of related individual items with the symptoms of the disease and its treatment, as well as an item of economic impact. The answers to the items on the scales refer to &quot;last week,&quot; except the patient's physical functioning scale whose time frame is the present. These answers they obey a Likert format, which ranges from 1 (&quot;Not at all&quot;) and 4 (&quot;A lot&quot;)</description>
