  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The growing population of adolescents with insulin resistance (IR) is predicted to create a
      large public health burden in the next few decades. This study examines the function of brain
      blood vessels and cognitive function, to test if increasing severity of IR in adolescents is
      related to reduced cognitive function and reduced brain blood vessel function. Findings from
      this study may help create treatments to delay or prevent some of the negative effects of IR
      on cognitive and vascular health.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One in five American adolescents are obese, and many of these patients exhibit some level of
      insulin resistance (IR). IR is associated with cerebrovascular disease, reduced memory,
      attention, and cognition, but how IR contributes to these in the course of adolescent brain
      development is unclear. The goal of this proposal is to investigate the extent and by which
      IR drives reductions in neurocognitive function and cerebral blood flow (CBF) in adolescents
      at elevated risk for poor brain and cerebrovascular health. The overall goal of this research
      program is to investigate IR-related changes in neurocognitive and vascular function. The
      investigators propose to study adolescents across a spectrum of IR, from healthy to
      pre-diabetic, without confounding effects of age or diabetesâ€” before the negative effects of
      IR can exert their full negative impact. The general hypothesis is that cognitive and
      vascular function is impaired due to dysfunctional brain blood vessel responses.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Cognitive Function as determined by NIH Toolbox Picture Vocabulary Test</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will undergo a series of cognitive tests to evaluate intelligence, memory, speed function, executive function, and psychiatric quality of life. The results of these test will be scored and reported individually.
The NIH Toolbox Picture Vocabulary Test assesses the mental processes that translate thought into symbols (words, gestures) that can be shared among individuals for purposes of communication. The respondent is presented with an audio recording of a word and four photographic images on the computer screen and is asked to select the picture that most closely matches the meaning of the word. This test is scored by the total number of correct responses with a total range of possible scores 0-130 with higher scores indicating better vocabulary skills.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Cognitive Function as determined by NIH Flanker Inhibitory Control and Attention Test</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will undergo a series of cognitive tests to evaluate intelligence, memory, speed function, executive function, and psychiatric quality of life. The results of these test will be scored and reported individually.
The NIH Toolbox Flanker Inhibitory Control and Attention Test assess executive attention. It is a visual display using a central arrow flanked by arrows either pointing in the same direction or different that the central arrow. The participant is to indicate the direction of the central arrow when they are all pointing in the same direction. Scoring is algorithm derived and based on accuracy and reaction time, with a total range of possible scores 0-10 with higher scores indicating increased executive attention.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Cognitive Function as determined by NIH List Sorting Working Memory Test</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will undergo a series of cognitive tests to evaluate intelligence, memory, speed function, executive function, and psychiatric quality of life. The results of these test will be scored and reported individually.
The NIH Toolbox List Sorting Working Memory Test assesses working memory by having participants sort images by size order. The total range of possible score is 0-28, with higher scores indicating more improved working memory.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Cognitive Function as determined by NIH Dimensional Change Card Sorting Test</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will undergo a series of cognitive tests to evaluate intelligence, memory, speed function, executive function, and psychiatric quality of life. The results of these test will be scored and reported individually.
The NIH Dimensional Change Card Sorting Test assesses cognitive flexibility and attention. Two target pictures are presented that vary along two dimensions (e.g., shape and color). Participants are asked to match a series of bivalent test pictures (e.g., yellow balls and blue trucks) to the target pictures, first according to one dimension (e.g., color) and then, after a number of trials, according to the other dimension (e.g., shape). &quot;Switch&quot; trials are also employed, in which the participant must change the dimension being matched. Scoring is based on a combination of accuracy and reaction time with a total range of possible scores 0-10 with higher scores indicating increased cognitive flexibility and attention.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Cognitive Function as determined by NIH Pattern Comparison Test</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will undergo a series of cognitive tests to evaluate intelligence, memory, speed function, executive function, and psychiatric quality of life. The results of these test will be scored and reported individually.
The NIH Toolbox (Pattern Completion) assesses processing speed by asking participants to indicate if visual stimuli are the same or not the same. This test is scored by the total number of correct responses in 90 seconds (maximum score is 130). The higher the score, the better the processing speed.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Cognitive Function as determined by NIH Picture Sequence Test</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will undergo a series of cognitive tests to evaluate intelligence, memory, speed function, executive function, and psychiatric quality of life. The results of these test will be scored and reported individually.
The NIH Toolbox (Picture Sequence) assesses episodic memory. Participants are shown a series of pictures one at a time, related to a single theme. After the last picture is shown, the participants is asked to place the pictures in the demonstrated sequence. The total number of correct placements across 3 trials provides the score, up to a maximum of 48. The higher the score, the better the episodic memory.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Cognitive Function as determined by NIH Oral Reading Recognition Test</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will undergo a series of cognitive tests to evaluate intelligence, memory, speed function, executive function, and psychiatric quality of life. The results of these test will be scored and reported individually.
The NIH Toolbox Oral Reading Recognition Test assesses reading decoding skill and of crystallized abilities. The participant is asked to read and pronounce letters and words as accurately as possible. Scoring is based on the number of correct items with a possible score up to 2500. The higher the score, the better the crystallized abilities.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Cognitive Function as determined by PedsQL - (Child 8-12/Teen 13-18)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will undergo a series of cognitive tests to evaluate intelligence, memory, speed function, executive function, and psychiatric quality of life. The results of these test will be scored and reported individually.
The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) is a 23-item survey assessing 4 functional dimensions: Physical, Emotional, Social, and School. Each item is scored on a 5-point Likert scale where 0 is 'not at all' and 4 is 'almost always'. Items are reversed scored (0=100, 1=75, 2=50, 3=25, 4=0) and linearly transformed to a 1-100 scale, where the higher the score, the better the Quality of Life.</description>
