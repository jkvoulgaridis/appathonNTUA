  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nowadays in France, there is no organized screening of the hearing loss in the elderly;
      however, it is a very common disease and simples tests to perform to detect it exist. Lots of
      studies use surveys to identify deaf people; but physicians often consider them too sensitive
      and less specific because lots of people were classified into &quot; deaf &quot; people meanwhile they
      have a subnormal tonal audiogram.

      Now, it's known that it corresponds to the &quot;Hidden Hearing Loss&quot; concept: it's defined as an
      auditive disturbance in a noisy ambiance in people with a normal tonal audiometry;
      corresponding to infraclinical cochlear lesions. These lesions, if detected early, can be
      prevented to avoid an audition degradation in time.

      The aim of the study is to determinate the values of sensitivity and specificity of the
      HHIE-S survey translated into French, so it could be used as a screening method of hearing
      loss in the elderly and as a prevention of cochlear damages.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The HHIE-S survey is one of the more used in studies to screen hearing loss in elderly. It
      has never been validated in French: that's why investigatosr want to test it on the French
      population, to determine its performance characteristics (sensitivity and specificity).
      Secondary, investigators study think that people that have high score on the hear loss
      screening survey, but a normal tonal audiometry have actually a hidden hearing loss. This
      corresponds to infraclinical cochlear lesions that we want to reveal thanks to a new
      audiometric test: an audiometry in a noisy ambiance.

      The study will take place in a research audiometric room in the department of ENT in
      Bordeaux. Patients will fill a medical survey the HHIE-S survey translated into French and
      perform a tonal audiometry test and after it a &quot; speech in noise &quot; audiometry test (VRB in
      French).

      The duration os study is one unique session of 45 minutes including patient information and
      consent.

    <description>First, the patient will fill in the French translation of the HHIE-S questionnaire in the observation book.
Secondly, he will perform the audiometry in silence test: for the tonal test in silence, we will test the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000 and 4000 hertz in each ear with pure tone sound. For the vocal in silence test, we will use the dissyllabic lists of words (Fournier's lists) at the intensities of 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 decibels. This test will be in free-field conditions testing both ears.
Thirdly, he will perform the speech in noise audiometry test that consists in repeating sentences pronounced at an equal intensity (60 decibels) while the intensity of the noise is increasing. This test will be in free-field conditions testing both ears.</description>
