  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The National Academy of Medicine (NAM) labels chronic pain as one of the most extensive
      health care issues facing our society with &quot;severe impacts on all aspects of the lives of its
      sufferers.&quot;1 Pain predominant chronic multisymptom illness (Pain-CMI, e.g., fibromyalgia) is
      a particularly debilitating and presumptive service connected condition for Veterans who
      deployed to the Gulf region. Health coaching is an appealing potential approach to improve
      the disability of Pain-CMI because it is personalized to the Veteran's unique goals and
      beliefs about Pain-CMI and it will be widely available as the VA is rolling out health
      coaching. The goal of this proposal is to understand if health coaching is also efficacious
      for a complex pain condition, Pain-CMI.

      Purpose:

      Chronic pain is one of the most common healthcare issues that Veterans face; it can be very
      debilitating as well as difficult to treat. Pain Predominant Chronic Multi-symptom Illness
      (CMI) (e.g., fibromyalgia) is a particularly debilitating and treatment-resistant chronic
      pain condition and a presumptive service-connected condition for Veterans who deployed to the
      Gulf region from 1990-2021 (VA Benefits Administration, 2018). There is an urgent need for
      evidence-based non-pharmaceutical treatments for chronic pain. This study will explore the
      efficacy of remote-delivered health coaching intervention aimed at modifying lifestyle
      factors of diet, exercise, social connections, stress, and sleep. The control condition will
      be supportive psychotherapy.

      Study Aims:

      Primary Aim 1: Determine if remote-delivered health coaching reduces (H1a) disability and
      (H2a) pain impairment as compared to remote-delivered supportive psychotherapy for Veterans
      with Pain-CMI. The investigators will also assess the improvement in (H1b) disability and
      (H2b) pain impairment at the 24-month follow-up.

      Primary Aim 2: Determine if health coaching results in more frequent clinically significant
      improvement in (H3) disability (20%) and (H4) pain impairment (1 point) as compared to
      supportive psychotherapy.

      Secondary Aim 3: Determine if health coaching reduces (H5) physical symptoms, (H6)
      catastrophizing, (H7) limiting activity and increases (H8) pain control as compared to
      supportive psychotherapy.

      Exploratory Aim 4: Determine if the reduction in (H9) catastrophizing, (H10) limiting
      activity and increases in (H11) pain control mediate the relationship between health coaching
      and reductions in disability and pain impairment.

      Study Design:

      The current proposal is a randomized clinical trial to determine the efficacy of
      remote-delivered health coaching in reducing disability and pain impairment for Veterans with
      Pain-CMI as compared to supportive psychotherapy (n=250). Additionally, the investigators
      will explore mechanisms of change. Participants will complete four assessments at four
      different timepoints: baseline, 6-week mid treatment (~6 weeks after baseline),
      post-treatment (~12 weeks after baseline), and 24-week follow-up (~24 weeks after baseline).

    <measure>World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-treatment (12 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule (WHO-DAS 2.0) measures disability which is due to physical and mental health conditions. The WHO-DAS is a 40-item measure and assesses two underlying constructs: activity limitations and deficits in social integration. The items of the WHODAS have a factor loading on a composite score of 0.82 to 0.98. The WHO-DAS has been found to have high reliability and validity. Consistent with IMMPACT, our primary outcomes include a general measure of disability (WHO-DAS) and a pain specific measure. A 20% improvement will be considered clinically significant. The WHO-DAS is scored on a scale of 0-100 with higher scores = worse disability.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Brief Pain Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>post-treatment (12-weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Brief Pain Inventory (BPI). Pain will be assessed using the BPI. The BPI is a 11-item measure of pain severity and interference. The BPI has been recommended as a core measure of clinical trials due to its reliability, validity and responsiveness to clinical intervention. There are 7-items for the pain interference subscale which are scored from 0-10 with higher = worse pain interference.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Health Questionnaire-15</measure>
    <time_frame>post-treatment (12-weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-15). The PHQ-15 measures physical symptoms and is scored from 0-30 with higher scores = worse symptom burden. The PHQ-15 was validated on a sample of 6,000 and found to be reliable, valid and responsive to change.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Illness Perception Questionnaire-Revised</measure>
    <time_frame>post-treatment (12-weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Illness Perception Questionnaire-Revised (IPQ-R).17 Perceived control beliefs will be measured by the IPQ-R. The IPQ-R measures a broad range of illness beliefs, including severity of illness consequences, chronicity, and controllability of illness. The IPQ has been found to be reliable and valid among patients with CMI, predictive of outcomes and responsive to clinical intervention. We will use the control subscale where higher scores = greater perceived control.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Catastrophizing Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>post-treatment (12-weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS). Catastrophizing will be measured by the PCS. The PCS is a 13-item measure of the degree of pain catastrophizing. The PCS is reliable, valid, predictive of outcomes and responsive to clinical intervention. The PCS is scored on a scale of 0-52 with higher = worse catastrophizing.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Behavioral Response to Illness Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>post-treatment (12-weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Behavioral Response to Illness Questionnaire. Limiting behaviors will be assessed with the BRIQ which measures behavioral responses to CMI. The BRIQ has four subscales: limiting behaviors, all or nothing behaviors, practical support and emotional support. The BRIQ is reliable, valid and predicts onset of CMI. We will use the limiting behaviors and all or nothing subscales where higher is more limiting and all or nothing behaviors respectively.</description>

    <description>The 12-session remote health coaching intervention assists Veterans in developing and maintaining health behaviors that meet their life goals. Veterans begin by discussing their symptoms, the impact of their symptoms, and their beliefs about Pain-CMI. Next, the Veteran identifies discrepancies between where they are and where they want to be for 5 lifestyle factors. The first half of treatment focuses on providing education about the 5 lifestyle factors. Veterans are introduced to behavior change/health coaching principles. The major focus is on behavior change and development of long-term healthy habits. During the last session, Veterans develop a long-term plan to maintain behavioral changes after the 12-week program and identify the skills that they can utilize moving forward.</description>
