  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At present, there is conflicting evidence regarding outcomes in patients with septic shock
      receiving weight-based vasopressor (WBVP) versus non-weight-based vasopressor (NWBVP) dosing
      strategies. At MCMC, a weight-based strategy is in place whereas MDMC, MMMC and MRMC
      currently utilize a non-weight-based dosing strategy. Obese patients (BMI &gt; 30) receiving
      either strategy may potentially be receiving substantially more or less vasopressor exposure
      compared to their non-obese (BMI &lt; 30) counterparts. Determining total vasopressor exposure
      and assessing clinical outcomes would benefit our institution and others by providing optimal
      vasopressor dosing strategies in obese and non-obese patients. There is a difference in
      clinical outcomes between patients receiving weight-based and non-weight-based vasopressor
      dosing strategies. There is a difference in total vasopressor exposure between obese and
      non-obese patients utilizing WBVP and NWBVP strategies.

    <textblock>
      Vasopressors are a mainstay of therapy for patients with septic shock to achieve and maintain
      hemodynamic stability.1 Both weight-based and non-weight-based dosing recommendations exist
      with no clear evidence that one is better than the other.3-10 However, in light of the
      obesity epidemic and emerging evidence regarding the dangers of excessive catecholamine
      exposure, an evaluation of dosing practices is warranted. The aim of this study is to
      determine whether clinical outcomes differ between patients receiving weight-based and
      non-weight-based vasopressor dosing strategies for septic shock. This is a multicenter,
      retrospective chart review. Patients admitted to MDMC and MCMC from 4/1/2017-8/31/2019 will
      be identified through the electronic medical record utilizing ICD codes for sepsis and septic
      shock. Patients meeting study inclusion criteria will be analyzed as described below.
      Outcomes will be assessed between patients receiving WBVP and NWBVP with planned subgroup
      analysis in each group between patients with BMI &lt; 30, 30-49, and &gt; 50.
