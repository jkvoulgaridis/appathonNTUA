  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this 3-arm randomized controlled trial is to compare two forms of digital
      training (i.e., low-intensity and high-intensity) with traditional face-to-face training of
      non-specialist health workers to deliver an evidence-based brief psychological treatment for
      depression called the Healthy Activity Program (HAP) in primary care settings in India. This
      study will evaluate a low-intensity digital training program (DGT) compared with traditional
      face-to-face training (F2F) on change in competence outcomes and cost-effectiveness. This
      study will also evaluate a high-intensity digital training program with the addition of
      individualized coaching support (DGT+) compared with traditional F2F on change in competence
      outcomes and cost-effectiveness.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Few individuals living with depression in India have access to adequate treatment in primary
      care settings. Task-sharing, which involves building capacity of frontline non-specialist
      health workers to deliver evidence-based treatment for common mental disorders such as
      depression, is an effective approach for bridging these gaps in available care. This
      emphasizes the need for novel approaches to scale up training efforts and to support the
      development of a skilled and competent workforce capable of delivering high quality treatment
      for depression in primary care settings. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to compare
      two forms of digital training (i.e., low-intensity and high-intensity) with traditional
      face-to-face training of non-specialist health workers to deliver an evidence-based brief
      psychological treatment for depression called the Healthy Activity Program (HAP) in primary
      care settings in India. This trial uses a 3-arm randomized controlled design. This study will
      evaluate a low-intensity digital training (DGT) compared with traditional face-to-face
      training (F2F) on change in competence outcomes and cost-effectiveness; and evaluate a
      high-intensity digital training with the addition of individualized coaching support (DGT+)
      compared with traditional F2F on change in competence outcomes and cost-effectiveness. In
      this trial, a total of 336 non-specialist health workers will be recruited from community
      health centers in Sehore District of Madhya Pradesh, a large and predominantly rural state
      situated in central India. This trial will generate knowledge on the most effective and
      cost-effective approaches to address the critical knowledge gap regarding the training of
      non-specialist health workers to deliver an evidence-based brief psychological treatment for
      depression in a low-resource setting. The findings from this trial will inform broader
      efforts to develop a mental health workforce necessary for scaling up brief psychological
      therapies for common mental disorders.

    <intervention_model_description>This study employs a 3-arm parallel randomized controlled trial design. Participants are randomly allocated to one of three training interventions: 1) low-intensity digital training (DGT); 2) high-intensity digital training with additional coaching support (DGT+); and 3) traditional face-to-face training (F2F).</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Double (Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>In this trial, the Outcome Assessors administering study assessments at baseline and at endpoint will be masked to the intervention arm that participants are allocated to receive. The Study Investigators will also be masked to the intervention arm that participants are allocated to receive. Masking Outcome Assessors and Study Investigators will minimize potential bias due to knowledge of which arm the participant is allocated to, and can ensure unbiased ascertainment of study outcomes is possible. For allocation concealment, the intervention allocation for each participant will not be revealed to the participant until they have been enrolled into the trial, to avoid selection bias.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Competency</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to up to 8 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>26-item multiple choice exam to assess the competency of the non-specialist health workers in delivering the Healthy Activity Program (HAP) after training. The measure consists of clinical vignettes followed by multiple-choice questions focused predominantly on assessing applied knowledge. Scores on the measure range from 0 to 26, with higher scores indicating higher levels of competency for delivering HAP. There are three different equivalent versions of this 26-item measure, and each participant will be assessed randomly with one of these at each of the two time points, ensuring that the same test is not used twice.To assess change in competency between two time points, this measure will be collected at baseline and at up to 8 weeks.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Mental Health Knowledge, Attitude, and Behavior</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to up to 8 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>13-item self-report questionnaire uses a 5-point Likert scale to ascertain non-specialist health workers' knowledge, attitudes, and behavior about different aspects of mental health. Scores range from 13 to 65, with higher scores indicating greater knowledge and better attitudes and behaviors towards persons living with a mental illness. Lower scores on this measure suggest lower levels of knowledge and greater stigma towards mental illness. This is important to measure because completion of the training program may contribute to improvements in knowledge, attitudes and behaviors about mental health. To assess change in mental health knowledge, attitudes, and behavior between two time points, this measure will be collected at baseline and at up to 8 weeks.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Costs Incurred During Participation in the Training Program</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 8 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The direct and indirect costs incurred by participants while completing each of the training programs will be collected after completion of the training program at up to 8 weeks. Participants will complete an 8-item questionnaire about the time, travel, and any monetary costs incurred during their completion of the training program. This questionnaire is not scored on a scale; each item will be examined as it relates to specific details about costs related to participation in the training program.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction with the Training Program</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 8 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>This 26-item questionnaire assesses participants' satisfaction with the training programs (either of the two forms of digital training or the traditional Face-to-Face training). This satisfaction questionnaire will be collected after completion of the training program at up to 8 weeks. Each of the 26-items on the questionnaire is rated on a 6-point Likert scale. The items cover feasibility, acceptability, adoption, and appropriateness of the training program. Scores on this questionnaire range from 26 to 156, with higher scores indicating greater satisfaction with the training program. The purpose of the questionnaire is to identify strengths and weaknesses related to factors and program content that affect participants' motivation and engagement in the training program.</description>
