  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized blinded trial with non-probabilistic sampling for convenience. Our goal
      is to compare PFMT with intravaginal vibratory stimulus versus PFMT alone on the treatment of
      female urinary incontinence.

      This is a randomized blinded trial with non-probabilistic sampling for convenience. Our goal
      is to compare PFMT with intravaginal vibratory stimulus versus PFMT alone on the treatment of
      female urinary incontinence. Women with an indication for conservative treatment of urinary
      incontinence will be referred to the Pelvic Floor Physiotherapy Team by the Medical Team of
      the Ambulatory of Urogynecology and Obstetrics of the Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre
      and those who are in compliance with the inclusion criteria proposed for the research will be
      invited to participate in the study.

    <description>We will measure it using the &quot;International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire - Short Form (ICIQ-SF) - Portuguese version&quot;, pre and post treatment, to assess if there are any changes in bladder control after the protocols. It consists of 3 scored items which evaluate the frequency, volume of leakage and overall impact of incontinence. The overall score ranges from 0 to 21, with greater values indicating increased severity. Klovning et al (2009) says that ICIQ-SF may be divided into the following four severity categories of UI: slight (1-5), moderate (6-12), severe (13-18) and very severe (19-21). Lim et al (2019) suggested that for women undergoing nonsurgical treatments for incontinence, reductions of 4 points in ICIQ-UI SF are perceived as clinically meaningful.</description>

    <measure>Impact in quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>We are using the &quot;International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire - Short Form (ICIQ-SF) - Portuguese version&quot;, which asks about overall impact of UI in quality of life by a scale from 0-10 of how much these symptoms bothered the patient's life. We are going to say the participant &quot;imagine that 0 is if urinary leakage doesn't bother you at all and 10 is as much as this can disrupt your life&quot;. There are other questions in this questionnaire according to the severity of the UI symptoms. Each answer has a punctuation and the total score could range between 0 and 21. The higher, the worse is the severity of UI and the impact on the participant's quality of life. The ICIQ is highly recommended (Grade A) for the basic evaluation of the patient's perspective of urinary incontinence (Abrams et al, 2010).</description>

They will be clarified about the role of pelvic floor muscles in continence mechanisms and will be orientated to perform 8 weeks of PFMT with intravaginal vibratory stimulus. They will need to come once a week to a session supervised by physiotherapist to use the vibration device and will be encouraged to perform the exercises at home during the other week days.</description>
