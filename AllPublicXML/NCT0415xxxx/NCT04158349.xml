      This study is a prospective, multi-center, open-label phase I trial designed to determine the
      MTD of IP oxaliplatin when given in combination with mFOLFIRI. This will be conducted
      according to a traditional 3+3 dose-escalation schedule and halted once MTD is established.

      After consent and once deemed eligible for trial participation, patients will receive four
      cycles of study therapy. During therapy, patients will be monitored for dose-limiting
      toxicities and adverse events. After completion of all four cycles patients will be followed
      until resolution of any ongoing study treatment-related adverse events, initiation of
      alternative treatment, and survival.

      Study drug treatment will be administered on day one of a 14-day cycle and the DLT evaluation
      period will be defined as the first three cycles of combination treatment (from cycle one day
      one to the last day of cycle three). The severity of AEs will be graded according to the
      NCI-CTCAE version 5.0 A standard 3+3 dose escalation design will be used to determine the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) while ensuring the safety and
      tolerability of the treatment. The study will test three dose levels of oxaliplatin.

      Dose Level 2 105 mg/m2 IP every 2 weeks Subjects will be accrued in cohorts of 3 to 6
      subjects per dose level starting at Dose Level 0 (85 mg/m2). Escalation will continue until
      DLT stopping rules are met or the highest dose level is reached.
