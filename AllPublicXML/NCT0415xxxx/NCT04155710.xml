    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2, study evaluating IOV-2001 (Adoptive Cell Therapy) composed of autologous
      PBL (Peripheral Blood Lymphocytes) in patient with CLL/SLL, which has relapsed or is
      relapsing during treatment with ibrutinib.

      This study involves patients receiving nonmyeloablative (NMA) lymphocyte depleting (LD)
      preparative regimen prior to infusion of IOV-2001 followed by IL-2 administration.

      In Phase 1, patients meeting the eligibility criteria will be enrolled and will receive
      treatment with IOV-2001 followed by low dose IL-2 or high dose IL-2.

      After completion of Phase 1, the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) will be evaluated in
      selected patient cohorts defined in the Phase 2 part of the study.

          8. Patients with active and chronic fungal, bacterial, or viral infection requiring IV
             treatment

          9. Patients who require treatment for anti-coagulation with a vitamin K antagonist
             (warfarin)
