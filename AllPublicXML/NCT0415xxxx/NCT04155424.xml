    <description>All participants will receive open-label eculizumab by intravenous infusion during the Primary Treatment Period, starting on Day 1 and for a total of 52/53 weeks. The dosing regimen will be based on the participant's body weight. As body weight changes during the study, the participant's weight cohort and dose may change accordingly.
After completing the 52/53-week Primary Treatment Period, participants may continue receiving eculizumab in the Extension Treatment Period for 104 weeks.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female participants aged 2 years to &lt; 18 years with body weight ≥ 10 kilograms
             (kg).

          2. Vaccinated against Neisseria meningitidis within 3 years prior to, or at the time of
             initiating eculizumab. Participants who initiate study drug treatment less than 2
             weeks after receiving a meningococcal vaccine must receive appropriate prophylactic
             antibiotics until 2 weeks after the vaccination.

          3. Documented vaccination against haemophilus influenzae type b and streptococcus
             pneumoniae infections at least 2 weeks prior to dosing as per local and
             country-specific immunization guidelines for the appropriate age group.

          4. Anti-aquaporin-4 antibody-positive and diagnosis of NMOSD as defined by the 2015
             International Panel for Neuromyelitis Optica Diagnosis criteria.

          5. Historical Relapse Rate of at least 2 relapses in the last 2 years, and with at least
             1 relapse in the year prior to Screening.

          6. EDSS score ≤ 7.

          7. Participants who enter the study receiving supportive immunosuppressive therapies
             (ISTs) for the prevention of relapse, either in combination or monotherapy, must be on
             a stable dosing regimen of adequate duration.

          8. Female participants of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test
             (serum human chorionic gonadotropin) at Screening and follow protocol-specified
             contraception guidance for avoiding pregnancy while on treatment and for 5 months
             after the last dose of eculizumab.

          9. Male participants with a female spouse/partner of childbearing potential or a pregnant
             or breastfeeding spouse or partner must agree to use double barrier contraception
             (male condom plus appropriate barrier method for the female partner) while on
             treatment and for at least 5 months after the last dose of eculizumab.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Parent or legal guardian is an Alexion employee.

          2. Pregnant, breastfeeding, or intending to conceive during the course of the study.

          3. Participants known to be human immunodeficiency virus positive or with congenital
             immunodeficiency.

          4. Unresolved meningococcal or other serious infection.

          5. Any unresolved acute or chronic systemic bacterial or other infection that is
             clinically significant in the opinion of the Investigator and has not been treated
             with appropriate antibiotics.

          6. Use of rituximab or other biologicals such as tocilizumab within 6 months prior to
             Screening.

          7. Use of mitoxantrone within 3 months prior to Screening.

          8. Use of intravenous immunoglobulin or plasma exchange within 3 weeks prior to
             Screening.

          9. Use of immunomodulatory therapies for multiple sclerosis within 3 months prior to
             Screening.

         10. Has previously received treatment with eculizumab or other complement inhibitors.
