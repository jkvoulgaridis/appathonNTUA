  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early treatment of invasive fungal infections (IFI) may prevent undue mortality in acute on
      chronic liver failure (ACLF) patients. We aim to study the impact of early empiric treatment
      (based on clinical suspicion) of IFI as compared to pre-emptive treatment (based on
      biomarkers and culture positivity) on the outcomes in ACLF patients with suspected IFI in a
      randomized trial. The ACLF patients with clinically suspected IFI would be randomly allocated
      to empiric treatment or pre-emptive treatment group and followed up clinically to assess the
      impact on survival, clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness and safety of such an approach.
      The protocol is designed to cut- down unnecessary usage and to curtail the duration of
      antifungals use in ICUs based on biomarkers/culture-driven stoppage rules. The results will
      fuel further studies on formal cost-effective analysis and antimicrobial stewardship
      protocols in ACLF patients.

      Research question: Does an early empiric antifungal therapy improve 28-day overall survival
      as compared to pre-emptive antifungal therapy in critically ill, non-neutropenic adult ACLF
      patients with suspected IFI?

      This study will be a single-center prospective randomized open-label with blinded end-point
      PROBE assessment and conducted at Liver ICU.

      ACLF patients aged 18 to 75 years with all three criteria will be included

        1. ICU stay of 48 hours or recent hospitalization

        2. Two or more risk factors for IFI 3. Clinical suspicion of IFI

      Exclusion criteria A Neutrophil count of less than 500 per mm3 B Recent antifungal treatment
      in the past 1months C Hepatocellular carcinoma or other active malignancy D Known
      hypersensitivity or contraindication to Liposomal AmB E HIV positivity or on HAART F
      Pregnancy or lactation G Moribund patients

      Eligible patients will be randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio to receive either early empiric
      systemic antifungal therapy (SAT: based on risk factors and clinical suspicion) or
      Pre-emptive SAT (based on risk factors, clinical suspicion and radiological/investigation
      based evidence of fungal infection) in addition to standard medical therapy SMT and followed
      up for a period of 28-days or transplant or death

      Empirical therapy will be Liposomal AmB 3 to 5 mg per kg of body weight per day.

      It is preferred because of maximum efficacy, widest spectrum, and safety in liver disease

      Pre-emptive therapy with liposomal AmB will be given if the treatment initiation rules are
      met including fungal biomarkers positivity, Mycological or radiological evidence of IFI

      Proven-IFI will be treated as per IDSA or ESCMID guidelines in either group Stoppage rules in
      both groups will be based on fungal biomarkers and cultures that will be done twice weekly
      and twice negative bio-markers or fungal cultures at day7 and 10 will be essential to stop
      treatment

      In case of intolerable adverse effects or contraindications to LipoAmB, the patients will
      undergo treatment as per IDSA guidelines Standard Medical Therapy will be as indicated and
      will include nutritional support, rifaximin lactulose albumin diuretics proton-pump
      inhibitors multivitamins and antibiotics

      Outcomes will include survival at 28-day, clinical outcomes, cost-effectiveness and safety of
      two approaches of antifungal therapy

    <description>Participants will receive standard medical therapy along with the empiric strategy of treatment of invasive fungal infection (based on both risk factors and clinical suspicion of invasive fungal infection). The choice of drug will be as per institutional protocol i.e. Injection Liposomal Amphotericin B, 3-5 mg/kg of body weight as a 4- hour infusion in 5% dextrose solution. The infusion will be prepared ten minutes prior to administration by reconstituting the vial in dextrose solution by a Registered Nurse. Each vial contains 50 mg (50000U) encapsulated in liposomes. After reconstitution, the concentrate will contain 4mg/ml of the drug. During the first dose administration, 1mg will be administered with a micro drip set over ten minutes and then stopped to look for any reactions for 30 minutes. If there are no reactions, the rest of the drug is administered over 30-60 minutes period.</description>
