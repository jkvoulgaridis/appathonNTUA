  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this global study is to demonstrate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of
      an intravenous (i.v.) regimen of secukinumab compared to placebo in subjects with active
      axSpA at Week 16 despite current or previous NSAID, DMARD and/or anti Tumor Necrosis Factor
      (TNF) therapy. In addition, to further support efficacy and safety of an i.v. regimen, data
      will be collected for up to 52 weeks of treatment. Efficacy and safety data may be used to
      support the registration of i.v. secukinumab in the US and other countries for treatment of
      subjects with active axSpA.

    <textblock>
      This multicenter study uses a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group
      design to study the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of treatment with intravenous
      secukinumab (initial dose of 6 mg/kg followed thereafter with 3 mg/kg administered every four
      weeks starting at Week 4) in subjects with active axSpA. The study population consists of
      approximately 400 subjects with active AS and approximately 100 subjects with active
      nr-axSpA, despite current or previous NSAID, conventional DMARD and / or TNF inhibitor
      therapy, or intolerance to these therapies. A screening (SCR) period of up to 10 weeks will
      be used to assess eligibility, followed by randomization to 52 weeks of study treatment.

      At baseline, subjects with active AS and nr-axSpA will be randomized to one of the two
      treatment groups:

        -  Group 1: approximately 200 AS subjects and approximately 50 nr-axSpA subjects; These
           subjects will receive secukinumab 6 mg/kg i.v. at randomization (Baseline (BSL) visit),
           followed by the administration of secukinumab 3 mg/kg i.v. every four weeks starting at
           Week 4 through Week 48 (exposure through Week 52).

        -  Group 2: approximately 200 AS subjects and approximately 50 nr-axSpA subjects; These
           subjects will receive i.v. placebo at randomization (BSL visit), Weeks 4, 8, and 12 ,
           followed by the administration of secukinumab 3 mg/kg i.v. at Week 16 and every four
           weeks through Week 48 (exposure through Week 52).

      This study will consist of 4 periods totaling up to 70 weeks: the screening period (up to 10
      weeks), the treatment period 1 (total duration of 16 weeks) and the treatment period 2 (total
      duration of 36 weeks) followed by the safety follow up period of 8 weeks after the end of
      treatment visit (i.e., Week 52).

      The subjects will be stratified at randomization according to disease condition (i.e., AS or
      nr-axSpA). No more than 20% TNF Inhibitor Incomplete Responders (TNF-IR) subjects will be
      enrolled in the study. Starting at Week 16, all subjects will switch to open-label
      intravenous secukinumab, including all placebo subjects.

      No subject will be on placebo treatment after Week 16. Although study treatment is open label
      secukinumab i.v. starting at Week 16, all subjects and investigators/site staff will remain
      blinded to original treatment assignment, so as to ensure unbiased efficacy and safety
      assessments for the remainder of the study. Study treatment will continue up to Week 52. An
      end of treatment visit (i.e., Week 52) is to be done 4 weeks after last study treatment
      administration and a post treatment follow-up visit (i.e., Week 60) is to be done 8 weeks
      after the end of treatment visit for all subjects (regardless of whether they complete the
      entire study as planned or discontinue prematurely). All i.v. infusions will be performed at
      the study site and site personnel will administer the infusions to subjects.

      Rescue medication is not allowed until Week 16. However, subjects who are deemed by the
      investigator not to be benefiting from the study treatment based on safety and efficacy
      assessments or for any reason of their own accord will be free to discontinue participation
      in the study at any time. The study will have a primary endpoint analysis at Week 16.
      Therefore, the primary analysis will be performed with Week-16 data once the last subject has
      completed the Treatment Period 1.

      Clinical management of axSpA by pharmacotherapy includes the use of NSAIDs and conventional
      DMARDs, and if insufficient response, biologic agents (i.e., TNF-inhibitor therapy or
      anti-IL17 agents).

      This study intends to enroll patients with active disease despite current or previous NSAIDs,
      conventional DMARDs and/or TNF inhibitor therapy or intolerance to these therapies. A
      background of NSAID therapy and/or concomitant therapy with methotrexate (≤25 mg/week) or
      sulfasalazine (≤ 3 g/day) will be acceptable, if dose and route of administration have been
      stable for at least two weeks with NSAIDs and/or four weeks with MTX or sulfasalazine, prior
      to the randomization visit. Inclusion of patients with active axSpA who are TNF-IR (up to 20%
      in each group) in the study also makes the background patient population more representative
      of the real world clinical scenario.

      A placebo arm up to the primary endpoint at Week 16 is included in this study. Due to the
      nature of the disease and the outcome measures used (ASAS criteria), a placebo arm is
      necessary to reliably evaluate the efficacy and safety of the active drug. The treatment
      duration of the placebo group is relatively short and the placebo group will be re-assigned
      to active treatment at Week 16. The regular assessment of disease activity ensures that
      subjects who are experiencing worsening of disease in any of the treatment groups can exit
      the study at any time upon their own accord or based on the advice of the investigator.

             liver function tests, such as SGOT (AST), SGPT (ALT), alkaline phosphatase and serum
             bilirubin. The investigator should be guided by the following criteria:

               -  Any single parameter may not exceed 2 x the upper limit of normal (ULN). A single
                  parameter elevated up to and including 2 x ULN should be re-checked once more as
                  soon as possible, and in all cases, at least prior to randomization, to rule-out
                  laboratory error.

               -  If the total bilirubin concentration is increased above 2 x ULN, total bilirubin
                  should be differentiated into the direct and indirect reacting bilirubin. In any
                  case, serum bilirubin should not exceed the value of 1.6 mg/dL (27 µmol/L)

         18. Significant medical problems or diseases, including but not limited to the following:

             Association status of class III or IV), uncontrolled diabetes, or very poor functional
             status precluding ability to perform self-care

         19. Plans for administration of live vaccines during the study period or within 6 weeks
             prior to randomization

         20. Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of
             becoming pregnant, unless they are using effective methods of contraception during the
             entire study or longer if required by locally approved prescribing information (e.g.,
             20 weeks in EU). Effective contraception methods include:

               -  Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of
                  the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
                  contraception

               -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without
                  hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment.
                  In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has
                  been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment

               -  Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). For female subjects on
                  the study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that
                  subject

               -  Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or
                  cervical/vault caps). For UK: with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/ vaginal
                  suppository

               -  Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or other
                  forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate &lt;1%),
                  for example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception

               -  Placement of an intrauterine device or intrauterine system In case of use of oral
                  contraception women should have been stable on the same pill for a minimum of 3
                  months before taking study treatment.

             Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have
             had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile
             (e.g., age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral
             oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks prior
             to randomization. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status
             of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she
             considered not of childbearing potential.

         21. Active ongoing inflammatory diseases other than axSpA that might confound the
             evaluation of the benefits of secukinumab therapy, including inflammatory bowel
             disease or uveitis

         22. Current severe progressive or uncontrolled disease which in the judgment of the
             clinical investigator renders the subject unsuitable for the trial

         23. Use of other investigational drugs at the time of enrollment, or within 5 half- lives
             of enrollment, or within 4 weeks until the expected pharmacodynamic effect has
             returned to baseline, whichever is longer; or longer if required by local regulations

         24. History of hypersensitivity to any of the study drug constituents

         25. Previous exposure to secukinumab (AIN457) or any other biologic drug directly
             targeting IL-17 or the IL-17 receptor

         26. Previous treatment with any cell-depleting therapies including but not limited to
             anti-CD20 or investigational agents (e.g., CAMPATH, anti-CD4, anti-CD5, anti-CD3,
             anti-CD19)
