  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients underwent surgical procedure experiences acute postoperative pain, but less than
      half report adequate postoperative pain relief. The poor management of pain after surgery is
      associated with inadequate sleep and poor mood. Music therapy is described as a
      non-pharmacological technique to accomplish individualized patient's goals for hospital
      treatment. Music has been used as a healing approach. In Saudi Arabia, there is a lack of
      evidence related to the effect of music therapy on pain and sleep among patients who
      underwent abdominal surgery. Studies are needed to address additional aspects of pain
      management and the promotion of sleep among Saudi adult postoperative people by using
      non-pharmacological modalities.

      Aim: The study will investigate the effect of music therapy on acute postoperative pain and
      sleep quality among patients undergoing abdominal surgery. A randomized control trial design
      will be demonstrated to accomplish this study. A total sample of 60 cases who underwent
      general abdominal surgery will be recruited. The study will be carried on in general surgery
      wards in one of a University Hospitals in Riyadh city, KSA. Four tools will be used to
      collect the data: Socio-demographic and medical data sheet, Pain Numeric Rating Scale (PNRS)
      for pain, Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and Opinions Questions Regarding music therapy. The
      intervention group will listen to the selected prerecorded music on individual CD players by
      using a headset for consecutive three days. Music therapy will be given for 30 minutes during
      day time; depends upon the analgesics peak action time to avoid the bias of the intervention.
      Once again, it will be played before bedtime.

    <description>The Pain Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) is a standardized scale, which measures pain severity. The Pain Numeric Rating Scale (PNRS) is a numeric version of the VAS. The PNRS has a single 11-point numeric scale in which respondents select a number from 0 (no pain) to 10 (severe pain) that reflects their pain severity. The PNRS has a high test-retest reliability in both literate and illiterate patients (r = 0.96 &amp; 0.95, respectively). Therefore, the PNRS will be used in this study to assess the pain severity.</description>

    <measure>Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 days</time_frame>
    <description>The ISI is a widely used scale to evaluate insomnia. It consists of seven items; each item has a score of (0-4), where zero indicates no disturbance and four indicates very severe disturbance. The scale score gives four categories: no insomnia = 0-7; sub-threshold insomnia = 8-14; moderate insomnia = 15-21; and severe insomnia = 22-28. The Arabic ISI has ascertained satisfactory validity and reliability with a Cronbach's alpha coefficient of 0.84.</description>

    <measure>Opinions Questions Regarding music therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>3 days</time_frame>
    <description>This section has questions related to the participants' perspective regarding benefit in listening to music therapy during postoperative period in terms of reducing pain and improving sleep quality. There will be five questions which will evaluate the effect of music therapy in reducing pain and promoting sleep. This Question will be asked only to the participants in the experimental group at the end of the data collection. The questions are open ended or with dichotomous response (Yes or No). The results will be presented as percentage or frequency. There is no high or low answer, the score just reflects the participant's opinion on music as a therapy for reduce pain and improve sleep condition.</description>
