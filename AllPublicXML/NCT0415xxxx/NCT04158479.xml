  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Extracorporeal life support (ECLS), also known as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO),
      is an extracorporeal technique of providing effective cardiac and respiratory support to
      patients with lungs and/or heart failure. There was a growth in ECLS cases, centers, and
      center scale in China during the past decade.

      This multi-center registry was conducted by Chinese Society of Extracorporeal Life Support.
      The objectives were to investigate China statistics of ECLS and to evaluate the short-term
      and long-term outcomes of patients with ECLS.
