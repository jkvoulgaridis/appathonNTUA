  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this trial is To evaluate the effect of an ankle and foot muscle
      strengthening program on pain, analgesic consumption, functionality, and lower limb
      biomechanics during gait in individuals with knee osteoarthritis.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled trial will be performed with 76 patients with knee osteoarthritis.
      The participants will be randomly assigned into either a control group (no exercises; they
      will keep their recommended clinical treatment) or an intervention group which will receive
      8-week physical therapy exercises, three times per week, under the supervision of a
      physiotherapist. Every exercise has its own progression depending on the subjects' execution,
      increasing in intensity and difficulty.

      The subjects will be evaluated in 3 different moments (Baseline, immediately after treatment
      and 8 weeks follow-up).

      The hypothesis of this study is that the intervention group will decrease pain and medication
      intake, and improve functional performance, increase isometric strength of the feet and
      production of beneficial biomechanical changes during walking compared to the control group.

    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 weeks and 16 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The WOMAC pain subscale consists of five questions (Likert Scale) relating to the patient's pain in everyday situations. The Likert Scale version used for all WOMAC items are: none, mild, moderate, severe, and extreme. The sum of all items of pain subscale ranges from 0 to 20. Higher scores indicate worse pain.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline WOMAC (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities) Stiffness Subscale at 8 and 16 weeks.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 weeks and 16 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The stiffness subscale included in the WOMAC index consists of two questions (Likert Scale) relating articular function of the patient. The Likert Scale version used for all WOMAC items are: none, mild, moderate, severe, and extreme. The sum of all items of the stiffness subscale ranges from 0 to 8. Higher scores on the stiffness WOMAC subscale indicate worse articular function.</description>

    <description>he physical function subscale included in the WOMAC index consists of seventeen questions (Likert Scale) relating to the patient's physical activities, or skills to move out and take care of themselves. The Likert Scale version used for all WOMAC items are: none, mild, moderate, severe, and extreme. The sum of all items of physical function subscale ranges from 0 to 68. Higher scores on the physical function WOMAC subscale indicate worse functional limitations.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 weeks and 16 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The WOMAC total score is the sum of all subscale (pain, function and stiffness) (Likert Scale) relating to the patient's physical activities, or skills to move out and take care of themselves.

    <description>GRCS assesses the clinical change perceived by the patient by comparing the onset of symptoms before and after treatment. &quot;With respect to your knee injury, how do you describe your situation now compared to the start of treatment?&quot; This numerical scale consists of 11 points (from -5 to +5: -5, extremely worse; 0, unchanged; +5, fully recovered). Higher scores indicate better recovery from the condition.</description>
