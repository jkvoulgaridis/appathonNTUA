  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      xrAI (pronounced &quot;X-ray&quot;) serves as a clinical assistance tool for trained clinical
      professionals who are interpreting chest radiographs. The tool is designed as a quality
      control and adjunct, limited, clinical decision support tool, and does not replace the role
      of clinical professionals. It highlights areas on chest radiographs for review by an
      interpreting clinician.

      The objective of this study is to utilize machine learning and artificial intelligence
      algorithms (xrAI) to improve the quality and efficiency in the interpretation of chest
      radiographs by family doctors, nurse practitioners, emergency medicine physicians,
      internists, pulmonologists, and radiologists.

      The hypothesis is that the addition of xrAI's analysis will reduce inter-observer variability
      in the interpretation of chest radiographs and increase participants' sensitivity, recall,
      and accuracy in pulmonary abnormality screening.

      To investigate the effect of xrAI for clinicians that interpret chest radiographs as part of
      their daily responsibilities, the investigators have designed a randomized control trial.

      The pulmonary abnormalities detected by xrAI and included in the definition of abnormal are
      as follows: any linear scar or fibrosis, atelectasis, consolidation, abscess or cavity,
      nodule, pleural effusion, severe cases of emphysema and COPD (mild cases with hyperinflation
      but not significant emphysema are not flagged), and pneumothorax.

      To assess the causal effect of xrAI the investigators randomly assign 36 clinicians to either
      treatment (x-ray images processed by xrAI) or control (no xrAI processing) groups.
      Participants will only review images once. Each participant will perform 500 radiograph
      interpretations in total.

      Participants in the control group will be asked to interpret the same 500 images without
      xrAI's analysis.

      To increase the precision of the estimate and better investigate potential differences
      between clinical professionals, investigators block randomize the assignment of treatment or
      control group within each group of clinicians (family doctor, nurse practitioner, emergency
      medicine physician, internist, pulmonologist, radiologist). Within each group of clinicians,
      investigators will randomly assign half to treatment or control group. This randomized
      complete block design ensures that an equal number of each group of clinical professionals
      are represented in the treatment and control groups.

      To analyse the effect of xrAI, the investigators will estimate the average treatment effect
      (ATE) for each subgroup by comparing the performance of the treatment and control groups
      using randomization-based inference (Green and Gerber, 2012).

    <description>Accuracy is defined as the ratio of the images where the physician's prediction matched the labels of the dataset.
Accuracy= (TP+FP) / (TP+FP+TN+FN)
TP (true positives) = cases interpreted as abnormal that are abnormal; FP (false positives) = cases wrongly interpreted to be abnormal; TN (true negatives) = cases correctly interpreted to be normal; FN (false negatives) = abnormal cases wrongly interpreted as normal.</description>

    <description>Precision is defined as the probability of a radiograph being abnormal if a physician makes the determination that it is abnormal.
Precision= TP / (TP+FP)
