    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of bosentan and how well it works
      when given together with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel for the treatment of pancreatic
      cancer that cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable). Bosentan may block the hormone
      endothelin and prevent the growth and spread of pancreatic cancer. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by
      stopping them from spreading. Giving bosentan with chemotherapy (gemcitabine and
      nab-paclitaxel) may work better in treating patients with pancreatic cancer compared to
      chemotherapy alone.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess the safety, toxicity and feasibility of administering bosentan with
      nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the response rate associated with this combination therapy in first line
      pancreatic cancer patients.

      II. To assess the progression-free survival and overall survival of all patients who start
      protocol therapy, and describe the outcomes based on measures of compliance during the
      lead-in week, and compliance with supplement during chemotherapy.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the impact of bosentan on the mass transport in the tumor (surrogate of
      alterations in tumor stroma and blood flow). (Pharmacodynamic Investigations) II. To describe
      the pharmacokinetic profile of nab-paclitaxel and bosentan and compare to historic
      single-agent profile. (Pharmacokinetic Investigations) III. To explore the association
      between hepatotoxicity to study agents and organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP)
      polymorphisms. (Pharmacogenomic Investigations) IV. To explore biomarkers on pre-treatment
      biopsy samples and peripheral blood samples for correlations of predictive of response.

      V. To describe quality of life utilizing the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy: General
      (FACT-G) questionnaire.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive bosentan orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days -7 to 21 or 8-21 of cycle 1
      and days 1-21 of subsequent cycles. Patients also receive nab-paclitaxel intravenously (IV)
      over 30 minutes and gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Cycles repeat every
      21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days. Patients who
      complete study treatment without disease progression are followed up every 2 months until
      disease progression and then biannually thereafter. Patients who complete study treatment
      with disease progression are followed up biannually.
