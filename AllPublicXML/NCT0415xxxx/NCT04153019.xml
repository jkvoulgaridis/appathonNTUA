  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Half of all cancer patients experience cachexia, with the prevalence rising above 80% in the
      last weeks of life. The cancer cachexia is a complex relational experience which involves the
      dyads patients-families. There are no studies on psychosocial interventions on dyads
      associated with rehabilitative interventions, to support more functional relationships to the
      management of cancer cachexia.

      Primary objective: to evaluate the feasibility of a psycho-educational intervention combined
      with a physiotherapy intervention on the dyads. Secondary objective: improvement of the
      Quality of Life of dyads, acceptability of the intervention, adherence to each of the two
      components.

      Methods: non-pharmacological interventional perspective, mixed-method study, addressed to a
      consecutive 30 cancer patients with cachexia and irreversible cachexia and their caregivers
      assisted by Hospital Palliative Care Unit.
