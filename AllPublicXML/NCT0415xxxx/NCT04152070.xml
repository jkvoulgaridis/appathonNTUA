      The purpose of this cross-sectional study is to validate the Spanish version of the Kihon
      Checklist for screening frailty in Spanish community-dwelling older adults.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In order to identify individuals at risk for frailty, a wide variety of assessment tools have
      been developed in recent years. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of a gold standard method
      to be used. Therefore, simple, reliable, and valid instruments are still needed for both
      research and clinical purposes. The Kihon Checklist is a multidimensional tool widely used in
      Japan and in other countries, but an exhaustive validity in Spanish population has not been
      yet established.

      The main objective is to validate the Spanish version of the Kihon Checklist for screening
      frailty in Spanish community-dwelling older adults, and as a secondary objective, to study
      and to compare different scales of frailty in the Spanish population, and to study their
      associations.

      To cope with the objectives of the present study, a cross-sectional study was conducted. To
      this purpose, data were collected through various tests and questionnaires about: frailty;
      clinical, demographic and anthropometric characteristics; physical assessment; functional
      status; cognitive function; health-related quality of life; depressive mood; and nutritional
      status.

    <measure>Frailty: The Kihon Checklist</measure>
    <time_frame>The cohort group was assessed in one day visit.</time_frame>
    <description>The Kihon Checklist is a self-reporting survey used for screening frail older adults. It consists of 25 yes/no questions divided into 7 domains: activities of daily living, physical strength, nutrition, eating, socialization, memory, and depressive mood. Higher scores indicate a higher risk of requiring support. A total score ≥ 7 points indicates general frailty (Sewo Sampaio 2016). The Spanish Kihon version used for validation in this study was translated by Maseda et al. (2017).</description>

    <time_frame>The cohort group was assessed in one day visit.</time_frame>
    <description>Fried's Frailty Phenotype proposed in the Cardiovascular Health Study (Fried 2001) consists of 5 criteria: unintentional weight loss, exhaustion, low physical activity, reduced grip strength, and reduced gait speed. It has a total score ranging from 0 to 5. A frail person is who scores 3 to 5; prefrail when scores 1 to 2, and robust when scores 0.</description>

It has a total score ranging from 0 to 17, with higher scores representing greater frailty severity.</description>
