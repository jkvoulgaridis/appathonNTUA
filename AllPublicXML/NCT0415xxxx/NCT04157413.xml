  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be comprised of 2 phases. Phase 1 study is a comparative cross-sectional
      study which will be conducted among children aged 12-24 months living in agricultural area. A
      total of 172 healthy children consisted of 86 stunted children (Length for age z-score &lt;-2
      Standard deviation) and 86 non-stunted children (Length for age z-score ≥0.5 Standard
      Deviation) will be recruited. Dietary intake, urine and dried blood spot from finger prick
      will be collected to assess amino acid intake, intestinal permeability and essential blood
      amino acid respectively. Qualitative study i.e. focus group discussion (FGD) and market
      survey will also be implemented. According to the result of phase 1 study, 2 types of
      food-based approaches will be developed, namely Complementary food recommendations (CFR) and
      Food multi-mix formula

      Phase 1 study will recruit a total of 172 healthy children who are matched by sex and age.
      Aside of being stunted, children must have normal weight for length z-score (not wasted or
      overweight). Data collection will be performed as follows:

        1. Dietary intake of the children will be collected by 9 days Estimated Food Record by
           visiting the respondents house

        2. Urine will be collected once to measure intestinal permeability profile using Lactulose
           Mannitol ratio indicator.

        3. Dried blood spot from finger prick will be collected to essential blood amino acid.

      To collect information on locally available and culturally accepted protein rich food
      sources, series of focus group discussion (FGD) and market survey will also be implemented.

      Food-based approaches will be developed according to the information attained from phase 1
      study. Problem nutrients that are identified from dietary assessment will be fulfilled
      through optimization of locally available food by using linear programming approach. Problem
      nutrients that are not able to be fulfilled by CFR will be use as a basis to develop a Food
      multi-mix (FMM) formula. Data of intestinal permeability profile will be used to add other
      locally available food in FMM that are potential to improve intestinal permeability.

        Target population of this study are children 12-24 months living in rural agricultural area
        in Kabupaten Malang. Kecamatan will be chosen based on the high prevalence of stunting and
        having potentials of protein food source to be optimized. Sample of the study are children
        living in selected villages in the period of 2019-2020 who fulfill the inclusion criteria.
