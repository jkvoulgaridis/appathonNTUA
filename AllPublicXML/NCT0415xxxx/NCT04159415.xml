    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of the study are to estimate the effects of REGN4461 on glycemic
      parameters in the subset of patients with elevated baseline hemoglobin A1c levels (HbA1c ≥7%)
      and to estimate the effects of REGN4461 on fasting triglyceride levels in the subset of
      patients with elevated baseline fasting triglycerides (TG ≥250 mg/dL).

      The secondary objectives are to estimate the effects of REGN4461 on a composite endpoint of
      changes in either HbA1c or fasting TG for all patients, estimate the effects of 2 dose levels
      of REGN4461 on glycemic parameters and fasting TG, to estimate the effects of REGN4461 on
      insulin sensitivity, to evaluate the safety and tolerability of REGN4461 and to evaluate the
      pharmacokinetics (PK) and immunogenicity of REGN4461.
