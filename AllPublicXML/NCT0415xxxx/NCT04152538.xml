      During Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA), joint undergo considerable stress, which causes
      neuromuscular activation deficits of the quadriceps femoris muscle. The current phenomenon
      depends on a complex mechanism called Arthrogenic Muscle Inhibition (AMI). AMI has been
      studied only in sub-acute and chronic phase after TKA due to the invasive procedures employed
      in order to evaluate it; However, clinical observation and experimental studies suggest
      presence of this phenomenon also in the first postoperative days. The aim of the study is to
      investigate differences in quadriceps neuromuscular activity, in acute phase.

      The study is a prospective observational study.15 healthy subjects and 15 patients scheduled
      for TKA will be recruited. Patients will be asked to perform three isokinetic taks in the
      same standardized biomechanical context in order to evaluate changes in quadriceps
      neuromuscular activity after surgery as primary outcome. Secondly, correlation between
      primary aim and pain perceived by the patient will be investigated. Moreover, patient's
      functional ability will be assessed using the Timed Up and Go Test (TUG). Data will be
      recorded the day before TKA, at one and three days after surgery.

      At the end of data acquisition, normality and homogeneity of demographic variables will be
      assessed. Differences in the outcome measures will be investigated with the t student test
      (or with the related non-parametric tests) and by means of the mixed models repeated measures
      ANOVA test. Linear regression will be applied to evaluate any correlation between outcomes.
