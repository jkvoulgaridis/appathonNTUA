  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cigarette smoking constitutes the greatest preventable cause of mortality and morbidity in
      the US. The most critical period for long term success of smoking cessation appears to be in
      the first 7 days after the quit date. A metaanalysis of 3 pharmacotherapy trials revealed
      that abstinence during the first 7 days was the strongest predictor of 6 month outcomes
      (n=1649; Odds ratio: 1.4, P &lt;0.0001; Ashare et al. 2013). Prodigious relapse rates during
      this first week of smoking cessation are likely due to behavioral and neurobiological factors
      that contribute to high cue-associated craving and low executive control over smoking. The
      long term goal of the research is to develop evidence-based transcranial magnetic stimulation
      protocols to facilitate abstinence during this critical period.

    <textblock>
      The competing neurobehavioral decision systems (CNDS) theory posits that in addiction, choice
      results from a regulatory imbalance between two decision systems (impulsive and executive).
      These behavioral systems are functionally linked to two discrete frontal-striatal circuits
      which regulate limbic and executive control. Modulating these competing neural circuits (e.g.
      either dampening the limbic/impulsive system or amplifying the executive control system), may
      render smokers less vulnerable to factors associated with relapse. The scientific premise for
      the proposed research is that direct modulation of these neural circuits will induce changes
      in cigarette valuation and brain reactivity to smoking cues.

      However, the relative efficacy of targeting one or the other systems is unknown. To address
      this gap the investigators will target the two components derived from the CNDS.

      These two frontal-striatal neural circuits - the limbic loop (ventromedial prefrontal cortex
      (vmPFC)-ventral striatum), and executive control loop (dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC)-dorsal
      striatum) can be differentially stimulated by theta burst stimulation (TBS), a patterned form
      of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Continuous TBS (cTBS) results in long term
      depression (LTD) of cortical excitability and intermittent TBS (iTBS) results in potentiation
      (LTP). Recent studies by our group have demonstrated that LTD-like cTBS to the vmPFC (Aim 1)
      attenuates brain activity in the nucleus accumbens (Hanlon et al. 2015) and salience network
      (2017). In a collaborative MUSC/VTCRI study, 5 days of vmPFC cTBS reduced the value of
      cigarettes, preference for immediate gratification, and smoking cue-evoked brain activity.
      Alternatively, other investigators have demonstrated that LTP-like stimulation to the dlPFC
      (Aim 2) decreases cigarette craving and cigarette use. These studies support the targets
      specified by CNDS. The investigators will evaluate the relative efficacy of these 2
      strategies as novel tools to change smoking-related behaviors and dampen brain reactivity to
      cues in two double-blind, sham- controlled neuroimaging studies. The investigators long-term
      vision is that TBS would be used as an acute intervention enabling individuals to get through
      the first week after a smoking quit attempt without relapsing, and transition to more
      sustainable mechanisms of behavioral change (e.g., medication, cognitive behavioral therapy).

      Aim 1 (Strategy 1): Modulating the limbic system as an approach to treatment: vmPFC cTBS.
      Cigarette smokers will be randomized to receive 10 days of real cTBS or sham cTBS directed to
      the vmPFC. Intermittently the desire to smoke, cigarette value using behavioral economic
      demand, preference for immediate gratification (delay discounting), and cigarette
      self-administration will be assessed. Smoking cue-evoked brain activity will also be measured
      when individuals are asked to 'crave' (passive limbic engagement) versus 'resist' the craving
      (executive engagement). The investigators hypothesize that cTBS will: 1) decrease the
      behavioral smoking measures described above, which will be explained by a selective 2)
      decrease in the neural response to cues when individuals 'allow' themselves to crave, and 3)
      sustain these changes over a time period sufficient to overcome the initial quit attempt
      (~7-14 days).

      Aim 2 (Strategy 2): Modulating the executive system as an approach to treatment: dlPFC iTBS.
      Aim 2 will follow the design of Aim 1. The procedures will be identical, except iTBS will be
      delivered to the left dlPFC. The investigators hypothesize that iTBS will: 1) decrease the
      behavioral smoking measures described above, which will be explained by a selective 2)
      increase in the neural response to cues when individuals attempt to 'resist' the cues, and
      again 3) sustain these changes over a similar period as specified in Aim 1.

      Exploratory Aim: Evaluate baseline frontal striatal connectivity and discounting rate as
      factors to predict an individual's likelihood of responding to Strategy 1 versus Strategy 2.
      The investigators will test the hypotheses that individuals with a higher ratio of
      (vmPFC-striatal)/(dlPFC-striatal) connectivity will be more likely to have a behavioral
      change after Strategy 1. Various demographics (e.g. gender, smoking history, socioeconomic
      status, sub clinical depressive symptoms, self-efficacy, &amp; motivation to quit will be
      evaluated as explanatory variables.

      The outcomes of the present aims will resolve a critical gap in the investigator's knowledge
      regarding the relative efficacy of 2 promising TMS treatment strategies. These outcomes will
      be directly translated to a larger longitudinal study evaluating a multi-pronged approach to
      improving outcomes in traditional pharmacotherapy or behavioral treatments.

    <description>The effect of real vs. sham iTBS to the left DLPFC vs. real vs. sham cTBS to the left MPFC as a tool to modulate the brain response to cigarette cravings will be assessed by comparing the brain activity in the executive circuit and limbic circuit before and after TMS. Participants will receive an MRI brain scan before their first TMS treatment, and at the end of their 10th days of TMS. At each MRI scan, participants will be subjected to a cigarette craving &quot;cue&quot; task within the scanner where elevated brain activity (BOLD signal) will be measured using an fMRI sequence. During each scan, they will see pictures of cigarette cues, neutral cues, and blurred images. The task is meant to induce craving and see how the brain responds to these craving cues.</description>

    <measure>Changes in Delayed Discounting Cognitive Behavioral Task</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked to choose between two conditions in which varying amounts and delays to behavioral outcomes (e.g., $50 now or $100 later) are presented. We will use magnitudes of $100 and $1000 which are the most thoroughly documented among the literature. Across consecutive choices, the delay to the larger outcome will be titrated until reaching the participant's indifference delay (i.e., the delay at which s/he equally values both options). This indifference delay indexes individual participants' rates of delay discounting. Monetary delay discounting has been documented to be predictive to treatment success for smokers.</description>

    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This 10-item questionnaire assesses cigarette craving. Participants will be asked to rate from 1 (strongly disagree) to 100 (strongly agree) their agreement with several statements (e.g., &quot;I have a desire for a cigarette right now,&quot; and &quot;Nothing would be better than smoking a cigarette right now.&quot;). Factor analyses support two factors: one that reflects a strong desire and intention to smoke and one that reflects relief from negative affect associated with an urgent desire to smoke.</description>

    <description>The hypothetical purchase task (HPT), a validated measure for cigarette demand, will assess cigarette purchases at various price conditions. Participants will hypothetically purchase quantities of cigarettes to use over a 24-hour period across ascending prices (e.g., $0, 0.12, $0.25, $0.50, $1.00, and $2.00 per cigarette). The HPT has been shown to be predictive of treatment outcomes. It will measure how participants value cigarettes throughout the course of the study visits.</description>
