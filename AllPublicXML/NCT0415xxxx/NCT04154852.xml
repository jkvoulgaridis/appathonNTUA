  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate adalimumab, a drug that is currently licensed for
      treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis
      and inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease). It is a protein (human monoclonal antibody)
      that is designed to block the effects of an inflammatory cytokine, tumour necrosis factor
      alpha (TNF alpha) which is a causative factor in joint inflammation. It is given as a
      subcutaneous injection.

      Management of established rheumatoid arthritis has been transformed with the use of
      TNFantagonists, the first in the class of biological agents. The benefits in early RA are
      also continuing to emerge. Oligoarthritis represents a subgroup of early inflammatory
      arthritis that warrants more effective treatment strategy including the potential to modulate
      the disease course and halt further progression. The TNFantagonists offer the potential of
      achieving this, justifying this initial investigation.

      Hence, this study is designed to establish the benefit of adalimumab in preventing
      progression of oligoarthritis. The primary aim of the study is to assess how many patients
      achieve remission i.e. no further evidence of joint inflammation or damage. The investigators
      will do this by including patients who present with inflammation of four or less joints who
      do not fulfil criteria for a definite arthritis condition such as rheumatoid arthritis. The
      investigators will perform clinical, laboratory (blood tests) and imaging assessments at
      regular intervals on these patients to check on safety of the study drug adalimumab and
      evaluate any changes in disease activity that may have resulted from use of adalimumab. All
      patients will receive treatment with a standard therapy (methotrexate) with randomisation of
      half of the patients to receive the active study drug, adalimumab as additional treatment for
      six months.
