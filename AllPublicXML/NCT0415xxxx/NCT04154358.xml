  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transgender men are individuals born genetically female that have a gender identity that is
      incongruent with their biological sex. For those who have begun or completed transition, they
      may present as males but still have a uterus and cervix. Thus far, no distinction has been
      made between routine cervical cancer screening guidelines in non-transgender women and those
      for transgender men, despite wide variations in sexual practices, including lifelong vaginal
      abstinence. The purpose of this study is to offer transgender men seen at clinic visits
      self-collected HPV testing to evaluate for improved cervical cancer screening rates, as well
      as a survey to further investigate sexual practices, rates of appropriate screening prior to
      being offered self-collection, and barriers to obtaining appropriate care.
