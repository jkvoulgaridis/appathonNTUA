      The aim of this study was to compare the risk of pulmonary aspiration assessed with gastric
      ultrasonography in elderly patients, undergoing elective surgery.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recently, carbohydrate loading is suggested for enhanced recovery after surgery.

      Aging process often accompanies gastrointestinal dysmotility. Therefore, elderly patients
      might have undiagnosed gastro-esophageal reflux disease, or other gastrointestinal disorders.
      Moreover, because of their co-morbid underlying diseases and multi-drug effects, gastric
      emptying might be further delayed in the elderly patients.

      This study was designated to compared the risk of pulmonary aspiration in elderly patients,
      with gastric ultrasound between fasting group and carbohydrate loading group.

    <description>Incidence of Perlas grade 2. Clear fluid is detected in gastric antrum by gastric antral ultrasound on both supine and right lateral decubitus position.
Perlas grade 2: fluid appears in both supine and right lateral decubitus positions Perlas grade 1: fluid is detected only in right decubitus position Perlas grade 0: fluid is not detected in both supine and right lateral decubitus positions.</description>
