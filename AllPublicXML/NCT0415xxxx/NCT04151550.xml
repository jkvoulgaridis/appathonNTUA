      This is a prospective, controlled, single-center clinical study to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of the Laser Scleral Microporation Procedure.

      Laser Scleral Microporation Procedure is a treatment to restore visual and accommodative
      function in presbyopic patients. The subjects are bilaterally treated with the Laser Scleral
      Microporation procedure.

    <description>The slitlamp examination is one examination to analyse the integrity of the eye structures.
With the slitlamp the ophthalmologist can observe the eyes stereoscopically. A focussed slit of light, which can be width-adjusted, is projected on the eye to be examined. The investigator observes this projection on the eye through a reflected light microscope. The slitlamp is used to observe the anterior and posterior part of the eye, including cornea, lens and anterior chamber. By dilating the pupil the fundus can also be examined. Following conditions shall be examined with the slitlamp:
Corneal clarity
anterior chamber cells
anterior chamber flare
lens grading using the LOCS III card
Conjunctival/scleral vessel injection
Degree of choroidal hue
Conjunctival edema
Conjunctival hemorrhages

             acuity losses to a level of 20/30 (logMAR 0.18) or worse (e.g., macular degeneration);

          5. Previous corneal surgery (e.g., corneal transplant, DSAEK/DSEK, lamellar
             keratoplasty), except for LASIK, EpiLASIK/LASEK, or PRK;

          6. Previous anterior or posterior chamber surgery (e.g., vitrectomy, laser iridotomy);

          7. Keratoconus or keratoconus suspect with CDVA of less than (&lt;) 20/20 (&lt; logMAR 0.00) at
             distance;

          8. Near visual acuity at 40cm equivalent to their distance vision with distance
             correction (i.e., no evident effect of reduced accommodative range);

          9. Use of systemic or ocular medications that may affect vision (the use of any miotic or
             cycloplegic agent is specifically contraindicated);

         10. Acute or chronic disease or illness that could increase the operative risk or confound
             the study outcome(s) (e.g., diabetes mellitus, immunocompromised, connective tissue
             disease);

         11. Uncontrolled systemic or ocular disease;

         12. Any abnormality preventing reliable applanation tonometry in EITHER eye;

         13. Undilatable pupil such that one cannot examine the periphery of the retina;

         14. Functional eye preference, defined as phoria measuring over 15dp horizontally and/or
             over 2dp vertically, any strabismus, or suppression.

         15. History of scleral ectasia, scleritis, or episcleritis; or thin sclera &lt; 400 microns,
             as determined by taking the average of three measurements with ultrasound
             biomicroscopy (UBM) pachymetry;

         16. History of nuclear sclerosis LOCS III grade 2 or worse and/or other cataracts reducing
             CDVA;

         17. Known allergies
