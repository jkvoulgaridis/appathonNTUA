    <textblock>
      Major Depressive disorder (MDD) is a heterogeneous mental illness. Treated with
      antidepressants that act on the neurotransmitter and/or their receptors just remitted only
      one third of patients with MDD, Thus, to improve the efficacy is a major unmet need for
      depression. Based on the scientific reports, inflammation plays a definite role in the
      development and treatment of depression, which may be an important way to understand and
      finally solve the problem. Our team found that there were significant changes in tumor
      necrosis factor (TNF)-α and other inflammatory factors in depressed patients, which caused
      neuronal apoptosis and depressive symptoms; PRKCB1(gene of protein kinase C-β) plays an
      anti-inflammatory role by regulating protein kinase C(PKC) activation in specific brain
      region, improving neuroplasticity and playing an antidepressant role. In this study, we
      assumes that the treatment-resistant depression patients maybe due to the immune inflammation
      and PKC activation inconsistency or unsynchronized, which couldn't reversible microglia
      polarization and neuronal apoptosis in specific brain regions, then, caused the significant
      changes at emotional and cognitive neural circuits, so as to exhibit such as emotional,
      cognitive symptoms of depression. Therefore, activating PKC and regulating
      immune/inflammatory process will be another way to improve the treatment outcome of
      depression. Take consideration, we focus on treatment-resistant depression patients, to
      validate the relationship between PKC activation and the immune inflammatory mechanism of
      depression, evaluate the antidepressant effect of golimumab or calcium tablet (a PKC
      activator) plus escitalopram, and initially proposes idividualized treatment strategies for
      MDD.

      This is a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled antidepressant augmentation trial. All
      participants are randomly divided into 3 groups treated orally with &quot;escitalopram +
      golimumab&quot; (N = 60), &quot;escitalopram + calcium tablet&quot; (N = 60) or &quot;escitalopram +placebo&quot; (N =
      60).
