  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long-term objective of this project is to improve human health and impact health care
      delivery by developing intelligent technologies that aid with health monitoring and
      intervention. The immediate objective of this project is to design, evaluate and validate
      machine learning-based software algorithms that recognize daily activities, provide
      activity-aware medicine reminder interventions and provide insights on intervention timings
      that yield successful compliance. The investigators hypothesize that many individuals with
      needs for medicine intervention can be more compliant with their medicine regimen if prompts
      are provided at the right times and in the right context. The investigators plan to
      accomplish these objectives by 1) enhancing and validating software algorithms that recognize
      daily activities and activity transitions, 2) developing and validating activity-aware
      medicine prompting interventions for mobile devices, and 3) designing technologies to analyze
      medicine reminder successes and failures. The proposed work will partner real-time
      methodologies for validation and algorithmic development with smart phone data, utilize novel
      activity discovery algorithms, and employ activity recognition and prediction algorithms in
      the development of activity-aware prompting.

      The investigators hypothesize that many individuals with needs for medicine intervention can
      be more compliant with their medicine regimen if prompts are provided at the right times and
      in the right context. They will validate the hypothesis by designing and evaluating machine
      learning-based software algorithms that recognize daily activities, provide activity-aware
      medicine reminder interventions and provide insights on intervention timings that yield
      successful compliance.

      The first aim of the project is to expand and validate software algorithms that recognize
      daily activities and activity transitions with mobile devices. The hypothesis is that daily
      behavior contexts can be characterized and tracked with minimal user input using machine
      learning combined with automated activity discovery. In earlier work, the investigators had
      demonstrated the success of our algorithms in smart homes. In this project, they propose to
      adapt the techniques for mobile devices.

      The second aim of the project is to develop activity-sensitive medicine prompting and assess
      the impact of activity-sensitive prompting on the primary outcome of medication adherence
      rates and the secondary outcome of quality of life. To this end, this goal can be decomposed
      into two tasks including (a) developing activity-sensitive prompting; (b) assessing the
      impact of activity-sensitive prompting on patient outcomes. The investigators will combine an
      activity prompting interface with activity recognition to deliver prompts in contexts with
      demonstrated success.

      Finally, in the third aim, the investigators design machine learning algorithms to analyze
      medicine reminder success and failure situations. They hypothesize that machine learning
      techniques can be used to automatically predict prompt compliance by using computer
      algorithms to learn how to distinguish successful from unsuccessful prompt situations. In
      their approach, the investigators utilize sensor data to analyze daily behavior and link
      behavior context with medicine adherence.

    <description>The Russell's adherence score will be used to measure medication adherence rate. A 3-hour window centered on the prescribed dosing time will be considered. A dose taken within this time window will be given a full score for that dosing time; a dose taken outside the window but within a 6 hour window will be given a half score for that dosing time; and missed doses will receive a score of 0. Each participant will be assigned a score from 0.0 to 1.0 for each day. The scores for each subject will be averaged to obtain weekly adherence rates. The overall adherence rate will be computed by taking an average other the entire study period.</description>
