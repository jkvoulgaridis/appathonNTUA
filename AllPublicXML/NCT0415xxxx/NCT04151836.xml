    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the effectiveness of a rehabilitation program in improving body
      composition, and quality of life in patients with bariatric surgery in Taiwan.

      Hypothesis:

        1. The body composition in exercise group is significant improving than control group at 1
           weeks, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd month.

        2. The quality of life in exercise group is significant improving than control group at 1
           weeks, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd month.
