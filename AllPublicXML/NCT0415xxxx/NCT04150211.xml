  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will assess running biomechanics and joint inflammation of physically active males
      between 40 and 60 years of age, mainly runners, suffering from knee joint inflammation and
      pain after training. Participants were split into two groups, intervention and placebo, to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of Exten(d) supplementation during 4 weeks.

      Triple-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group, pilot safety, and efficacy
      study.

      30 healthy physically active males (40 to 60 years old) suffering from knee joint
      inflammation and pain after training were randomly assigned to the Exten(d) or Placebo group.
      During the first visit and after 4 weeks supplementation (either 2 g daily of Exten(d)
      capsules or placebo capsules) the participants were subjected to a three-stage exercise
      session: (i) running biomechanical assessment, (ii) exercise physiology maximal effort test
      and (iii) running biomechanical assessment after the incremental exercise to exhaustion. The
      volunteers have been assessed to determine: (1) inflammation by I-R thermography and pain
      perception, (2) running technics though biomechanic analysis and (3) performance.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male recreational runners who run for at least 150 minutes per week divided into two
             or more sessions.

          -  The participants were expected to describe some degree of knee inflammation and/or
