  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic duct stones can cause obstruction of the main pancreatic duct leading to abdominal
      pain, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, and recurrent acute pancreatitis. By removing
      pancreatic duct stones, the obstruction can be relieved, and this can improve symptoms. Small
      stones can be removed with standard endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and
      stone removal, but larger stones may require lithotripsy to break up the stone before
      removal. The two current methods of lithotripsy include extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy
      (ESWL) and single operator pancreatoscopy with intracorporeal lithotripsy (SOPIL).

      ESWL is based on concentrating shock wave energy to the stone through an external device.
      SOPIL is a newer technique based on direct visualization of the stone during ERCP and
      targeting the stone with a shock wave catheter. There are currently no studies directly
      comparing ESWL to SOPIL for breaking apart stones in the pancreatic duct, so this study is
      designed to compare the two techniques.

      Objective #1: Obtain pilot data to determine the optimal method of clearing large MPDS
      Objective #2: Obtain pilot data to assess how effective large MPDS clearance is in improving
      long term patient centered outcomes Objective #3: Obtain pilot data to measure the cost
      effectiveness of large MPDS clearance

    <measure>Change in pain scores</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Change in Izbicki pain scores from baseline at 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months. The Izbicki pain scale is a validated pain score for chronic pancreatitis using a visual analog scale, frequency of pain, requirement of pain medication, and pain affecting functional ability. The score ranges from 0 to 100 with higher scores suggesting more pain.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in quality of life based on chronic pancreatitis specific instruments: PANQOLI</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Change in the pancreatitis quality of life instrument (PANQOLI) scores from baseline at 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months. The PANQOLI score is a validated quality of life score for chronic pancreatitis with specific focus on the domains of physical function, role function, emotional function, and self-worth. The score ranges from 11 to 103, which higher scores suggesting better quality of life.</description>
