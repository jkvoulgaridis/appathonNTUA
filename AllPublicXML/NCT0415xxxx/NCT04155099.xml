  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with cirrhosis are likely to develop overt hepatic encephalopathy for which
      diagnostic modalities and treatment options are limited. The purpose of this study is to
      determine if individuals with cirrhosis who experience hepatic encephalopathy would benefit
      from investigational microbiota restoration therapy due to their inherent cognitive
      alterations. Analysis for a correlation between changes in microbiome composition and
      specific blood biomarkers could allow for earlier diagnosis of HE which could then be treated
      earlier and with novel treatments.

    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that changes in an individual's cognition due to HE-related
      liver cirrhosis can be stabilized and/or improved through investigational microbiota
      restoration therapeutic treatment. The main objective of this study is to determine if
      investigational microbiota restoration therapeutic treatment alters the cognitive function in
      individuals with cirrhosis who have been previously diagnosed with overt hepatic
      encephalopathy (HE). Once individuals have one HE episode, they are more likely to experience
      additional episodes, even after complying with standard of care. The number of HE episodes
      each study group experiences during the post-treatment follow-up will be compared among
      treatment groups. It is also anticipated that cognitive improvement will correlate with
      specific changes in the intestinal microbiota composition of these individuals likely
      shifting their microbiome away from baseline samples and becoming more like donor samples.
      Novel blood biomarkers potentially related to episodes of HE will be assessed in individuals
      before and after treatment.

    <intervention_model_description>Study individuals will be placed into one of four study treatment groups: High dose investigational microbiota restoration therapeutic RBX7455 group, Low dose investigational microbiota restoration therapeutic RBX7455 group, or a pill quantity-matched Placebo group.

    <measure>Change in cognitive function at 1 month post-FMT as measured by change in response times on EncephalApp (Stroop test)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Determine whether microbiota restoration therapy improves cognition 1 month after treatment by measuring differences in time scores from EncephalApp. The app times participants in seconds (s) in variations of the Stroop Test. The average (s) across all trials will be reported as well as the difference in (s) between (trial 1)-(trial 5). Longer completion times indicate greater cognitive impairment, while a decrease in completion time from trial 1 to trial 5 indicates learning (cognitive improvement).
The scale for this measure is theoretically 0s-500s.</description>

    <measure>Engraftment of FMT as assessed by change in type and abundance of gut microbiota following shotgun sequencing</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>It is anticipated that with treatment, changes in the intestinal microbiota composition of these individuals will likely shift their microbiome to contain different species. Microbiome analyses will measure, at the family and genus level, which bacteria are present and their relative abundance. Samples from the same individual at different time points will be compared as well as differences between treatment groups at each time point.</description>
