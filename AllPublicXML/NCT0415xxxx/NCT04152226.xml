  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open- label, single- dose, dose escalating evaluation of the safety and
      tolerability of three dose levels of DBI-001 in patients with Tinea pedis.

      The purpose of the current protocol is to establish the safety and tolerability of a single
      application of J. lividum to the feet of patients with proven T. pedis. In addition, the
      effect of J liv on the T. pedis will also be evaluated.

      Open- label, single- dose, dose escalating evaluation of the safety and tolerability of three
      dose levels of DBI-001 in patients with Tinea pedis.

      Study Objectives and Purpose The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of DBI-001 in patients with Tinea pedis. Secondly to evaluate presence or
      persistence of J. lividum of DBI-001 following a single application of DBI-001. Thirdly to
      see the effect on the abundance of T. rubrum. Lastly to see the effect of a single
      application of DBI-001 on the signs and symptoms of interdigital T. pedis.

      Tolerability will be evaluated through assessment of selected local signs and symptoms (pain
      / burning / stinging, pruritus, erythema, edema, and scabbing / crusting). Any local skin
      reaction that requires use of a concomitant therapy or study discontinuation will be reported

    <intervention_model_description>A single center open label dose escalating study design will be used in a population of patients with interdigital Tinea pedis. Each subject will have a single application of the test article applied to each foot. The three test articles will be a low dose, medium and a high dose of J. lividum. Each of the three groups will have 4 subjects. After the first cohort has completed their day 7 visits and if no significant tolerability of safety issues is identified the second cohort will be enrolled. After the second cohort has completed the day 7 visits and if no significant tolerability or safety issues are identified the third cohort will be enrolled.
At all evaluations, signs and symptoms of application site reactions will be recorded at baseline, as well as days 2, 3, 7, 14, and 28.</intervention_model_description>

        Subjects must meet all of the following criteria to be included in the study:

             Ethics Committee.

          2. A signed Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) authorization
             form which permits the use and disclosure of subject's individually identifiable

          4. Subjects with a clinical diagnosis of interdigital T. pedis T. pedis interdigital
             defined as lesions localized to the interdigital spaces or predominantly interdigital,
             but may extend to other areas of the foot (the non-interdigital lesions should not be
             hyperkeratotic, i.e., characteristic of tinea pedis moccasin).
