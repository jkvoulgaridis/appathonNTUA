    <textblock>
      This is a research study where all subjects will receive study medication to understand how
      the body processes the study medication, and to determine the safety and efficacy of ARQ-151
      cream 0.15% in adolescent and pediatric subjects with mild to moderate AD. At entry, subjects
      will have 1.5-35% Body Surface Area involvement (excluding the scalp, palms, soles) and mild
      or moderate atopic dermatitis (AD) based on vIGA-AD. Three groups will be evaluated,
      including:

        -  Cohort 1: ARQ-151 cream 0.15% in adolescents (12-17 years old; inclusive)

        -  Cohort 2: ARQ-151 cream 0.15% in children 6-11 years old (inclusive)

        -  Cohort 3: ARQ-151 cream 0.15% in children 2-5 years old (inclusive; will be performed in
           parallel with Cohort 2)

      Cohort 2 and Cohort 3 will be performed in parallel and may commence after results are
      available from ARQ-151-212, a Phase 2 study evaluating ARQ-151 cream 0.05% and 0.15%
      administered once a day for 4 weeks in adolescents and adults with mild to moderate AD
      affecting 1.5% to 35% BSA.

To calculate the EASI, the sum of the severity rating (0 to 3 with 3 being the most severe) for four clinical signs are multiplied with the numerical value of the area affected and with the percentage of the four body areas.</description>
