  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the suggestions that GA and frailty indices could be used to guide therapy selection,
      the ability to effectively incorporate the use of GA in older patients diagnosed with AML in
      a real-world clinic environment has not yet been established. Thus, in this study, the
      investigators seek to describe the feasibility of using this shorter GA tool, the mGA,
      administered via patient self-report on a touchscreen computer, as well as the real-time use
      and utility by clinicians and the correlation of mGA results on treatment decision-making.

      This outcomes study has a two-part intervention that includes 1) provider education and 2)
      patient and provider use of Carevive Treatment Care Planning technology. The provider
      education component of the intervention highlights evidenced guidelines and investigational
      agents in the treatment of AML in older adults. The Carevive CPS will be used for the second
      component of the intervention. The results of this study will provide important information
      about drivers of treatment decision-making and practice patterns, feasibility of a technology
      platform to incorporate important, but under-utilized components of value-based care into
      practice, and healthcare utilization data.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The correlation of mGA for patients with AML on clinical outcomes at three months post treatment decision making.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical outcomes include time on treatment, adherence to the prescribed treatment, quality of life (QoL), and patient side effects. Providers will review results of the mGA at a treatment decision visit and indicate if the mGA results influenced the treatment selection. Chart abstraction will be conducted at a 3-month post treatment planning visit time point to confirm treatment given. Baseline and 3-month QoL and symptom assessment measures will be collected and change over time will be analyzed. Comparisons of change in QoL and symptoms over 3 months, total time on treatment, and adherence among fit, intermediate, and frail groups will be made.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Review of Real-world clinician practice patterns of hematologists managing older patients with AML (age&gt;60),</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Quantitative measures include data collected by the Carevive CPS platform to describe treatment practice patterns of hematologists caring for older patients with AML at three study sites. At baseline, and then again as part of participating clinicians' exit interview, each clinician will complete a survey that asks about his/her behaviors related to assessment and management of their older AML patients.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction (usability, acceptability, feasibility and utility) of incorporating electronic mGA into routine clinical care will be evaluated at baseline and each clinic visit.A comprehensive survey will be utilized to capture these outcomes.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Usability and acceptability of the electronic mGA is measured by both patients and providers using surveys after the visit. Feasibility of the mGA is assessed at the patient level and focuses on the patient's ability to complete the assessment via an electronic tablet prior to their visit without assistance. These measures will be collected using one comprehensive survey</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the hematologists' knowledge, skills and attitudes from baseline following continuing education modules viewed by providers.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Clinicians will complete a pre-test and a post-test questionnaire, allowing for the determination of clinician competency to optimally manage older patients with AML based on GA screening. The comparisons will assess changes in knowledge, skills and attitudes as a direct result of the training. Surveys will be completed capturing the results and will be compared at the different timepoints.</description>
