      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-123. TAK-123 is being tested in Japanese
      healthy adult men. This study will look at the PK, safety and tolerability of phenylacetate
      and benzoates of people who administered TAK-123.

      The study will enroll approximately 10 participants. All participants will be administered
      TAK-123 intravenously at the dose level of 3.75 g/m^2 of sodium phenylacetate and 3.75 g/m^2
      of sodium benzoate.

      - TAK-123 as 3.75 g/m^2 of sodium phenylacetate and 3.75 g/m^2 of sodium benzoate

      This single-center trial will be conducted in Japan. The overall time to participate in this
      study is approximately 8 days. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic and be
      hospitalized for four days.

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant who has signed informed consent to participate in a study; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. A TEAE is defined as an AE that occurs on or after the start of the study drug administration.</description>

    <ipd_description>Takeda makes patient-level, de-identified data sets and associated documents available for all interventional studies after applicable marketing approvals and commercial availability have been received (or program is completely terminated), an opportunity for the primary publication of the research and final report development has been allowed, and other criteria have been met as set forth in Takeda's Data Sharing Policy (see www.TakedaClinicalTrials.com for details). To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias. Once approved, qualified researchers who sign a data sharing agreement are provided access to these data in a secure research environment.</ipd_description>
