  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted as a parallel randomized controlled intervention trial, initiated
      by eight weeks rapid weight loss with one of two VLCDs, one week of reintroducing regular
      foods, and 12 weeks with one of two different ad libitum diets; in total 21 weeks. The study
      will be blinded for the statistician. Due to obvious different dietary intakes in the two
      diets, subjects cannot be blinded and neither the study personnel. As the study includes
      different dietary recommendations the registered clinical dietician advising the subjects
      cannot be blinded either.

      In total 110 overweight and obese volunteers will be included.

Two measurements are made when the scale has stabilized and both results are noted to the nearest 0.1 kg. The average of the two measurements is used in further analysis.</description>

    <description>The participant will be instructed to remove shoes and asked to stand erect with their back to the wall-mounted stadiometer, with the back of their head, back, and buttocks touching the stadiometer. The participant will be further instructed to look straight ahead and keep arms relaxed and hanging loosely alongside their body and to inhale deeply. The reading on the stadiometer will be performed before the participant exhales. Two measurements are made and both results are recorded in centimeters to the nearest 0.5 of a centimeter.

    <description>The measurement of waist circumference will be performed in a fasting condition with an empty bladder. The measure is done with a with a no-elastic tape measure mid-way between the lower rib and iliac crest (top of the hip bone) at the end of expiration with the participant in a standing position with their weight distributed evenly on both feet. Two measurements are made and both results are noted to the nearest 0.5 cm and the average of the two measurements is used in further analysis.</description>
