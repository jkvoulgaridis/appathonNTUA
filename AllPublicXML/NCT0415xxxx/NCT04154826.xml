    <textblock>
      A prospective, single-center, single-blinded study involving patients with refractory
      nontuberculous mycobacteria lung disease to ascertain pharmacokinetics, safety, efficacy, and
      tolerability of two dose levels of parenteral administration of recombinant Interleukin-7
      (IL-7) (CYT107).

    <textblock>
      A single center, randomized, phase II, single blinded, two-dose level trial aimed at testing
      anti-mycobacterial activity of CYT107 in patients with non-tuberculous mycobacteria lung
      disease (NTMLD).

      A total of 12 evaluable NTMLD patients from Washington University School of Medicine in St.
      Louis will be recruited and randomized 6:6 to study drug treatment at either 10μg/kg/wk or
      20μg/kg/wk for two 4-week treatment periods.

      The randomization will be stratified based on the presence of pulmonary cavitaries. A maximum
      of three patients with pulmonary cavitary disease will be allocated to each group.

      A potential study extension is envisioned in the United Kingdom, in which case the protocol
      would be amended to increase the targeted enrollment and number of participating centers.

      The aim of this trial is detection of an immuno-therapeutic response in patients with
      refractory NTMLD and to determine the potential rate of response and tolerance of CYT107
      using two dose levels that indicated good immune response in other pathologies such as HIV,
      HCV, sepsis and various cancers.

      For patients with refractory NTMLD, a control group is not beneficial as the standard of care
      treatment results are already known and documented.

      All serious adverse events (SAEs) will be reported within 24 hours of notification
