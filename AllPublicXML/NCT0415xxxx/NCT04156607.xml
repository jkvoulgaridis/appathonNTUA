    <textblock>
      This study aimed to explore the effects of Kinesio tape applied to plantar soles on balance
      in children with Down Syndrome (DS). Two groups including children with DS and a group with
      their typically developing peers evaluated. Half of the children with DS took Kinesio tape
      application to the plantar soles and the other half took sham taping application. All
      children evaluated with dynamic and static balance measurements and DS children evaluated
      immediately after taping and 45 minutes after taping again with the same measurements.

    <textblock>
      Balance is one of the most problematic issues in children with DS. Mechanoreceptors of
      plantar region of the foot helps to regulate human erect posture and balance. Studies shows
      that inputs from foot sole give a positive effect in improving balance both in healthy and
      neurologically demaged subjects. Kinesio tape is a supportive method in physiotherapy with
      it's proprioceptive input giving effects. It is aimed to show the acute effects of Kinesio
      tape on balance parameters in children with DS.

    <intervention_model_description>The study was carried out with the participation of 3 groups as kinesio taping application group with Down Sydnrome children (KT) (n=12, DS), sham taping application group with Down Syndrome children (ST) (n=12, DS) and healthy control with healty children (HC) (n=12). Healty children took no taping applications. KT group took Kinesio tape, ST group took sham taping evaluated 2 times after the tapings (immediately and 45 minutes later).</intervention_model_description>

    <description>For the fascia technique, one part of the band which were divided by 4 fans is adhered on Achilles tendon to the heel with a 0% stretch. Then the plantar fascia was stretched by the examiner and the toes were extended (ankle dorsiflexion, toe extension) and the divided part of the band was applied toward the metatarsal heads with paper-off technique (5-15%).</description>
