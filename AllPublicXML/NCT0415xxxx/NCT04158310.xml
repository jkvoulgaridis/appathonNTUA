  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In order to verify the clinical value and safety of Xiyanping injection in children with CAP,
      we intend to carry out this multi-center, large-sample, non-intervention clinical research
      through more rigorous and scientific design. Considering the current status of clinical
      research in children in China,research use real-world research methods.

      This is an real world study of efficacy and safety of intravenous injection of Xiyanping
      injection in pediatric subjects with CAP.The purpose to determine the clinical value and
      influencing factors of Xiyanping injection in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia
      in children based on real-world clinical data. The starting point for the study was the time
      at which the patient started treatment with Xiyanping injection or using a conventional
      treatment regimen; the end of follow-up was the date of the last visit to the patient, and if
      the patient had a disease progression or transfer, the date of the occurrence was the end. At
      the same time, baseline demographic characteristics (gender, date of birth, type of medical
      insurance, etc.), therapeutic drugs during the follow-up period, dose and time of use,
      laboratory indicators (such as white blood cells, C-reactive protein, etc., and examination
      time) were collected.
