  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to develop and to test the efficacy of a novel mHealth app for
      gambling disorder. The app capitalizes on smartphones' global positioning software (GPS) that
      recognizes a user's location to within 15 feet. Users will receive an alert of this go near a
      gambling venue. The project will conduct a 12-week pilot randomized clinical trial to test
      the short-term efficacy of the app with gambling disorder individuals.

    <measure>Patient satisfaction with the gambling app</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to post-treatment (12 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Investigator derived patient satisfaction self-report questionnaire. Five items, using a 7-point Likert scale from very dissatisfied (1) to very satisfied (7). Higher scores indicate a better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Gambling behavior via Timeline Followback (Weinstock, Whelan, &amp; Meyers, 2004)</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to post-treatment (12 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Self-report gambling frequency and intensity as assessed by the Gambling Timeline Followback - a retrospective self-report calendar. Gambling frequency can range from 0 to 84; gambling intensity is measured in $ and time (hours). Dollars wagered can range from $0 to unlimited $. Time is measured in hours and can range from 0 to &gt;1,000 hours. Higher scores indicate a worse outcome.</description>

    <description>Self-reported gambling harms as assessed by the 72-item Gambling-Related Harms Questionnaire (yes/no responses). Scores range from 0 to 72. Higher scores indicate a worse outcome.</description>

    <measure>Quality of Life Inventory (Frisch et al., 1994). A self-reported quality of life measure assessing 17 domains of life for importance and satisfaction.</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to post-treatment (12 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Self-report quality of life questionnaire. Participants rate 17 domains on importance (range not at all important [0] to extremely important [2]). The 17 domains are then rated on how satisfied the individual is regards to his or her life (-3 [very dissatisfied] to 3 [very dissatisfied]). A total score is then generated by summing the product of importance multiplied by satisfaction. Scores range from 0 to 102. Higher scores indicate a better outcome.</description>

    <description>The app uses smartphones' global positioning software (GPS) that recognizes a user's location to within 15 feet. The app will construct a customizable geofence (e.g., 3 miles) around a gambler's favored gambling venue (e.g., casino, gas station). If the individual crosses the fence boundary his or her phone will raise the alarm with a personalized motivational message.</description>
