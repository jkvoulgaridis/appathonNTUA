  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nipple-sparing mastectomy (NSM) with immediate reconstruction is one of the standard of care
      surgical treatments of breast cancer (BC) and is used for risk reduction in patients with a
      high risk for BC. While this method shows satisfactory oncologic and good cosmetic outcomes,
      its drawbacks include compromise of the skin flap vascularization due to skin incision,
      nipple-areolar complex (NAC) malposition/distortion and visible scar on the breast. NSM also
      has technical challenges of dissecting and removing larger specimens through limited
      incisions and concerns regarding oncologic effectiveness due to difficulties in visualizing
      regions of the breast remote from the incision. To improve cosmetic outcomes after NSM, a
      modification of this technique using a surgical robotic system was recently described. In a
      limited number of studies, the robotic NSM (RNSM) with immediate prosthetic breast
      reconstruction (IPBR) was shown to be feasible and safe, as well as led to excellent cosmetic
      outcomes and patient satisfaction. There are limited number of centers in North America and
      none in Canada that offer RNSM-IPBR. The investigators hypothesize that RNSM-IPBR is a
      feasible and safe technique that can be utilized in our institution and that it can provide
      superior cosmetic outcomes with less morbidity and higher patient satisfaction compared to
      the traditional NSM-IPBR. The aim is to conduct a single-arm prospective study to investigate
      the safety and feasibility, as well as cosmetic, surgical complication and patient
      satisfaction parameters of NSM-IPBR performed in the University Health Network (UHN). This
      study will serve a foundation for potential introduction of a novel surgical approach in our
      institution and will make it available for treatment and prevention of breast cancer in
      Canadian women. The study will also serve as pilot data for future potential studies,
      including randomized-controlled trials (RCT) comparing RNSM with conventional NSM. As such,
      the study will further our approach to innovation in breast surgical oncology within Canada
      and North America.

    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm prospective study to assess feasibility and safety (primary outcomes),
      as well as patient satisfaction, cosmetic and oncologic outcomes of RNSM-IPBR in women with
      BC or at high risk of BC treated at UHN.

      The objectives of the study are to determine:

        1. Feasibility of RNSM-IPBR through assessing operative parameters (such as time of
           procedure, robot docking time, conversion to conventional NSM-IPBR).

        2. Safety of RNSM-IPBR through assessing rate of morbidity from surgical complications
           (such as wound infection, flap and NAC necrosis, postoperative hematoma/bleeding, seroma
           requiring aspiration, implant loss, anesthesia related complications and need for
           reoperation with one month due to complications) and mortality due to the procedure.

        3. Patient satisfaction from RNSM-IPBR through assessing psychological, physical, sexual
           well-being, as well as satisfaction with breast, overall outcome and care through
           patient reported outcomes.

        4. Cosmetic outcomes of RNSM-IPBR, such as distortion or malposition of NAC and scarring,
           rate of reoperation due to unacceptable cosmetic outcomes.

        5. Short- and long-term oncologic outcomes of NSM-IPBR, such as positivity of margins,
           breast cancer incidence and recurrence rate, as well as overall survival.

      The rationale of the study is to investigate a novel technique of RNSM-IPBR that might have
      superior cosmetic and patient satisfaction outcomes, as well as lower rates of complications,
      based on a small number of previously published studies from Europe and Asia.

      Once enrolled, clinical, radiologic, and pathologic data will be collected for each
      participant at the initial visit and follow up data will be collected via available
      electronic patient records.

      RNSM-IPBR will be performed by previously described method (Toesca et al.) using an
      extra-mammary axillary incision along the mid-axillary line in the axillary fossa. We will
      use Da Vinci Si Surgical System® (Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA) available at Toronto
      General Hospital, UHN.
