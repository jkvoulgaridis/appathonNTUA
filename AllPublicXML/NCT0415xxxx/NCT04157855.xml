    <textblock>
      Background: Chronic Abdominal Pain (CAP) is the sixth most common cause of hospital admission
      from any cause in women and the tenth most common cause in men. In the UK, it has been
      estimated that chronic abdominal pain costs the economy in excess of Â£100 million per annum.
      The mechanism of CAP is poorly understood. Patients with acute exacerbation of their CAP have
      multiple hospital admissions, prolonged length of stay and utilise significant health care
      resources. These patients have undergone multiple investigations with negative results
      leading to frustration for both the patient and the clinician. Additional testing and
      investigations increases costs, patient morbidity and comes with added risks. Patients are
      discharged once the flare up settles. The investigators have shown that treating patients
      with steroid injection followed by pulsed radio frequency treatment six months later can
      reduce the length of stay, repeat hospital admission, improve mood and provide durable pain
      relief in patients with CAP. The steroid is injected into a specific plane in the abdominal
      wall and is called abdominal plane block (APB). The investigators currently offer ABP
      treatment as a standard treatment in the management of patients with CAP.

      Aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of Abdominal Plane Block (APB) treatment in
      reducing hospital readmission over 12 months in patients admitted with exacerbation of CAP

      Methods: The proposed study is a prospective, observational pilot study that will be
      conducted at Leicester General Hospital over 36 months. After providing written consent,
      adult patients admitted to the hospital with acute exacerbation of CAP will receive two
      sequential APB treatments (steroid injection followed by pulsed radio frequency treatment)
      six month apart. If the first treatment with steroid does not provide any benefit, the
      participants will receive a rescue treatment (trigger point injection with steroids).
      Participants will be asked to complete questionnaires on pain scores, mood and quality of
      life. Length of hospital stay, number of hospital re-admission following APB treatment as
      well as any complication from the APB treatment will be recorded. Participation in the study
      will end at 12 months following the first APB treatment on completion of relevant
      questionnaires.

    <description>APB Steroids treatment: under real time ultrasound guidance, a 100 mm needle is introduced into the specified plane (subcostal TAP for upper abdomen pain, posterior TAP for lower abdomen pain or TQL for flank and lower abdominal pain). Normal saline (10 ml) is used to open the fascial plane (saline hydrodissection). Then 40 mg of depomedrone diluted in 10 ml of 0.25% levo-bupivacaine is injected into the plane. . A total of 80 mg of depomedrone (steroid) will be used.</description>

        This study is based on a cohort of adult patients who are admitted to the hospital with
        acute exacerbation of chronic abdominal pain.

        Chronic Abdominal Pain is defined as persistent abdominal pain that lasts for more than
        three months.
