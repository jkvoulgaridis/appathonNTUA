  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer diagnosis among women and the incidence is
      increasing. Prognosis and treatment are dependent on the expression of estrogen receptors
      (ER) in the tumor. ER status is determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) on biopsy tissue.
      The ER expression can change over time and be heterogeneous.

      The IHC score on ER expression is subjective and can lead to intra and inter observer
      variability. A new computer image analysis software that can give the exact percentage of
      colored tumor cells on sectional tumor cuts has been developed.

      It is also possible to quantify the ER expression non invasive by using the tracer
      16α-18F-flour-17β-estradiol (FES) and in vivo positron emission tomography (PET) scans.
      FES-PET/CT has a high background activity in the liver which complicates the visualization of
      liver metastases. Theoretically, a new whole body parametric scan method makes it possible to
      distinguish background activity from uptake in liver metastases.

      Malignant tumors often have an increased perfusion, and previous studies have found that
      tumors with low metabolism relative to blood flow have the longest disease free survival
      (DFS). To the best of our knowledge, no previous studies have examined the correlation
      between ER expression and blood flow.
