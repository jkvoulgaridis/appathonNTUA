  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Automated Insulin Delivery (AID) systems have now become an important standard-of-care for
      people with T1D and have demonstrated a reduction, but not elimination, of hypoglycemia
      during long-term studies. One limitation of current AID systems is that they have no
      knowledge about the context or environment that a person is currently experiencing.
      Contextual patterns can potentially improve the performance of an AID by recognizing
      environments or patterns of living that are related to changes in glucose. The team at OHSU
      is developing a context-aware glucose prediction algorithm that will capture context data
      from the patient both indoors and outdoors. This context data will be provided to the
      algorithm to allow for detecting contextual patterns that might relate to high or low
      glucose. The goal of this study will be the creation of a data set that will include
      contextual patterns along with glucose, insulin and physiological data.

      Subjects will be on study for 28 days. Sensor glucose, activity, exercise, insulin, indoor
      and outdoor contextual patterns and meal data will be collected during this time. Subjects
      will wear the Dexcom G6 CGM system and a physical activity monitor for the entire 28 days.
      Subjects will continue to use their own insulin pump. Subjects will be asked to also wear a
      MotioWear indoor/outdoor context-aware tracking tag and to install the MotioWear beacons
      within their home. Subjects will be randomized to complete either aerobic, high intensity
      interval training, or resistance exercise videos twice weekly at home during weeks 1 and 2
      and once during weeks 3 and 4. Subjects will also ingest a self-selected meal prior to these
      prescribed exercise sessions. Subjects will eat a high carbohydrate dinner once each week on
      the same day at the same approximate time of day (but not on the exercise days).

      Subjects will use the T1 DEXI mobile app created by OHSU to capture meal and exercise data
      along with photos of meals the day of exercise and the day after. While at home, subjects
      will check CBG before and after exercise, for symptoms of hypoglycemia, and for Dexcom G6
      alarms for sensor &lt;70 mg/dL and &gt;250 mg/dL.
