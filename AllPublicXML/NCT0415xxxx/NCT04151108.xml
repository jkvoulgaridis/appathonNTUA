  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As humans age, there is a gradual loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength, termed
      sarcopenia. The underlying causes of sarcopenia are yet not fully elucidated but are thought
      to be multifactorial and include increased levels of systemic pro-inflammatory mediators, a
      decrease in anabolic hormones and changes in the neuromuscular system. Furthermore, physical
      inactivity, chronic diseases, immobilisation and hospitalisation are known to play an
      important part in the development of sarcopenia.

      The prevalence of sarcopenia ranges from 20-30% (aged &gt;70yrs) within the general community.
      However, the prevalence of sarcopenia in geriatric patients after an acute hospital admission
      is substantially higher, estimated at â‰ˆ50%. Furthermore, successive events of hospitalisation
      have been suggested to contribute to the development of sarcopenia, as even short periods
      (4-5 days) of skeletal muscle disuse are known to induce muscle atrophy.

      Mean length of hospital stay in geriatric wards due to acute illness or hip-fracture is
      typically 7 to 11 days during which the level of physical activity is strongly reduced
      leading to an accelerated loss of muscle mass that many older patients never recover from.

      Notably, a substantial part of the deterioration in functional capacity could be avoided just
      by counteracting loss of muscle mass during hospitalization. As such, we need to identify
      sensitive biological, clinical and functional biomarkers predicting loss of muscle mass and
      function during hospitalization to identify patients at risk of developing sarcopenia.
      Additionally, it is crucial to investigate the association of these biomarkers with hospital
      length of stay, as hospitalisation has been suggested to contribute to the development of
      sarcopenia while longer hospital stays may increase patient risk of hospital-acquired
      infections and place an economic burden on society.
