    <textblock>
      There is no current research to support the efficacy of a combination of equine-assisted
      activities (EAA) and brain building activities to influence motor skill competencies in youth
      with neurodevelopmental disorders (ND). The primary objective of this study was to quantify
      changes in motor skill proficiency before and after 8 weeks of EAA and brain-building
      activities in youth with ND. A secondary objective was to quantify changes in motor skill
      proficiency before and after 1 year of EAA and brain-building activities in youth with ND.

      Twenty-five youth completed the same 32-week protocol that was separated into 4, 8-week
      blocks, in the following order: a) control, b) EAA-only, c) washout, and d) GaitWay block
      (EAA and brain building activities). Before and after each block, motor skills were assessed
      using the Short Form of the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency-Version 2 (BOT-2).
      Seven youth continued with the GaitWay intervention for one additional year, and the BOT-2
      Short Form was also administered following this intervention. A repeated-measures
      analysis-of-variance was performed to compare BOT-2 subtest and overall scores between
      interventions. A significance of .05 was used. Manual dexterity was higher at Post-Washout
      versus Pre-Control (p = .018) and Post-Control (p = .024), and at Post-GaitWay versus
      Pre-Control (p = .037). Upper-limb coordination was higher Post-GaitWay versus Post-Control
      (p = .050). When compared to Pre-Control, strength was higher at Post-EAA (p = .028) and at
      Post-GaitWay (p = .015). Overall scores were higher at Post-GaitWay when compared to
      Pre-Control (p = .003) and Post-Control (p = .009). Among the seven participants who
      participated in the 1-year follow-up GaitWay motor skills were maintained for one year
      following the Post-GaitWay testing session. A combination of EAA and brain building
      activities may be an effective therapeutic modality to improve and maintain motor skill
      proficiency in youth with ND.
