  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this trial is to evaluate the possible benefits on saciety and dyslipidemia in
      subjects with overweight/obesity (BMI ≥25 y &lt;40 kg / m2) and dyslipemia after consumption of
      a modifed honey with soluble fiber and polyphenols.

      Some studies have shown the contribution of high-fiber foods in the reduction of the
      cardiovascular risk. Besides, polyphenols have reported with their potent antioxidant effect
      and their implication lowering the vardiovascular risk.

      The trial was designed as a randomized, parallel, double-blind and controlled study with 2
      experimental arms. This study was performed to evaluate the effect on saciety and
      dyslipidemia of subjects with overweight/obesity after a long consumption (3 months) of a
      modified honey with soluble fiber and polyphenols. Additionally, a short-term randomized,
      cross-over, doble-blind and controlled trial was also performed to evaluate immediate saciety
      effect on the same subjects.

      For the middle-term study, investigators included 67 participants (8 men and 59 women)
      between 18 and 65 years (BMI ≥25 and &lt;40 kg / m2). All volunteers were randomized into 2
      study groups, and participants received the 2 different study products during the 3 months.
      On the other hand, the associated short-term trial included 10 participants (5 men and 5
      women) between 18 and 65 years (BMI ≥25 and &lt;40 kg / m2). All volunteers were randomized into
      2 study groups, and participants took the 2 different study products in two non-consecutive
      days.
