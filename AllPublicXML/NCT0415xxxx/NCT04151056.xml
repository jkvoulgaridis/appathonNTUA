    <textblock>
      Currently, the social problems are hidden behind clinical diagnostics. This may lead to
      overdiagnosis and overtreatment of some discomforts/pathologies that are observed in primary
      care centers that may respond better to community level interventions and promotion of health
      actions.

      It is longitudinal , multicentered, pre and post intervention study, conducted by health
      professionals of central Catalonia sanitary region during 2019 Prior to the intervention, the
      number and type of social coded diagnoses in the clinical history is going to be described.
      Subsequently, an intervention will be carried out: training the professionals in the
      homogeneous codification of five selected social determinants. This codification will be
      systematically applied .The number and type of social diagnostics registered in the pre and
      post-intervention periods is going to be compared. Finally, the impact analysis of the social
      determinants is going to be carried out.

      Afterwards the investigators plan to search solutions at Community level for the select
      social diagnoses

    <description>It will be evaluated health differences in the six coded groups (including the control group) through appropriate parametric and non-parametric tests , It is going to be compared the average of each selected dependent health variables in social coded diagnoses and the screened patients group without a social diagnosis
The dependent health variables are going to be analysed after the codification of the six selected diagnosis. The study dependent health variables are:
number of clinical diagnoses registered;
number of medicines consumed ;
number of the total diagnostic test requested;
number of specialists referrals
