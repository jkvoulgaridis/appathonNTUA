  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In most Asian medical centers, rapid on-site cytology evaluation is not available, the number
      of needle passes of EUS-FNA is decided by endoscopists. Full-field optical coherence
      tomography (FF-OCT) is a new optical imaging technique that could generate sectioning
      tomogram from fresh tissue and provide close-to-pathology depiction of the morphological
      structure and pathological changes in minutes without conventional tissue preparation,
      slicing, and staining, and dynamic cell imaging (DCI) added the viability information of
      cells/tissue, which could be more important in sample rapid evaluation.

      Light-CT, a special-designed pathology-approximation system which is based on the lighting
      feature or dynamic feature of tissue and cells, is used to detect malignant cells or tissue
      in fresh specimens. Morphological structure and pathological changes could be captured in
      minutes, which implies a possible application in intraoperative diagnosis. The investigators
      aimed to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of FFOCT for the tissue samples obtained from
      EUS-FNB of pancreas.

    <description>Pancreatic tissue sample obtained by EUS-FNB will be used for FFOCT imaging. The Images will be sent to trained pathologists for diagnosis. The same tissue sample will be sent to the pathology department for routine histological examination. Compare the diagnoses made by the 2 different methods.</description>
