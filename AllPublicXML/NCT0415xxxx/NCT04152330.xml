      Problem: With the increased survival rate of children with congenital heart disease, other
      health issues, other than just the disease clinic, have emerged, such as the risks to
      developmental delay to which these children are exposed. There is a need for low-cost
      intervention studies that seek to minimize these risks.

      Objective: To evaluate the effect of an early stimulation program using parents as
      intervention vectors on the neurodevelopment of children with severe congenital heart
      disease.

      Methodology: Randomized clinical trial conducted with children with congenital heart disease
      considered at high risk for developmental delay according to the American Heart Association
      (2012) guidelines from birth to the first year of life. The study will consist of two groups
      G1 (cases) and G2 (controls). G1 parents will receive stimulation activity guidance at 2
      different times, at 30 days and at 3 months. Parents will also be instructed to keep an
      online execution diary, direct with the researcher through video, and mobile messaging. G2
      parents will receive the standard guidelines currently used in the follow-up services of
      children with congenital heart disease. Children in both groups will be assessed at 3 and 6
      months by the Bayley Scales of Baby and Toddler Development (3rd Edition).

      Expected Results: Better neuropsychomotor performance of children after application of early
      stimulation protocol.

      Perspectives: Create a body of information that can serve as a basis for formulating
      intervention policies and surveillance of the development of this population.

    <description>Subjects will be randomized to two groups, intervention group (IG) and Control group (CG). Each GI Parents-Baby dyad will receive 4 interventions, which will take place at predetermined dates (at 30 days, 3 months, 6 months, and 9 months) with groups of up to 5 pairs of participants. &quot;Parents&quot; is understood to be a generalist nomenclature and will be considered as parent, parent or primary caregiver.
CG subjects will receive standard guidelines from the pediatric and pediatric cardiology outpatient clinic.</description>

    <description>A parent guidance booklet will be prepared. It will contain a specific program of stimulation activities for each stage of development in simple language and with illustrations. Subdivided into 4 areas: Cognition, Language, Broad Motor, and Fine Motor. The duration will be 6 months, with intervention at 30 days and 3 months. Parents will attend 2 individual meetings, where they will receive information and clarifications on the application of the booklet. Parents will be advised about the capabilities and limitations of their babies according to the congenital heart disease the child has, as well as what is expected within the typical development for that age group, and the importance of early stimulation activities in each child. one of 4 development areas. They will be informed about the need for that stimulus for the baby's development, as well as possible doubts about the stimulus.</description>
