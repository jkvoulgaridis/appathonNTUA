    <description>The Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale (HDSS) is a disease-specific, quick, and easily-understood diagnostic tool that provides a qualitative measure of the severity of the patient's condition based on how it affects daily activities. HDSS is a four item scale. A score of 1 or 2 indicates mild or moderate Hyperhidrosis. A score of 3 or 4 indicates severe Hyperhidrosis.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of severe primary axillary hyperhidrosis with a HDSS score of 3 or 4

          -  At least 50 mg of sweat production in each axilla measured gravimetrically at room
             temperature and at a humidity consistent with the normal climate in that area over a
             period of 5 minutes (patients should have acclimatized to that room for at least 30
             minutes)

          -  Men and women aged 18 to 65 years at the time of informed consent with a body mass
             index of 18-32 kg/m2

          -  Able to comply with protocol requirements, including overnight stays, blood sample
             collections as defined in the protocol subjects

          -  Willing and able to provide written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known allergy to any of the components in the investigational product.

          -  Hypersensitivity against glycopyrrolate

          -  Secondary hyperhidrosis, for example, hyperhidrosis that is secondary to other
             underlying diseases including hyperthyroidism, lymphoma and malaria, climacteric
             hyperhidrosis.

          -  Previous surgical treatment of hyperhidrosis including sympathectomy, surgical
             debulking of the sweat glands, subcutaneous tissue curettage and ultrasonic surgery.

          -  Botulinum toxin treatment in the prior 4 months.

          -  Angle closure glaucoma or its precipitation (narrow angle).

          -  Mycotic, other skin infections and other dermal disorder including infection at
             anticipated application sites in either axilla.

          -  Any condition or situation that, in the investigator's or sub-investigator's opinion,
             may interfere with the patient's participation in the study
