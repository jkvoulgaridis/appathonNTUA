      Patients with diabetes, hammer, mallet and claw toes and impending ulcers associated with
      hammer mallet and claw toes will be randomized to tenotomy (cutting) of flexor tendons to the
      afflicted toes, done by needle and standard offloading or offloading alone. Impending ulcers
      are defined as callus or nail changes that are known pre-stages to ulcers. The effects of the
      surgery on incidence of ulcers associated with the named deformities, and rate of
      complications associated with the surgery.

      1. STUDY RATIONAL Diabetes is one of the largest medical challenges facing the world today.
           12% of the world's health budget is spent on diabetes, that is USD 673 billion (Euros
           585 billion). It is estimated that a lower limb is amputated due to diabetes every 30
           sec. on a global scale, and it is known that 85% of all amputations are performed due to
           a diabetic ulcer1. In Denmark 320.000 citizens has a diabetes diagnosis, an additional
           200.000 are estimated to have diabetes unknowingly, and 750.000 to have the pre-stages
           of diabetes2. These numbers have doubled in the past ten years and are estimated to cost
           DKK 86 million a day (or Euros 11.6 million a day)1. One of the complications to
           diabetes is the &quot;diabetic foot syndrome&quot;, which is a result of neurological
           abnormalities, vascular complications or a combination of the two. Knowledge about the
           causes of the disease has been gathered since the late nineteenth century3. In recent
           years, preventive therapy has been the focus of treatment, resulting in several national
           and international guidelines4,5,6. Focus has been on education in self-care and
           awareness of risk factors, combined with &quot;Foot-at-Risk&quot; evaluation7, at least once a
           year and off-loading therapy crafted and applied by specialized personnel3,4.

           Steno Diabetes Center Copenhagen, University of Copenhagen, Denmark is a
           highly-specialized treatment facility focusing on the patient with diabetes. In spite of
           optimized treatment for patients with diabetes, and the fact that incidence of first
           time ulcers in patients with type 1 and 2 diabetes is declining, the incidence of first
           time ulcers is still 2.6 and 8.7 per. 1000 patient years for type 1 and 2,
           respectively8. Diabetic foot ulcers have a known association with increased mortality,
           morbidity and economic burden9,10,11, at the same time most amputations in patients with
           diabetes are preceded by an ulcer12.

           Hammer, mallet and claw-toe deformities are some of the most common deformities
           associated with the diabetic foot syndrome. Prevalence has been reported between 32% and
           46%13,14. These deformities are predictors of diabetic foot ulcers15,16. There are
           several theories on the etiology of hammer, mallet and claw toe deformities - the three
           classic deformities of the toes. In the diabetic patient setting, the classical theory
           is based on neuropathy (nerve damage associated with diabetes and other diseases),
           resulting in intrinsic muscle (muscles of the foot) dysfunction, changes that lead to
           imbalance between the flexor and extensor tendons, which in turn leads to hyperextension
           of the metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint and/or flexion in the interphalangeal joints
           (IP), leading to the three classic deformities of the toes. The neuropathic theory is
           not sufficient to explain the full scope of the problem 4, and other theories have been
           proposed17. In the non-diabetic patient, the neuropathic explanation is not viable, but
           the explanations still center on an imbalance between in- and extrinsic musculature,
           resulting from deformities in the foot either as flexor-substitution or stabilization
           deformities18. The deformities change the pressure on the plantar aspect of the foot19.
           These changes in pressure make specific contact points predilection sites for ulcers.
           The sites have been described as tip of the toe ulcers, cock-up ulcers, kissing ulcers
           and plantar metatarsal ulcers20.

           The treatment of hammer, mallet and claw toe deformities in diabetes has classically
           consisted of offloading in the form of shoes, insoles and/or orthosis (i.e. silicone
           spacers, felt pads etc.) or flexor tendon tenotomy (cutting tendons) done by scalpel.
           Several studies on flexor tenotomies performed with scalpel have been performed21,22;
           all have reported acceptable or positive results on ulcer healing and low complication
           rates, including one study from our own institute23. At Diabetic Foot Study Group 2018
           we presented unpublished results from a study showing that tenotomy done by needle has
           comparable results to the classical scalpel. However, no study has, to our knowledge,
           been published comparing conservative treatment with surgical approach to these
           deformities, let alone randomized controlled trials (RCT).

        2. WHAT DOES THIS TRIAL ADD TO CURRENT KNOWLEDGE? This is to our knowledge the first RCT
           looking at flexor tenotomies as a preventive treatment, and/or compared to conservative
           treatment. At the same time this is the first study looking at needle flexor tenotomies,
           as opposed to the classic tenotomies done by scalpel.

        3. HYPOTHESIS We hypothesize that treating hammer, mallet and claw toe deformities in
           patients with type 1 and 2 diabetes, and impending ulcers (defined as nail changes, and
           hypercallosities at the predilection sites for ulcers associated with hammer, mallet and
           claw toe deformities) with needle tenotomy is a safe and effective treatment, and
           superior compared to offloading (conservative) treatment done by silicon spacer,
           insoles, felt, and/or therapeutic sandals

        4. AIM The aim of the RCT is to evaluate the effect of needle tenotomy when treating
           impending ulcers associated with hammer, mallet and claw toe deformities.

           The study is designed as a prospective RCT comparing needle tenotomy with conservative
           treatment, for patients with deformities and impending ulcers associated with the three
           deformities.

           Primary endpoint will be number of new ulcers incurred, defined as ulcers associated
           with hammer, mallet and claw toe deformities, placed on treated foot.

           Secondary endpoints will be complications: infections (defined as ailment associated
           with procedure or ulcer, that is diagnosed as infection by attending health
           professional), transfer lesions (defined as impending ulcers or actual ulcers at
           anatomical sites associated with hammer, mallet and claw toes in patients with diabetes,
           on non-treated hammer, mallet and claw toes after surgical treatment), minor amputations
           (defined as amputations below ankle level), major amputations (defined as amputations at
           or above ankle level).

        5. STUDY I 5.1 Design A prospective RCT involving patients with diabetes as well as one of
           the three deformities and an impending ulcer associated with the mentioned deformities.
           By randomization, patients will be allocated to either conservative treatment or
           tenotomy performed by needle.

           5.2 Statistical analysis plan Sample-size The calculation is done with a Type 1 error
           rate at 5%, and a power at 80%. The primary endpoint is number of new ulcers incurred.

           In the general diabetic population life time prevalence of diabetic ulcers has been
           reported at 15-25%24, the yearly incidence in the same group is 6%. This study focuses
           on patients with a deformity reported to have a 1.5 hazard ratio25, and signs of an
           impending ulcer like callus formation, which has been reported with a relative risk of
           1126. The incidence of new diabetic foot ulcers incurred by the study population is set
           at 10%, according to the above mentioned considerations.

           The incidence in the intervention group is set at 6%, so the anticipated reduction in
           incidence is 4% compared to the incidence in the control group which as above mentioned
           is set at 10%.

           However, the numbers for incidence of new diabetic foot ulcers is an uncertain size,
           especially when looking at the specific group we are looking at, therefore the standard
           deviation is set at 10.

           The calculator used is a 2 means, 2 sample, 2-sided equality calculator. The formula is
           18 With the above described parameters, the sample size is 98 patients, which due to an
           expected dropout of 10% will be extended to 110 patients.

        6. PERSPECTIVE The results of these studies will allow us to evaluate if there's a clinical
           advantage to performing preventive tenotomies. Several studies have shown that
           tenotomies done by scalpel are safe, and that most patients go on to heal their ulcers,
           but none have compared tenotomies to standard care, and no studies have looked at
           tenotomies as a preventive treatment against new ulcers. Our hypothesis is that patients
           with impending ulcers associated with hammer, mallet and claw toe deformities will have
           a lower incidence of new ulcers associated with hammer, mallet and claw toe deformities.
           At the same time, unpublished data from our institute show that tenotomies done by
           needle has comparable results to tenotomies done by scalpel. The economic perspectives
           are vast if a preventive minimal invasive procedure, that can be performed in everyday
           clinical work, with a minimal surgical technique requirement, can lead to significant
           reductions in incidence of new ulcers.

        7. QUALITY CONTROL AND MONITORING The studies will be performed in accordance with the
           Helsinki Declaration, International Council for Harmonization of technical requirements
           for pharmaceuticals for human use (ICH) Guidelines for good Clinical Practice (GCP)27.
           and after approval by the The National Committee on Health Research Ethics and the Data
           Monitoring Board in Denmark. The study will be registered on
           http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/.

           Permission for a third person to have access to patient data will be obtained at
           screening visit. Investigators will provide access to source data and relevant documents
           in connection with monitoring, inspections, and audits to all relevant authorities.

        8. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND DATA SAFETY The study will be conducted in accordance with
           the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki 1996 and
           the principles of GCP28 8.1 Ethical committee approval The appropriate approval from a
           local Danish ethical committee will be obtained before start of trial, and their
           guidelines will be followed throughout the process. Patients will receive oral and
           written information on the study, before being required to sign an informed consent
           paper.

           8.2 Personal data usage and protection The appropriate approval from the Danish data
           protection agency will be obtained before the study commences, and their guidelines will
           be followed throughout the process. All patient data will be stored and treated in
           accordance with regulation 2016/679 from the European parliament on the protection of
           natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement
           of such data, dated 27 April 201629, and the Danish amendment to regulation 2016/67930.

           8.3 Patient Perspective Patients enrolled in this study will receive a treatment that is
           already implemented in our and several other clinics, and the unpublished data from our
           retrospective study and the formerly published data on tenotomies, points towards
           tenotomies being a safe and effective treatment of hammer, mallet and claw toes.
           Patients who don't receive intervention in the form of tenotomies in the study, will
           receive standard offloading and ulcer treatment, and be offered to undergo tenotomy if
           an ulcer occurs and tenotomi is found relevant. In conclusion the patients enrolled in
           the study will receive a treatment with potential benefits for them, and a low risk of
           complications making the study ethically sound.

        9. RECRUITMENT Patients will be recruited and treated at the three study sites, Bispebjerg
           Hospital, Hilleroed Hospital and Steno Diabetes Center Copenhagen. Healthcare
           professionals (doctors, nurses and podiatrists) with daily care of patients with
           diabetes will be encouraged to look for potential study candidates in the outpatient
           clinics. If any potential candidates are found, patients will receive written
           information on the project, asked if we can contact them regarding the study and
           referred to one of the investigators for further screening. When referred to
           investigator, eligibility criteria will be confirmed based on information from the
           patients' electronic record (sundhedsplatformen). Patients will hereafter be contacted
           by telephone. If patients do not respond to contact by telephone, they will be contacted
           by letter.

           In addition to the above mentioned method, primary investigator will conduct a screening
           of patients that are currently treated at the three institutes for eligible candidates.
           This screening will be conducted through the patient electronic record
           (sundhedsplatformen). The data that is screened in patient electronic record, includes
           all data relevant for in/exclusion criteria, namely prior diagnosis, operations,
           medicine use and visit information.

           Identified candidates will be contacted by letter. If patients do not respond to letter,
           they will be contacted by phone.

           Before written consent is given, patients will be informed orally and in writing by the
           educated study personnel, including information on procedures, visits, goal of the
           study, and their rights as participants.

           General practitioners will be contacted by mail and asked to refer likely candidates to
           relevant study site (i.e. Hilleroed, Bispebjerg or Steno). The general practitioners and
           licensed podiatrists in the region will be informed by standard text, in the form of a
           standard letter To increase potential candidates found, adds in relevant locale
           newspaper and in national magazines. The ads will be in standard texts.

           Written consent will be acquired at inclusion visit by study related personnel. Patients
           will be required to fill out written consent form, after they have received oral and
           written information and been allowed up to 24 hours consideration and the possibility of
           bringing a personal assessor to participate at information and screening visits. If the
           patient needs additional time to consider, a follow-up meeting will be arranged minimum
           24 hours after the first visit. Patients are informed that they can always withdraw
           their commitment to participate in the study, without consequences for their further
           treatment. No study related procedures are done until informed consent is signed by the
           patient.

       10. DISSEMINATION OF RESULTS The study is initiated by Peter Rossing. Data is owned by the
           investigators. Positive, inconclusive as well as negative study results will be
           published in both national and international oral and written presentations as well as
           peer-reviewed international scientific journals. If data against expectations are not
           published in international journals, positive as well as negative study results will be
           published on a public website, for example www.clinicaltrials.gov.

       11. PATIENT INFORMATION

      11.1 Written Information All patients will receive information detailing the project, written
      information on their rights as Participants in research projects from the Danish ethics
      committee31, and written information on the procedure, potential unintended side effects, and
      what to expect after the operation.

      11.2 Verbal Information All patients will be informed in layman's terms on the details of the
      operations, potential unintended side effects, and what to expect after the operation.

    <description>Patient is placed in seated posture with feet elevated. The toe(s) with hammer, mallet or claw toe deformity is anesthetized by a digital toe block with 1-5 ml of 1% lidocaine administered for each toe. The toe digital block is administered through a plantar approach, at the web level of the deformed toe(s), with a 0,6 mm diameter and 30mm long needle.
After anesthetizing the toe(s) the plantar aspect of the toe at web level is disinfected with an alcohol based disinfectant twice.
Both the long and short flexors are then severed with a 1.2mm diameter and 40mm long needle through a plantar approach, immediately proximal to the web level of the toe.
After the procedure a dry gauze bandage is applied and the patients treated foot/feet is/are elevated for 20 minutes to achieve haemostasis, and the bandage is checked for bleeding before discharge.</description>
