  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single cente, single arm, open-label, phase I study to evaluate the safety and
      effectiveness of CMV-TCR-T cell immunotherapy in treating CMV virus infection after HSCT.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CMV infection is a common virus infection of HSCT, and which is highly related with the
      failure of transplantation and survival time of transplant patients. To evaluate the safety
      and efficacy of allogenic CMV-TCR-T cell therapy in subjects with CMV infection, patients
      with CMV emias or deseases will be enrolled, and donor derived
      CMV-TCR-T(HLA-A*1101\0201\2402) cells will be intravenously infused with a escalated dose of
      0.1-1×106 CMV-TCR-T cells. The CMV DNA copies and CMV-TCR-T cell proliferation will be
      monitored in the scheduled time (day 0, day 4, day 7, day 10, day 14, day 28).
