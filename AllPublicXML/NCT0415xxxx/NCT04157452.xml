  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis is a lethal complication of flexible ureteroscopy. The aim of this study is to
      identify predictors of sepsis after flexible ureteroscopy in patients with solitary proximal
      ureteral stones.

    <description>sepsis is defined as the concurrence of infection and at least 2 of the following 4 criteria: (1) body temperature &gt;38°C, (2) heart rate &gt;90/minute, (3) respiratory rate &gt;20/minute, and (4) leukocyte count &lt;4,000 cells/μL or &gt;12,000 cells/μL</description>

    <description>flexible ureteroscopy is used to removed the stone. If a double-J stent was inserted pre-operatively, it was removed at the beginning of surgery. Rigid ureteroscopy was routinely used for ureteral dilatation before fURS. A 0.035 mm guidewire was advanced through the urethral and ureteral meatuses to the renal pelvis under direct rigid ureteroscope vision. A 14-Fr ureteral access sheath (Cook Medical, Bloomington, IN) was then passed over the wire to the ureteropelvic junction, and 7.5-Fr fURS (Flex-X2, Karl Storz, Germany) was performed through the sheath. Intrarenal pressure was stabilized by a pressure-sensitive pump (Shenda Medical, China). Holmium: yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser was used to fragment the stones. After lithotripsy, 6-Fr double-J stent was routinely inserted in all cases for 2-4 weeks.</description>
