  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will treat patients (targeting enrollment of n=20) who suffer from
      trigeminal or glossopharyngeal nerve pain in the context of painful small fiber neuropathy.
      The primary pain-related objective is reduction of pain and reduced use of rescue and other
      anti-pain medications. Another goal is to monitor and confirm the safety profile established
      in the migraine population, during previous Phase 3 trials.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 18-80 years old.

          -  The patient must have an assigned diagnosis of non-neuralgic trigeminal nerve pain
             G50.1, with all its permutations listed in the ICD10 explicitly allowed. Co-morbid
             trigeminal neuralgia G50.0 and G43. â€¦ related headache codes are allowed. As an
             alternative to trigeminal nerve pain G50.1, glossopharyngeal nerve pain will be
             another inclusion criterion, with a G52.1 diagnosis and explicit mentioning of pain
             mediated by or in the innervation territory of the glossopharyngeal nerve.

        In addition, patients have to be diagnosed with a painful small fiber neuropathy. This
        diagnosis is based on a skin biopsy or biopsy of an innervated surface epithelium with
        nerve fiber density count. The required ICD10 diagnostic codes are G63.3, G60.8, G62.8.
        Co-morbidity with a fibromyalgia-related disorder will be allowed, typically summarized
        under a diagnosis code of M79.7.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients that have a history of allergy or allergy-like incompatibility with a
             biologic that contains a human or humanized monoclonal antibody will be excluded.

          -  Female patients of child-bearing age who are or want to become pregnant will be
             excluded. In case such a patient intends to participate, then she has to commit to a
             pregnancy prevention regimen that is based on hormonal contraceptive or intra-uterine
             device.
