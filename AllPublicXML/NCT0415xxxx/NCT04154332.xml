  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although extensively studied, the cause of preeclampsia remains uncertain other than it is
      thought that the placenta plays a critical role in the development of preeclampsia. Recent
      data revealed that exosomes released from the placenta could cause preeclampsia by
      transporting specific cargo responsible for the pathophysiological changes associated with
      the systemic disease. By isolating these exosomes from maternal blood and placental tissue in
      patients diagnosed with preeclampsia and studying their biochemical, cellular and molecular
      mechanism in an animal model, the investigators hope to elucidate the critical role that
      exosomal cargo plays in the development of preeclampsia and cardiovascular remodeling. This
      will be accomplished by obtaining patient samples from volunteers delivering at the Women and
      Infants Center and taking the samples to the lab for quantification, characterization, and
      identification of key functional roles through in/ex vivo, in vitro, and profiling studies.
      The investigators believe this work will be valuable as hope exists to define the functional
      role exosomes play in the development of preeclampsia that leads to cardiovascular
      remodeling. Data from this study will shed more light on the functional role of exosomal
      cargo in normal and pathological pregnancies and point towards novel therapeutic intervention
      strategies for preeclampsia associated with cardiovascular disease.

        Inclusion

          1. Preeclampsia patients: Age ≥ 18 years; Diagnosis of preeclampsia with severe features:
             (a) BP ≥160/110 after 20 weeks gestation AND ≥300 mg/day proteinuria or
             protein/creatinine ratio of 0.3 mg/dL; OR (b) BP ≥160/110 after 20 weeks gestation
             with any of the following co-conditions: platelet count less than 100,000 X 109/L,
             AST/ALT enzymes elevated to twice the upper limit of normal, serum creatinine ≥1.1
             mg/dL or a doubling of the creatinine from baseline, pulmonary edema, new-onset
             headache, and/or visual disturbances.

          2. Control patients: Age ≥ 18 years; no diagnosis of preeclampsia or any
             pregnancy-induced hypertension disorder.

        Exclusion criteria:

          1. Preeclampsia patients: Age &lt; 18 years; Any other diagnosis of pregnancy-induced
             hypertension that isn't preeclampsia with severe features (i.e. gestational
             hypertension or preeclampsia without severe features).

          2. Control Patients: Age &lt; 18 years; Any diagnosis of pregnancy-induced hypertension.
