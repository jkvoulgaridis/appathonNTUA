    <measure>Incidence of Adverse Events (AE) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Throughout the study period (approximately up to 9 years)</time_frame>
    <description>An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence (whether considered to be related to study product or not) that at any dose results in death, life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital abnormality or birth defect, an important medical event. An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical (study) product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (study) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (study) product. AEs and SAEs that are at least possibly related to study drug ADYNOVI/ADYNOVATE will be evaluated in this outcome.</description>
