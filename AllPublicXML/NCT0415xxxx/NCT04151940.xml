  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates the changes in positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography
      (CT) imaging scans during chemoimmunotherapy and radiation therapy treatment in patients with
      stage IV non-small cell lung cancer. Analyzing changes in PET/CT imaging scans may help
      doctors assess and predict patterns of cancer response to chemoimmunotherapy and radiation
      therapy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergo PET/CT scan within 4 weeks before starting standard of care
      chemoimmunotherapy and a second PET/CT scan within 5 days of the second chemoimmunotherapy
      cycle. Patients receiving standard of care radiation treatment undergo additional PET/CT
      scans within 4 weeks prior to radiation treatment and 1 month post-radiation treatment.

             targeting other immuno-regulatory receptors or mechanisms

             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator

          -  Has an active autoimmune disease currently requiring systemic treatment (e.g. disease
             modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs)

             **Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a
             form of systemic treatment

          -  Has known, active, and symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or
             carcinomatous meningitis
