  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial will seek to extend the preliminary findings of efficacy of MBG453 in combination
      with hypomethylating agents (HMA) by evaluating MBG453 in combination with the HMA
      azacitidine and the Bcl-2 inhibitor venetoclax. The primary purpose of Part 1 (Safety Run-in)
      is to rule out excessive toxicity of MBG453, when administered in combination with
      azacitidine and venetoclax. The primary purpose of the combined Part 1 and Part 2 (Safety
      run-in and Expansion Part) is to evaluate efficacy of MBG453, when administered in
      combination with azacitidine and venetoclax in adult patients with newly diagnosed AML, who
      are not suitable for treatment with intensive chemotherapy.
