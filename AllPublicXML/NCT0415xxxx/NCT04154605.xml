      A randomized, sham-controlled, single-blind study of cryotherapy as a treatment for chronic
      rhinitis.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, multicenter, randomized, sham-controlled, single-blind (participants) study to
      demonstrate the superiority of treatment with the ClariFix cryotherapy device for reducing
      symptoms when compared with a sham treatment in patients with chronic rhinitis. The ClariFix
      device is a Class II FDA-cleared medical device that is intended to be used as a cryosurgical
      tool for the destruction of unwanted tissue during surgical procedures, including in adults
      with chronic rhinitis.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>rTNSS responder rate</measure>
    <time_frame>90-days post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Responders are defined as participants with a 30% or greater reduction in reflective Total Nasal Symptom Score (rTNSS) relative to baseline. The active treatment will be compared with the sham treatment.
The reflective Total Nasal Symptom Score (rTNSS) is a validated PRO consisting of 4 nasal symptom scores for rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, nasal itching, and sneezing that are assessed over the previous 2-week period. Each symptom is rated on a scale of 0 (no symptoms) to 3 (severe symptoms) and the scores are summed to provide a total rTNSS with a possible range of 0 to 12.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in rTNSS</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Mean change from baseline in the rTNSS. The active treatment will be compared with the sham treatment.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in RQLQ(S)</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Mean change from baseline in the Standardized Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ(S)) score. The active treatment will be compared with the sham treatment.
The RQLQ(S) is a validated PRO that measures functional impairments due to allergic or non-allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. The assessment consists of 28 questions related to nose symptoms, eye symptoms, non-eye/nose symptoms, sleep problems, practical problems, activity limitations, and emotional function. Each item is scored from 0 (no impairment) to 6 (severely impaired). An overall score is calculated from the mean of the 28 item responses. Domain scores are the mean of the item scores within that domain.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in EQ-5D-5L</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Mean change from baseline in the 5-level EuroQol 5-dimension survey (EQ-5D-5L) scores. The active treatment will be compared with the sham treatment.
The EQ-5D-5L is a validated, standardized questionnaire used to evaluate general health-related quality of life. The questionnaire consists of 5 health dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) and a visual analog scale (VAS) to indicate overall health on a scale of 0 to 100. Each health dimension has 5 possible responses: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, or extreme problems.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient satisfaction questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Percent of participants indicating satisfaction with the procedure outcome. The active treatment will be compared with the sham treatment.
The satisfaction questionnaire consists of 3 questions that the participant answers at each follow-up visit. The questions indicate whether the participant is satisfied with the procedure outcome, whether the participant would undergo the procedure again for similar results, and whether the participant would recommend the procedure to family or friends with a similar condition. For each item the participant indicates agreement/disagreement with each statement.</description>
