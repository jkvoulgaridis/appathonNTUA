  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of acetic acid in the characterization of polyps, produces a homogeneous white
      staining in sessile serrated adenomas, but not in tubular or tubulo-villous adenomas, a
      simple approach to predict polyp histopathology.

      To determine the diagnostic accuracy of the use of acetic acid on tubular and serrated
      adenomas, during colonoscopy, a prospective diagnostic accuracy study was designed, taking as
      gold standard the pathological anatomy of the resected polyps.

      Polyps found during a colonoscopy with suspicion of sessile serrated adenomas or
      tubular/tubulo villous will be included.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In our experience tubular or tubulovillous adenomas with acetic acid have the same behavior
      as normal colonic mucosa. When sprayed with acetic acid they stain white, as well as the
      surrounding mucosa, but with a subsequent rapid loss of the effect. In contrast, serrated
      adenomas maintain an &quot;aceto-whitening&quot; reaction even though the surrounding normal mucosa
      loses staining.

      The objectives are to determine the sensitivity and specificity, positive and negative
      probability coefficients of the positive or negative aceto-whitening reaction on serrated
      adenomas and tubular-tubulo-villous adenomas.

      To determine the diagnostic accuracy of the use of acetic acid on tubular, tubulo-villous and
      serrated adenomas a prospective diagnostic accuracy study was designed considering the gold
      standard as the pathological anatomy of resected polyps.

      As independent variables the presence or absence of aceto-whitening reaction after staining
      and the diagnostic impression of the endoscopist without acetic acid are considered. The
      presence or not of the aceto-whitening reaction will be evaluated, understanding it as the
      persistence of white staining of the polyp at one minute or three minutes, standing out from
      the surrounding mucosa.

      In case of positive staining it will be considered homogeneous if the staining is uniform on
      the surface of the polyp or heterogeneous if it is done irregularly.

      Place: German Hospital, endoscopy unit.

      Data analysis: the data collected in double-entry tables will be captured to obtain the same
      sensitivity, specificity and positive or negative probability coefficients.

      Sample size: 100 polyps.

      Estimated duration: 1 month

    <description>If during a videcolonoscopy a polyp is found with suspicion of tubular, tubulovillious or Serrated adenoma, the endoscopist will proceed to stain it using diffuser and acetic acid at a concentration of 3%. The presence or not of the aceto-whitening reaction will be evaluated, understanding it as the persistence of white staining of the polyp at one minute or three minutes, standing out from the surrounding mucosa.
In case of positive staining it will be considered homogeneous if the staining is uniform on the surface of the polyp or heterogeneous if it is done irregularly.</description>
