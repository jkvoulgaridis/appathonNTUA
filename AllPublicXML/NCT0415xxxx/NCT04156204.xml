  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medication non-adherence is a major risk factor for graft dysfunction and graft loss among
      pediatric and adult transplant recipients. Rates of non-adherence in these populations are
      estimated between 30 and 70%, with the highest prevalence in adolescent and young adult (AYA)
      transplant recipients. Treatment-related factors known to impact rates of adherence include
      the number of medication doses per day and the number of tablets or capsules a patient takes
      per day, or &quot;pill burden&quot;. One approach to minimizing dosing frequency and pill-burden
      includes transitioning patients to once-daily formulations. The current literature
      investigating utilization of once-daily immunosuppressive regimens in the AYA kidney
      transplant population is limited.

    <textblock>
      One approach to minimizing dosing frequency and pill-burden includes transitioning patients
      to once-daily formulations.3 The current literature investigating utilization of once-daily
      immunosuppressive regimens in the AYA kidney transplant population is limited. Two studies
      have demonstrated safe and effective conversion of twice-daily tacrolimus to the Astagraf® in
      stable pediatric solid organ transplant recipients.4,5 Patients maintained equivalent
      tacrolimus exposure and experienced similar rates of rejection and graft loss in the first
      year post-conversion.5 To date, experience with another once-daily extended release (XR)
      tacrolimus product, Envarsus XR®, has not been published in the AYA population. Additionally,
      adherence studies evaluating a once-daily immunosuppression regimen including
      extended-release tacrolimus and azathioprine (which is dosed once daily as opposed to the
      twice daily dosing required for azathioprine's alternative mycophenolate mofetil) have not
      been conducted.

      Of note, and even though twice-daily mycophenolate has been shown to be superior to
      once-daily azathioprine early post-transplant, more long-term data suggest that this
      advantage may not persist.6 Furthermore, a recent Cochrane review addressed the question of
      mycophenolate versus azathioprine as primary anti-proliferative immunosuppression for kidney
      transplant recipients; it concluded that &quot;balancing the benefits and harms of the two drugs
      remains a major task of the transplant physician to decide which agent&quot; is appropriate for
      the individual patient. 7 Moreover, once-daily immunosuppression with tacrolimus
      extended-release and once-daily azathioprine has been used with excellent results at a
      British center that focusses on AYA kidney transplant recipients.

    <measure>Health-Related Quality of Life: as assessed by change in PedsQL</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0, Day 60, Day 210</time_frame>
    <description>Pediatric Quality of Life (PedsQL) Transplant Module Version 3.0 will be used to assess quality of life prior to and after transition from twice to once daily immunosuppressant medication regimen. Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) has been defined as an individual's subjective experience of their illness, and the impact that illness and its treatment have on the individual's functioning in a variety of domains. The PedsQL is a 46-item self- and parent-report measure that rates HRQOL in 8 domains (medication adherence, medication side-effects, social relationship, physical discomfort, worries regarding health status, treatment anxiety, impact on appearance, and communication). The PedsQL Transplant Module assesses physical functioning, emotional functioning, social functioning, and school functioning and was developed through focus groups, cognitive interviews, pretesting, and field testing measurement development protocols. Higher scores indicate lower problems.</description>

    <description>Tacrolimus trough goals between 4-7ng/mL as per Transplant Immunosuppression Protocols. Student T-test, repeated measures for parametric data).
The standard deviation of tacrolimus troughs will be calculated from the 4 tacrolimus trough values obtained for clinical care purposes preceding Study Visit 1 (SD1). The standard deviation of tacrolimus troughs will be calculated again from the 4 tacrolimus trough values obtained for clinical care purposes preceding Study Visit 4 (SD2).</description>

    <time_frame>Day 0, Day 60, Day 210</time_frame>
    <description>17 item scale that corresponds to the Parent Medication Barriers Scale (PMBS) with 16 items. Both have strong internal consistency and are scored on a 5-point Likert scale from Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree. A total score can be calculated, and there are subdomains of disease frustration/adolescent issues, regimen adaptation/cognitive issues, and ingestion issues, with an additional parent reminder domain on the PMBS. Lower scores indicate less barriers to medication adherence.</description>

    <measure>Adherence to medical therapies and medications: as assessed by Change in The Medical Adherence Measure (MAM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0, Day 60, Day 210</time_frame>
    <description>Semi-structured interview that has four general modules to assess adherence with medication, diet, exercise, and clinic attendance, as well as illness-specific modules. For the purpose of this study, the Medication and Clinic Attendance Modules will be completed. Non-adherence scores can be calculated based on the degree of adherence on a spectrum of 0%-100% adherent to capture the fluctuations and intricacies of occasional or slightly inconsistent adherence. Missed adherence score = number of doses missed out of the doses prescribed × 100%. Late adherence score = number of doses taken late out of the doses prescribed × 100%, where late is defined as greater than one hour later than the usual routine. Adherence is assessed for each medication separately and then averaged across medications.</description>

    <description>Markers of graft function will be assessed by measuring levels of serum creatinine and urinary protein. Lower serum creatinine and urinary protein indicate better long-term graft and patient survival.</description>
