    <textblock>
      The clinical trial is a phase 1, single-arm trial that will evaluate the safety of the
      investigational treatment on pancreatic cancer in patients who have an inherited, deleterious
      BRCA1 or BRCA2 genetic alteration. The investigational treatment will involve 2 cycles of a
      combination of intravenous melphalan, BCNU, low-dose I.V. ethanol, vitamin B12b, and vitamin
      C in association with autologous hematopoietic stem cell infusion. A dose-escalation schedule
      will be employed for vitamin C

    <textblock>
      In the current clinical trial, participants with BRCA-related metastatic pancreatic cancer
      will receive a combination of melphalan, BCNU, low-dose ethanol, vitamin B12b, and vitamin C
      in conjunction with autologous stem cell infusion. The drug combination is designed to
      address multiple mechanisms of melphalan resistance. The purpose of the ethanol is the
      protection of RBC catalase activity.

      Investigational Treatment Description:

        -  Hematopoietic Stem Cell Collection

             1. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and if needed Plerixafor, will be used to
                mobilize bone marrow stem cells, which will be collected by apheresis.

             2. At least 2 bags of CD34+ cells, each containing at least 2 × 10^6 cells/kg, will be
                prepared and stored.

             3. Mobilization of hematopoietic stem cells will only occur prior to the first cycle
                of investigational therapy.

             4. If there is not a sufficient mobilization of stem cells for at least 2 cycles of
                chemotherapy, then no investigational drugs will be given.

        -  Investigational Drug Therapy and Stem Cell Infusion

             1. All subjects will receive two cycles of investigational drug therapy with stem cell
                infusion unless precluded by adverse reactions.

             2. Subjects will receive on day −2:

                  1. Melphalan (100 mg/m^2 I.V.).

                  2. BCNU (150 mg/m^2 I.V.).

                  3. Vitamin B12b (1450 mg/m^2 I.V.).

                  4. Vitamin C (a dose-escalation schedule will be employed beginning with 3 g/m^2
                     I.V. and escalating to a maximum of 8 g/m^2 I.V.).

                  5. Ethanol (3.5 g/m^2 I.V. as cosolvent with the BCNU infusion, followed by 0.5
                     g/h I.V. for 23 h).

             3. On day 0, at least 2 × 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg will be infused as per the institution's
                standard procedures.

             4. Subjects will receive supportive care as per the institution's standard procedures
                before, during, and after the investigational drug therapy and stem cell infusion.

        -  Additional Cycles a. Subjects will receive a second cycle of the investigational
           treatment described immediately above in &quot;Investigational Drug Therapy and Stem Cell
           Infusion,&quot; with an interval of approximately 6 weeks between cycles.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria

          -  18 years ≤ age &lt; 64 years when eligibility pre-screening begins.

          -  Expected survival time ≥ 6 months.

          -  Life expectancy not severely limited by diseases other than malignancy.

          -  Karnofsky score ≥ 60%

          -  Potential subjects must have an inherited BRCA1 and or BRCA2 mutation (or both),
             confirmed by Myriad's BRACAnalysis CDx test, and the mutation must be known to be
             deleterious or suspected to cause functional impairment.

          -  Pathologically confirmed ductal adenocarcinoma.

          -  Stage IV (based on AJCC staging guidelines) at the time of enrollment.

             a. Note that potential subjects with stage IV cancer that have had a complete response
             from prior chemotherapy are still potentially eligible.

          -  Absence of malignant ascites.

          -  The estimated volume of metastatic tumor burden (not taking into account lymph node
             lesions or the primary tumor) based on CT imaging must be ≤ 20 ml (with a margin of
             error of +25% or +5 ml) as assessed by the core imaging laboratory.

               1. The following steps will be used to calculate the volume of each metastasis
                  (other than lymph node lesions):

                    1. Measure the metastasis in 3-D and determine the maximum transverse diameter
                       (L), perpendicular diameter (W), and craniocaudal height (H).

                    2. Apply the formula for the volume of an ellipsoid, V = L x W x H x 0.52.

               2. The estimated volume of metastatic tumor burden will be the sum of those
                  estimated volumes.

          -  Prior treatment with a platinum-based therapy is required with (1) no evidence of
             disease progression and (2) objective evidence of a response by at least one of the
             following:

               1. Normalization or a confirmed decrease in an elevated tumor marker of ≥ 50%.

               2. A partial or complete response by RECIST version 1.1 criteria.

               3. Pathological evidence of a response (Evans Grade III or IV or College of American
                  Pathologists Grade 0 or 1).

          -  The platinum-based therapy must be the last chemotherapy received by the subject.

          -  No chemotherapy within 3 weeks of enrollment.

          -  If a potential subject has had surgical resection of the primary tumor, then that
             potential subject must be at least 28 days post-op with the surgical wounds healed and
             significant complications resolved.

          -  No evidence of disease progression between the time of surgical resection of the
             primary tumor and screening for enrollment if the patient is seeking enrollment in the
             immediate post-surgery period.

          -  Prior surgical resection of the primary tumor is allowed but not required.

             from the time of signing of the informed consent through 6 months after the last dose

               2. Practice true abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual
                  lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation,
                  symptothermal, post-ovulation methods, and withdrawal) are not acceptable methods
                  of contraception.

             do one of the following from the time of signing of the informed consent through 6
             months after the last dose of melphalan:

               1. Practice effective barrier contraception, plus a second method of effective
                  contraception.

               2. Practice true abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual
                  lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation,
                  symptothermal, post-ovulation methods, and withdrawal) are not acceptable methods
                  of contraception.
