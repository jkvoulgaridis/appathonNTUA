      A Phase I-II, First-in-Human Study of SKB264 in Patients with Locally Advanced
      Unresectable/Metastatic Solid Tumors who are refractory to Available Standard Therapies.
      Patient must have historically documented, incurable, locally advanced or metastatic cancer
      that are refractory to standard therapies of one of the following types:

      i. Ovarian epithelial cancer (Phase I only) ii. Gastric adenocarcinoma (Phase I-II) iii.
      Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (Phase I-II) iv. Triple negative breast cancer (Phase I only) v.
      Bladder cancer (Phase I-II)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, Phase I-II, first in human (FIH) study for SKB264 as monotherapy in
      patients who have locally advanced unresectable or metastatic solid tumor that is refractory
      to all standard therapies. TROP2 (trophoblast antigen 2) assessments will not be performed
      prior to enrollment but it will be assessed retrospectively. Confirmation of TROP2
      (trophoblast antigen 2) expression by immunohistology or other means is not required, but the
      Sponsor will request fresh tumor biopsy or tissue specimens from archived materials for
      determination of TROP2 (trophoblast antigen 2) expression retrospectively. The patient must
      be, in the judgment of the investigator, an appropriate candidate for experimental therapy
      whose tumor is refractory to standard therapies. Patients will receive study drug as a single
      IV infusion at the prescribed dose level at each administration. Cycles will continue until
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The study is divided into 2 parts (Phase I and
      Phase II).

             iv. Triple negative breast cancer v. Bladder cancer

             Note: Confirmation of TROP2 expression by immunohistology or other means is not
             required, but the Sponsor will request tissue specimens from archived materials or
             fresh tumor biopsy for determination of TROP2 expression retrospectively.

          4. Measurable or evaluable disease by CT/MRI during dose escalation.

          5. Patients should have an unresectable locally advanced or metastatic solid tumor that

          7. Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dL (Patients with known Gilbert disease who have serum
             bilirubin level ≤ 3 ×ULN may be enrolled)., aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine
             aminotransferase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN),

               -  Oral contraception should always be combined with an additional contraceptive
                  method because of a potential interaction with the study drug. The same rules are
