        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of high grade osteosarcoma

          2. Refractory or relapsed osteosarcoma after 1 to 2 prior systemic treatments

          5. Lansky play score greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 50 Percent (%) or Karnofsky
             Performance Status score &gt;=50%. Use Karnofsky for participants &gt;=16 years of age and
             Lansky for participants less than (&lt;)16 years of age. Participants who are unable to
             walk because of paralysis, but who are up in a wheelchair, will be considered
             ambulatory for the purpose of assessing the performance score

          6. Adequate organ function per blood work

          7. Adequate cardiac function as evidenced by left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)
             &gt;=50% at baseline as determined by echocardiography

          8. Adequately controlled blood pressure (BP) with or without antihypertensive
             medications, defined as:

             BP &lt;95th percentile for sex, age, and height/length at screening (as per National
             Heart Lung and Blood Institute guidelines) and no change in antihypertensive
             medications within 1 week prior to Cycle 1 Day 1. Participants &gt;18 years of age should
             have BP less than or equal to (&lt;=) 150/90 millimeters of Mercury at screening and no
             change in antihypertensive therapy within 1 week prior to Cycle 1 Day 1

          9. Washout before Cycle 1 Day 1 of 3 weeks in case of prior chemotherapy, 6 weeks if
             treatment included nitrosoureas; 4 weeks for definitive radiotherapy, 2 weeks for
             palliative radiotherapy; and 3 months from high-dose chemotherapy and stem cell
             rescue. Participants must have recovered [to Grade &lt;=1, except for alopecia,
             ototoxicity, and Grade &lt;=2 peripheral neuropathy, per common terminology criteria for
             adverse events (CTCAE) v5.0] from the acute toxic effects of all prior anticancer
             therapy before Cycle 1 Day 1

             at least 2 weeks before Cycle 1 Day 1

          3. Active second malignancy within 2 years prior to enrollment ([in addition to
             osteosarcoma], but not including definitively treated superficial melanoma,
             carcinoma-in-situ, basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin)

          4. Has had major surgery within 3 weeks prior to Cycle 1 Day 1. Note: Adequate wound
             healing after major surgery must be assessed clinically, independent of time elapsed
             for eligibility

          5. A clinically significant electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormality, including a marked
             baseline prolonged QT or QTc interval (example, a repeated demonstration of a QTc
             interval greater than [&gt;] 480 millisecond [msec])

          6. Gastrointestinal malabsorption, gastrointestinal anastomosis, or any other condition
             that in the opinion of the investigator might affect the absorption of lenvatinib

          8. Gastrointestinal bleeding or active hemoptysis (bright red blood of at least 1 divided
             [/] by 2 teaspoon) within 3 weeks prior to Cycle 1 Day 1

          9. Radiographic evidence of intratumoral cavitation, encasement, or invasion of a major
             blood vessel. Additionally, the degree of proximity to major blood vessels should be
             considered for exclusion because of the potential risk of severe hemorrhage associated
             with tumor shrinkage/necrosis after lenvatinib therapy

         10. History of ifosfamide-related Grade &gt;=3 nephrotoxicity or encephalopathy
