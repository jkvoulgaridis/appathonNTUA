  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with bronchiectasis and age-matched healthy controls will be evaluated with
      sit-to-stand test and six-minute walk test and utilization of STST in determining functional
      capacity will be investigated.

    <textblock>
      Bronchiectasis (BE) is a chronic condition which is characterized by the permanent abnormal
      widening of the bronchi as a result of repetitive airway infections and inflammation.
      Disabling cough and shortness of breath, excess mucus production, progressive airway
      obstruction and loss of skeletal muscle mass are the primary factors that impairs exercise
      tolerance in BE patients. Imaging modalities and pulmonary function test are insufficient to
      determine disease burden or the prognosis thus it is stated that exercise tolerance and
      quality of life should also be evaluated in these patients.

      Exercise tolerance can be evaluated using cardiopulmonary exercise test by directly measuring
      oxygen consumption but the field tests such as six-minute walk test (6MWT), shuttle walk test
      or stair climbing tests also provides reliable data on exercise tolerance by measuring
      functional capacity. Among field tests, 6MWT is the most commonly used test for evaluating
      functional capacity in cardiopulmonary patients. Although 6MWT is easy to apply and does not
      require any special equipment, it still requires a 30-m long corridor and a total testing
      time of approx. 20 minutes considering the pre- and post-test resting periods which may
      impair its feasibility in some clinical settings.

      Sit-to-stand test (STST) is firstly developed for older population to measure mobility
      related function and physical performance. Today, it is widely used in various populations
      including cardiopulmonary diseases such as cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease and heart failure. The investigator's aim in this study is to investigate whether
      STST is utilizable for evaluating functional capacity in children with BE.
