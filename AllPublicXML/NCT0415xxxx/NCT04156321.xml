      Background (brief):

        1. Burden:

           Bangladesh has a population of 29.5 million adolescents, which represents nearly
           one-fifth of the country's total population. Adequate nutrition during this critical age
           period is key, and is associated with improved health and development of the future
           adult population, as well as that of their future off-spring bringing potential
           inter-generational benefits. Yet, adolescents are known to face multiple nutritional
           challenges related to persistent undernutrition and micronutrient deficiencies as well
           as rapidly rising overweight and obesity due to inadequate and inappropriate nutritional
           practice. A large percentage of adolescents in Bangladesh consume an inadequate diet in
           terms of energy content, nutrient density and diversity. To alleviate micronutrient
           deficiency, Moringa oleifera leaves can be used in their daily diet with a traditional
           manner. It contains substantial amount of protein &amp; several essential micronutrients for
           growth.

        2. Knowledge gap:

           Although, adolescence has been identified as a 'second window of opportunity&quot; for
           correcting nutritional inadequacies and insufficient growth from childhood, however,
           they face multiple nutritional challenges related to persistent undernutrition and
           micronutrient deficiencies, particularly in resource poor countries like Bangladesh.

        3. Relevance:

           About 80% of kilocalories per capita per day in Bangladesh are from micronutrient-poor
           foods, and 70% are from rice alone (75% for rural adolescents). A study on pregnant
           adolescent women showed that around 60% had low or medium dietary diversity. Among the
           major food groups, the routine diet of a Bangladeshi adolescent particularly lacks in
           protein in terms of both animal source like eggs, dairy products and plant source like
           legumes and nuts. Daily consumption of vitamin A-rich vegetables and fruits (other than
           dark-green leafy vegetables) are also inadequate. Such inadequate diet is reflected by
           various health outcomes. The prevalence of low Body Mass Index is 31% among
           married-adolescents of 15-19 years old. 13% of the adolescents are short in stature.

           Moringa leaves have a high amount of protein, and vitamins A &amp; C, calcium, iron,
           potassium and zinc. It is well-known and easily cultivable in Bangladesh with limited
           resource. The high nutrient content of the leaves make it suitable to bring
           transformative changes in diet and feeding practices within the purchasing capacity of
           marginalized people due to its availability and affordability. Our proposed approach
           will assess the impact of locally available, affordable and culturally accepted Moringa
           leaves consumption into adolescent's regular diet to improve their nutritional status as
           a whole.

        4. Hypothesis (if any):

           150 gm of Sajna shak /bora (Moringa) 5 days/week) will improve haemoglobin and vitamin A
           status of the adolescent girls after 6 months of consumption.

        5. Objectives:

           The study objectives are as below:

           1.1 Primary: To assess the effect of consumption of Sajna shak/bora (Moringa) on
           haemoglobin and vitamin A status among the adolescent girls after 6 months of
           consumption 1.2 Secondary: Assess the effect of Sajna shak/bora (Moringa) on adolescent
           weight gain after 6 months of consumption

        6. Methods:

           This will be a school-based trial. Group I (intervention) will receive 150 gm of Sajna
           shak/bora (Moringa) added with 25 gm concenstrated dal with 100 gm of rice as
           mid-morning snack in selected school 5 times a week for 6 months along with nutrition
           education. Group II (Control) will rice, concenstrated dal and potato vaji. Both groups
           will recieve calorie matched meal (411 kcal). Baseline and endline survey will be
           conducted. Blood sample will be collected at the baseline, at end of 3 months and at the
           endline. Compliance will be measured through on-spot feeding. Data on feeding, morbidity
           and anthropometry (height and weight) will be collected bi-monthly.

        7. Outcome measures/variables:

      Primary outcomes: Changes in 2 biochemical markers (haemoglobin and vitamin A).

    <description>Peripheral blood samples will be collected from all participants from both intervention and control groups. Blood samples collected will be labelled with a bar-coded identification label specifically created for this study, and corresponding to study subject identification number. In this way, the laboratory could easily identify, which particular clusters are to be tested in a batch and thus minimizing the possibilities of increasing freeze/thaw cycles. A sample record/hBandover form will be filled up indicating name of the participants, ID number, sample ID number, and type of analysis to be done. The samples will be carried to the nutritional biochemistry laboratory in Dhaka in temperature controlled cooler box. Samples will be received at the laboratory and stored in a -70‚Å∞C freezer and analyzed to estimate the blood parameters. Mean hemoglobin level (gm/dl) and serum level of retinol (mmol/l) will be measured at baseline ,3 months and after 6 months of intervention.</description>

    <description>Trained staff will collect anthropometric measurements (weight in kg and height in cm) monthly using established methods. Measurement would be taken at baseline, every 2 months thereafter for 6 months. Weight will be measured with minimal clothing and without any shoes and accessories in kilograms using portable Tania scale with an accuracy of accuracy of 100 g. Height will be measured at cm with height meter with 1 mm accuracy. The entire instrument will be calibrated every morning with a standard weight and height board accordingly, prior to data collection. These measurements will be standardized before and during the data collection. For our analysis of BMI status, all BMI data will be converted and categorized according to WHO cutoff points. Using the WHO BMI-for-age growth chart for girls ages 5 to 19 years, normal weight, overweight (&gt;+1 SD, equivalent to BMI 25 kg/m obese (&gt;+2 SD, equivalent to BMI 30 kg/m2 each study.</description>

    <description>School Tiffin:
Each of the adolescent girls will receive fresh Moringa leaves (150 gram) cooked in a traditional manner as Sajna shak (stir-fried)/ bora with rice and concentrated dal once daily for 5 days during tiffin time. Sajna Stir fry and bora will be given on every alternative day. Standard questionnaire will be used to measure the compliance of food. As we are serving the food in school premises during tiffin period, it would be both unethical and socially unacceptable if few of the students from a section receive the meal. Therefore, all the students from selected section/sections will receive the daily meal. However, we will only collect information from the selected study participants who would give consent to participate in the study Each of the combination of tiffin meal will supply 411 calories in the both arm .</description>
