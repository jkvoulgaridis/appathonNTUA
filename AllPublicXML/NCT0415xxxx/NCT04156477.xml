  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship, if any, between markers of satiety,
      desire to eat, hunger, and metabolic markers of the regulation hereof during ketosis as
      compared with a Glucose-containing and a Placebo drink adjusted for taste.

    <textblock>
      All subjects are, in random order, tested on three separate occasions with intake of weight
      adjusted and taste matched drink of i) a ketone ester, and ii) an isocaloric and -volumetric
      glucose drink, or iii) an isovolumetric tap water drink.

      Subjects are studied for five hours with baseline and blood sampling on multiple occasions. A
      satiety questionaire are included.

      Subjects are recruited through notice on website for this purpose. Sample size calculations
      were performed prior to inclusion (n=10). According to protocolized statistical plan, missing
      data will not be replaced and no imputation will occur. Data will be analyzed by applying a
      repeated measurements multilevel model with intervention, time and their interactions as
      categorical factors. Effects size are adjusted for small sample size.

    <masking_description>All subjects are, in random order, tested on three separate occasions with intake of weight adjusted and taste matched drink of i) a ketone ester (HVMN Ketone, 38 Mason St, 3rd Floor, San Francisco, CA 94102, USA) and ii) an isocaloric and -volumetric glucose drink, or iii) an isovolumetric tap water drink. Taste matching for the latter two are done by adding of a bitterness additive (Bitrex, Integriertes Trademarketing GmbH Herderstraße 16, 23564 Lübeck, Germany) with additional adding Stevia (Bodylab Stevia Drops; Bodylab,Plastvænget 3D, 9650 Hadsund, Denmark) for the tap water drink. Subjects will subsequently drink 50 mL of zero-calorie drink (Gatorade (Gatorade Company, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) in order to eliminate any remaining flavour of the intervention drinks.</masking_description>
