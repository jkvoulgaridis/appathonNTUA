  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endometriosis is a benign disease that affects 6-10% of women of reproductive age. The wide
      range of symptoms observed in patients with endometriosis is due to implantation of
      endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity. This ectopic endometrium is subjected to
      cyclic changes similar to that of eutopic endometrium. Typically, ectopic lesions are found
      in the pelvis, notably on the ovaries in the form of cysts (endometriomas), as well as the
      rectouterine and vesicouterine pouch. Lesions have also been described in other parts of the
      abdomen and in other locations outside the abdominal cavity.

      Although endometriosis has also been described in asymptomatic patients, possible symptoms
      range from mild to severe pain presenting itself as dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, or dyschezia,
      or as infertility. Since the clinical picture varies, the treatment of this disease has
      become quite personalized. Many studies conducted over the past several years have presented
      different treatment options for the symptoms caused by endometriosis.

      Turmeric, which is won from the rootstalks of Curcuma longa, has more than 300 biologically
      active elements. One of the three main curcuminoids that are derived from turmeric, is
      curcumin. Several in-vitro and animal studies have described anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory
      and anti-angiogenic effects of curcumin.

      The main objective for the treatment of endometriosis patients is symptom relief. Treatment
      options include analgesic therapies, hormonal therapies, laparoscopic surgery or a
      combination of these. For patients who refuse hormonal therapies however, conservative
      treatment options are limited.

      Curcuma is a substance that has been in use for centuries, especially in ayurvedic and
      Traditional Chinese Medicine for the treatment of various symptoms, notably for pain
      alleviation in inflammatory illnesses. Several recently published studies have shown very
      promising results of Flexofytol for pain alleviation in patients with osteoarthritis, due to
      its anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties. Due to these properties of curcuma, we aim
      to analyse if curcuma capsules, sold by the pharmaceutical company Tilman under the name
      Flexofytol®, can be used to alleviate symptoms in patients suffering from endometriosis.
