    <textblock>
      The aim of the current clinical trial was to evaluate the effects of premolar extractions
      compared with non-extraction orthodontic treatment on the skeletal vertical dimension of the
      face.

      The null-hypothesis is that there is no difference in post-treatment skeletal vertical
      characteristics of normodivergent and hyperdivergent patients treated orthodontically with
      first premolar extractions compared with patients treated in non-extraction manner.

      The current protocol will be submitted for partial fulfillment of the PhD requirements in
      Faculty of Dentistry, Cairo University.

      The trial will be conducted in the outpatient clinic of the Orthodontic Department, Faculty
      of Dentistry, Cairo University.

      Primary examination and diagnosis of the patients seeking orthodontic treatment will be
      performed, to select a sample of the trial.

      then, final diagnosis and planing of each participant will be performed by a trained
      orthodontists to be sure that all patients fallen with the inclusion criteria.

      Interventions will be conducted with the same orthodontist, under supervision of orthodontic
      professors in the Orthodontic department, Cairo University.
