  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective clinical study on adult patients (18 years or more) with biological
      therapy for severe asthma at the Helsinki University Central Hospital (HUCH). This is a
      real-life study with a broader patient population than in a randomized controlled trial.
      Omalizumab has been used for treatment of asthma in HUCH since January 2009, anti-IL5
      therapies starting with mepolizumab since April 2016.

      The investigators collect and analyse results of anti-IL5/IL5R and anti-IgE therapies in
      asthma until October 2019.The investigators compare number of exacerbations, number of
      glucocorticoid courses, dose of per oral glucocorticoid, number of antibiotic courses, need
      of emergency care and hospitalizations because of asthma before use of biologicals and at the
      latest visits of the participants when using biologicals.
