  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine the effect of an acute maximal exercise on serum uncoupling
      protein-1, irisin, interleukin 6 levels, and on blood lipid and lipoprotein concentrations.
      This study also evaluates the role of uncoupling protein-1-3826 A/G polymorphism on this
      eventual effect.

      Therefore, this study hypothesizes that:

      H01: Sedentary people and athletes' serum uncoupling protein 1, irisin, and interleukine 6
      levels are different before and after an acute maximal exercise.

      H02: Sedentary people and athletes' basal serum uncoupling protein 1 levels are associated
      with uncoupling protein 1-3826 A/G polymorphism.

      H03: Uncoupling protein 1-3826 A/G polymorphism has a modifying role in the effect of maximal
      exercise on serum uncoupling protein 1 levels.

      H04: Sedentary people and athletes' basal serum lipid and lipoprotein levels are associated
      with uncoupling protein 1-3826 A/G polymorphism.

      H05: Uncoupling protein 1-3826 A / G polymorphism has a modifying role in the effect of
      maximal exercise on serum lipid and lipoprotein levels.
