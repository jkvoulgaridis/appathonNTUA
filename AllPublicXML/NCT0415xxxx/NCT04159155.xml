    <textblock>
      This a phase II and III study whose purpose is to compare how long various treatment regimens
      can keep the cancer from worsening or coming back in people with serous or p53 abnormal
      endometrial cancer.

      The study is divided into three cohorts: Early stage cohort, advanced stage cohort, and
      exploratory cohort. Each cohort will have different arms to examine different treatment
      regimens to determine the best regimen for each cohort.

      The study will enroll participants into the early stage cohort at this time. The early stage
      cohort will compare the following treatments after standard of care surgery:

        -  Adjuvant chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel alone

        -  Adjuvant radiation therapy and chemotherapy with cisplatin, followed by chemotherapy
           with carboplatin and paclitaxel.

    <textblock>
      There is currently no standard or usual treatment for serous or p53 abnormal endometrial
      cancer after standard surgery. Additional treatment may sometimes be given after the main
      treatment in hopes of preventing the cancer from worsening or coming back (called adjuvant
      therapy).

      It is not fully know whether adjuvant therapy after surgery is useful in early stage
      endometrial cancer. It is also not known what the best adjuvant therapy after surgery is. The
      most commonly given adjuvant therapy is chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel.
      Sometimes, chemotherapy and radiation therapy may be given. There is not enough information
      available as to how useful adjuvant therapy is and what the most useful type of treatment is.
      This study will look at adjuvant chemotherapy alone compared with adjuvant radiation therapy
      and chemotherapy, after standard of care surgery, in patients with serous or p53 abnormal
      endometrial cancer.
