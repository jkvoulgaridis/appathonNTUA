  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this project is to examine the effect of combining theta burst
      stimulation (TBS) and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) on cocaine craving and brain response to
      cocaine-related images.

    <description>N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is a medication that is used to treat paracetamol (acetaminophen) overdose, and to loosen thick mucus in individuals with cystic fibrosis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It has a long-established safety record in adults and children, with FDA approval since 1963. The side effects most commonly noted in people who take NAC by mouth include diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and headache. These side effects are usually mild and go away even with continued use of NAC by mouth. There is also a risk of a skin reaction, such as flushing, itching, or rash. A meta-analysis of studies evaluating long-term oral treatment with NAC for prevention of chronic bronchitis found that NAC was well tolerated, with generally mild, most commonly gastrointestinal adverse effects that did not require treatment interruption.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        1. Age 18-65 2. English fluency 4. Meet criteria for cocaine use disorder (CUD), as
        determined by DSM-V criteria, using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-V.

        5. Enrolled in an intensive outpatient treatment program (MUSC Center for Drug and Alcohol
        Programs Intensive Outpatient Program (CDAP-IOP) or currently engaged in treatment for
        substance related problems.

        6. Able to read and understand questionnaires and informed consent 7. Lives within 50 miles
        of the study site. 8. Is not at elevated risk of seizure (i.e., does not have a history of
        seizures, is not currently prescribed medications known to lower seizure threshold) 9. Does
        not have metal objects in the head/neck. 10. Does not have a history of traumatic brain
        injury, including a head injury that resulted in hospitalization, loss of consciousness for
        more than 10 minutes, or having ever been informed that they have an epidural, subdural, or
        subarachnoid hemorrhage.

        11. Does not have a history of claustrophobia leading to significant clinical anxiety
        symptoms.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Past head injury or primary neurological disorder associated with MRI abnormalities,
             including dementia, MCI, brain tumors, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, or demyelinating
             diseases

          2. Any physical or intellectual disability affecting completion of assessments

          3. Any contraindication to MRI

             potential must agree to undergo a pregnancy test 72 hours prior to the fMRI scanning
             session and regularly before and during the medication trial. They must further agree
             to notify the study physician or PA if they become pregnant during the study.

          7. Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment (CIWA-Ar) scale will be used to assess
             alcohol withdrawal. Individuals with CIWA &gt; 8 will be excluded.

             infarction)

          9. Has current suicidal ideation or homicidal ideation.

         10. Has the need for maintenance or acute treatment with any psychoactive medication
             including anti-seizure medications and medications for ADHD

         11. Suffers from chronic migraines

         12. Any physical or intellectual disability affecting completion of assessments
