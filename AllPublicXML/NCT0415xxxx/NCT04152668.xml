  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Erythritol is a natural sugar alcohol (a four-carbon polyol) produced by the reduction of
      erythrose. It is considered safe as food additive and has many of the functional properties
      that are important for subgingival debridement. Current evidence includes no prospective
      studies comparing the outcomes of a low abrasive erythritol air-polishing as an adjunctive
      therapy to conventional titanium and ultrasonic debridement of patients in a maintenance
      program with peri-implantitis. Thus, the main purpose of this randomized, single-masked
      controlled trial (RCT) is to assess whether low abrasive erythritol air-polishing has an
      adjunct effect to conventional non-surgical treatment of peri-implantitis.

      This RCT will enroll subjects among patients in need for non-surgical treatment of
      peri-implantitis at a private dental clinic in Stavanger, Norway. Forty patients diagnosed
      with peri-implantitis on at least one implant will be randomly allocated by tossing a coin
      into test or control group. Patients with cement-retained and screw-retained
      supraconstructions will be included.

      Treatment of peri-implantitis will be performed by one operator (AS) at baseline, 3-, 6-, 9-
      and 12-month follow-up visits. Local anesthesia will be used when needed. In the test group,
      implants will be treated with titanium curette, ultrasonic device and a specially designed
      nozzle mounted on a hand piece (Perio-Flow) connected to an airflow unit.

      In the control group, implant with peri-implantitis will be debrided with titanium curette
      and ultrasonic device only. Test and control debridement will be performed without time
      limit. The treatment will continue until the operator is judging the implant surface to be
      free for supra- and subgingival deposits.
