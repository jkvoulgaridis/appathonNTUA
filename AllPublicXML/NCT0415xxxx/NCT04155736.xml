  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the acceptability and efficacy of a self-guided
      behavioral health tool delivered by mobile app (called &quot;Renew&quot;) for people who are
      experiencing symptoms of posttraumatic stress. This study also aims to determine the
      necessity of coaching support over and above support from peers, shedding light on the
      critical question of level of support resources needed to maintain mHealth app engagement.

    <description>Users will be assigned a study staff member as a support person who is notified when the user engages with the app or if they have not engaged for 7 days. Support persons are provided with psychoeducation material including information about how to be an effective support person for the user and direct messaging capacity to respond to app notifications about user engagement (e.g., user earned X points, user achieved a new level).</description>

    <description>Renew is a behavioral health self-management app/too that focuses on three core activities: 1) in vivo exposure (to help participants approach safe situations they have been avoiding that they want to feel comfortable in), 2) expressive writing (to help participants emotionally process trauma memories), and 3) Self-Care exercises (designed to promote behavioral activation, social connectedness and relaxation; includes a breathing relaxation tool). Users have access to psychoeducation via a whiteboard video and short texts as well as Motivation content (quotes, videos, images, and songs) related to confronting challenges and overcoming fears. For each exercise that is completed, the user earns points that are connected to levels and visually reinforcing images (i.e., a growing tree).</description>
