  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study is focused on estimating the impact of a tele-sleep intervention on
      patient-centered outcomes relevant to former football players, including a) sleep duration,
      quality, and daytime impairment; b) pain, pain catastrophizing, physical and emotional
      functioning; c) mood; d) quality of life, with the longer-term goal to evaluate the impact on
      cardiovascular health risk. The evidence-based 'Brief Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia' (BBTI)
      will be utilized and tailored it to meet the needs of former football players.

      This pilot work will serve as the foundation for a larger, future clinical trial that
      utilizes a durable approach for improving sleep health with potential influence pain and
      quality of life as well as future studies to evaluate the implementation and scalability of
      BBTI in novel populations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will plan to enroll 40 participants. Players will be recruited from the
      Harvard Football Players Health Study cohort from across the US via email and telephone
      invitations. Following screening, if the participant is eligible and interested, they may
      consent to enroll in the study. Participants will receive evidence-based 'Brief Behavioral
      Therapy for Insomnia' (BBTI), tailored to meet the needs of former football players. BBTi is
      a brief, efficacious treatment that focuses on modifying behaviors, rather than cognitive
      domains. The treatment emphasizes education, motivational tools, and specific behavioral
      recommendations (e.g., restricting time in bed). BBTI has been previously delivered remotely
      and this intervention will be delivered by phone by sleep interventionists including trained
      social workers, psychologists, and nurse practitioners. Participants will complete an intake
      session with their interventionist followed by a 'treatment session' a week later wherein the
      interventionist will provide education about sleep regulation and create an individualized
      schedule of sleep/wake times for the participant. This will be followed by 3 brief weekly
      check-in calls to review progress, address questions and concerns, and adjust the behavioral
      treatment plan as the participant progresses. The participant will complete a daily sleep
      diary throughout the intervention to inform the treatment. Participants will also complete
      baseline, endpoint and follow-up questionnaires to assess outcomes and intervention
      acceptability and feasibility. Participants will receive compensation for their
      participation.

    <time_frame>Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>PROMIS Sleep Impairment measures self-reported perceptions of alertness, sleepiness, and tiredness during usual waking hours, and the perceived functional impairments during wakefulness associated with sleep problems or impaired alertness during the past seven days. The measure includes 8-items with higher scores indicating greater sleep impairment. The minimum score is 8 and the maximum score 40.

    <time_frame>Week 0 vs. Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Previous 'Brief Behavioral Treatment for Insomnia' interventions have defined response to treatment as a change in the PSQI score of ≥3 points (Buysse, 2011). The PSQI, or the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, is a validated instrument which assesses self-reported sleep quality and disturbances over a 1-month interval. The minimum score is 0 and maximum score is 21. Higher scores indicate worse sleep quality.</description>

    <measure>Insomnia Severity Index, ISI (Endpoint)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The Insomnia Severity Index is a 7-item self-report questionnaire assessing the nature, severity, and impact of insomnia in the last month. A 5-point Likert scale is used to rate each item (e.g., 0 = no problem; 4 = very severe problem), yielding a total score ranging from 0 to 28. The total score is interpreted as follows: absence of insomnia (0-7); sub-threshold insomnia (8-14); moderate insomnia (15-21); and severe insomnia (22-28).</description>
