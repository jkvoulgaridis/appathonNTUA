        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  18-75 years old;

          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic or
             unresectable gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma. GEJ
             adenocarcinoma may be classified according to Siewert's classification type I, II, or
             III

          -  Histological documentation of local recurrence or metastasis is strongly encouraged,
             unless the risk of such a procedure outweighs the potential benefit of confirming the
             metastatic disease.

          -  If no histologic confirmation, then the metastases or recurrence will require
             documentation by a 2nd radiographic procedure (eg. PET/CT scan or MRI in addition to
             the CT scan). If the imaging procedure does not confirm recurrent or metastatic
             disease, biopsy confirmation will be required.

          -  Patients must have ascites or peritoneal carcinomatosis confirmed by image (CT or MR
             or US or others) operation.

          -  Patients may have received no prior chemotherapy for metastatic or unresectable
             disease. Patients may have received prior adjuvant therapy (chemotherapy and/or
             chemoradiation) if more than 6 months have elapsed between the end of adjuvant therapy
             and registration.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) of 0-1;

          -  An expected survival of ≥ 3 months;

          -  Major organ function has to meet the following criteria; (1) For results of blood
             routine test:

          -  Hemoglobin (HB) ≥ 80g / L,

          -  ANC(absolute neutrophil count) ≥ 1.5 × 109 / L,

          -  PLT(blood platelet) ≥ 75 × 109 / L, (2) For results of biochemical tests:

          -  BLT（total bilirubin） ≤ 1.25 times the upper limit of normal (ULN),

          -  ALT(Alanine aminotransferase) and AST(aspartate aminotransferase ) ≤ 2.5 × ·ULN, liver
             metastases, if any, the ALT and AST≤ 5 × ULN,

          -  Serum Cr（creatinine）≤1ULN, Endogenous creatinine clearance rate ＞50ml/min;

          -  The patient has a PT（prothrombintime） (INR international normalized ratio) &lt; or = to
             1.5 and an PTT（Partial Thromboplastin Time）&lt; than or = to 3 seconds above the upper
             limits of normal if the patientia t is not on anticoagulation. ·If a patient is on
             full-dose anticoagulants, the following criteria should be met for enrollment:

          -  The patient must have an in-range INR (usually between 2 and 3) on a stable dose of
             warfarin or on stable dose of LMW(Low molecular weight) heparin

          -  The patient must not have active bleeding or pathological conditions that carry high
             risk of bleeding (e.g. tumor involving major vessels, known varices)

          -  Pregnancy test (serum or urine) has to be performed for woman of childbearing age
             within 7 days before enrolment and the test result must be negative.

          -  Men and women of childbearing potential must be willing to consent to using effective
             contraception while on treatment and for at least 3 months thereafter.

          -  Ability to understand informed consent and signing of written informed consent
             document prior to initiation of protocol therapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        - Patients who have received previous chemotherapy for the treatment of metastatic or
        unresectable gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma are ineligible.

          -  Patients who have received previous pre- or post-operative chemotherapy or
             chemoradiation are ineligible if therapy was completed less than 6 months prior to
             study registration. Patients must have recovered from adverse events from any previous
             therapy.

          -  Patients with a history of another neoplastic disease within the past three years,
             excluding basal cell carcinoma of the skin, cervical carcinoma in situ, or
             nonmetastatic prostate cancer.

          -  Patients with brain or central nervous system metastases, including leptomeningeal
             disease.

          -  Pregnant (positive pregnancy test) or breast feeding.

          -  Serious, non-healing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture.

          -  Significant cardiac disease as defined as:

        unstable angina, New York Heart Association (NYHA) grade II or greater, congestive heart
        failure, history of myocardial infarction within 6 months Evidence of bleeding diathesis or
        coagulopathy.

          -  History of a stroke or CVA within 6 months

          -  Clinically significant peripheral vascular disease.

          -  Inability to comply with study and/or follow-up procedures.

          -  Patients with any other medical condition or reason, in that investigator's opinion,
             makes the patient unstable to participate in a clinical trial.
