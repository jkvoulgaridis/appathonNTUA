  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, randomized, multi-center, comparative study. Subjects will be screened
      prior to study entry to establish eligibility. 60 Subjects who meet all the selection
      criteria will be randomly assigned to (A) QL007 200mg BID+ Tenofovir dipirofurate fumarate
      （TDF）300 mg QD, (B) QL007 200 mg BID+ Entecavir 0.5 mg QD, (C)TDF 300 mg QD, (D) Entecavir
      0.5 mg QD.

      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of QL-007 tables in
      combination with TDF or Entecavir in patients with chronic hepatitis b who have received
      nucleoside (acid) therapy, and to recommend a reasonable regimen for phase III study.

      The subjects received the drug treatment for a maximum of 96 weeks: divided into two stages:
      the first stage: 0-24 weeks as the core treatment period, 25-48 weeks as the extended
      treatment period. The second stage: 49-96 weeks is the extended treatment period. Stage 2:
      subjects in stage 1 group A and C were grouped into group E(QL-007 200 mg BID或XX mg +TDF 300
      mg QD), and subjects in group B and D were grouped into group F(QL-007 200 mg BID或XX mg +
      Entecavir 0.5 mg QD). Subjects in group E and F entered the second stage of treatment
      according to 200 mg BID. After the efficacy data of the original treatment clinical trial
      (protocol 201) determine the optimal dose of 007, all subjects entering the second phase will
      receive the optimal dose of 007 and continue treatment withTDF or Entecavir tablets (007
      XXmg+TDF or ETV) into the second phase 49-96 weeks of extended treatment.
