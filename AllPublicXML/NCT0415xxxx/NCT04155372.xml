      The purpose of the present study is to investigate the effect of different rate of fluid
      consumption on post-exercise rehydration.

    <textblock>
      The body water deficits equivalent to 2% body mass might impair performance. Due to high
      exercise intensity, thermal environment, or rule limitation, athletes often in dehydration
      status post-exercise. Thus, how to rehydrate effectively to prepare the next game is
      important. The participants arrived to the lab euhydrated and were dehydrated to 2% of body
      weight by running. After a rest, they will ingest sports drink in a volume equivalent to 150%
      of BW loss in 30 min, 60 min, or 90 min. Urine and blood sample will be collected to evaluate
      hydration status.
