    <textblock>
      This study is being done to evaluate the clinical outcomes of Relapse/Refractory Chronic
      Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) participants treated with venetoclax as routine standard of care
      in Greece. The decision to treat with venetoclax is made by the participant's physician prior
      to being offered enrollment in this study.

      The objectives of this study include determining overall response rate, assessing safety
      information, analyzing patient profiles and disease characteristics and participant quality
      of life.
