  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Every year around 70 children affected by cancer or life-threatening genetic diseases undergo
      haematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) within the Blood and Marrow Transplant (BMT) unit
      at Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH).

      One of the main goals of the BMT unit over the last decade has been to reduce the morbidity
      and mortality related to HCT, and the group has become a world-leader in pioneering less
      toxic transplants.

      Fixed high doses of chemotherapy drugs are generally used to prepare children for HCT but
      several studies have shown a correlation between the concentration of these drugs achieved in
      the patient's blood, and the success or failure of the HCT procedure.

      Recently a new drug, Treosulfan, has become available for use in patients undergoing HCT, and
      GOSH has pioneered its introduction in children undergoing HCT. With promising early results,
      Treosulfan has become the pre-HCT drug of choice, however, very little is currently known
      about how the drug is metabolised and cleared from the body, particularly in children.

      The investigators therefore plan to investigate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of
      Treosulfan in children undergoing HCT at GOSH and define which parameters affect its
      metabolism and clearance, and what blood levels are associated with a favourable outcome
      (graft take without toxicity) or a poor result (graft rejection and/or toxicity).

    <description>To measure Treosulfan PK parameteres such as maximum concentration, area under the curve and half life after the first (day -7) and third (day -5) dose of Treosulfan and study if there is any significant intrapatient and interpatient variability of these results.</description>

    <measure>2) Assess the relationship between PK parameters and patient characteristics;</measure>
    <time_frame>day -7 and -5 pre HSCT</time_frame>
    <description>To study the relationship between treosulfan PK parameters such as area under the curve, maximum concentration and half life after the 1st and 3rd administration and pre-HSCT parameters such as renal function (creatinine, urea levels) and liver function (ALT, AST, GGT, bilirubin).</description>

    <time_frame>from day -7 pre HSCT to day +100 post HSCT</time_frame>
    <description>The toxicity of the transplant will be recorded in the clinical notes and CRF forms using the NCI toxicity criteria (toxicity score for every organ/system, with a range from 1 to 5). This information will be correlated to Treosulfan PK criteria such as maximum concentration and area under the curve</description>

    <measure>4) Assess the relationship between Treosulfan PK and efficacy parameters, such as rate of engraftment and donor chimerism.</measure>
    <time_frame>from day -7 pre HSCT to day + 360 post HSCT</time_frame>
    <description>Donor engraftment in the peripheral blood (in different cell lineages: CD15+ cells and CD3+ cells) will be addressed regularly after HSCT and these results will be correlated with Treosulfan PK parameters such as area under the curve.</description>
