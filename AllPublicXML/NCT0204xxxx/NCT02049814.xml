  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of voglibose versus acarbose
      combined with metformin in participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) by evaluating
      levels of glycosylated hemoglobin.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called voglibose. Voglibose is being tested to treat
      type 2 diabetes in people who have diabetes that is inadequately controlled on metformin
      alone. This study will look at glycemic control in people who take voglibose.

      The study will enroll 494 patients. All participants will be enrolled in a 2-week screening
      phase and a metformin run-in phase. Eligible participants will be randomly assigned (by
      chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups:

        -  Metformin and Voglibose 0.2 mg

        -  Metformin and Acarbose 50 mg

      All participants will be asked to take their current dose of metformin tablets and either
      voglibose or acarbose tablets three times a day throughout the study.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in China. The overall time to participate in this
      study is up to 20 weeks and participants will make 8 visits to the clinic.
