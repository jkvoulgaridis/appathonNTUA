  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this extension study is to determine the long-term safety and tolerability of
      an investigational treatment (LUM001) in children with ALGS who have completed participation
      in a core LUM001 treatment protocol. Efficacy will be assessed by evaluating the effect of
      LUM001 on pruritus, biochemical markers of pruritus, as well as biochemical markers of
      cholestasis and liver disease.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Participation for an individual patient is expected to be approximately 72 weeks.

        Patients who complete 72 weeks of treatment may be eligible to receive treatment for up to
        52 weeks during the follow-up treatment period. Planned participation for each patient
        enrolled in the optional follow-up treatment study is 128 weeks, inclusive of a 4-week
        follow-up phone call.
