  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is primarily aimed to compare the effect and safety of electro-acupuncture and
      prucalopride for severe chronic constipation: if the short-term effect of electro-acupuncture
      is no inferior to prucalopride? Besides, the investigators will also mainly confirm the
      superiority of electro-acupuncture: if the effect of electro-acupuncture can last for 3~6
      months? Then, assess the patients' acceptance of electro-acupuncture.

      Study design: this trial is a multi-central randomized controlled trial which contains 14
      centers. Random sequences will be generated by the clinical evaluating center of China
      Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences. Subjects are patients who have severe chronic
      constipation.

      Sample size evaluation: Sample size will be based on the proportion of patients having mean
      complete spontaneous bowel movements (CSBMs) no less than 3 times per week. The proportion is
      31.67% in our phase I clinical trial by using electro-acupuncture, and 30.9% in another trial
      by using prucalopride.The total sample size is 560.

      Periods and primary outcome: participants will be assessed at baseline for 2 weeks, treated
      for 8 weeks, and followed up for 24 weeks. Primary outcome is the proportion of patients
      having mean CSBMs/week no less than 3 times over the latter 6-week treatment.

      Quality control: the study is a randomized controlled trial; participants were included
      strictly; evaluators and statisticians are blinded; quality control officers of 3 different
      levels will supervise this trial.

      Data management: this trial will use the Remote Dara Capture (RDC) system for data entering
      and Data Verification Plan (DVP) for data examining.

      Statistical analysis: Intention-To-Treat (ITT) analysis will be used in this study. One-sided
      test (non-inferiority) will be used for testing the primary outcomes; meanwhile, two-sided
      test will be used for evaluating other outcomes. A P value equal to or less than 0.05 is
      considered to indicate statistical significance.

    <description>Abbreviation: CSBMs, complete spontaneous bowel movements. Calculation method: First, the mean weekly CSBMs of each patient were calculated over weeks 3-8. Second, we got the number of patients with 3 or more mean weekly CSMBs. Third, we got the proportion of participants through dividing that number by the total cases at baseline, and multiplying by 100%.

    <time_frame>over weeks 1-2, 3-8.</time_frame>
    <description>The change from baseline in the mean score of stool consistency of each SBM over weeks 1-2 and weeks 3-8. Assessing time: baseline, weeks 1-2 and weeks 3-8. Patients will self-report their stool consistency of each SBM according to the 7-type Bristol Stool Form Scale (scored by 1 to 7 respectively). Type 1: Separate hard lumps, like nuts (hard to pass); Type 2: Sausage-shaped, but lumpy; Type 3: Like a sausage but with cracks on its surface; Type 4: Like a sausage or snake, smooth and soft; Type 5: Soft blobs with clear cut edges (passed easily); Type 6: Fluffy pieces with ragged edges, a mushy stool; Type 7: Watery, no solid pieces. Entirely liquid.
Type 3 and 4 were deemed as a normal stool.</description>

Patients will self-report their straining degree of each SBM in the defecation diaries according to the following scale. 0 = not difficult; 1 = a little difficult, need some straining to defecate; 2 = difficult, need straining to defecate; 3 = very difficult, need hard straining to defecate.

    <time_frame>week 4 and week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The change from baseline of the score of Patient Assessment of Constipation Quality of Life (PAC-QOL) at week 4 and week 8. PAC-QOL is a self-report questionnaire to evaluate the quality of life in patients with constipation, which was distributed by Mapi Research Trust in France. This questionnaire contains 28 items including 4 basic parts of physical discomfort, worries and concerns, psychosocial discomfort, and satisfaction. We use the Chinese version in our trial. Assessing point: baseline, week 4 and week 8. The score of PAC-QOL ranged from 1 to 5 (1 indicates no discomfort or feeling very satisfied, 5 indicates extreme severity and always appears or feeling very dissatisfied).</description>

      <population>Baseline analysis population was the recruited patients with baseline data. We recruited 560 participants (280 for each group) in total; however, 3 participants from EA group and 2 from prucalopride group withdrew their informed consents with no baseline data. Therefore, they were not included in the baseline analysis.</population>

          <description>Electro-acupuncture (EA) at bilateral ST25, SP14 ,and ST37. Additionally, bilateral BL33 was used for severe straining if any; DU20 and DU24 were used for patients with anxiety and depression if any.
EA treatment was lasted for 30 min, and EA treatment was taken 5 times/week for the first 2 weeks, and 3 times/week for the next 6 weeks. Each treatment cycle will include 28 sessions for continuous 8 weeks.
After the EA treatment is stopped, the participants will be followed up for 24 weeks.</description>

          <title>the Proportion of Participants With ≥1 Increase in Mean Weekly CSBMs From Baseline Over Weeks 1-2, 3-8, 11-12, 15-16, 19-20, 31-32.</title>
          <description>Abbreviation: CSBMs, complete spontaneous bowel movements. Calculation method: First, the increase in mean weekly CSBMs of each patient from baseline were calculated over weeks 1-2, 3-8, 11-12, 15-16, 19-20, 31-32. Second, we got the number of patients with ≥1 increase in the mean weekly CSMBs from baseline. Third, we got the proportion of participants through dividing that number by the total cases at baseline, and multiplying by 100%.
Assessing time frame: weeks 1-2, 3-8, 11-12, 15-16, 19-20, 31-32.</description>

        <title>the Change From Baseline in Mean Score of Stool Consistency for Each SBM Over Weeks 1-2 and 3-8.</title>
        <description>The change from baseline in the mean score of stool consistency of each SBM over weeks 1-2 and weeks 3-8. Assessing time: baseline, weeks 1-2 and weeks 3-8. Patients will self-report their stool consistency of each SBM according to the 7-type Bristol Stool Form Scale (scored by 1 to 7 respectively). Type 1: Separate hard lumps, like nuts (hard to pass); Type 2: Sausage-shaped, but lumpy; Type 3: Like a sausage but with cracks on its surface; Type 4: Like a sausage or snake, smooth and soft; Type 5: Soft blobs with clear cut edges (passed easily); Type 6: Fluffy pieces with ragged edges, a mushy stool; Type 7: Watery, no solid pieces. Entirely liquid.
Type 3 and 4 were deemed as a normal stool.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Mean Score of Patient Assessment of Constipation Quality of Life</title>
        <description>The change from baseline of the score of Patient Assessment of Constipation Quality of Life (PAC-QOL) at week 4 and week 8. PAC-QOL is a self-report questionnaire to evaluate the quality of life in patients with constipation, which was distributed by Mapi Research Trust in France. This questionnaire contains 28 items including 4 basic parts of physical discomfort, worries and concerns, psychosocial discomfort, and satisfaction. We use the Chinese version in our trial. Assessing point: baseline, week 4 and week 8. The score of PAC-QOL ranged from 1 to 5 (1 indicates no discomfort or feeling very satisfied, 5 indicates extreme severity and always appears or feeling very dissatisfied).</description>
