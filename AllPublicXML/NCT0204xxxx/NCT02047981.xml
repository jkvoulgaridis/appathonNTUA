  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our long-term goal is to more precisely define the role of mass azithromycin treatments as an
      intervention for reducing childhood mortality. We propose a single multi-site
      (multi-country), cluster-randomized trial comparing communities randomized to oral
      azithromycin with those randomized to placebo. We hypothesize that mass azithromycin
      treatments will reduce childhood mortality.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will assess childhood mortality over three years, comparing communities where children
      aged 1-60 months receive biannual oral azithromycin (&quot;Azithromycin&quot; arm) for two years, to
      communities where the children receive biannual oral placebo (&quot;Control&quot; arm) for two years.
      During the third year at the Niger site only, everyone will receive azithromycin.

      This is a cluster-randomized trial; at each site, communities within a contiguous area of
      300,000 to 600,000 individuals will be randomized to azithromycin or placebo using simple
      random sampling.

      Niger contingency study: In the event that mass distributions of oral azithromycin are proven
      to reduce mortality in 1-60 month-old children, then we will treat all communities in Niger
      with mass azithromycin distributions to test whether the intervention continues to reduce
      childhood mortality after the initial 2 years of mass treatments.
