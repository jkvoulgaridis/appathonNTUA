  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test how effective the drug, Carfilzomib, reduces progression of prostate
      cancer in patients who have previously received chemotherapy and androgen inhibitors.
      Carfilzomib is approved for multiple myeloma but is not approved for prostate cancer.
      Therefore, it is considered investigational. Other approved methods of treatment for
      metastatic prostate cancer have demonstrated only modest benefits. Novel and tolerable agents
      are necessary to make further gains and extend overall survival.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      First-line chemotherapy for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) combined
      with androgen inhibitors modestly extends overall survival. Carfilzomib is anticipated to
      enhance progression-free survival (PFS) as well as reduce pain and toxicities.

      Proteasome inhibitors are promising agents used in the therapy of prostate cancer.
      Carfilzomib is a more potent and irreversible proteasome inhibitor than the frequently used
      proteasome inhibitor, Bortezomib. In Phase I trials Carfilzomib demonstrated substantial
      antitumor activity while exhibiting tolerable side effects.

      Carfilzomib has been approved by the FDA for patients with multiple myeloma. The drug,
      however, is not approved for the use with CRPC patients. This trial will evaluate the
      tolerance and effectiveness of Carfilzomib in men with metastatic progressive CRPC following
      chemotherapy and androgen inhibitors.

The dose of carfilzomib is 20 mg/m2 on days 1 and 2 of cycle 1 and is then escalated in succeeding weeks and cycles to 56 mg/m2 if no dose limiting toxicities occur. Acyclovir is given orally at 400 mg twice daily during therapy but may be discontinued at some point.
