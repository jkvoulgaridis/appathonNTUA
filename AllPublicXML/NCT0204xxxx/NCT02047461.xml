  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will include a screening period, a 6-month treatment period, followed by long-term
      extension period expected to last approximately 72 months.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will receive daily IV infusions of ORGN001 (formerly ALXN1101) starting on Day 1.
      After a prescribed period, dosing will increase monthly based on defined patient safety
      measures. After Month 6, patients will continue daily dosing at their last tolerated dose.
