  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Strokes are very common in the United States and occur more in the elderly. The number of
      strokes is likely to double in the next 50 years. Many stroke survivors are sedentary and
      have a poor dietary intake, which results in abnormalities in fuel utilization (eg
      carbohydrate versus fat). This study will examine the effects of dietary modification and
      treadmill training on fuel utilization and physical function. We will study skeletal muscle
      oxidative stress in chronic stroke patients and the ability to employ dietary modification
      and exercise training to reverse these abnormalities in this ethnically diverse population.

    <textblock>
      In acute stroke settings, it is known that energy imbalance is associated with poorer
      rehabilitation and functional outcomes, and importantly, increased risk of
      institutionalization. However, nutrition and eating habits of chronic stroke rehabilitative
      care have received very little consideration, especially if the survivor is living in a free
      living environment. Studies have shown deficiencies in energy and protein intake versus
      recommendations in chronic stroke survivors. Perry et al. found ~7% of chronic stroke
      survivors were at moderate and ~5% at high nutritional risk. Although little is known
      regarding total daily energy expenditure and dietary intake in chronic stroke, energy and
      macronutrient imbalance may have a profound impact on stroke recovery and risk of development
      of chronic disease and recurrent stroke by altering substrate oxidation and result in
      systemic and tissue level oxidative stress. Conversely, cardiovascular disease risk increases
      with excess calorie and fat intake and two-thirds of stroke survivors are overweight or
      obese. In obese, non-stroke populations, energy dense, high fat meals are associated with
      increases in plasma oxidative stress markers. Oxidative stress can lead to mitochondrial
      damage and abnormal accumulation of metabolite intermediates and lipid accumulation in
      non-adipose tissues, which can impair heart function, increasing CVD and stroke recurrence
      risk.

    <description>After a 12 hour fast, economy of hemiparetic gait will be measured using open circuit spirometry during a standard constant load submaximal effort treadmill walking task at a pre-established gait velocity (60% of self-selected floor walking velocity). This slower walking velocity is selected because untrained subjects with stroke usually cannot maintain their self-selected walking pace, precluding steady state measures of oxygen consumption that defines gait economy. We will calculate the change in respiratory exchange ratio from rest to the final 3 minutes of a 10-minute walk under steady state oxygen consumption conditions (RER at 60%VO2peak-RER at rest). Subjects not achieving a plateau in VO2 will be re-tested at a lower velocity on a different date to eliminate potential confounding effects of fatigue on testing.</description>

    <description>Training will be started conservatively with a goal of 15 minutes total duration at 40-50% HRR. Training target HR = %(HRmax - HRrest) + HRrest. HR max is defined as peak HR based on 2 maximal exercise tests at baseline. Individuals unable to walk continuously will exercise intermittently for several minutes as tolerated, with rest intervals, and advanced as tolerated with HR, blood pressure monitoring, and Borg Perceived Exertion to assess subjective cardiopulmonary exercise tolerance, as previously described. Treadmill training velocity will advance as tolerated by week 6 to a target intensity of 70-80% maximal HRR. Duration will similarly advance to a target of 30 minutes by week 6. Following week 6, the progressive training protocol will continue with attempts to increase velocity on a weekly basis and increase duration by 5 minutes bi-weekly to peak at 50 minutes. After week 6, the target HR goal will be 75-85% of HRR as tolerated by the subject.</description>

    <description>Stretch controls will be enrolled in supervised stretching program for 2 days/week for 1 hour sessions. The stretch program will focus on basic mobility skills, including balance, endurance, sit-to-stand, weight shifting, leg strength, and truncal stability-coordination. Stretching will be done in groups up to 6 participants. Exercises will be performed in standing, seated, and lying positions. A log book on the stretching exercise participation and progression will be maintained and reviewed by the instructor with the participant at each session.</description>

Stretching (control): Stretch controls will be enrolled in supervised stretching program for 2 days/week for 1 hour sessions. The stretch program will focus on basic mobility skills, including balance, endurance, sit-to-stand, weight shifting, leg strength, and truncal stability-coordination. Stretching will be done in groups up to 6 participants. Exercises will be performed in standing, seated, and lying positions. A log book on the stretching exercise participation and progression will be maintained and reviewed by the instructor with the participant at each session.</description>

Treadmill Exercise: Training will be started conservatively with a goal of 15 minutes total duration at 40-50% HRR. Training target HR = %(HRmax - HRrest) + HRrest. Treadmill training velocity will advance as tolerated by week 6 to a target intensity of 70-80% maximal HRR. Duration will similarly advance to a target of 30 minutes by week 6. Following week 6, the progressive training protocol will continue with attempts to increase velocity on a weekly basis and increase duration by 5 minutes bi-weekly to peak at 50 minutes. After week 6, the target HR goal will be 75-85% of HRR as tolerated.</description>

        <title>The Change in Substrate Oxidation</title>
        <description>After a 12 hour fast, economy of hemiparetic gait will be measured using open circuit spirometry during a standard constant load submaximal effort treadmill walking task at a pre-established gait velocity (60% of self-selected floor walking velocity). This slower walking velocity is selected because untrained subjects with stroke usually cannot maintain their self-selected walking pace, precluding steady state measures of oxygen consumption that defines gait economy. We will calculate the change in respiratory exchange ratio from rest to the final 3 minutes of a 10-minute walk under steady state oxygen consumption conditions (RER at 60%VO2peak-RER at rest). Subjects not achieving a plateau in VO2 will be re-tested at a lower velocity on a different date to eliminate potential confounding effects of fatigue on testing.</description>
