  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this research study, the investigators want to learn more about the use of donor-derived
      viral specific T-cells (VSTs) to treat viral infections that occur after allogeneic stem cell
      transplant. A viral specific T cell is a T lymphocyte (a type of white blood cell) that kills
      cells that are infected (particularly with viruses). Allogeneic means the stem cells come
      from another person. These VSTs are cells specially designed to fight the virus infections
      that can happen after a bone marrow transplant.

      The investigators are asking people who have undergone or will undergo an allogeneic stem
      cell transplant to enroll in this research study, because viral infections are a common
      problem after allogeneic stem cell transplant and can cause significant complications
      including death.

      Stem cell transplant reduces a person's ability to fight infections. There is an increased
      risk of getting new viral infections or reactivation of viral infections that the patient has
      had in the past, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), adenovirus (ADV),
      BK virus (BKV), and JC virus. There are anti-viral medicines available to treat these
      infections, though not all patients will respond to the standard treatments. Moreover,
      treatment of viral infections is expensive and time consuming, with families often
      administering prolonged treatments with intravenous anti-viral medications, or patients
      requiring prolonged admissions to the hospital. The medicines can also have side effects like
      damage to the kidneys or reduction in the blood counts, so in this study the investigators
      are trying to find an easier way to treat these infections.

      The stem cell matched donor will be asked to provide a blood donation for the VSTs
      generation. In the laboratory, the investigators will treat this blood sample to select out
      the cells that will help fight viruses. The cells will be grown with peptides (protein
      fragments that represent parts of the virus that will encourage the donor immune cells to
      grow). The cells will be grown in the laboratory so that there is a stock of virus fighting
      cells for the patient to use in the future. The investigators will freeze the cells and store
      them in a freezer in the laboratory.

      If the patient has signs of virus in their blood after the transplant, they will be given the
      cells to help fight the infection. If there are signs that the cells are helping fight the
      infection, more cells may be given. The patient may get the cells up to 5 times, with one
      month between each treatment. If the patient does not show signs of a virus, the cells will
      stay in the freezer.

      Following VST infusion, (s)he will be monitored with physical exams daily while inpatient and
      weekly while outpatient as well as blood tests weekly until 30 days after the last infusion
      of cells. The patient will have 3 teaspoons (15 mL) of blood drawn and urine collected before
      each cell infusion and then once a week after each infusion for 4 weeks and then once a month
      if possible for 1 year after the last infusion, all to monitor for the viral response.
