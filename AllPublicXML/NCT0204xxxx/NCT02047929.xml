  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a common disease that affects people of all ages and has significant morbidity and
      mortality. Poor outcomes and health disparities related to asthma result in part from the
      difficulty of disseminating new evidence and paradigms of care delivery such as shared
      decision making (SDM) into clinical practice. This study will evaluate a novel mechanism for
      dissemination of an evidence-based SDM Toolkit for asthma care in primary care practices. The
      study is ideally suited to study dissemination methods because it will leverage a partnership
      between an established consortium of practice based research networks (PBRNs) and an advanced
      Medicaid Network.

      This study will evaluate a novel dissemination process (FLOW) to spread an Asthma Shared
      Decision Making Toolkit to practices within a Medicaid network using a consortium of
      practice-based research networks (NCNC). The knowledge gained from this proposal and the
      partnerships formed between practice-based research networks and NC Medicaid will facilitate
      widespread dissemination to almost 300 practices.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Changing the behavior of health providers can be challenging, and significant gaps exist in
      our knowledge of how to best disseminate new medical evidence into everyday practice. This is
      true when the evidence involves a new paradigm of patient-centered care delivery such as
      shared decision making (SDM). The most common dissemination used is passive diffusion, which
      includes journal publications, didactic presentations, and educational material and often
      fails to produce timely or sustainable practice level changes. A unique partnership between a
      Medicaid network and a well established consortium of practice-based research networks
      provides an ideal venue to examine the effectiveness of new effective methods of
      dissemination. We previously developed an asthma toolkit that was funded by the Agency for
      Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and tested across a regional network of Pediatric,
      Family Medicine, and Internal Medicine ambulatory practices in Mecklenburg County North
      Carolina. During this study, key principles of community based participatory research were
      used engaging providers and patients to develop a Facilitator-Led participant OWned (FLOW)
      Approach to dissemination. The FLOW approach uses Practice Facilitators to guide practices
      through the process of adapting the Toolkit into the existing culture and workflow. This
      approach led to rapid dissemination and sustainability of the Toolkit across six practices.
      The initial results have showed marked improvement in patient outcomes (improved medication
      adherence and decreased asthma exacerbations) with increased patient involvement in the
      creation of the care plans. The objective is to determine what dissemination strategy most
      effectively increases practice level adoption of shared decision making, improves patient
      outcomes, and increases patient involvement in care decisions. We will leverage a partnership
      between the statewide Medicaid network and NCNC, a state-wide consortium of research
      networks, to identify best practices for dissemination of the shared decision making toolkit.
      We will test the FLOW method for dissemination on a larger scale by randomizing 30 primary
      care practices from 4 practice based research networks to one of three dissemination arms:
      (1) Facilitator-Led participant OWned (FLOW) Approach to Dissemination; (2) Traditional
      dissemination (Active Diffusion) with facilitator exposure; and (3) Passive dissemination.

We have defined this type of dissemination, &quot;traditional dissemination&quot;. For the purpose of this study, practices randomized to traditional dissemination will receive a lunchtime presentation by a physician champion / subject matter expert on shared decision making. The presentation will give an overview of the Asthma Shared Decision Making (SDM) Toolkit, access to the internet link with additional information, and a copy of all printed materials associated with the Toolkit.</description>

The research team for this proposal was funded by the Agency for Health Care Research and Quality to build, disseminate and evaluate a novel Asthma SDM Toolkit - The Asthma Comparative Effectiveness Study. The Toolkit development was completed in 2010 and has been in evaluation for 2 years. This study will continue to evaluate the Toolkit in a wide array of practices across NC while testing a new method of dissemination.</description>
