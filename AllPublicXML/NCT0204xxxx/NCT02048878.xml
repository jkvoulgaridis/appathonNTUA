    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether individuals with chronic insomnia disorder
      have a higher degree of physiologic arousal (resulting in their trouble sleeping) than good
      sleepers. The primary goal is to perform a rigorous quantitative assessment of physiologic
      hyper-arousal across two domains (autonomic nervous system and neurophysiology) in patients
      with chronic primary insomnia as compared to good sleepers matched for sex, age, body mass
      index (BMI) and race/ethnicity.

        Inclusion Criteria for Insomniacs:

          -  Men and women with primary insomnia of at least 3 months in duration

          -  ages 21-65 years old

          -  BMI &lt;35 kg/m2 to enable microneurography

          -  Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) &gt; 5

          -  Self-reported habitual sleep duration &lt; 6.5 hours

        Inclusion criteria for good sleepers:

          -  21-65 years old men and women with BMI &lt;35 kg/m2

          -  No insomnia based on ISI questionnaire

          -  Self-reported habitual sleep duration ≥ 6.5 hours but &lt; 9 hours

          -  PSQI&lt;5
