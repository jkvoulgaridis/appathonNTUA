      This is a phase 1b/2 study of the safety and efficacy of sapanisertib (MLN0128) in
      combination with exemestane or fulvestrant therapy in women with estrogen receptor
      positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative (ER+/HER2-) advanced or metastatic
      breast cancer who progressed on treatment with everolimus in combination with exemestane or
      fulvestrant.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called sapanisertib (MLN0128). Sapanisertib is being
      tested in women with estrogen receptor positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2
      negative (ER+/HER2-) advanced or metastatic breast cancer who progressed on treatment with
      everolimus. This study will look at the safety and efficacy of sapanisertib when given in
      combination with exemestane or fulvestrant.

      The study enrolled 118 patients. This study has two phases: phase 1 and phase 2. Phase 1 has
      2 parts. In part 1 of phase 1, unmilled active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) capsules were
      administered, while in part 2, capsules based on milled API were administered.

        -  Phase 1 (Part 1): sapanisertib 5 mg (unmilled) + exemestane

        -  Phase 1 (Part 1): sapanisertib 5 mg (unmilled) + fulvestrant

        -  Phase 1 (Part 2): sapanisertib 3 mg (milled) + exemestane

        -  Phase 1 (Part 2): sapanisertib 3 mg (milled) + fulvestrant

        -  Phase 1 (Part 2): sapanisertib 4 mg (milled) + exemestane

      In phase 2, participants were enrolled into one of 2 parallel cohorts, depending on the
      quality and/or duration of their prior response to everolimus in combination with either
      exemestane (any country) or fulvestrant (US only).

      Everolimus-Resistant Cohort: patients who had progressed on treatment with everolimus in
      combination with either exemestane (any country) or fulvestrant (US only) without achieving
      an objective response (CR or PR) or after achieving stable disease for &lt;6 months as their
      best response.

      Everolimus-Sensitive Cohort: participants who had progressed on treatment after achieving a
      CR or PR of any duration, or stable disease for ≥6 months with prior everolimus treatment in
      combination with either exemestane (any country) or fulvestrant (US only). Participants were
      to receive MLN0128 in combination with the same dose of the previously administered treatment
      (exemestane [any country] or fulvestrant [US only]).

      This multi-center trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this
      study was 52 months. Participants made multiple visits to the clinic and were contacted by
      telephone every 3 months for a follow-up assessment.

    <time_frame>First dose of study drug through 30 days after the last dose (Up to 52 months)</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product whether or not it is related to the medicinal product. This includes any newly occurring event, or a previous condition that has increased in severity or frequency since the administration of study drug.
A SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of an existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is a medically important event. Relationship of each AE to study drug will be determined by the Investigator.</description>

             Age &lt; 55 years and 1 year or more of amenorrhea, with an estradiol assay &lt; 20 pg/mL

             Note: Ovarian radiation or treatment with a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone
             agonist (goserelin acetate or leuprolide acetate) is not permitted for induction of
             ovarian suppression.

          4. Have a history of brain metastasis are eligible for the study provided that all the
             following criteria are met:

             Brain metastases which have been treated

               -  No evidence of disease progression for ≥ 3 months or hemorrhage after treatment

               -  Off-treatment with dexamethasone for 4 weeks before administration of the first
                  dose of MLN0128

               -  No ongoing requirement for dexamethasone or anti-epileptic drugs

                  aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 2.5 x ULN (≤ 5 x ULN
                  if liver metastases are present)

               -  Creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min based either on Cockcroft-Gault estimate or
                  based on a 12- or 24-hour urine collection

          7. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) within 5 absolute percentage points of
             institutional standard of normal as measured by echocardiogram (ECHO) or multiple
             gated acquisition scan (MUGA) within 4 weeks before the first dose of MLN0128 (ie, if
             the institutional standard of normal is 50%, LVEF may be as low as 45% to be eligible
             for the study).

          8. Able to provide paraffin blocks or a minimum of 10 unstained slides of available
             archival tumor tissues (paraffin blocks are preferred). If archival tumor tissue is
             not available, a tumor biopsy may be performed before the patient begins treatment
             with MLN0128. If fewer than 10 slides are available or the tumor content/area
             requirements are not met, study eligibility will be determined upon discussion with
             the sponsor.

          9. Ability to swallow oral medications, willingness to perform mucositis prophylaxis, and
             suitable venous access for the study-required blood sampling.

         10. Voluntary written consent must be given before the performance of any study related
             procedure not part of standard medical care, with the understanding that consent may
             be withdrawn by the patient at any time without prejudice to future medical care.

             Phase 1b Only: In addition to the previously mentioned inclusion criteria, each
             patient must meet the following inclusion criterion to be enrolled in the phase 1b
             portion of the study:

         11. Patients may have SD or disease progression during their most recent treatment with
             exemestane or fulvestrant, or everolimus in combination with either exemestane (any
             country) or fulvestrant (US only). Exemestane or fulvestrant in combination with
             MLN0128 can also be initiated as a new line of therapy.

             Phase 2 Only: In addition to the previously mentioned inclusion criteria, each patient
             must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be enrolled in the phase 2
             portion of the study:

         12. Measurable disease defined as follows:

               -  At least 1 extra-osseous lesion that can be accurately measured in at least 1
                  dimension. The lesion must measure ≥ 20 mm with conventional imaging techniques
                  or ≥ 10 mm with spiral computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging
                  (MRI), or

               -  Bone lesions (lytic or mixed [lytic plus sclerotic]) in the absence of measurable
                  disease as defined above

         13. Patients must have had disease progression during treatment with everolimus in
             combination with either exemestane (any country) or fulvestrant (US only) (duration of
             treatment ≥ 4 weeks) and must have tolerated everolimus treatment in combination with
             exemestane (any country) or fulvestrant (US only) adequately according to the treating
             physician's judgment. Everolimus in combination with exemestane or fulvestrant is not
             required to be the most recent treatment before enrollment, but progression on the

             are met.

          7. Other clinically significant co-morbidities, such as uncontrolled pulmonary disease,
             active central nervous system disease, active infection, or any other condition that
             could compromise participation of the patient in the study.

          8. Known human immunodeficiency virus infection.

    <ipd_description>Takeda makes patient-level, de-identified data sets and associated documents available for all interventional studies after applicable marketing approvals and commercial availability have been received (or program is completely terminated), an opportunity for the primary publication of the research and final report development has been allowed, and other criteria have been met as set forth in Takeda's Data Sharing Policy (see www.TakedaClinicalTrials.com for details). To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias. Once approved, qualified researchers who sign a data sharing agreement are provided access to these data in a secure research environment.</ipd_description>

        <title>Phase 1: Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</title>
        <description>An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product whether or not it is related to the medicinal product. This includes any newly occurring event, or a previous condition that has increased in severity or frequency since the administration of study drug.
A SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of an existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is a medically important event. Relationship of each AE to study drug will be determined by the Investigator.</description>
        <time_frame>First dose of study drug through 30 days after the last dose (Up to 52 months)</time_frame>
        <population>Safety Population included participants who received at least 1 dose of any study drug.</population>

          <title>Phase 1: Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</title>
          <description>An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product whether or not it is related to the medicinal product. This includes any newly occurring event, or a previous condition that has increased in severity or frequency since the administration of study drug.
A SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of an existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is a medically important event. Relationship of each AE to study drug will be determined by the Investigator.</description>

        <description>PFS is defined as the time in months from the date of first dose of study treatment to the date of the first documented disease progression or death. Disease progression was defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study, including baseline; an absolute increase of at least 5 mm in the sum of diameters of target lesions; or the appearance of one or more new lesions.</description>

        <population>Safety Population included participants who received at least 1 dose of study drug. For a participant whose disease had not progressed and was last known to be alive, PFS was censored at the last response assessment that was stable disease or better.</population>

          <description>PFS is defined as the time in months from the date of first dose of study treatment to the date of the first documented disease progression or death. Disease progression was defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study, including baseline; an absolute increase of at least 5 mm in the sum of diameters of target lesions; or the appearance of one or more new lesions.</description>
          <population>Safety Population included participants who received at least 1 dose of study drug. For a participant whose disease had not progressed and was last known to be alive, PFS was censored at the last response assessment that was stable disease or better.</population>
