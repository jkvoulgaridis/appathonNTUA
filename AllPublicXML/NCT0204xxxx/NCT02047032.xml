  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A noninferiority randomized controlled trial aimed at comparing the effect and safety of
      electroacupuncture versus the pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) plus solifenacin for mixed
      urinary incontinence (MUI).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants experiencing mixed urinary incontinence will be recruited from 10 centers. A
      gynecologist or urologist will make the diagnosis. Central randomization will be performed by
      the Clinical Evaluation Center of the China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences in Beijing.

      Sample size: Sample size is based on the primary outcome. According to literature, the
      investigators predict that MUI patient's average 72-h incontinence episode frequency of the
      week 1-12 will decrease by 60% from the baseline after treatment of PFMT plus solifenacin.
      The number of the acupuncture group is 57%. For the assessment of noninferiority, 250
      participants will be needed for each group allowing for a 15% dropout (α=0.05，β=0.2，δ=15%).

      Quality control: A 3-level monitoring system (monitors responsible for one center, monitors
      responsible for all centers and monitors responsible for the whole trial) will be established
      to check the performance of the trial in time. Outcome assessment, completion of case report
      forms and data management will be under strict supervision.

      Data management: The Remote Dara Capture (RDC) system will be used for data entering. Both
      paper and electronic case report form will be reserved. A data verification plan is made.

    <description>The average 72-h IEF (urinary incontinence, stress urinary incontinence and urgency urinary incontinence respectively) is calculated based on a 72-h bladder diary. For example, the average 72-h incontinence episodes from the 13th to 36th week equal to the sum of 72-h incontinence episodes of the 16th, 20th, 24th, 28th, 32nd, 36th weeks divided by 6.</description>

    <description>The performance of 1-hour pad test according to the International Incontinence Society:
Participants were instructed to void 2 hours before the pad test. On arrival, they received a pre-weighed pad and were asked to sit and drink 500 ml sodium-free water in 15 minutes. Next, they were instructed to walk for 30 minutes, including going up and down 24 stairs. On returning to the clinic, the participants were instructed to perform several activities, including standing and sitting 10 times, coughing vigorously 10 times, running for 1 minute, picking up a coin from the floor 5 times, and putting their hands under water for 1 minute. After the activities were completed, the pad was reweighed to measure the amount of urinary leakage using a gram sensitive weight scale (Xiangshan, EK3820).</description>

    <description>For BL33, the needle (75mm) will be inserted at the point upper and outside of BL33. Insert the needle with a 30-45°angle to a depth of 50-60 mm. The needle will be manipulated with an even lifting, thrusting and twisting method and the sense of soreness and distention will radiate to the perineal region or the anus. For BL35, the needle will be inserted upward and outward slightly with an even lifting, thrusting and twisting method. The sense of soreness and distention will radiate to the perineal region or the anus. The electric stimulator will be put on the two pair of points with a spare-dense wave, 10/50 Hz, 0.1-5.0 mA. The current intensity will be increased until the participant can not stand.</description>

acupuncture: For BL33, the needle (75mm) will be inserted at the point upper and outside of BL33. Insert the needle with a 30-45°angle to a depth of 50-60 mm. The needle will be manipulated with an even lifting, thrusting and twisting method and the sense of soreness and distention will radiate to the perineal region or the anus. For BL35, the needle will be inserted upward and outward slightly with an even lifting, thrusting and twisting method.

        <description>The performance of 1-hour pad test according to the International Incontinence Society:
Participants were instructed to void 2 hours before the pad test. On arrival, they received a pre-weighed pad and were asked to sit and drink 500 ml sodium-free water in 15 minutes. Next, they were instructed to walk for 30 minutes, including going up and down 24 stairs. On returning to the clinic, the participants were instructed to perform several activities, including standing and sitting 10 times, coughing vigorously 10 times, running for 1 minute, picking up a coin from the floor 5 times, and putting their hands under water for 1 minute. After the activities were completed, the pad was reweighed to measure the amount of urinary leakage using a gram sensitive weight scale (Xiangshan, EK3820).</description>

            <description>Both PFMT and solifenacin will be given for 36 weeks. Solifenacin will be taken 5mg once daily, before or after meal. PFMT includes intensive exercises conducted in hospital and home exercises.

solifenacin: Solifenacin used in this trial is produced by Astellas Pharma Europe B.V.(Country medicine accurate character No. J20090109 )

            <description>BL33 and BL35 of both sides are used. Every session will last for 30 minuets and will be given every other day. There are 36 sessions for each participant in all (3 session per week, 12 weeks).
acupuncture: For BL33, the needle (75mm) will be inserted at the point upper and outside of BL33. Insert the needle with a 30-45°angle to a depth of 50-60 mm. The needle will be manipulated with an even lifting, thrusting and twisting method and the sense of soreness and distention will radiate to the perineal region or the anus. For BL35, the needle will be inserted upward and outward slightly with an even lifting, thrusting and twisting method. The sense of soreness and distention will radiate to the perineal region or the anus. The electric stimulator will be put on the two pair of points with a spare-dense wave, 10/50 Hz, 0.1-5.0 mA. The current intensity will be increased until the participant can not stand.</description>

acupuncture: For BL33, the needle (75mm) will be inserted at the point upper and outside of BL33. Insert the needle with a 30-45°angle to a depth of 50-60 mm. The needle will be manipulated with an even lifting, thrusting and twisting method and the sense of soreness and distention will radiate to the perineal region or the anus. For BL35, the needle will be inserted upward and outward slightly with an even lifting, thrusting and twisting method. The sense of soreness and distention will radiate to the perineal region or the anus. The electric stimulator will be put on the two pair of points with a spare-dense wave, 10/50 Hz, 0.1-5.0 mA. The current intensity will be increased until the participant can not stand.</description>
