  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to learn whether or not a brief parenting program
      called Child Adult Relationship Enhancement (CARE) offered at a primary care office can help
      improve behavior problems in children who are 2-6 years old.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the CARE intervention. The study
      will include 2-6 year old children who receive their primary care at the Children's Hospital
      of Philadelphia, South Philadelphia Primary Care clinic and whose caregiver and/or doctor has
      concern about a behavior problem in the child. The caregivers will also be subjects in the
      study.

      Child-caregiver pairs who agree to be in the study will be randomly assigned to receive the
      CARE training immediately or in 3-4 months.

      The CARE intervention will last 6 weeks and child behavior and parenting will be measured at
      baseline, 6-8 weeks, and 14-18 weeks. Investigators will also measure parent satisfaction
      with the CARE intervention.

        -  Child Adult Relationship Enhancement (CARE) is a group parent training program.

        -  The goals of the program are to teach parents skills that help their children
           successfully reach developmental milestones while increasing positive behaviors.

        -  The program also was designed to help parents manage and decrease negative child
           behaviors.

        -  Each training will be led by 2 therapists and 4-10 parents will attend the CARE program
           together.

        -  Children do not attend the training but parents are encouraged to practice the skills
           learned at CARE between the sessions.

    <description>Behavior will be measured by the Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory (ECBI). The primary outcome is the ECBI change score (time 3-time1). The ECBI is a parent rating scale designed to measure conduct problem behaviors in children ages 2-16 years. The instrument contains 36 items that assess behavior on two scales. The problem scale provides a yes/no problem identification rating for each item, and the sum of yes responses yields a problem score with a potential range from 0 to 36 with a clinical cutoff of 15. The intensity scale provides a frequency-of-occurrence rating for each item, ranging from never (1) to always (7) and the ratings are summed to yield an intensity score with a potential range from 36 to 252 with a clinical cutoff of 131. Higher scores indicate worse outcomes. The ECBI has demonstrated strong internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and discriminant validity and has been shown to be a sensitive indicator of intervention efficacy for child behavior problems.</description>

    <measure>Changes From Baseline in Parental Disciplinary Practices Assessed at Different Time Points (Baseline up to 18 Weeks)</measure>
    <time_frame>Mean change in scores from baseline to 14-18 weeks. Increases in scores indicate decreased risk for abuse and better outcomes.</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators want to determine the effect of the CARE intervention on diminishing harsh parenting as measured by the Adult Adolescent Parenting Inventory-2.
The Adult Adolescent Parenting Inventory-2 (AAPI-2) is a 40 item parent-report measure that assesses parenting attitudes along 5 dimensions: inappropriate expectations of children, parental lack of empathy towards children's needs, strong belief in the use of corporal punishment as a means of discipline, reversing parent-child role responsibilities, and oppressing children's power and independence.
Parents respond to each item on a five point Likert Scale of Strongly Agree, Agree, Disagree, Strongly Disagree and Uncertain. This measure yields a score of 1-10 for each construct. Higher scores indicate lower risk parenting.</description>

    <description>40 child-caregiver pairs will be randomized to usual treatment plus immediate CARE. The trainings are administered to groups of 4-10 caregivers at a time and are led by two mental health providers trained in the CARE curriculum. The children do not attend the training; however, caregivers are expected to practice the skills that they learn in CARE with their child between sessions. The curriculum involves 6 sessions over 6-8 weeks. Each session will be 1-2 hours.</description>

    <description>CARE is a group parent training informed by the principles of Parent Child Interaction Therapy and was developed by Trauma Treatment Training Center and CHOP Policy Lab. CARE has been used in many populations including residential treatment center/domestic violence shelter staff, daycare providers, graduate students, biological parents, and foster parents/caseworkers. Goals are to decrease stress for caregivers, improve child behavior, and enhance the caregiver-child relationship, family stability, and wellness. The training teaches parents to follow a child's lead thus building a connection and promoting positive behaviors. The focus is on giving attention to child's pro-social behavior and ignoring minor misbehavior. The second phase teaches techniques for giving effective commands.</description>

          <description>The Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory (ECBI) is a 36 item parent rating scale that measures problem behaviors (externalizing or conduct-disordered behaviors) in children 2-16 on the Intensity scale and the Problem scale. The problem score (range 0-36) is the total number of behaviors for which the parent identifies that the behavior is problematic. Higher scores indicate worse behavioral problems. Baseline ECBI Problem Scale was collected by parental report for Child Participants only.</description>

          <description>Adult Adolescent Parenting Inventory 2 (AAPI-2) is a 40-item parent self-report measure that assesses parenting attitudes on five subscales: 1) inappropriate expectations of children 2) parental lack of empathy towards child’s needs, 3) strong belief in the use of corporal punishment as a means of discipline, 4) reversing parent-child role responsibilities and 5) oppressing child’s power and independence. Standardized sten scores for each of the 5 subscales range from 1-10 with lower scores indicating higher risk for child maltreatment.</description>

        <description>Behavior will be measured by the Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory (ECBI). The primary outcome is the ECBI change score (time 3-time1). The ECBI is a parent rating scale designed to measure conduct problem behaviors in children ages 2-16 years. The instrument contains 36 items that assess behavior on two scales. The problem scale provides a yes/no problem identification rating for each item, and the sum of yes responses yields a problem score with a potential range from 0 to 36 with a clinical cutoff of 15. The intensity scale provides a frequency-of-occurrence rating for each item, ranging from never (1) to always (7) and the ratings are summed to yield an intensity score with a potential range from 36 to 252 with a clinical cutoff of 131. Higher scores indicate worse outcomes. The ECBI has demonstrated strong internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and discriminant validity and has been shown to be a sensitive indicator of intervention efficacy for child behavior problems.</description>

        <title>Changes From Baseline in Parental Disciplinary Practices Assessed at Different Time Points (Baseline up to 18 Weeks)</title>
        <description>Investigators want to determine the effect of the CARE intervention on diminishing harsh parenting as measured by the Adult Adolescent Parenting Inventory-2.
The Adult Adolescent Parenting Inventory-2 (AAPI-2) is a 40 item parent-report measure that assesses parenting attitudes along 5 dimensions: inappropriate expectations of children, parental lack of empathy towards children's needs, strong belief in the use of corporal punishment as a means of discipline, reversing parent-child role responsibilities, and oppressing children's power and independence.
Parents respond to each item on a five point Likert Scale of Strongly Agree, Agree, Disagree, Strongly Disagree and Uncertain. This measure yields a score of 1-10 for each construct. Higher scores indicate lower risk parenting.</description>
        <time_frame>Mean change in scores from baseline to 14-18 weeks. Increases in scores indicate decreased risk for abuse and better outcomes.</time_frame>
