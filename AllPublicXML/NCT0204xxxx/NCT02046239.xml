  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Closure of the skin after liver resection (surgery to remove part of the liver) may be
      achieved by one of several methods. The standard method at our institution is to use
      stainless steel staples to adjoin the two sides of skin. Alternatively, a continuous
      absorbable suture may be used to &quot;sew&quot; the skin together.

      The ideal method of closure should be safe, effective, associated with minimal patient
      discomfort and have a good cosmetic result. At present, there is no scientific evidence to
      describe which method is most suitable following liver resection.

      The primary aims of this study is to investigate which method (subcuticular sutures vs
      staples) offers the best result in postoperative rate of (1) skin infection, (2) skin
      dehiscience (separation of skin) and (3) time taken to perform skin closure. In addition, we
      are interested in which method is best for patient satisfaction and cosmetic appearance and
      which method is most cost effective.

    <description>Staple Group: At the end of the operation, the skin will be closed using stainless steel staples, which is standard clinical practice at St. James's University Hospital. Approximately ten days after the operation, the staples will be manually removed; this is normally performed by the patients GP.</description>

    <description>Suture Group: At the end of the operation, the skin will be closed using absorbable surgical suture. Manual removal of this suture is not required because the thread is self-absorbable.</description>
