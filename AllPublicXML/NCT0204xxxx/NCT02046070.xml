    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, multicenter, open-label study in patients with Newly Diagnosed Multiple
      Myeloma (NDMM) who have not received prior systemic treatment for multiple myeloma (MM) and
      who are ineligible for high-dose therapy (HDT)-stem cell transplantation (SCT) due to age
      (ie, ≥ 65 years) or comorbid disease(s) or with Relapsed and/or Refractory Multiple Myeloma
      (RRMM).

      The investigational drug being tested in this study is called MLN9708 also known as Ixazomib.
      This study will look at disease response rates and safety in people who take ixazomib in
      addition to cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone. NDMM participants will be randomly assigned
      (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of two treatment groups and RRMM participants will
      be assigned to a third group:

        -  NDMM - ixazomib (MLN9708) 4.0 mg + cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m^2 + dexamethasone 40 mg

        -  NDMM - ixazomib (MLN9708) 4.0 mg + cyclophosphamide 400 mg/m^2 + dexamethasone 40 mg

        -  RRMM - ixazomib (MLN9708) 4.0 mg + cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m^2 + dexamethasone 40 mg

      The study enrolled 148 participants. This multi-centre trial will be conducted in the United
      States, European Union, and Australia.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Each participant with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) must meet all of the
        following inclusion criteria to be enrolled in the study:

          1. Adult male or female participants 18 years of age or older with a confirmed diagnosis
             of symptomatic multiple myeloma (MM) according to standard criteria.

          2. Participants for whom cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone treatment is appropriate and
             who are considered not eligible for high-dose therapy (HDT)-stem cell transplantation
             (SCT) for 1 or more of the following reasons:

               -  The participant is 65 years of age or older.

               -  The participant is less than 65 years of age but has significant comorbid
                  condition(s) that are, in the opinion of the investigator, likely to have a
                  negative impact on tolerability of HDT-SCT.

        Each participant with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) must meet all of
        the following inclusion criteria to be enrolled in the study:

          1. Adult male or female participants 18 years or older with a confirmed diagnosis of
             symptomatic MM either currently or at the time of initial diagnosis, according to
             standard criteria, and relapsed and/or refractory disease after 1 to 3 lines of prior
             therapy. A participant is considered to have refractory disease if disease progression

               -  are surgically sterile, or

               -  If they are of childbearing potential, agree to practice 2 effective methods of
                  contraception, at the same time, from the time of signing the informed consent
                  through 90 days after the last dose of study drug, or

               -  agree to practice true abstinence over the period previously described, when this
                  is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant. (Periodic
                  abstinence [ie, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods] and
                  withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.), and

               -  agree to practice effective barrier contraception during the entire study
                  treatment period and through 90 days after the last dose of study drug, or

               -  agree to practice true abstinence over the period previously described, when this
                  is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant. (Periodic
                  abstinence [eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods for the
                  female partner] and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.), and

               -  adhere to any treatment-specific pregnancy prevention guidelines for
                  cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone.

          6. Voluntary written consent must be given before performance of any study-related
             procedure not part of standard medical care, with the understanding that consent may
             be withdrawn by the participant at any time without prejudice to future medical care.

          7. Suitable venous access for the study-required blood sampling.

          8. Is willing and able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol

        <description>An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product whether or not it is related to the medicinal product. This includes any newly occurring event, or a previous condition that has increased in severity or frequency since the administration of study drug.
A SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of an existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is a medically important event. Relationship of each AE to study drug was determined by the Investigator.</description>

        <description>An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product whether or not it is related to the medicinal product. This includes any newly occurring event, or a previous condition that has increased in severity or frequency since the administration of study drug.
A SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of an existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is a medically important event. Relationship of each AE to study drug was determined by the Investigator.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30) During the Induction Phase in NDMM Participants</title>
        <description>EORTC QLQ-C30 is a patient completed 30 item questionnaire that consists of 5 functional scales (physical functioning, role functioning, emotional functioning, cognitive functioning, and social functioning), 1 global health status scale, 3 symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, and pain), and 6 single items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties). The patient evaluates their health status over the previous week. There are 28 questions answered on a 4-point scale where1=Not at all (best) to 4=Very Much (worst) and 2 questions answered on a 7-point scale where 1=Very poor (worst) to 7= Excellent (best). All of the scales and single-item measures are transformed to a score:0 to 100. For functioning scales and global QOL higher scores indicate better functioning (a positive change from Baseline indicates improvement); for symptom scales higher scores indicate more severe symptoms (a negative change from Baseline indicates improvement).</description>

        <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product; the untoward medical occurrence does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.
A SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of an existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is a medically important event. Relationship of each AE to study drug was determined by the Investigator.</description>

        <description>EORTC QLQ-C30 is a patient completed 30 item questionnaire that consists of 5 functional scales (physical functioning, role functioning, emotional functioning, cognitive functioning, and social functioning), 1 global health status scale, 3 symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, and pain), and 6 single items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties). The patient evaluates their health status over the previous week. There are 28 questions answered on a 4-point scale where1=Not at all (best) to 4=Very Much (worst) and 2 questions answered on a 7-point scale where 1=Very poor (worst) to 7= Excellent (best). All of the scales and single-item measures are transformed to a score:0 to 100. For functioning scales and global QOL higher scores indicate better functioning (a positive change from Baseline indicates improvement); for symptom scales higher scores indicate more severe symptoms (a negative change from Baseline indicates improvement).</description>

For functioning scales and global QOL higher scores indicate better functioning (a positive change from Baseline indicates improvement); for symptom scales higher scores indicate more severe symptoms (a negative change from Baseline indicates improvement).</description>
