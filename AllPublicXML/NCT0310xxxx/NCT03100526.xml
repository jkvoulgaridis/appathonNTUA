  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: Implement a Patient Aligned Care Team (PACT) model that identifies and proactively
      manages Veterans at the highest risk for hospital admission and death while the patient is
      still in the ambulatory care setting.

      Goal:

        -  Reduce emergency department and urgent care utilization, hospitalization, and mortality
           in complex, high risk patients

        -  Improve Veteran and staff satisfaction

      Objectives:

        -  Maintain the patient in the home setting as much as possible

        -  Secure appropriate home environment to facilitate health and well-being

        -  Utilize comprehensive team-based care

        -  Engage appropriate Veteran Health Administration (VHA) programs to provide
           interdisciplinary, coordinated, and timely management of complex medical issues

    <measure>Total Medicare Cost</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years (two 1-year points)</time_frame>
    <description>Data will be extracted from VHA's Corporate Data Warehouse to capture patient Medicare cost.

    <measure>Patient Engagement</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years (two 1-year points)</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will look at patient PIM enrollment data by utilizing qualitative data. The data will be collected through qualitative interviews with patients and PACT providers.
Provider Interviews questions:
Tell me what kinds of things you and your team have been doing to try to engage patients What types of patients have you been able to engage most successfully? Once patients have started to engage with the PIM team, how do you prioritize what to work on with them?
Patient Interview questions:
Has working with the PIM team made a difference in your health? Have you changed how you take care of yourself since you have been part of PIM? If you were going to tell another Veteran about this program, what would you say (are the pros and cons)? How would you say you have benefitted from being in this program? What have been the drawbacks of being in this program?</description>

    <measure>Primary Care Staff Job Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years (two waves)</time_frame>
    <description>We will survey Primary Care Providers (PCPs) (physicians, MDs/DOs; nurse practitioners, NPs; physician assistants, PAs) and nurses (registered nurses, RNs; licensed practical nurses, LPNs; licensed vocational nurses-LVNs) at the five healthcare systems that have a PIM team. We will use both online using RedCap and paper-and-pen versions of the survey to increase response rate. We will survey Primary Care staff at baseline and one year later. Primary Care Staff Job Satisfaction is measured by a single item &quot;Overall, I am satisfied with my job,&quot; rated on a 5-point Likert agreement scale. (Strongly disagree, Disagree, Neither agree nor disagree, Agree, Strongly agree). The higher the score the higher the satisfaction.
