    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effect and best dose of neratinib and to see how well
      it works with paclitaxel and with or without pertuzumab and trastuzumab before combination
      chemotherapy in treating patients with breast cancer that has spread to other places in the
      body. Neratinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for
      cell growth. Immunotherapy with pertuzumab and trastuzumab, may induce changes in body's
      immune system and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Drugs
      used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, doxorubicin hydrochloride, and cyclophosphamide,
      work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by
      stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving neratinib,
      pertuzumab, trastuzumab, paclitaxel and combination chemotherapy may work better in treating
      patients with breast cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of neratinib in combination with paclitaxel,
      pertuzumab, and trastuzumab in HER2-positive (HER2+) primary metastatic or locally advanced
      (stage III) breast cancer within 2 cycles. (Cohort 1: Phase Ib) II. To determine the
      pathologic complete response (pCR) rate of neratinib in combination with paclitaxel,
      pertuzumab, and trastuzumab followed by doxorubicin hydrochloride (doxorubicin) and
      cyclophosphamide (AC) in HER2+ locally advanced (stage III) inflammatory breast cancer (IBC)
      patients. (Cohort 1: Phase II) III. To determine the pCR rate of neratinib in combination
      with paclitaxel followed by AC in HER2-negative/hormone receptor (HR)-positive (HER2-/HR+)
      locally advanced (stage III) IBC patients. (Cohort 2)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate 2 years progression free survival (PFS) rate of HER2+ locally advanced (stage
      III) IBC patients, and HER2-/HR+ IBC patients treated with neratinib plus anthracycline and
      taxane based chemotherapy. (Cohort I Phase II and Cohort II) II. To determine toxicity and
      safety of the combination therapy.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the adaptive target and downstream changes in pan-HER family members induced
      by one-week window period of neratinib based on tissue and blood based biomarkers.

      II. To determine the correlation between positive/negative changes in EGFR, HER2 and HER4 and
      the occurrence of pCR.

      III. To determine the rate of HER2 mutation in HER2+ IBC and HER2-/HR+ IBC. IV. To determine
      the association between HER2 mutation and pCR achieved by study combination therapy.

      V. To determine the correlation between tumor tissue based pharmacodynamic marker changes in
      association with circulating tumor cells (CTC) and circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid
      (ctDNA).

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of neratinib followed by a phase II study.
      Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 groups.

      GROUP A (COHORT 1 PHASE IB): Patients receive neratinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days
      1-21, paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 1-3 hours on days 1, 8, and 15, pertuzumab IV over 1
      hour on day 1, and trastuzumab IV over 1-2 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days
      for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients
      without progression or excessive toxicity with metastatic disease may receive up to 4
      additional courses and with locally advanced disease may receive up to 2 additional courses.

      GROUP B (COHORT 1 PHASE II): Patients receive neratinib, paclitaxel, pertuzumab, and
      trastuzumab as in Group A. Patients then receive doxorubicin hydrochloride IV and
      cyclophosphamide IV over 90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 4
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo
      standard of care surgery.

      GROUP C (COHORT 2): Patients receive neratinib PO QD on days 1-21, paclitaxel IV over 1-3
      hours on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 4 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo surgery/
      Patients then receive doxorubicin hydrochloride and cyclophosphamide as in Group B. Patients
      then undergo standard of care surgery.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 month.

             findings no more than 6 months; extent erythema occupying at least 1/3 of whole
             breast; pathology: pathologic confirmation of invasive carcinoma

          -  Cohort 1: Phase II: patient must have HER2+ (regardless of hormonal receptor status)
             stage III IBC or Stage IV IBC if the metastatic sites are amenable for local therapy
             (i.e. radiation and/ or surgery) and will have breast surgery

          -  Cohort 2 Patient must have HER2-/HR+ stage III IBC or Stage IV IBC if the metastatic
             sites are amenable for local therapy (i.e. radiation and/ or surgery) and will have
             breast surgery; HER2 negative status, which determined by assays using IHC require
             negative (0 or 1+) staining score; if IHC is equivocal (2+) staining score, assays
             using FISH require the absence of gene amplification: dual-probe HER2/CEP17 ratio is &lt;
             2.0 and an average HER2 copy number &lt; 4.0 signals/cell; if HER2 testing result is
             confirmed at M D Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC), it does not require centralized
             repeat testing; hormone receptor (HR) positivity is determined by estrogen receptor
             (ER) &gt;= 10% and /or progesterone receptor (PR) &gt;= 10% by IHC staining

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Excisional biopsy or lumpectomy for the current breast cancer

          -  Any other previous malignancies (except for cervical in situ cancers treated only by
             local excision, and basal and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin) within 5 years

          -  Any other previous antitumor therapies for the current cancer event; this exclusion
             does not apply to phase Ib part of cohort 1

          -  Breast-feeding at screening or planning to become pregnant during the course of
             therapy

          -  History of active or known autoimmune disease that can cause diarrhea like (but not
             limited to) Addison's disease, celiac disease/gluten intolerance/irritable bowel
             syndrome, scleroderma

          -  Active infection or chronic infection requiring chronic suppressive antibiotics

          -  Known hepatitis B or hepatitis C with abnormal liver function tests

          -  Malabsorption syndrome, ulcerative colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, resection of
             the stomach or small bowel, or other disease or condition significantly affecting
             gastrointestinal function

          -  Persistent &gt;= grade 2 diarrhea regardless of etiology

          -  Sensory or motor neuropathy &gt;= grade 2

          -  Conditions that would prohibit intermittent administration of corticosteroids for
             paclitaxel premedication; however, corticosteroid can be dropped after confirming of
             no asthma like reaction to paclitaxel after 3 doses

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension defined as a systolic blood pressure (BP) &gt; 150 mmHg or
             diastolic BP &gt; 90 mmHg, with or without anti-hypertensive medications

          -  Cardiac disease (history of and/or active disease) that would preclude the use of any
             of the drugs included in the treatment regimen; this includes but is not confined to:

               -  Active cardiac diseases including:

                    -  Symptomatic angina pectoris within the past 180 days that required the
                       initiation of or increase in anti-anginal medication or other intervention

                    -  Ventricular arrhythmias except for benign premature ventricular contractions

                    -  Supraventricular and nodal arrhythmias requiring a pacemaker or not
                       controlled with medication

                    -  Conduction abnormality requiring a pacemaker

                    -  Valvular disease with documented compromise in cardiac function

                    -  Symptomatic pericarditis

               -  History of cardiac disease:

                    -  Myocardial infarction documented by elevated cardiac enzymes or persistent
                       regional wall abnormalities on assessment of left ventricular (LV) function

                    -  History of documented congestive heart failure (CHF)

                    -  Documented cardiomyopathy
