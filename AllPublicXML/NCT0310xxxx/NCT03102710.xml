  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to use a brain stimulation tool called transcranial direct current
      stimulation (tDCS) to investigate the analgesic (reducing sensitivity to pain) effects of
      lidocaine cream and the hyperalgesic (increasing sensitivity to pain) effects of capsaicin
      cream using a neutral cream as a control. tDCS stimulation has been shown to temporarily
      influence the way the stimulated part of the brain functions. With this method, the
      involvement of specific parts of the brain can be investigated in the working of the brain as
      a whole.

    <measure>Comparison of Functional Connectivity Changes of the DLPFC Before and After tDCS Stimulation</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>We investigated the effects of cathodal (inhibition) and anodal (enhancement) tDCS on rDLPFC functional connectivity (FC) with the supplementary motor area (SMA) and anterior insula. Higher Fisher Z-scores represent greater resting-state functional connectivity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>fMRI Resting States Functional Connectivity Changes During Pain Stimulation</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>We measured changes in blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) activity in the brain during pain stimulation. In the outcome measure data table, &quot;placebo contrast&quot; indicates lidocaine - neutral and &quot;nocebo contrast&quot; indicates capsaicin - neutral.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Gracely Sensory Scale Pain Rating Changes in Response to Lidocaine and Capsaicin Creams and tDCS</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Gracely Sensory Scale allows participants to rate the intensity of heat pain stimuli on a scale from 0 to 20, with 0 indicating no pain sensation and 20 indicating extremely intense pain. The outcome measure data table shows mean pain ratings for the lidocaine, capsaicin, and neutral creams after enhancement, inhibition, or sham tDCS stimulation.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <pre_assignment_details>18 subjects were dropped prior to randomization. Reasons for this included inconsistent or non-differentiable pain ratings to heat stimuli, pain thresholds that were too high or low, inability to finish subsequent sessions, too much discomfort with noxious stimuli, no SSN/hairstyle incompatible with tDCS, participated in a previous pain study.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>We investigated the effects of cathodal (inhibition) and anodal (enhancement) tDCS on rDLPFC functional connectivity (FC) with the supplementary motor area (SMA) and anterior insula. Higher Fisher Z-scores represent greater resting-state functional connectivity.</description>

            <description>In this group, the transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) stimulates the areas of the brain being examined in this study to increase their activity.
transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS): tCDS safely applies a weak electrical current to your scalp using two sponge electrodes that look like flat circular pads. The pads will be held in place on your head with a neoprene cap. The pads will be attached to a generator that will send a weak stimulus to your scalp. This current influences the way that your brain cells work. When the stimulus starts, you might feel a tingling sensation underneath the electrode pads. That sensation is not painful and goes away in seconds.
Lidocaine cream: Lidocaine cream will be applied on the arm to reduce pain sensitivity (analgesia).
Capsaicin cream: Capsaicin cream will be applied on the arm to increase pain sensitivity (hyperalgesia).
Control cream: A neutral cream will be applied on the arm as a control.</description>
