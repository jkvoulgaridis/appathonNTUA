  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic musculoskeletal pain (CMP) is highly prevalent, disabling and with high
      socio-economic costs, with many negative effects on quality of life. CMP affects the ability
      to perform work, social, recreational and domestic tasks by changing the mood and
      concentration of this population that suffers.

      In a study carried out in 2010, 17% of the Spanish population had experienced pain in the
      last month and according to the severity of symptoms 12% felt severe , 64% moderate and 24%
      mild pain. In this same study it is specified that 61% was due to back pain, 29% due to neck
      pain and 23% due to shoulder pain.

      Pain neuroscience education (PNE) has been shown as an effective treatment strategy in
      increasing knowledge and understanding of neurobiology, neurophysiology and pain processing,
      modifying beliefs about it, improving patient skills and encouraging to the accomplishment of
      physical and social activities in different chronic pathologies.

      Study design and setting: The design of the present study will be a quasi-experimental study
      with 2 follow-ups (one month and four months after intervention) that will be performed
      between Apr 2018 and Apr 2020 in public health system in Malaga, Spain. The outcomes will be
      assessed at baseline (t0), one month (t1) and four months after the physiotherapy treatment
      begins (t2). Written informed consent will be acquired for all participants prior to their
      participation.

    <description>Pain neuroscience education (PNE) can be defined as an educational session or sessions describing the neurobiology and neurophysiology of pain, and pain processing by the nervous system. It will be applied one time (at baseline). Physiotherapy includes kinesitherapy and exercises.</description>
