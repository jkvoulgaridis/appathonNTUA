  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to conduct a program of pilot research aimed at developing and
      evaluating a technology-assisted wellness intervention for older adults with obesity.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The national epidemic of obesity is also affecting older adults, and is associated with an
      increased risk of disability, nursing home placement and early mortality. Conventional weight
      loss programs have the potential to reduce body fat, but are difficult to access for older
      obese adults due to transportation and mobility challenges. The overarching goal of this
      study is to conduct a program of pilot research aimed at developing and evaluating a
      technology assisted wellness intervention for older adults with obesity.

      Study Timeline:

      September 2017 to June 2018:

      Goal: Conduct a pilot study of improving weight and physical function in older adults with
      obesity. An mHealth Obesity Wellness Intervention (MOWI) will integrate Amulet +/- Fitbi with
      a weekly individual dietician-led nutritional session, along with twice weekly physical
      therapist led group exercise session.

      Participation Duration: Three times weekly for 3 months

    <description>18-item scale measuring eating behavior with 3 subscales (cognitive restraint, emotional eating, uncontrolled eating) using Likert scale (1-4 point scale). Items 1-16 on this scale are reverse scored. The scale score is then entered into the following formula: (cognitive restraint scale score - 3)/9. The outcome is then multiplied by 100. Higher scores indicate higher restraint, emotional eating or uncontrolled eating, respectively. Subscales aretransformed to 0-100 score
To calculate the emotional eating sub scale, reverse scored items 2, 4, 7, 10, 14 and 16 are summed and then averaged to generate a mean score. The mean score is then multiplied by 6 to generate a scale score. The scale score is then entered into the following formula: (emotional eating scale score - 6)/18. The outcome is then multiplied by 100.
Positive change scores represent lower restraint, higher emotional eating or higher uncontrolled eating.</description>

          <title>Develop &amp; Refine MOWI w/o Amulet (2A)</title>
          <description>Develop and refine a mHealth obesity wellness intervention (MOWI) for rural, older, obese adults without the use of Amulet technology.
Develop &amp; Refine MOWI w/o Amulet: The mHealth Obesity Wellness Intervention (MOWI) will be informed by the previous Aim (Aim 1) of this proposal. It will consist of a 12-week, 3x/week program of: weekly nutrition counseling; 2x/week group exercise visits. A dietician and physical therapist will lead the in-person sessions. A wave of 8 individuals each will be assessed at 0, 4, 8 and 12 weeks.</description>

          <title>MOWI Weight Loss Maintenance</title>
          <description>Evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, + potential effectiveness of an 8-session, tri-weekly, psychosocial skills group intervention to support weight loss maintenance post-MOWI.
MOWI Weight Loss Maintenance: Participants who successfully completed the initial MOWI program will be offered the opportunity to participate in a 6-month weight management program. This program will consist of 8 group-based skills workshop sessions occurring approximately once monthly (every 3 weeks), which will be 90-120 min. The overall structure will emphasize the following evidence-based weight management components: Goal setting/action planning, self-monitoring, receiving feedback regarding performance, reviewing relevant goals in the light of feedback, and e. psychological skills for increasing behavioral commitment.
Participants in &quot;MOWI Weight Loss Maintenance&quot; were separately enrolled in this Study and did not enter the Maintenance from one or more remaining arms included here.</description>

Total scores range 0-60: higher scores indicate greater satisfaction with the intervention.Three additional sub-items ask participants to rate their preference for the frequency of sessions, length of group meetings, and total number of group meetings using a Likert scale (-1 - 1 point scale: too few/too short = -1 to 1 = too much/too long). Each of these three items will be interpreted individually and not included in a summed total score. Additionally, this questionnaire includes 1 open-ended response item where participants are asked to leave any additional comments they may have regarding their level of satisfaction with the intervention.</description>

        <title>Change in Three Factor Eating Questionnaire Score</title>
        <description>18-item scale measuring eating behavior with 3 subscales (cognitive restraint, emotional eating, uncontrolled eating) using Likert scale (1-4 point scale). Items 1-16 on this scale are reverse scored. The scale score is then entered into the following formula: (cognitive restraint scale score - 3)/9. The outcome is then multiplied by 100. Higher scores indicate higher restraint, emotional eating or uncontrolled eating, respectively. Subscales aretransformed to 0-100 score
To calculate the emotional eating sub scale, reverse scored items 2, 4, 7, 10, 14 and 16 are summed and then averaged to generate a mean score. The mean score is then multiplied by 6 to generate a scale score. The scale score is then entered into the following formula: (emotional eating scale score - 6)/18. The outcome is then multiplied by 100.
Positive change scores represent lower restraint, higher emotional eating or higher uncontrolled eating.</description>

MOWI Weight Loss Maintenance: Participants who successfully completed the initial MOWI program will be offered the opportunity to participate in a 6-month weight management program. This program will consist of 8 group-based skills workshop sessions occurring approximately once monthly (every 3 weeks), which will be 90-120 minutes in length. The overall structure of the program will emphasize the following evidence-based weight management components: Goal setting/action planning, self-monitoring, receiving feedback regarding performance, reviewing relevant goals in the light of feedback, and e. psychological skills for increasing behavioral commitment (acceptance, willingness, thought monitoring, mindful decision making, and values clarification).</description>
