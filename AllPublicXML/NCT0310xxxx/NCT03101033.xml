  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether epidural neuroplasty has better efficacy
      than epidural steroid injection for the treatment of lumbar disc herniation.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One hundred patients diagnosed as herniated lumbar disc will be recruited and divided into
      two groups. One group will be treated with Transforaminal steroid injection, the other with
      epidural neuroplasty. The VAS and ODI scores obtained at one month, three months and six
      months post-treatment will be analysed statistically.
