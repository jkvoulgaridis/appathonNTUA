    <textblock>
      This study will develop and test a web-based intervention to enhance emotion regulation
      skills and parent-son relationship communication to decrease adolescent boys' risk for dating
      violence involvement as well as attitudes supporting relationship aggression.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over the past ten years dating violence (DV) has been recognized as a significant public
      health problem affecting adolescents. Emerging data suggest that boys and girls have
      different developmental trajectories toward violence and therefore prevention programs that
      target their unique pathways to DV are needed. Despite this need, there is a relative dearth
      of such gender-informed programs for early adolescent boys. This research project aims to
      prevent the emergence of DV perpetration/ victimization among boys by developing a web-based
      intervention that is informed by research on gender-specific pathways to violence and
      harnesses the influence of parents during the early adolescent years.

      Among boys, the perpetration of delinquency-related violence and attitudes supporting
      violence has been found to predict later perpetration of DV. Thus, gender-informed
      interventions designed to prevent DV in boys need to target skills that underlie violent
      behavior and attitudes. The goal of this study is to develop and test a web-based
      intervention to enhance emotion regulation skills and parent-son relationship communication
      to prevent DV.

      Development and testing will occur in three phases. In the Development Phase, the
      intervention modules will be developed and iteratively reviewed by both a panel of experts
      familiar with the research in the field as well as an advisory group of parents and teens
      from the target population. In the Acceptability Testing Phase, testing will be conducted to
      assess acceptability and feasibility, and this will be followed by revisions to the
      intervention program based on feedback and observations. During the Randomized Controlled
      Trial (RCT) Phase, 120 families will complete the intervention program in an observed
      setting, to ensure fidelity to intervention dosing. Parents and adolescents will complete the
      program together and then complete assessments of aggressive and risk behaviors, parent-child
      communication, and emotion regulation at baseline, 3-,and 9-month follow-ups.

    <measure>Change in Dating Violence (DV) Perpetration From Baseline to 9 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, and 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Conflict in Adolescent Dating Relationships Inventory (CADRI) is a behavioral measure of abuse perpetration and victimization. It was completed by teens in reference to conflict or disagreement with a current or recent dating partner. Each question is asked twice, first regarding perpetration and, again in relation to victimization producing a perpetration and a victimization sub scale. Percentages include teens endorsing any perpetration or victimization.</description>

    <measure>Change in General Aggressive Behavior From Baseline to 9 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Aggression Questionnaire (AQ) is a 34-item questionnaire that rates five types of aggression (physical aggression, verbal aggression, anger, hostility, and indirect aggression). Item responses ranged from 1-5, with 1=Not at all like me, 2=A little like me, 3=Somewhat like me, 4=Very much like me, 5=Completely like me. Higher scores indicate more aggression.</description>

    <description>Adolescent Relationship Violence Questionnaire (ARVQ) is a 22-item questionnaire is a composite measure developed to assess changes in knowledge, attitudes, and methods of dealing with relationship violence. Item responses ranged from 1-4 with 1=strongly agree, 2=agree, 3=disagree 4=strongly disagree. Higher scores indicate more favorable attitudes.</description>

    <measure>Change in Emotion Regulation Skills From Baseline to 9 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, and 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Adolescent Self-Regulatory Inventory (ASRI) is a 33 item survey that measures adolescents' use of both functional and dysfunctional emotion regulation strategies. It produces two sub scales measuring short-term and long-term self-regulation. Item responses range from 1-5 with 1= Not at all true for me, 2= Rarely true for me, 3= True some of the time, 4= True most of the time, 5= Really true for me. Items were reverse coded so that higher scores indicate more use of emotion regulation behaviors.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Parent-Adolescent Communication From Baseline to 9 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, and 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Parent Adolescent Communication Survey (PACS) is 20 item survey measuring quality of communication between adolescents and their parents. Adolescents will complete the measure in reference to the parent participating in the intervention with them. This is completed by parents and youth. This scale also produces two sub scales: The Open Family Communication Scale (OFCS) and The Problems in Family Communication Scale (PFCS). Item responses range from 1-5 with 1=Strongly disagree, 2=Moderately disagree, 3=Neither agree neither disagree, 4=Moderately agree, 5=Strongly agree. On the OFCS subscale, higher scores indicate more open communication. One the PFCS subscale, higher scores indicate fewer problems in family communication, thus higher scores on both subscales are favorable.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Emotion Regulation Skills Baseline to 9 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Emotion Regulation Behavioral Skills (ERBS) scale is comprised of 8 items rated on a scale of 1 &quot;all the time&quot; to 5 &quot;never&quot; and was specifically created for to detect the use of the specific affect management strategies taught in the Project STRONG intervention. Sample items include &quot;How often did you…get away from whatever was causing your feeling? …talk to someone about whatever was causing your feeling?&quot; Higher scores indicate greater use of emotion regulation skills.</description>

    <measure>Change in Distress Tolerance From Baseline to 9 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Behavioral Indicator of Resiliency to Distress (BIRD) is a 5-minute computerized distress tolerance task for adolescents. This measure generates a score of total time that adolescents persist on a frustrating task, which has been linked to distress tolerance. Scores are recorded in milliseconds (ms) with a maximum time participants can persist is 300 seconds (0-300 is the range). Higher score indicate longer persistence during the frustrating task.</description>

        <title>Change in Dating Violence (DV) Perpetration From Baseline to 9 Months</title>
        <description>The Conflict in Adolescent Dating Relationships Inventory (CADRI) is a behavioral measure of abuse perpetration and victimization. It was completed by teens in reference to conflict or disagreement with a current or recent dating partner. Each question is asked twice, first regarding perpetration and, again in relation to victimization producing a perpetration and a victimization sub scale. Percentages include teens endorsing any perpetration or victimization.</description>

            <description>The web-based program consists of a number of games, activities, and didactic information that teens move through with their parent. Didactic information introduces teens and parents to specific emotion management, communication, and problem solving strategies as well as sexual health and healthy relationship information. Games and activities allow parents and teens to practice and apply strategies to developmentally appropriate situations.

        <description>The Adolescent Self-Regulatory Inventory (ASRI) is a 33 item survey that measures adolescents' use of both functional and dysfunctional emotion regulation strategies. It produces two sub scales measuring short-term and long-term self-regulation. Item responses range from 1-5 with 1= Not at all true for me, 2= Rarely true for me, 3= True some of the time, 4= True most of the time, 5= Really true for me. Items were reverse coded so that higher scores indicate more use of emotion regulation behaviors.</description>

        <title>Change in Parent-Adolescent Communication From Baseline to 9 Months</title>
        <description>Parent Adolescent Communication Survey (PACS) is 20 item survey measuring quality of communication between adolescents and their parents. Adolescents will complete the measure in reference to the parent participating in the intervention with them. This is completed by parents and youth. This scale also produces two sub scales: The Open Family Communication Scale (OFCS) and The Problems in Family Communication Scale (PFCS). Item responses range from 1-5 with 1=Strongly disagree, 2=Moderately disagree, 3=Neither agree neither disagree, 4=Moderately agree, 5=Strongly agree. On the OFCS subscale, higher scores indicate more open communication. One the PFCS subscale, higher scores indicate fewer problems in family communication, thus higher scores on both subscales are favorable.</description>

            <description>The web-based program consists of a number of games, activities, and didactic information that teens move through with their parent. Didactic information introduces teens and parents to specific emotion management, communication, and problem solving strategies as well as sexual health and healthy relationship information. Games and activities allow parents and teens to practice and apply strategies to developmentally appropriate situations.

        <description>The Behavioral Indicator of Resiliency to Distress (BIRD) is a 5-minute computerized distress tolerance task for adolescents. This measure generates a score of total time that adolescents persist on a frustrating task, which has been linked to distress tolerance. Scores are recorded in milliseconds (ms) with a maximum time participants can persist is 300 seconds (0-300 is the range). Higher score indicate longer persistence during the frustrating task.</description>
