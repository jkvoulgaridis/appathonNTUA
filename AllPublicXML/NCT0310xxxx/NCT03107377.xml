      Phase 2B double-blind placebo-controlled efficacy trial of Amphora® gel for the prevention of
      acquisition of urogenital Chlamydia trachomatis infection
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary: To determine if intravaginal Amphora gel reduces the risk of urogenital Chlamydia
      trachomatis (CT) infection.

      Secondary: To determine if intravaginal Amphora gel reduces the risk of urogenital Neisseria
      gonorrhoeae (GC) infection.

      Exploratory:To determine if Amphora gel use rate (subject adherence to instructed use) has an
      effect on proportion of subjects who experience at least one CT or GC infection during the
      study intervention period.

      Primary Outcome Measures: Proportion of subjects who experience at least one urogenital CT
      infection during the study intervention period (incident infection of CT).

      Secondary Outcome Measures: Proportion of subjects who experience at least one urogenital GC
      infection during the study intervention period (incident infection of GC).

      Exploratory Outcome Measures:

        -  Compliance with Amphora gel usage during study (rate of product use adherence).

        -  Sensitivity analyses of the primary parameter (proportion of subjects who experience at
           least one CT or GC infection during the study intervention period) will be performed for
           the following:

        -  Subjects with ≥20%, ≥40%, ≥60% and ≥80% product use adherence

        -  Subject Satisfaction

        -  Sexual satisfaction
