  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anesthesia-related factors have been linked to poor perioperative outcomes. Our observational
      study suggested that the cumulative duration of a triple-low state [intraoperative low mean
      arterial pressure (MAP), low bispectral index (BIS), and low target effect-site
      concentration(Ce) ]was associated with poorer 30-day mortality.This randomized, prospective
      study based on individualized Oxygen dynamics is designed to confirm this association in
      high-risk patients cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).
