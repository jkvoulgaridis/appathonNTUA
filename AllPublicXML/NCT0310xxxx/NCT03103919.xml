    <measure>Change From Baseline to Visit 2 in Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part III Motor Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Visit 1/Week 1) to Visit 2 (Week 12/ 3 months after start of treatment with Neupro)</time_frame>
    <description>UPDRS Part III has 27 items assessing motor skills including facial expression and speech, tremors, rigidity, posture, gait, and bradykinesia. Each of the 27 items in the UPDRS part III is measured on a scale of 0 to 4, where 0 is normal and 4 represents severe abnormalities. The motor score ranges from 0 to 108, where the maximum score indicates the worse condition. A negative value in change in Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale indicates improvement, whereas a positive value indicates worsening of disease.</description>

An AE could therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.</description>

    <description>Kinesia-ONE™ wearable sensor uses a subject-worn finger sensor and iPad mini application (APP) to objectively measure specific motor tasks related to Parkinson's disease symptoms such as tremor, bradykinesia (slowed movements), and dyskinesia (involuntary movements) in the Investigator's office. Subjects should wear the Kinesia-ONE™ device on the most affected side.</description>

    <description>Kinesia-360™ wearable sensor includes a wrist and ankle device, along with a cell phone, which is also APP-based, and is designed for continuous day time monitoring of Parkinson's disease symptoms. Subjects will wear Kinesia-360™ while they go about their daily lives, and symptom severity is continually captured to enable objective assessment of Parkinson's disease symptoms. Subjects should wear the Kinesia-360™ device bands on the most affected side.</description>

        <description>UPDRS Part III has 27 items assessing motor skills including facial expression and speech, tremors, rigidity, posture, gait, and bradykinesia. Each of the 27 items in the UPDRS part III is measured on a scale of 0 to 4, where 0 is normal and 4 represents severe abnormalities. The motor score ranges from 0 to 108, where the maximum score indicates the worse condition. A negative value in change in Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale indicates improvement, whereas a positive value indicates worsening of disease.</description>
