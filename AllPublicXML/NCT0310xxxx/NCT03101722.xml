      This study is a randomized, controlled trial. 60 eligible participants in total will be
      recruited. Participants in each group will be evenly and randomly assigned to the huperzine A
      subgroup and control subgroup using simple randomization method. Participants in the
      treatment subgroup will receive huperzine A (a dose of 0.2 mg/time, 2 times/day) with basic
      treatment and health education(BTHE), and those in the control subgroup will receive BTHE
      only. The primary outcome (auditory function) and secondary outcomes (tinnitus, cognitive
      symptom and quality of life) will be evaluated at baseline, 3-, 6-, 12-month follow-up.

    <intervention_model_description>The studies were divided into 2 groups: Control subgroup and huperzine A group.The study is a single-center, randomized, basic treatment and health education controlled trial, with minimized allocation of patients to one of the two groups.
For the study of tinnitus intervention, there is a 3 to 12 month follow-up.</intervention_model_description>
