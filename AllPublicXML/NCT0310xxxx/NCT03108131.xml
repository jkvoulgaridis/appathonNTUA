  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well cobimetinib and atezolizumab work in treating
      participants with rare tumors that have spread to other places in the body (advanced) or that
      does not respond to treatment (refractory). Cobimetinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal
      antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and
      may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving cobimetinib and
      atezolizumab may work better in treating participants with advanced or refractory rare
      tumors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the efficacy of cobimetinib plus atezolizumab (COTEZO) in cohorts of advanced
      rare tumors using objective response rate (ORR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
      Tumors (RECIST) version (v)1.1.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine progression-free survival (PFS) on COTEZO in cohorts of advanced rare tumors
      per RECIST v1.1 and immune-related (ir)RECIST.

      II. To determine overall survival (OS) on COTEZO in cohorts of advanced rare tumors.

      III. To determine disease control rate (DCR) and duration of response (DOR) on COTEZO in
      cohorts of advanced rare tumors per RECIST v1.1 and irRECIST.

      IV. To determine objective response rate (ORR) per immune-related RECIST criteria.

      V. To determine safety profile and adverse events encountered by patients with advanced rare
      tumors treated with COTEZO.

      VI. To collect and bank tumor tissue and peripheral blood for future correlative analyses
      from patients with advanced rare tumors treated with COTEZO.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive cobimetinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 and atezolizumab
      intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants followed up every 3 months thereafter.

          -  Must have completed prior chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or radiation therapy at least

             total abstinence in cases where the lifestyle of the patient ensures compliance.
             (Periodic abstinence [e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post ovulation
             methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception)
