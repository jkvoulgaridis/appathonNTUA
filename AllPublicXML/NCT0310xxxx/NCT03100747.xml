  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the rate of post-operative trachomatous
      trichiasis differs significantly between bilamellar tarsal rotation surgery with an incision
      height of 3 mm, bilamellar tarsal rotation surgery with an incision height of 5 mm, and
      Trabut surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this trial the investigators will randomize 4,953 individuals with previously unoperated
      trichiasis on a 1:1:1 basis to bilamellar tarsal rotation trichiasis surgery with an incision
      height of 3 mm, bilamellar tarsal rotation trichiasis surgery with an incision height of 5
      mm, or Trabut surgery. Participants will receive trichiasis surgery then will be followed at
      1 day, 2 weeks, 6 weeks, and 12 months after surgery. Some participants may be asked to
      attend a follow-up visit at 3-6 months. The primary outcome is development of post-operative
      trachomatous trichiasis (PTT) within 12 months after surgery. Logistic regression analyses
      will be performed to compare the rates of PTT in the 3 versus 5 mm incision BLTR groups, in
      the 3 mm BLTR versus Trabut group, and in the 5 mm BLTR versus Trabut group, adjusting for
      demographic characteristics and pre-operative trichiasis severity.

    <measure>Number of Eyes with Presence of Post-Operative Trichiasis within12 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Presence of post-operative trichiasis is defined as 1+ trichiatic eyelashes or evidence of recent epilation. Any eyelashes touching the eye with the eye in primary gaze are considered to be trichiatic. Outcomes will be evaluated at 6 weeks and 12 months. The first date of post-operative trichiasis will be used as the outcome.</description>

    <measure>Severity of Post-Operative Trichiasis at 6 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Severity of post-operative trichiasis will be graded as mild, moderate, or severe based on number of eyelashes touching globe and number of eyelashes epilated.
Definitions for trichiasis severity are: Mild: 1-4 Eyelashes touching globe, no epilation OR 1-10 Eyelashes epilated, no eyelashes touching globe; Moderate: 5-9 Eyelashes touching globe, no epilation OR 1-4 Eyelashes touching globe and 1-10 eyelashes epilated; Severe: 5-9 Eyelashes touching globe and 1-10 eyelashes epilated OR 10+ Eyelashes touching globe, regardless of epilation status OR 11-20 Eyelashes epilated, regardless of eyelashes touching globe OR Entire eyelid epilated</description>

    <measure>Number of Eyes with Presence of Eyelid Contour Abnormalities at 6 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A field and photograph examiner will grade the presence of abnormality independently, using a standardized definition. For this analysis, mild will be combined with normal to create &quot;no significant abnormality&quot; and moderate and severe will be combined into a &quot;moderate/severe contour abnormality&quot; group. The photographic grade will serve as the primary grade for this measure. We will conduct a secondary analysis using field grades.
Definitions for abnormality are: Mild: Vertical deviation from the natural contour, 1 mm in height (less than half the pupil height in daylight) and affecting 1/3 of horizontal eyelid length; Moderate: Vertical deviation from the natural contour 1-2 mm in height (about the pupil height in daylight) or affecting 1/3-2/3 of horizontal eyelid length; Severe: Vertical deviation from the natural contour 2 mm in height (more than the pupil height in daylight) or a defect &gt;2/3 of the horizontal eyelid length</description>

    <description>Pyogenic granulomas occasionally develop after trichiasis surgery, and it is thought that these are a response to a foreign body, such as suture material or a jagged incision edge.
