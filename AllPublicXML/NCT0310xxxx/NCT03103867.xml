  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is an open label single centre randomised cross over study to evaluate the impact
      of a sensor augmented pump (SAP) with a predictive algorithm to suspend temporarily insulin
      administration (640G® with the Smart Guard feature) versus the use of the same pump for
      insulin administration with 'only' continuous glucose measurements (not interacting with the
      pump, Freestyle Libre ® ) on the time in glucose target , in hypo- and hyperglycemia.
      Exploratory endpoints are the effect on sleep and quality of life in children with type 1
      diabetes and their caregivers.

    <textblock>
      Optimising metabolic control in children with Type 1Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) is essential to
      prevent late complications. Fear of nocturnal hypoglycemia is pervasive amongst parents of
      children with T1DM, leading to a heightened vigilance by parents to control regularly their
      children's blood sugar values or to check the sensor information during the night. This leads
      to chronic sleep interruption and to lack of sleep as well in the parents as in their
      children with diabetes.

      In this study, the impact of new technologies on glucose time in target , hypo fear and
      quality of life will be evaluated, using continuous interstitial glucose measurements either
      with a direct impact on insulin administration (640G medtronic pump (R)) and with alerts , or
      without impact on insulin administration and without alerts.
