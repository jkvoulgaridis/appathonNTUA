    <textblock>
      This study evaluates a topical nanoparticle paclitaxel ointment (SOR007) for the treatment of
      cutaneous metastases from non-melanoma cancer in adults. Three concentrations of SOR007 will
      be evaluated in dose-rising cohorts of three. An expanded cohort will treat additional
      subjects at the maximum tolerated dose.

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2, open-label, dose-rising study evaluating the safety, tolerability and
      preliminary efficacy of three concentrations of SOR007 (Uncoated Nanoparticle Paclitaxel)
      Ointment (0.15%, 1.0%, and 2.0%) applied to non-melanoma cutaneous metastases. A treatment
      area of 50 cm2 will be selected by the Investigator. Using a gloved hand, subjects will apply
      one Finger Tip Unit (FTU) of SOR007 to the 50 cm2 treatment area twice daily at approximately
      the same time each day for 28 days, with the option of extending treatment an additional 28
      days to total 56 days for subjects in the dose expansion phase. At each visit (Days 1, 8, 15,
      29, and 43 for 28 treatment days; Days 8, 15, 29, 57, and 70 for 56 treatment days), at least
      two global and two close-up color photographs of the treatment area will be taken (with a
      ruler for scale). The photographs will be analyzed with ImageJ. Eligible lesions will be
      determined at baseline by the RECIST definition of measurable tumors (≥ 10mm in its longest
      diameter). The study will include a dose escalation phase and a dose expansion phase.

      In the dose escalation phase, formal safety reviews will be conducted after the last subject
      in each cohort of three subjects completes 15 days of treatment. The next dose level will
      enroll upon a finding of safety and tolerability. The top dose or the maximum tolerated dose
      (if DLT occurs) will be taken into the dose expansion phase and additional subjects will be
      enrolled to reach a maximum of 16 subjects at that dose.

    <intervention_model_description>Phase 1/2, open-label, dose-rising trial of three concentrations of SOR007 (0.15%, 1.0%, 2.0%).
During the dose escalation phase, the study will follow a standard 3+3 dose-ascending design. If a single dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is identified in one of three subjects in the cohort, a further three subjects will be enrolled at the same dose level. If one or more DLT occur in the three additional subjects enrolled in the cohort, dose escalation will stop and the prior dose level will be regarded as the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and taken forward into the dose expansion phase. If no further DLT are identified, dose escalation will continue, until either a DLT is identified at a higher dose or the top dose of 2% is reached.
In the dose expansion phase, additional subjects will be enrolled up to a maximum of 12 subjects at the dose determined to be the MTD (or the top dose, 2.0% SOR007).</intervention_model_description>
