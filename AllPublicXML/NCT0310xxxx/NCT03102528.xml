  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in approximately one-third of patients undergoing cardiac
      surgery (CS), and represents one of the most significant negative predictors of patient
      outcome in this population. The investigators sought to examine the risk factors associated
      with the development of AKI and renal recovery in patients undergoing cardiac surgery at San
      Bortolo Hospital, Italy 2014-2015.
