  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Detection of growth restricted fetuses relies primarily on abdominal ultrasound examinations
      during pregnancy. Many clinicians, however, have not received systematic training and may
      therefore perform inadequately. We wish to examine, whether systematic, simulation-based
      training can improve diagnostic accuracy of estimated fetal weight by ultrasound at different
      levels of clinical experience.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants are physicians working at obstetric departments. Participant characteristics
      (age, experience in years and number of monthly scans) are recorded. Participants perform two
      abdominal growth scans prior to randomization and estimated fetal weight is compared to birth
      weight. Mean absolute percentage error is calculated as a measure of diagnostic accuracy.

      Participants are then randomized to either control (no intervention) or intervention. The
      latter group receives training on the Metaphor Scantrainer trans abdominal ultrasound
      simulator until they pass a previously validated test. After completing the training the
      participants use a mannikin to practice systematic approach and 'knobology'.

      All participants then perform another two growth scans. Diagnostic accuracy before and after
      the intervention or control period is compared.

      We wish to examine the effect of systematic training on the diagnostic accuracy of estimated
      fetal weight by ultrasound across different levels of clinical experience.

      If an effect can be found in the inexperienced participants, simulation-based training in
      obstetric ultrasound could be implemented as a part of basic obstetric training and/or as a
      means of maintaining skills.
