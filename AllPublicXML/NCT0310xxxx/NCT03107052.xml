  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 68-week study to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of fremanezumab in
      participants with cluster headache (CH). Participants who complete the pivotal studies
      TV48125-CNS-30056 (NCT02945046) and TV48125-CNS-30057 (NCT02964338) and enroll into the
      current study will visit the investigational center for investigational medicinal product
      (IMP) administration, safety and efficacy assessments, and blood and urine collections for
      pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity (anti-drug antibodies [ADAs]), and biomarker analyses.
      Participants will return to the investigational center for a follow-up visit to evaluate
      ADAs, fremanezumab concentrations, biomarkers, and safety (adverse events and concomitant
      medications) approximately 7.5 months after the last dose of IMP.

        <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that develops or worsens in severity during the conduct of a clinical study and does not necessarily have a causal relationship to the study drug. Relationship of AE to treatment was determined by the Investigator. Serious AEs include death, a life-threatening adverse event, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, a congenital anomaly or birth defect, or an important medical event that jeopardized the participant and required medical intervention to prevent the previously listed serious outcomes. A summary of other non-serious AEs and all serious AEs, regardless of causality is located in Reported AE section. Baseline refers to the baseline values from the pivotal studies.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Suicidal Ideation and Suicidal Behavior as Assessed by the Electronic Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (eC-SSRS)</title>
        <description>eC-SSRS is a questionnaire to assess suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior. Suicidal behavior was defined as a &quot;yes&quot; answer to any of 5 suicidal behavior questions: preparatory acts or behavior, aborted attempt, interrupted attempt, actual attempt, and completed suicide. Suicidal ideation was defined as a &quot;yes&quot; answer to any one of 5 suicidal ideation questions: wish to be dead, non-specific active suicidal thoughts, active suicidal ideation with methods without intent to act or some intent to act, without specific plan or with specific plan and intent, any self-injurious behavior with no suicidal intent. Baseline refers to the baseline values from the pivotal studies.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline up to follow-up (Week 68)</time_frame>
        <population>ITT analysis set included all participants who were enrolled in this study for long-term safety evaluation, regardless if they received study treatment or not.</population>
