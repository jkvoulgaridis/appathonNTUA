    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 52 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence (example; any unfavorable and unintended sign including abnormal laboratory findings, symptom or disease) in a participant or clinical investigation participant after providing written informed consent for participation in the study until the end of study visit. TEAEs were defined as adverse events started on or after the time of the first inhalation of study drug but no later than 7 days after the last administration (30 days in the case of SAEs). SAE was defined as any adverse event (appearance of [or worsening of any pre-existing]) undesirable sign, symptom or medical conditions which is fatal or life-threatening or results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or constitutes a congenital anomaly/birth defect or requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization or is medically significant.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Asthma Control Questionnaire-7 (ACQ-7) Total Score at Week 26 and 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 26, Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>ACQ-7 is a 7-item, disease-specific instrument developed and validated to assess asthma control in participants. All 7 items were scored on a 7-point Likert scale, with 0 indicating total control of asthma and 6 indicating poor control of asthma. The questions were equally weighted and the total score is the mean of the 7 items. A decrease of ACQ-7 score of at least 0.5 from baseline was considered to be clinically meaningful improvement.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Written informed consent must be obtained before any assessment is performed.

          -  Male and female adult patient ≥ 18 years old.

          -  Patients with a diagnosis of persistent asthma (GINA 2016) for a period of at least 1
             year prior to Visit 1.

          -  Patients who have used medium or high dose of ICS/LABA combinations for asthma for at
             least 3 months and at stable dose and regimen for at least 4 weeks prior to Visit 1.

          -  An ACQ-7 score ≥ 1.5 at Visits 2.

          -  Pre-bronchodilator FEV1 of ≥ 40% and ≤ 85% of the predicted normal value for the
             patient after withholding bronchodilators at Visit 2.

             o Repeating is allowed once only. Repeating of percentage predicted FEV1 should be
             done in an ad-hoc visit to be scheduled on a date that would provide sufficient time
             to receive confirmation from the spirometry data central reviewer of the validity of
             the assessment before Visit 99.

          -  Patients must demonstrate reversibility defined as an increase in FEV1 of ≥ 12% and
             200 mL within 15 to 30 minutes after administration of 400 µg of salbutamol at Visit
             2. Spacer devices are permitted during reversibility testing only. The Investigator or
             delegate may decide whether or not to use a spacer for the reversibility testing.

               -  If reversibility is not proven at Visit 2, patients may be permitted to enter the
                  study with historical evidence of reversibility that was performed within 5 years
                  prior to Visit 1.

               -  Alternatively, patients may be permitted to enter the study with a historical
                  positive bronchoprovocation test (defined as a provoked fall in FEV1 of 20% by
                  bronchoconstriction agent e.g., methacholine, histamine) or equivalent test
                  (e.g., astography) that was performed within 5 years prior to Visit 1.

               -  If reversibility is not proven at Visit 2 and historical data is not available,
                  reversibility should be repeated once in an ad-hoc visit scheduled as close as
                  possible from the first attempt (but not on the same day).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had an asthma attack/exacerbation requiring systemic steroids or
             hospitalization or emergency room visit within 6-weeks of Visit 1.

          -  Patients who have ever required intubation for a severe asthma attack/exacerbation.

          -  Patients who have a clinical condition which is likely to be worsened by ICS
             administration (e.g. glaucoma, cataract and fragility fractures) who are according to
             investigator's medical judgment at risk participating in the study.

          -  Patients with narrow-angle glaucoma, symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) or
             bladder-neck obstruction or severe renal impairment or urinary retention. BPH patients
             who are stable on treatment can be considered.

          -  Patients who have had a respiratory tract infection or asthma worsening as determined
             by investigator within 4 weeks prior to Visit 1 or between Visit 1 and Visit 99.
             Patients may be re-screened 4 weeks after recovery from their respiratory tract
             infection or asthma worsening.

          -  Patients with a history of chronic lung diseases other than asthma, including (but not
             limited to) COPD, sarcoidosis, interstitial lung disease, cystic fibrosis, clinically
             significant bronchiectasis and active tuberculosis.

          -  Patients with severe narcolepsy and/or insomnia

          -  Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women

          -  Women of child-bearing potential unless they are using highly effective methods of
             contraception during dosing and for 30 days after stopping of investigational
             medication

        <description>An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence (example; any unfavorable and unintended sign including abnormal laboratory findings, symptom or disease) in a participant or clinical investigation participant after providing written informed consent for participation in the study until the end of study visit. TEAEs were defined as adverse events started on or after the time of the first inhalation of study drug but no later than 7 days after the last administration (30 days in the case of SAEs). SAE was defined as any adverse event (appearance of [or worsening of any pre-existing]) undesirable sign, symptom or medical conditions which is fatal or life-threatening or results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or constitutes a congenital anomaly/birth defect or requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization or is medically significant.</description>
