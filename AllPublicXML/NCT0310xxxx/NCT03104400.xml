  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3 multicenter study that includes two periods. Period 1 is designed to
      compare the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of ABT-494 Dose A once daily (QD) and Dose B
      QD versus placebo and versus adalimumab every other week (eow) in participants with
      moderately to severely active Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA) and have an inadequate response to
      non-biologic DMARDs (DMARD-IR). Period 1 is also designed to compare the efficacy of ABT-494
      Dose A QD and Dose B QD versus placebo for the prevention of structural progression. Period 2
      evaluates the safety, tolerability and efficacy of ABT-494 Dose A QD and Dose B QD in
      participants with PsA who have completed Period 1.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Response defined as at least 20% reduction (improvement) compared with baseline in tender joint count (TJC), swollen joint count (SJC), and at least 3 of the 5 remaining ACR core set measures: patient's assessment of pain, patient's global assessment of disease activity (PtGA); physician's global assessment of disease activity (PhGA), Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP).</description>

    <measure>Change in HAQ-DI</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The HAQ DI is a patient-reported questionnaire. It includes the categories of dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip and common daily activities.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving a Static Investigator Global Assessment (sIGA) of Psoriasis of 0 or 1 and at least a 2-point Improvement From Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The sIGA is a 5 point score ranging from 0 to 4, based on the investigator's assessment of the average elevation, erythema, and scaling of all psoriatic lesions. The assessment is considered &quot;static&quot; which refers to the patients disease state at the time of the assessments, without comparison to any of the patient's previous disease states, whether at Baseline or at a previous visit.</description>

    <measure>Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) 75 Response (For Participants With &gt;= 3% Body Surface Area (BSA) Psoriasis at Baseline)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of participants with a greater than or equal to 75% reduction (improvement) in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score at Week 12. PASI is a composite measure of the level of erythema (redness of the skin), induration (hardening of the skin), and desquamation (peeling of the skin) on 4 sites (head, upper extremities, trunk, and lower extremities), each of which are rated on a 5-point scale from 0 (no symptoms) to 4 (very marked). The possible range for PASI score is 0 to 72, with the highest score representing complete erythroderma of the severest possible degree; a decrease in score indicates improvement.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36v2 is a general health-related quality of life (HRQoL) instrument with extensive use in multiple disease states. The SF-36v2 instrument comprises a total of 36 items (questions) targeting a participant's functional health and well-being in 8 domains (physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role emotional, and mental health). Domain scores are aggregated into a PCS score (range = 0 to 100; a higher score indicates better mental function and well-being).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-Fatigue) Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The FACIT-Fatigue questionnaire is a self-administered patient questionnaire that consists of 13 questions designed to measure the degree of fatigue experienced by participants in the previous 7 days. Participants respond to the questions on a scale from 'not at all' (0) to 'very much' (4). The scale score is computed by summing the item scores, after reversing those items that are worded in the negative direction. The FACIT-Fatigue subscale score ranges from 0 to 52, where higher scores represent less fatigue.</description>
