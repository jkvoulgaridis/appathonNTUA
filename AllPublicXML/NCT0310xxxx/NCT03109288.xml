    <textblock>
      Background:

      In people with multiple sclerosis (MS), brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers
      indicate inflammation or disease. Researchers want to see if 4 drugs given alone or combined
      affect MS biomarkers. They want to see if a change in biomarker levels can predict which
      drugs a person with MS might respond to.

      Objective:

      To see if signs of inflammation in CSF help predict a person s response to different drugs.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 18 and older who:

        -  Are in protocol 09-I-0032

        -  Have progressive MS

        -  Can stand and walk a few steps

        -  Take an MS drug

      Design:

      Participants will be screened in protocol 09-I-0032.

      Participants will take 1 of the 4 study drugs. Researchers will call after 1 month to see how
      they are doing. Some will start a second drug. They may take each drug or combination for up
      to 18 months.

      Participants will have 2 visits a year for up to 6 years. Visits include:

        -  Medical history

        -  Physical exam

        -  Blood and heart tests

        -  X-rays and scans

        -  Eye exam and tear collection

        -  Lumbar puncture: A needle inserted between back bones removes some CSF.

        -  Lymphocytapheresis: Blood is removed through a needle in one arm and run through a
           machine. The blood is returned through a needle in the other arm.

        -  A sensor on the forehead records blood flow and oxygen use.

        -  Participants may get a device for testing at home.

      Participants will stop taking the drugs if they have taken 2 drugs together for 18 months or
      if they do not do well on the drugs.

      Participants will be called 3 months later to see how they are doing.

      Objective

      Multiple inflammatory and neurodegenerative mechanisms drive progression of disability in
      fully established multiple sclerosis (MS); therefore, it is unlikely that a single
      therapeutic agent will be curative. Analogous to cardiovascular diseases, effective
      treatments for evolved MS will likely require individualized combination therapies that
      target pathogenic processes active in the particular patient. Ability to reliably measure
      such pathogenic processes in living patients is a prerequisite for a precision-medicine
      approach to MS.

      Using combinatorial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, we identified and validated
      molecular diagnostic tests of MS and its progressive stage, tests that correlate with
      clinical disability and brain atrophy (i.e., molecular tests of MS progression) and tests
      that predict future rates of disability progression (i.e., molecular tests of MS severity).

      These proteomic tests showed that intra-individually heterogeneous processes, different from
      those that drive MS susceptibility, underlie continuous accumulation of disability and brain
      atrophy in patients with progressive MS (PMS), or patients with relapsing-remitting (RRMS)
      treated with current disease-modifying treatments (DMTs). These processes include
      compartmentalized inflammation, activation of innate immunity such as myeloid lineage,
      complement and coagulation cascade, toxic astrocytosis, restructuring of the extracellular
      matrix in the form of fibrosis, and the re-expression (or lack of it) of developmental
      pathways related to neurogenesis and remyelination. These alternative, likely pathogenic
      mechanisms are essentially unaffected by current DMTs, consistent with observations of
      declining efficacy of FDA-approved DMTs with advancing age of MS patients, so that
      collectively, they offer no benefit on disability progression after age of approximately 53
      years. Consequently, the objectives of this protocol are: 1. To develop clinical trial
      methodology that allows economical screening of prospective therapeutic agents for their
      efficacy on biological processes related to MS disease severity using CSF biomarkers; 2. To
      develop knowledge base of intrathecal effects of current DMTs and novel treatments targeting
      varied mechanisms of MS progression; and 3. To establish and validate framework for
      development of effective combination therapies for MS via precision-medicine paradigm.

      Study population

      Patients with MS who continue to accumulate clinical disability while untreated (e.g. PMS
      subjects) or on FDA approved immunomodulatory therapies and are able to travel to NIH every 6
      months and undergo serial lumbar punctures (LP).

      Design

      The protocol has an adaptable workflow that allows simultaneous assessments of multiple
      therapeutic agents while maximizing potential therapeutic benefit to the studied subjects and
      providing knowledge necessary for rational development of future combination therapies for
      MS. To start with, we selected four agents, whose mechanism of action (MOA) have the
      potential to inhibit identified processes underlying MS disease severity. Patients will be
      assigned to one of the drugs that are not contra-indicated based on existing comorbidities
      and to which the patient has a therapeutic target (e.g. treatment that inhibits activation of
      myeloid lineage will be assigned only to patients who have elevated CSF biomarkers of myeloid
      lineage). Longitudinal measurements of CSF biomarkers will determine if the applied
      treatment(s) exert the desired pharmacodynamics (PD) effects in the intrathecal compartment.
      While those drugs that do not reproducibly effect CSF biomarkers will be dropped from further
      study (or will be tested in higher dose, if possible), drugs with measurable intrathecal PD
      activity will be combined to evaluate additive or synergistic effects. Safety, tolerability
      and pilot clinical/imaging efficacy data will evaluate surrogacy of the biomarkers and
      collect data for power analysis for future definitive trials. The increased understanding of
      biomarker biology will be utilized to derive process-specific combinatorial biomarkers and
      biomarker signatures predictive of clinical efficacy.

      Outcome measures

      Primary outcome will be the change in Combinatorial Weight adjusted dIsability ScalE
      (CombiWISE) progression at the end of monotherapy + combination therapy period in comparison
      to projected baseline disability progression. The acquired longitudinal data will be used for
      assessment of biomarker surrogacy, for identification and validation of PD markers for
      development of new therapeutic entities and for power analysis of future/definitive clinical
      trials.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Enrolled in 09-I-0032 protocol

          -  Clinically definite MS

          -  Age greater than or equal to 18 at time of study enrollment

          -  Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) 1.0-7.5

          -  Documented sustained clinical progression of at least 0.5 CombiWISE points/year
             (measured by greater than or equal to 4 time-points regression analysis of CombiWISE
             values spanning at least 1.5 years in total)

          -  Subjects of childbearing potential must be willing to use a medically acceptable form
             of birth control, which includes abstinence, while being treated on this study

          -  Patients who desire to continue their current FDA-approved DMTs based on its perceived
             (partial) therapeutic benefit will be enrolled with the understanding that the
             underlying FDA-approved therapy must remain stable during this protocol. If patient
             desires and/or his/her medical condition requires changing FDA-approved DMT during the
             duration of this protocol, the drugs administered under this protocol will be
             withdrawn, to establish new baseline of CSF biomarkers under changed therapy, and, if
             necessary, to establish new progression rate. New baseline of CSF biomarkers on
             changed therapy can be established after 6 months of new therapy. Because the efficacy
             of current DMTs decreases with patient s age so that on average, zero percent efficacy
             on disability progression occurs after age 53, only those patients who change to
             higher potency therapy (i.e., treatment escalation) before age 53 will need to repeat
             the entire process of establishing baseline progression rate: go back to greater than
             or equal to 1.5 year baseline period on new DMT to verify that the rate of progression
             remains greater than or equal to 0.5 CombiWISE points/year. Following therapeutic
             change that occurs before age 53 will be considered treatment escalation: 1.
             Initiation of any FDA-approved DMT in previously untreated subject or 2. Change from
             any low potency (i.e., copaxone, teriflunamide, interferon beta preparations, dimethyl
             fumarate and fingolimod) to any high potency drugs (i.e., natalizumab, ocrelizumab,
             rituximab, alemtuzumab, siponimod and mitoxantrone). All other therapy changes (i.e.,
             parallel change from low efficacy to low efficacy or from high efficacy to high
             efficacy, as well as discontinuation of treatment after age 53) will require new CSF
             baseline (6 months after such therapy change), but will not require 18 months to
             calculate new CombiWISE slope. After new CSF baseline, and, if necessary, new
             CombiWISE progression slopes are established, patient can be matched to the same
             monotherapy or combination therapy regimen they were on before the immunomodulatory
             DMT change.
