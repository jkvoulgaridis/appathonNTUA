      To study feasibility and implementation of a education videogame and the effects on
      adolescents knowledge and beliefs around tobacco products.

      The goal for sub-study 4 is to learn more about how an educational videogame can feasibly be
      implemented and disseminated in youth programs. For this sub-study we will further develop,
      expand, and refine the smokeSCREEN game and increase the game's reach on a national platform.
      The study will conduct the proposed evaluation by: working with game developers to develop a
      web- based version of the game, creating a pre-post survey to measure the effect of the game
      and building that into the smokeSCREEN game to anonymously collect information on players'
      knowledge and beliefs around tobacco products, and collaborating with youth programs to pilot
      test how the game can be implemented in real world settings.

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Participants completed a pre-survey through a secured, data collection website (Qualtrics Data Collection Software) and then played the videogame intervention. Fourteen questions were designed from the National Youth Tobacco Survey (2014)13 that focused on beliefs about cigarettes, e-cigarettes, and flavored tobacco were used. For beliefs, questions had 4-5 choices ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree or definitely yes to definitely not, or 5 response choices ranging from very unlikely to very likely.</description>

    <description>Participants completed a post-survey through a secured, data collection website (Qualtrics Data Collection Software), after they have played the videogame intervention. Fourteen questions were designed from the National Youth Tobacco Survey (2014)13 that focused on beliefs about cigarettes, e-cigarettes, and flavored tobacco were used for the survey. For beliefs, questions had 4-5 choices ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree or definitely yes to definitely not, or 5 response choices ranging from very unlikely to very likely.</description>

    <description>Participants completed a pre-survey through a secured, data collection website (Qualtrics Data Collection Software), played the videogame intervention, and then completed a post-survey using the same data collection website. Fourteen questions were designed from the National Youth Tobacco Survey (2014)13 that focused on knowledge about cigarettes, e-cigarettes, and flavored tobacco were used for the survey.
