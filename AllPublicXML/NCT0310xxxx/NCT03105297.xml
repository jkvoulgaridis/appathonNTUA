      This study was a baseline-controlled study. This study consisted of three phases: Baseline
      phase, 28 days Active phase (1 month in home treatment usage period with sleep laboratory
      nights after 7 (Night 8) and 28 days (Night 29) of treatment) followed by a two-night
      cross-over Nasal resistance phase. Screened participants were evaluated for sleep disordered
      breathing and PSG variables with sleep laboratory nights at Baseline, after 7 and 28 days of
      in house use of nasal dilator strip (Night 8 and 29 of Active phase), and at Day 30 and 31
      (Night 30 and 31 of Nasal resistance phase). Participants wore the Nasal dilator strip during
      Active phase. Participants then entered the Nasal resistance phase of the study, which
      consisted of two sleep laboratory nights at Day 30 and 31 (Night 30 and 31) where they were
      randomized to receive a sequence of either 'strip'/' no strip' or 'no strip'/'strip&quot; as per
      there randomization schedule.

    <measure>Total Score of Composite Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ) : Active Phase</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 29</time_frame>
    <description>The FOSQ was 30-item, validated psychometric instrument that assessed the impact of disorders of excessive sleepiness on functional outcomes relevant to daily behaviors and quality of life (QoL). The responses to the questionnaire were grouped according to five factors for analysis: 1) Activity Level, 2) Vigilance, 3) Intimacy and Sexual Relationships, 4) General Productivity and 5) Social Outcome. Participant used a scale of 0 to 4 to score each question of FOSQ which then grouped in above factors (where 0= I don't do this activity for other reasons, 1= Yes, extreme difficulty, 2= Yes, moderate difficulty, 3= Yes, a little difficulty, and 4= No difficulty). Total score of composite FOSQ was the sum of scores obtained on all 30 questions of the questionnaire. The possible range for the total score of composite FOSQ was from 0-120. A higher total score of composite FOSQ indicates better QoL of the participant.</description>

    <description>Participants answered the following question How likely are you to doze off or fall asleep in the following situations, in contrast to feeling just tired? 1. Sitting and reading, 2. Watching TV, 3. Sitting, inactive in a public place (e.g. a theatre or a meeting), 4. As a passenger in a car for an hour without a break, 5. Lying down to rest in the afternoon when circumstances permit, 6. Sitting and talking to someone, 7. Sitting quietly after a lunch without alcohol, and 8. In a car, while stopped for a few minutes in the traffic. Use the following scale to choose the most appropriate number for each situation: 0 = would never doze, 1 = slight chance of dozing, 2 = moderate chance of dozing, and 3 = high chance of dozing. Total ESS was calculated as the sum of all the individual scores observed for the above mentioned situations. The possible range for total ESS was 0-24. A lower total ESS indicates better sleep.</description>

          <description>The study consisted of 3 phases: baseline phase, 28 days active phase followed by a two-night cross-over nasal resistance phase. In the baseline phase all the participants applied nasal dilator strip during the sleep laboratory night on Day 1. During the active phase participants wore nasal dilator strip over a 1-month in-home use period and returned for sleep laboratory nights after 7 days (on Day 8) and 28 days (on Day 29) of treatment. The nasal resistance phase consisted of 2 sleep laboratory nights (Day 30 and 31), where the participants were randomized to receive a sequence of either 'strip'/' no strip' or no strip'/'strip' as per the randomization schedule</description>

        <description>The FOSQ was 30-item, validated psychometric instrument that assessed the impact of disorders of excessive sleepiness on functional outcomes relevant to daily behaviors and quality of life (QoL). The responses to the questionnaire were grouped according to five factors for analysis: 1) Activity Level, 2) Vigilance, 3) Intimacy and Sexual Relationships, 4) General Productivity and 5) Social Outcome. Participant used a scale of 0 to 4 to score each question of FOSQ which then grouped in above factors (where 0= I don't do this activity for other reasons, 1= Yes, extreme difficulty, 2= Yes, moderate difficulty, 3= Yes, a little difficulty, and 4= No difficulty). Total score of composite FOSQ was the sum of scores obtained on all 30 questions of the questionnaire. The possible range for the total score of composite FOSQ was from 0-120. A higher total score of composite FOSQ indicates better QoL of the participant.</description>

        <title>Total Epworth Sleepiness Scale Score (ESS) : Active Phase</title>
        <description>Participants answered the following question How likely are you to doze off or fall asleep in the following situations, in contrast to feeling just tired? 1. Sitting and reading, 2. Watching TV, 3. Sitting, inactive in a public place (e.g. a theatre or a meeting), 4. As a passenger in a car for an hour without a break, 5. Lying down to rest in the afternoon when circumstances permit, 6. Sitting and talking to someone, 7. Sitting quietly after a lunch without alcohol, and 8. In a car, while stopped for a few minutes in the traffic. Use the following scale to choose the most appropriate number for each situation: 0 = would never doze, 1 = slight chance of dozing, 2 = moderate chance of dozing, and 3 = high chance of dozing. Total ESS was calculated as the sum of all the individual scores observed for the above mentioned situations. The possible range for total ESS was 0-24. A lower total ESS indicates better sleep.</description>

        <title>Number of Snores Per Hour : Baseline, Active and Nasal Resistance Phase</title>
        <description>The Investigator or designee recorded the number of snores per hour during the participant's domiciled sleep visits. Numbers of snores were recorded for all participants with strip on Day 1 (Visit 2) in baseline phase, Day 8 (Visit 3) and Day 29 (Visit 4) in active phase, and in participants with and without strip on Day 30 (Visit 5) and Day 31 (Visit 6) cumulatively, in nasal resistance phase.</description>

            <description>The study consisted of 3 phases: baseline phase, 28 days active phase followed by a two-night cross-over nasal resistance phase. In the baseline phase all the participants applied nasal dilator strip during the sleep laboratory night on Day 1. During the active phase participants wore nasal dilator strip over a 1-month in-home use period and returned for sleep laboratory nights after 7 days (on Day 8) and 28 days (on Day 29) of treatment. The nasal resistance phase consisted of 2 sleep laboratory nights (Day 30 and 31), where the participants were randomized to receive a sequence of either 'strip'/' no strip' or no strip'/'strip' as per the randomization schedule</description>

            <description>The study consisted of 3 phases: baseline phase, 28 days active phase followed by a two-night cross-over nasal resistance phase. In the baseline phase all the participants applied nasal dilator strip during the sleep laboratory night on Day 1. During the active phase participants wore nasal dilator strip over a 1-month in-home use period and returned for sleep laboratory nights after 7 days (on Day 8) and 28 days (on Day 29) of treatment. The nasal resistance phase consisted of 2 sleep laboratory nights (Day 30 and 31), where the participants were randomized to receive a sequence of either 'strip'/' no strip' or no strip'/'strip' as per the randomization schedule</description>

            <description>This was a baseline-controlled study and consisted of 3 phases: baseline phase, 28 days active phase followed by a two-night cross-over nasal resistance phase. In the baseline phase all the participants were applied nasal dilator strip during the sleep laboratory night on Day 1 (Night 1). During the active phase all the participants wore nasal dilator strip over a 1 month in-home use period and returned for sleep laboratory nights after 7 (Day 8, Night 8) and 28 days (Day 29, Night 29) of treatment. The nasal resistance phase consisted of 2 sleep laboratory nights (Day 30 Night 30 and Day 31 Night 31), where the participants were randomized to receive a sequence of either 'strip'/' no strip' or 'no strip'/'strip' as per the randomization schedule</description>

            <description>The study consisted of 3 phases: baseline phase, 28 days active phase followed by a two-night cross-over nasal resistance phase. In the baseline phase all the participants applied nasal dilator strip during the sleep laboratory night on Day 1. During the active phase participants wore nasal dilator strip over a 1-month in-home use period and returned for sleep laboratory nights after 7 days (on Day 8) and 28 days (on Day 29) of treatment. The nasal resistance phase consisted of 2 sleep laboratory nights (Day 30 and 31), where the participants were randomized to receive a sequence of either 'strip'/' no strip' or no strip'/'strip' as per the randomization schedule</description>

        <title>Sleep Efficiency (SE) : Baseline, Active and Nasal Resistance Phase</title>
        <description>Sleep efficiency [SE, a polysomnography (PSG)] was measured as the percentage of total time in bed spent in sleep. It was calculated as the sum of Stage N1, Stage N2, Stage N3, and REM sleep, divided by the total time in bed and multiplied by 100. SE gives an overall sense of how well the participant slept and was measured for all participants with strip on Day 1 (Visit 2) in baseline phase, Day 8 (Visit 3) and Day 29 (Visit 4) in active phase, and in participants with and without strip on Day 30 (Visit 5) and Day 31 (Visit 6) cumulatively, in nasal resistance phase.</description>

        <title>Sleep Onset Latency (SOL) : Baseline, Active and Nasal Resistance Phase</title>
        <description>Sleep onset latency (SOL, a PSG parameter) was measured as the duration from the time when lights were turned off (as the participants attempted to sleep) till the time participant fell asleep. Determination of sleep and awake state was based on Electroencephalography (EEG) and behavioral parameters change. SOL was measured for all participants with strip on Day 1 (Visit 2) in baseline phase, Day 8 (Visit 3) and Day 29 (Visit 4) in active phase, and in participants with and without strip on Day 30 (Visit 5) and Day 31 (Visit 6) cumulatively, in nasal resistance phase.</description>

            <description>The study consisted of 3 phases: baseline phase, 28 days active phase followed by a two-night cross-over nasal resistance phase. In the baseline phase all the participants applied nasal dilator strip during the sleep laboratory night on Day 1. During the active phase participants wore nasal dilator strip over a 1-month in-home use period and returned for sleep laboratory nights after 7 days (on Day 8) and 28 days (on Day 29) of treatment. The nasal resistance phase consisted of 2 sleep laboratory nights (Day 30 and 31), where the participants were randomized to receive a sequence of either 'strip'/' no strip' or no strip'/'strip' as per the randomization schedule</description>

        <description>Non-Rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep stage consist of 3 progressively deeper stages of sleep: N1 (transition period from being awake to falling asleep), N2 (where breathing and heart rate began to slow) and N3 (slow wave sleep where body heals and repair itself). Sleep architecture (SA) was measured by the percentage of sleep time spent by the participants in each stage (time spent in each stage to total time spent in NREM, multiplied by 100). SA was measured for all participants with strip on Day 1 (Visit 2) in baseline phase, Day 8 (Visit 3) and Day 29 (Visit 4) in active phase, and in participants with and without strip on Day 30 (Visit 5) and Day 31 (Visit 6) cumulatively, in nasal resistance phase.</description>

        <description>Total NREM (N1, 2, and 3) and REM sleep were calculated as the time spent by a participant in the NREM (measured during stable sleep) and REM sleep stages. Total NREM and REM sleep was measured by overnight PSG using a computerized system for all participants with strip on Day 1 (Visit 2) in baseline phase, Day 8 (Visit 3) and Day 29 (Visit 4) in active phase, and in participants with and without strip on Day 30 (Visit 5) and Day 31 (Visit 6) cumulatively, in nasal resistance phase.</description>

            <description>The study consisted of 3 phases: baseline phase, 28 days active phase followed by a two-night cross-over nasal resistance phase. In the baseline phase all the participants applied nasal dilator strip during the sleep laboratory night on Day 1. During the active phase participants wore nasal dilator strip over a 1-month in-home use period and returned for sleep laboratory nights after 7 days (on Day 8) and 28 days (on Day 29) of treatment. The nasal resistance phase consisted of 2 sleep laboratory nights (Day 30 and 31), where the participants were randomized to receive a sequence of either 'strip'/' no strip' or no strip'/'strip' as per the randomization schedule</description>

        <title>Respiratory Effort Related Arousals (RERA) : Baseline, Active and Nasal Resistance Phase</title>
        <description>Respiratory Effort Related Arousal (RERA) was flattening of an inspiratory portion of nasal pressure with increased respiratory effort leading to arousal. The total number of arousals per hour were calculated as RERA. RERA was measured all participants with strip on Day 1 (Visit 2) in baseline phase, Day 8 (Visit 3) and Day 29 (Visit 4) in active phase, and in participants with and without strip on Day 30 (Visit 5) and Day 31 (Visit 6) cumulatively, in nasal resistance phase.</description>

            <description>The study consisted of 3 phases: baseline phase, 28 days active phase followed by a two-night cross-over nasal resistance phase. In the baseline phase all the participants applied nasal dilator strip during the sleep laboratory night on Day 1. During the active phase participants wore nasal dilator strip over a 1-month in-home use period and returned for sleep laboratory nights after 7 days (on Day 8) and 28 days (on Day 29) of treatment. The nasal resistance phase consisted of 2 sleep laboratory nights (Day 30 and 31), where the participants were randomized to receive a sequence of either 'strip'/' no strip' or no strip'/'strip' as per the randomization schedule</description>

        <title>Percentage of Lowest Arterial Oxygen Saturation (SAO2) During Rapid Eye Movement (REM) and Non-rapid Eye Movement (REM) Sleep Stage : Baseline, Active and Nasal Resistance Phase</title>
        <description>Arterial oxygen saturation (SAO2) is the fraction of [oxygen]-saturated hemoglobin relative to total hemoglobin (unsaturated + saturated) in the blood. SAO2 in NREM and REM sleep was measured overnight by pulse oximetry with a finger probe using a computerized system. Lowest SAO2 values observed during the NREM and REM sleep were recorded for this endpoint. Oximetry measurements were performed in all participants with strip on Day 1 (Visit 2) in baseline phase, Day 8 (Visit 3) and Day 29 (Visit 4) in active phase, and in participants with and without strip on Day 30 (Visit 5) and Day 31 (Visit 6) cumulatively, in nasal resistance phase.</description>

In the baseline phase all the participants applied nasal dilator strip during the sleep laboratory night on Day 1. During the active phase participants wore nasal dilator strip over a 1-month in-home use period and returned for sleep laboratory nights after 7 days (on Day 8) and 28 days (on Day 29) of treatment. The nasal resistance phase consisted of 2 sleep laboratory nights (Day 30 and 31), where the participants were randomized to receive a sequence of either 'strip'/' no strip' or no strip'/'strip' as per the randomization schedule</description>

          <title>Percentage of Lowest Arterial Oxygen Saturation (SAO2) During Rapid Eye Movement (REM) and Non-rapid Eye Movement (REM) Sleep Stage : Baseline, Active and Nasal Resistance Phase</title>
          <description>Arterial oxygen saturation (SAO2) is the fraction of [oxygen]-saturated hemoglobin relative to total hemoglobin (unsaturated + saturated) in the blood. SAO2 in NREM and REM sleep was measured overnight by pulse oximetry with a finger probe using a computerized system. Lowest SAO2 values observed during the NREM and REM sleep were recorded for this endpoint. Oximetry measurements were performed in all participants with strip on Day 1 (Visit 2) in baseline phase, Day 8 (Visit 3) and Day 29 (Visit 4) in active phase, and in participants with and without strip on Day 30 (Visit 5) and Day 31 (Visit 6) cumulatively, in nasal resistance phase.</description>
          <population>Per protocol population included all participants who fully complied with all study procedures and restrictions. Here, number analyzed signifies participants who were evaluable at specified timepoints.</population>

        <title>Average Oxygen Desaturation During Sleep : Baseline, Active and Nasal Resistance Phase</title>
        <description>Oxygen desaturation is the drop in blood's oxygen level per hours of sleep. Average drop in oxygen level during total sleep was measured overnight by pulse oximetry with a finger probe using a computerized system. Oximetry measurements were performed in all participants with strip on Day 1 (Visit 2) in baseline phase, Day 8 (Visit 3) and Day 29 (Visit 4) in active phase, and in participants with and without strip on Day 30 (Visit 5) and Day 31 (Visit 6) cumulatively, in nasal resistance phase.</description>

In the baseline phase all the participants applied nasal dilator strip during the sleep laboratory night on Day 1. During the active phase participants wore nasal dilator strip over a 1-month in-home use period and returned for sleep laboratory nights after 7 days (on Day 8) and 28 days (on Day 29) of treatment. The nasal resistance phase consisted of 2 sleep laboratory nights (Day 30 and 31), where the participants were randomized to receive a sequence of either 'strip'/' no strip' or no strip'/'strip' as per the randomization schedule</description>

        <title>Apnea/Hypopnea Index (AHI) : Baseline, Active and Nasal Resistance Phase</title>
        <description>Apnea/Hypopnea Index (AHI) was measured as the number of events (apnea and hypopnea) per hour of sleep. AHI was measured using overnight by PSG using a computerized system. PSG was performed in all participants with strip on Day 1 (Visit 2) in baseline phase, Day 8 (Visit 3) and Day 29 (Visit 4) in active phase, and in participants with and without strip on Day 30 (Visit 5) and Day 31 (Visit 6) cumulatively, in nasal resistance phase.</description>

            <description>The study consisted of 3 phases: baseline phase, 28 days active phase followed by a two-night cross-over nasal resistance phase. In the baseline phase all the participants applied nasal dilator strip during the sleep laboratory night on Day 1. During the active phase participants wore nasal dilator strip over a 1-month in-home use period and returned for sleep laboratory nights after 7 days (on Day 8) and 28 days (on Day 29) of treatment. The nasal resistance phase consisted of 2 sleep laboratory nights (Day 30 and 31), where the participants were randomized to receive a sequence of either 'strip'/' no strip' or no strip'/'strip' as per the randomization schedule</description>
