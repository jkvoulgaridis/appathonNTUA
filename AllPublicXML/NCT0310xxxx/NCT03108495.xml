    <textblock>
      Prospective, multicenter, single-arm, open label, interventional study evaluating adoptive
      cell therapy (ACT) with autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) infusion (LN-145)
      followed by IL-2 after a non-myeloablative (NMA) lymphodepletion preparative regimen for the
      treatment of patients with recurrent, metastatic, or persistent cervical carcinoma
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      LN-145 is an adoptive cell transfer therapy that utilizes an autologous TIL manufacturing
      process, as originally developed by the NCI, for the treatment of patients with recurrent,
      metastatic, or persistent cervical carcinoma. The cell transfer therapy used in this study
      involves patients receiving a NMA lymphocyte depleting preparative regimen, followed by
      infusion of autologous TIL followed by the administration of a regimen of IL-2.

          3. At least one resectable lesion (or aggregate of lesions resected) of a minimum 1.5 cm
             in diameter post resection to generate TIL; surgical removal with minimal morbidity

             metastatic or persistent cervical carcinoma

               -  A line of systemic therapy is defined as any chemotherapy or multiple-agent
                  chemotherapy regimen that was administered for recurrent, metastatic or
                  persistent SCC, ASC, or AC of the cervix.

               -  A bevacizumab and chemotherapy combination is encouraged as a prior line of
                  treatment

               -  Neither chemoradiation, nor chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant settings
                  are considered as a prior line of systemic therapy.

             (ie, PD-1, PD-L1])

             Cohort 3: Must have not received any therapies other than prior chemoradiation or
             surgery for loco-regional disease

          6. Any prior therapy directed at the malignant tumor must be discontinued at least 28
             days prior to tumor resection. Radiation therapy may have been received up to 28 days
             prior to tumor resection for lesions not expected to be used for TIL generation or
             target lesions.

          7. Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1

          8. Patients must be seronegative for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Patients
             with positive serology for hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B core
             antibody (anti-HBc), or hepatitis C virus antibody (HCV Ab) indicating acute or
             chronic infection may be enrolled if the viral load by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
             is undetectable with/without active treatment.

          9. Patients of childbearing potential must be willing to take the appropriate precaution
             to avoid pregnancy for the duration of the study and practice an approved, highly
             effective method of birth control during treatment and for 12 months after receiving
             the last protocol-related therapy.

         10. Prior to study Enrollment (tumor resection), patient must have documentation of
             radiological disease progression after the most recent therapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who have received an organ allograft or prior cell transfer therapy except

          2. Patients who are on chronic systemic steroid therapy

          3. Patients who currently have prior therapy-related toxicities Grade &gt; 1 according to

             cardiac stress test, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmia, obstructive or
             restrictive pulmonary disease, or other conditions that in the opinion of the
             Investigator would increase the risk of participation
