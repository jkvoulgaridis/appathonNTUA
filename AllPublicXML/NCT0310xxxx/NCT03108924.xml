  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial aims to evaluate the plasma pharmacokinetics of gefapixant (MK-7264) administered
      to participants with varying degrees of renal insufficiency (RI) compared to healthy matched
      controls; and to investigate the extent of MK-7264 removal by hemodialysis (HD) in
      participants with end stage renal disease (ESRD), following administration of a single 50 mg
      dose of gefapixant.

    <description>The mean area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 to infinity (AUC0-inf) of plasma gefapixant was assessed. In Part 1, participants with Moderate RI, Severe RI, or normal renal function (i. e., Healthy Controls) received a single oral dose of gefapixant 50 mg at Hour 0 on Day 1. In Part 2, Period 1, ESRD participants received a single oral dose of gefapixant 50 mg at Hour 0 on Day 1, immediately following the scheduled HD. In Part 2, Period 2, participants received a single oral dose of gefapixant 50 mg at Hour 0 on Day 1, approximately 2 hours prior to initiation of HD. Non-model based summary statistics were provided for the number of participants with non-missing data, as well as mean and standard deviation values. Serial blood samples for the determination of plasma gefapixant concentrations were collected at predose and at selected time points over 72 hours postdose.</description>

    <description>To evaluate the extent of gefapixant removal by hemodialysis, individual values of AUC0-inf, were natural log (ln)-transformed and analyzed using a linear mixed-effects model with population (ESRD Non-HD, ESRD HD) as a fixed effect. An unstructured covariance matrix was used to allow for unequal variances and to model the correlation between the 2 measurements within each participant. A two-sided 90% confidence interval (CI) for the true difference in means was calculated for AUC0-inf. These confidence limits were exponentiated to obtain the 90% CI for the geometric least squares mean ratio (GMR) (ESRD HD/ESRD Non-HD) for AUC0-inf.</description>

    <description>AUC0-inf values of plasma gefapixant based on BSA-normalized eGFR for participants with moderate RI, severe RI, or normal renal function (i. e., Healthy Controls) were estimated using regression analysis. Individual values of AUC0-inf were natural log-transformed and evaluated with a linear fixed-effects model containing BSA-normalized eGFR as a continuous variable. The back transformed mean AUC0-inf and corresponding 95% CI were predicted at the midpoint of the BSA enormalized eGFR range for each group (45 mL/min, 22.5 mL/min, and 139 mL/min for moderate RI, severe RI, and healthy controls, respectively). Although no participants with mild RI were included in this study, their normalized eGFR estimates were predicted at midpoint 75 mL/min.</description>

    <description>Geometric mean and 95%CI for AUC0-inf were estimated in participants with moderate RI, severe RI, ESRD requiring but not receiving HD, and normal renal function (i. e., Healthy Controls). Individual values of AUC0-inf, were ln-transformed and evaluated with a linear fixed-effects heterogeneous variance model containing a categorical effect for population (ESRD Non-HD, severe RI, moderate RI, and healthy matched control, based on BSA normalized eGFR). To compare subjects with RI in each of the renal categories to subjects with normal renal function, a two-sided 90% CI for the true difference in means (renal impairment - normal renal function) was calculated for AUC0-inf, using the mean square error from the model and referencing a t-distribution.

    <measure>[Parts 1 and 2] Estimated CLr of Gefapixant 50 mg in Participants With BSA Non-Normalized eGFR (Regression Analysis)</measure>
    <time_frame>Parts 1 and 2 - Predose and at 0-12 hrs, 12-24 hrs, and 24-48 hrs post dose</time_frame>
    <description>CLr values of plasma gefapixant based on BSA non-normalized eGFR for participants with moderate RI, severe RI, or normal renal function (i. e., Healthy Controls) were estimated using regression analysis. Individual values of CLr were natural log-transformed and evaluated with a linear fixed-effects model containing BSA non-normalized eGFR as a continuous variable. The back transformed mean AUC0-inf and corresponding 95% CI were predicted at the midpoint of the BSA non-normalized eGFR range for each group (45 mL/min, 22.5 mL/min, and 139 mL/min for moderate RI, severe RI, and healthy controls, respectively). Although no participants with mild RI were included in this study, their BSA non-normalized eGFR estimates were predicted at midpoint 75 mL/min.</description>

    <measure>[Parts 1 and 2] Number of Participants Experiencing an Adverse Event (AE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Parts 1 and 2 - Up to 29 days.</time_frame>
    <description>The number of participants who experienced at least one adverse event (AE) was assessed. An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure.</description>

        <description>The mean area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 to infinity (AUC0-inf) of plasma gefapixant was assessed. In Part 1, participants with Moderate RI, Severe RI, or normal renal function (i. e., Healthy Controls) received a single oral dose of gefapixant 50 mg at Hour 0 on Day 1. In Part 2, Period 1, ESRD participants received a single oral dose of gefapixant 50 mg at Hour 0 on Day 1, immediately following the scheduled HD. In Part 2, Period 2, participants received a single oral dose of gefapixant 50 mg at Hour 0 on Day 1, approximately 2 hours prior to initiation of HD. Non-model based summary statistics were provided for the number of participants with non-missing data, as well as mean and standard deviation values. Serial blood samples for the determination of plasma gefapixant concentrations were collected at predose and at selected time points over 72 hours postdose.</description>

        <description>To evaluate the extent of gefapixant removal by hemodialysis, individual values of AUC0-inf, were natural log (ln)-transformed and analyzed using a linear mixed-effects model with population (ESRD Non-HD, ESRD HD) as a fixed effect. An unstructured covariance matrix was used to allow for unequal variances and to model the correlation between the 2 measurements within each participant. A two-sided 90% confidence interval (CI) for the true difference in means was calculated for AUC0-inf. These confidence limits were exponentiated to obtain the 90% CI for the geometric least squares mean ratio (GMR) (ESRD HD/ESRD Non-HD) for AUC0-inf.</description>

        <title>[Part 1] Estimated AUC0-inf of Gefapixant 50 mg in Participants With Body Surface Area (BSA)-Normalized Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) (Regression Analysis)</title>
        <description>AUC0-inf values of plasma gefapixant based on BSA-normalized eGFR for participants with moderate RI, severe RI, or normal renal function (i. e., Healthy Controls) were estimated using regression analysis. Individual values of AUC0-inf were natural log-transformed and evaluated with a linear fixed-effects model containing BSA-normalized eGFR as a continuous variable. The back transformed mean AUC0-inf and corresponding 95% CI were predicted at the midpoint of the BSA enormalized eGFR range for each group (45 mL/min, 22.5 mL/min, and 139 mL/min for moderate RI, severe RI, and healthy controls, respectively). Although no participants with mild RI were included in this study, their normalized eGFR estimates were predicted at midpoint 75 mL/min.</description>

        <title>[Part 1] Estimated AUC0-inf of Gefapixant 50 mg in Participants With BSA Non-Normalized eGFR (Regression Analysis)</title>
        <description>AUC0-inf values of plasma gefapixant based on BSA non-normalized eGFR for participants with moderate RI, severe RI, or normal renal function (i. e., Healthy Controls) were estimated using regression analysis. Individual values of AUC0-inf were natural log-transformed and evaluated with a linear fixed-effects model containing BSA non-normalized eGFR as a continuous variable. The back transformed mean AUC0-inf and corresponding 95% CI were predicted at the midpoint of the BSA non-normalized eGFR range for each group (45 mL/min, 22.5 mL/min, and 139 mL/min for moderate RI, severe RI, and healthy controls, respectively). Although no participants with mild RI were included in this study, their BSA non-normalized eGFR estimates were predicted at midpoint 75 mL/min.</description>

        <population>All participants in Part 1 who were compliant with the study procedure and had available data were included. For non-normalized eGFR estimates, participants originally assigned to the severe RI group were reassigned: 1 participant reassigned to the mild RI group (excluded from analysis), and 1 participant reassigned to the moderate RI group.</population>

        <description>Geometric mean and 95%CI for AUC0-inf were estimated in participants with moderate RI, severe RI, ESRD requiring but not receiving HD, and normal renal function (i. e., Healthy Controls). Individual values of AUC0-inf, were ln-transformed and evaluated with a linear fixed-effects heterogeneous variance model containing a categorical effect for population (ESRD Non-HD, severe RI, moderate RI, and healthy matched control, based on BSA normalized eGFR). To compare subjects with RI in each of the renal categories to subjects with normal renal function, a two-sided 90% CI for the true difference in means (renal impairment - normal renal function) was calculated for AUC0-inf, using the mean square error from the model and referencing a t-distribution. For each of the RI populations, these confidence limits were exponentiated to obtain the 90% CI for the GMR (renal impairment/normal renal function).</description>

        <description>To evaluate the extent of gefapixant removal by hemodialysis, individual values of AUC0-last, were ln-transformed and analyzed using a linear mixed-effects model with population (ESRD Non-HD, ESRD HD) as a fixed effect.

A two-sided 90% CI for the true difference in means was calculated for AUC0-last.

        <description>AUC0-last values of plasma gefapixant based on BSA-normalized eGFR for participants with moderate RI, severe RI, or normal renal function (i. e., Healthy Controls) were estimated using regression analysis. Individual values of AUC0last were natural log-transformed and evaluated with a linear fixed-effects model containing BSA-normalized eGFR as a continuous variable. The mean AUC0-ilast and corresponding 95% CI were back-transformed and predicted at the midpoint of th BSA enormalized eGFR range for each group (45 mL/min, 22.5 mL/min, and 139 mL/min for moderate RI, severe RI, and healthy controls, respectively). Although no participants with mild RI were included in this study, their normalized eGFR estimates were predicted at midpoint 75 mL/min.</description>

        <description>Geometric mean and 95%CI for AUC0-last were estimated in participants with moderate RI, severe RI, ESRD requiring but not receiving HD, and normal renal function (i. e., Healthy Controls). Individual values of AUC0-last, were ln-transformed and evaluated with a linear fixed-effects heterogeneous variance model containing a categorical effect for population (ESRD Non-HD, severe RI, moderate RI, and healthy matched control, based on BSA normalized eGFR). To compare subjects with RI in each of the renal categories to subjects with normal renal function, a two-sided 90% CI for the true difference in means (renal impairment - normal renal function) was calculated for AUC0-last, using the mean square error from the model and referencing a t-distribution.

        <description>To evaluate the extent of gefapixant removal by hemodialysis, individual values of Cmax, were ln transformed and analyzed using a linear mixed-effects model with population (ESRD Non-HD, ESRD HD) as a fixed effect. An unstructured covariance matrix was used to allow for unequal variances and to model the correlation between the 2 measurements within each participant. A two-sided 90% CI for the true difference in means was calculated for Cmax. These confidence limits were exponentiated to obtain the 90% CI for the geometric least squares mean ratio (GMR) (ESRD HD/ESRD Non-HD) for Cmax.</description>

        <description>Cmax values of plasma gefapixant based on BSA-normalized eGFR for participants with moderate RI, severe RI, or normal renal function (i. e., Healthy Controls) were estimated using regression analysis. Individual values of Cmax were natural log-transformed and evaluated with a linear fixed-effects model containing BSA-normalized eGFR as a continuous variable. The back transformed mean Cmax and corresponding 95% CI were predicted at the midpoint of the BSA enormalized eGFR range for each group (45 mL/min, 22.5 mL/min, and 139 mL/min for moderate RI, severe RI, and healthy controls, respectively). Although no participants with mild RI were included in this study, their normalized eGFR estimates were predicted at midpoint 75 mL/min.

To compare subjects with RI in each of the renal categories to subjects with normal renal function, a two-sided 90% CI for the true difference in means (renal impairment - normal renal function) was calculated for Cmax, using the mean square error from the model and referencing a t-distribution. For each of the RI populations, these confidence limits were exponentiated to obtain the 90% CI for the GMR (renal impairment/normal renal function).</description>
          <population>All Parts 1 and 2 participants who were compliant with the study procedure and had available data were included. A single participant was excluded from the ESRD Non-HD group since this participant had 6 missing peripheral plasma samples in Part 2, Period 1.</population>

          <title>[Part 1] Estimated CL/F of Gefapixant 50 mg in Participants With BSA Non-Normalized eGFR (Regression Analysis)</title>
          <description>CL/F values of plasma gefapixant based on BSA non-normalized eGFR for participants with moderate RI, severe RI, or normal renal function (i. e., Healthy Controls) were estimated using regression analysis. Individual values of CL/F were natural log-transformed and evaluated with a linear fixed-effects model containing BSA non-normalized eGFR as a continuous variable. The back transformed mean CL/F and corresponding 95% CI were predicted at the midpoint of the BSA non-normalized eGFR range for each group (45 mL/min, 22.5 mL/min, and 139 mL/min for moderate RI, severe RI, and healthy controls, respectively). Although no participants with mild RI were included in this study, their BSA non-normalized eGFR estimates were predicted at midpoint 75 mL/min.</description>

        <description>Geometric mean and 95% CI for CL/F were estimated in participants with moderate RI, severe RI, ESRD requiring but not receiving HD, and normal renal function (i. e., Healthy Controls). Individual values of CL/F, were ln-transformed and evaluated with a linear fixed-effects heterogeneous variance model containing a categorical effect for population (ESRD Non-HD, severe RI, moderate RI, and healthy matched control, based on BSA normalized eGFR). To compare subjects with RI in each of the renal categories to subjects with normal renal function, a two-sided 90% CI for the true difference in means (renal impairment - normal renal function) was calculated for CL/F, using the mean square error from the model and referencing a t-distribution. For each of the RI populations, these confidence limits were exponentiated to obtain the 90% CI for the GMR (renal impairment/normal renal function).</description>

        <title>[Parts 1 and 2] Estimated CLr of Gefapixant 50 mg in Participants With BSA-Normalized eGFR (Regression Analysis)</title>
        <description>CLr values of plasma gefapixant based on BSA-normalized eGFR for participants with moderate RI, severe RI, or normal renal function (i. e., Healthy Controls) were estimated using regression analysis. Individual values of CLr were natural log-transformed and evaluated with a linear fixed-effects model containing BSA-normalized eGFR as a continuous variable. The back transformed mean CLr and corresponding 95% CI were predicted at the midpoint of the BSA-normalized eGFR range for each group (45 mL/min, 22.5 mL/min, and 139 mL/min for moderate RI, severe RI, and healthy controls, respectively). Although no participants with mild RI were included in this study, their normalized eGFR estimates were predicted at midpoint 75 mL/min.</description>
