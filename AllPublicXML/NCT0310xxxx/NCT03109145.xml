      The overall goal of this project is to determine the effectiveness of the MEANS (MyHealtheVet
      to Enable And Negotiate for Shared decision making) intervention in improving women's
      self-reported knowledge and rates of diagnosis and appropriate management of menopause
      symptoms. The proposed intervention is an educational and shared decision making platform for
      menopause symptoms to improve communication between patients and their providers regarding
      menopause symptoms. MEANS combines educational secure messages through the Veterans Affairs
      online Personal Health Record called MyHealtheVet, along with face-to-face and print
      interventions.

      MEANS will be applied in target population consisting of postmenopausal women Veterans ages
      45 to 60 who receive primary care at the Miami Veterans Affairs Healthcare System. This
      project will enroll women in MyHealtheVet, develop a library of menopause symptoms material
      for distribution, and evaluate how useful of MyHealtheVet use for educating and tracking
      women regarding menopause symptoms.
