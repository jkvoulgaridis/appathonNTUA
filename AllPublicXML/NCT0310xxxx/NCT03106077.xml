    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well mirvetuximab soravtansine works as first line in
      treating patients with triple negative breast cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      mirvetuximab soravtansine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either
      by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  I. Determine if mirvetuximab soravtansine as a single agent is likely to induce response
           in at least 20% of patients with metastatic folate receptor (FR) alpha+ triple negative
           breast cancer (TNBC).

        -  II. Determine if mirvetuximab soravtansine as a single agent in the neoadjuvant setting
           will improve rates of excellent pathologic response (pathologic complete response
           [pCR]/residual cancer burden [RCB]-0 or RCB-I) from 5% to 20% in patients with high
           risk, chemotherapy insensitive, FRalpha+ TNBC.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  I. Determine the radiographic response rate as measured by ultrasound and/ or magnetic
           resonance imaging (MRI) (partial response + complete clinical response) for mirvetuximab
           soravtansine in chemotherapy insensitive, FRalpha

           + localized TNBC or using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria
           in patients with FRalpha+ advanced TNBC.

        -  II. Determine toxicity of 4 cycles of mirvetuximab soravtansine given in the neoadjuvant
           setting following anthracycline based therapy (Cohort B) and unrestricted cycles in
           patients receiving therapy in the advanced/metastatic setting (Cohort A).

        -  III. Determine disease free survival (DFS) at 3 years for patients treated with
           mirvetuximab soravtansine given in the neoadjuvant setting; progression free survival
           (PFS), duration of response (DOR) and overall survival at 3 years (overall survival [OS]
           at 3 years) in patients receiving therapy for advanced/ metastatic TNBC.

        -  IV. Compare disease response (as measured by pCR/RCB-I) in patients with FRalpha+
           chemotherapy resistant disease treated on clinical trial with mirvetuximab soravtansine
           in the neoadjuvant setting to those with similar molecular features who receive standard
           taxane-based chemotherapy as the second phase of their NACT.
