  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2-part trial: a Phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation study in subjects with
      metastatic or locally advanced solid tumors, with a consecutive Phase 2 expansion to evaluate
      efficacy in subjects with recurrent, unresectable, or metastatic (advanced) cervical cancer
      that has progressed after a platinum-based treatment regimen.

      Phase 1: Dose Escalation

      Phase 1 will consist of a standard 3+3 dose escalation with the following escalating dose
      levels and schedules:

      Part A1: 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg administered every 2 weeks Part A2: 6 and 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks
      Each subject will stay on the dose level and schedule assigned at trial entry. Subjects will
      receive AGEN2034 for a maximum of 2 years or until confirmed progression, unacceptable
      toxicity, or any criterion for stopping the study drug or withdrawal from the trial occurs.

      A Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) will assess safety; decide on dose-escalation and opening
      of backfill enrollment; define the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D); and determine opening of
      the phase 2 cohorts.

      In Part A1, the first subject of each cohort will be observed for 16 days (i.e., ≥ 48 hours
      after second dose) for occurrence of DLT before the second subject is administered trial
      medication. Thereafter, within each cohort, consecutively enrolled subjects may initiate
      treatment ≥ 48 hours after the prior enrolled subject initiated treatment. Dose escalation
      will continue until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is reached or the maximum planned dose
      level (10.0 mg/kg) is shown to be safe. The MTD is defined as the dose below which ≥ 2 DLTs
      are observed.

      Once Part A1 is completed, enrollment to Part A2 will begin. If &lt; 2 DLTs are observed in Part
      A1 at the maximum planned dose of 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks, open enrollment to Part A2 will
      begin with enrollment of 10 subjects at 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks, followed by open enrollment of
      10 subjects at 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks. If ≥ 2 DLTs are observed in Part A1, at the maximum
      planned dose in Part A1, the standard 3+3 dose escalation will resume with Part A2 where
      consecutively enrolled subjects in dose escalation may initiate treatment ≥ 48 hours after
      the prior enrolled subject initiated treatment.

      For cohorts in dose escalation, concurrent with the 3+3 dose escalation schema, additional
      subjects will be backfilled to lower dose levels to ensure that each cohort enrolls a total
      of 10 subjects. Subjects enrolled to backfill cohorts may be enrolled simultaneously, without
      sequential dosing (i.e., not required to wait 48 hours between 2 subjects). These additional
      subjects at each dose level will have the purpose of generating additional safety, PK, and
      receptor occupancy data, and will not undergo formal DLT observation.

      Phase 2: Dose Expansion

      To further characterize safety and efficacy, subjects with recurrent, unresectable, or
      metastatic cervical cancer will be enrolled in Phase 2 and receive the RP2D of AGEN2034 (3
      mg/kg every 2 weeks) for a maximum of 2 years or until confirmed progression, unacceptable
      toxicity, or any criterion for stopping the study drug or withdrawal from the trial occurs.

      An SMC will assess safety, and an Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will evaluate
      safety and efficacy.

          2. Be ≥ 18 years of age.

          3. Diagnosis and prior systemic treatment:

               1. Phase 1: Have a histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of a
                  metastatic or locally advanced solid tumor for which no standard therapy is
                  available or standard therapy has failed.

               2. Phase 2:

             I. Have (1) a histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of squamous-cell
             carcinoma, adenosquamous carcinoma, or adenocarcinoma of the cervix, and (2)
             metastatic, locally advanced, and/or unresectable disease at the time of enrollment.
             Histologic confirmation of the original primary tumor is required via pathology
             report.

             Note: The following cervical tumors are not eligible: minimal deviation/adenoma
             malignum, gastric type adenocarcinoma, clear cell carcinoma, and mesonephric
             carcinoma.

             II. Has cervical cancer and has relapsed after a platinum-based treatment (first line)
             regimen for advanced (recurrent, unresectable, or metastatic) disease; Note: Subjects
             who have received &gt; 1 prior systemic treatment regimen for their advanced or
             metastatic disease will be eligible in the following cases: Subject receiving
             chemotherapy concurrently with primary radiation (e.g., weekly cisplatin) or subject
             receiving adjuvant chemotherapy following completion of radiation therapy (e.g.,
             paclitaxel and carboplatin for ≤ 4 cycles) and progressed within 6 months after
             treatment completion.

          4. Measurable disease - based on investigator assessment

               1. Phase 1: Have objective evidence of disease; the presence of measurable disease
                  is not required.

               2. Phase 2: Have measurable disease on imaging based on RECIST version 1.1. Note:
                  Subjects must have at least one &quot;target lesion&quot; to be used to assess response, as
                  defined by RECIST version 1.1. Tumors within a previously irradiated field will
                  be designated as &quot;non-target&quot; lesions unless progression is documented or a
                  biopsy is obtained to confirm persistence at least 90 days following completion
                  of radiation therapy.

             Note: Measurable disease by RECIST 1.1 must be confirmed by independent central
             radiologic review prior to first dose. Subjects without centrally confirmed measurable
             disease at baseline will not be eligible for this trial.

                  upper limit of normal (IULN), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level ≤ 2.5 x
                  IULN, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level ≤ 2.5 x IULN, and alkaline phosphatase
                  ≤ 2.5 x IULN.

               3. Adequate renal function defined as creatinine ≤ 1.5 x IULN OR calculated
                  creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min for subjects with creatinine levels &gt; 1.5 x IULN
                  (if no local guideline is available, creatinine clearance should be calculated
                  using the Cockcroft-Gault Method).

          7. Other than the cancer for which the subject is enrolled, have no history of prior
             malignancy, with the exception of basal cell carcinoma of the skin, superficial
             bladder cancer, squamous-cell carcinoma of the skin, or has undergone potentially
             curative therapy with no evidence of that disease recurrence for 5 years since
             initiation of that therapy.

          8. In Phase 2, subjects must provide a sufficient and adequate formalin fixed paraffin
             embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue sample preferably from the most recent biopsy of a tumor
             lesion, collected either at the time of or after the diagnosis of advanced or
             metastatic disease has been made AND from a site not previously irradiated. If no
             tumor tissue is available, a fresh biopsy will be required.

             Note: Tissue from needle or excisional biopsy or from resection is required.

          9. Female subjects must have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening (within 72
             hours before first dose of study drug) if of childbearing potential or be of non-child

             (corticosteroid use on study for management of immune-related adverse events, and/or a
             premedication for IV contrast allergies/reactions is allowed). Subjects who are
             receiving daily corticosteroid replacement therapy are an exception to this rule.
             Examples of permitted therapy are daily prednisone at doses of 5 to 7.5 mg or

             result of the brain metastases or their treatment must have resolved or be minimal and
             be expected as sequelae from treated lesions. For individuals who received steroids as
             part of brain metastases treatment, steroids must be discontinued ≥ 7 days prior to
             first dose of study drug.

          9. Has active or history of autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment
             within 2 years of the start of trial treatment (i.e., with use of disease modifying
             agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (i.e.,
             thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or
             pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment.

             Note: Subjects with diabetes type 1, vitiligo, psoriasis, hypo-, or hyperthyroid
             disease not requiring immunosuppressive treatment are eligible.

         10. Has had an allogeneic tissue/solid organ transplant.

         11. Has or had interstitial lung disease (ILD) OR has had a history of pneumonitis that

         13. Has known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies).

         14. Has known active Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C or tuberculosis. Active Hepatitis B is
             defined as a known positive HBsAg result. Active Hepatitis C is defined by a known
             positive Hep C Ab result and known quantitative HCV RNA results greater than the lower
             limits of detection of the assay.

         15. Has clinically significant (i.e., active) cardiovascular disease: cerebral vascular
             accident/stroke or myocardial infarction within 6 months before enrollment, unstable
             angina, congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association class ≥ II), or serious
             uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication.

         16. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating Investigator.
