      Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a serious public health problem in Hong Kong and worldwide.
      Older adults, the age group with the highest prevalence of MetS, may prefer specific exercise
      modalities that are suitable for their regular participation to manage MetS. This project
      aims to evaluate the effectiveness of Tai Chi, a very suitable exercise for older adults, to
      alleviate MetS in older population

      PURPOSE/OBJECTIVE: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a serious public health problem in Hong Kong
      and worldwide. Older adults, the age group with the highest prevalence of MetS, may prefer
      specific exercise modalities that are suitable for their regular participation to manage
      MetS. This project aims to evaluate the effectiveness of Tai Chi, a very suitable exercise
      for older adults, to alleviate MetS in older population.

      DESIGN &amp; METHODS: This study will adopt a three-arm randomized controlled trial with
      pretest-posttest design. Older adults aged 50 years or above with abdominal obesity will be
      randomly assigned to passive control, active control, and Tai Chi groups. Subjects assigned
      to Tai Chi and active control groups will be provided with a 12-weeks program of Tai Chi and
      generic fitness, respectively. No intervention will be given to the passive control group.
      Outcome measures including MetS components (waist circumference, blood pressure, blood
      glucose, triglyceride and high density lipoprotein-cholesterol) will be assessed at baseline,
      post-intervention, and follow-up (6 months after the end of intervention) assessments in all
      groups.

      HYPOTHESES: We hypothesize that: 1) improvements of waist circumference and other indicators
      of MetS are found in Tai Chi group but not in passive control group and 2) improvements of
      waist circumference and other indicators of MetS are greater in Tai Chi group than active
      control group.

      MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Waist circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, blood
      glucose, triglyceride and high density lipoprotein-cholesterol

      DATA ANALYSIS: Two-way (time x intervention) mixed mode ANOVA with post hoc test.
