  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to describe hallucinations prevalence in a sample of patients affected by
      Parkinson's disease and consulting in an outpatient facility.

      An unique one hour interview will be offered to volunteers patients. Patients participating
      to the study will be asked to answer a semi-structured questionnaire searching for
      hallucinations of all modalities, minor psychotic symptoms and delusions. Psychometric scales
      will be assessed to search for depressive symptoms, cognitive impairment and specific
      personality characteristics.

      The study hypothesis is that hallucinations prevalence in Parkinson's disease is
      underestimated and is higher than usually described in the scientific literature when all
      hallucinations modalities and minor hallucinatory phenomenons are searched for.
