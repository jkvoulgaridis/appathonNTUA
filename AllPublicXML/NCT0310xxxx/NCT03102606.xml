      To assess Duration of Severe Neutropenia (DSN) in treatment Cycle 1 in patients with advanced
      or metastatic breast cancer, who have failed &gt;/= 1 but &lt; 5 prior lines of chemotherapy;
      locally advanced or metastatic non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after platinum therapy
      failure; or hormone refractory (androgen independent) metastatic prostate cancer treated with
      docetaxel (75 mg/m2) + plinabulin (40 mg) versus docetaxel (75 mg/m2) + pegfilgrastim (6 mg).
      Neutrophils count will be assessed at baseline; Pre dose during Cycle 1, Day 1, 2, 5, 6, 7,
      8, 9, 10, 15.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized study. Approximately 190 patients will be
      enrolled in this study.

      All patients will receive docetaxel at a dose of 75 mg/m2. Pn Phase 3, patients with one of
      the following will be enrolled: advanced or metastatic breast cancer, who have failed ≥ 1 but
      &lt; 5 prior lines of chemotherapy; locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after platinum therapy
      failure; or hormone refractory (androgen independent) metastatic prostate cancer.

      The eligibility of all patients will be determined during a 28-day screening period.

      Approximately 150 patients are planned to be enrolled in the Phase 3 with one of the
      following diagnosis: advanced or metastatic breast cancer, who have failed ≥ 1 but &lt; 5 prior
      lines of chemotherapy; locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after platinum therapy failure;
      or hormone refractory (androgen independent) metastatic prostate cancer. Each eligible
      patient will be stratified according to his or her diagnosis (advanced or metastatic breast
      cancer, NSCLC, or HRPC). Patients will be randomly assigned with equal probability (1:1
      ratio) or 75:75, with the arm designation and planned intervention as follows:

      Arm 1: Docetaxel (75 mg/m2) + pegfilgrastim (6 mg) + placebo matching plinabulin

      Arm 2: Docetaxel (75 mg/m2) + plinabulin (40 mg) + placebo matching pegfilgrastim

      In order to facilitate balanced treatment arms with respect to cancer type, once either arm
      reaches at least 1/3 (of total) of patients with that cancer type, it will be closed to that
      cancer type and enrollment will continue for patients with the other cancer types, up to the
      planned maximum number of patients.

      Data from all patients receiving the RP3D plinabulin dose in Phase 2 and Phase 3 will not be
      pooled for assessing the primary and secondary study endpoints, but analyzed separately.

          6. Life expectancy of 3 months or more.

          7. The following laboratory results provided by the central laboratory within 14 days
             prior to study drug administration:

               -  Hemoglobin &gt;/= 9 g/dL independent of transfusion or growth factor support

             Note: Results are from the central laboratory. Local laboratory results may be
             accepted on a case by case basis after discussion with the Medical Monitor, however in
             this case central laboratories must also be taken within the screening time window.

          8. Prothrombin time (PT)/International Normalized Ratio (INR) ≤ 1.5 × upper limit of
             normal (ULN), activated partial thromboplastin time (PTT) ≤ 1.5 × ULN, based on
             central laboratory results.

          9. Female subjects of childbearing potential have a negative pregnancy test at screening.
             Females of childbearing potential are defined as sexually mature women without prior
             hysterectomy or who have had any evidence of menses in the past 12 months. However,
             women who have been amenorrhoeic for 12 or more months are still considered to be of
             childbearing potential if the amenorrhea is possibly due to prior chemotherapy,
             anti-estrogens, or ovarian suppression.

               -  Women of childbearing potential (i.e., menstruating women) must have a negative
                  urine pregnancy test (positive urine tests are to be confirmed by serum test)
                  documented within the 24-hour period prior to the first dose of study drug.

               -  Sexually active women of childbearing potential enrolled in the study must agree
                  to use two forms of accepted methods of contraception during the course of the
                  study and for 3 months after their last dose of study drug. Effective birth
                  control includes (a) intrauterine device (IUD) plus one barrier method; (b) on
                  stable doses of hormonal contraception for at least 3 months (e.g., oral,
                  injectable, implant, transdermal) plus one barrier method; (c) 2 barrier methods.
                  Effective barrier methods are male or female condoms, diaphragms, and spermicides
                  (creams or gels that contain a chemical to kill sperm); or (d) a vasectomized
                  partner.

               -  For male patients who are sexually active and who are partners of premenopausal
                  women: agreement to use two forms of contraception during the treatment period
                  and for at least 3 months after the last dose of study drug.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          4. Received no prior chemotherapy or &gt;/= 5 lines of cytotoxic chemotherapy for advanced
             or metastatic breast cancer (adjuvant chemotherapy will count as one line of
             chemotherapy, and any hormonal or biological, non conjugate therapy [e.g.,
             trastuzumab] will not count as a line of therapy).

          5. Current use of strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibitors, within 3 days of the first
             administration of study drug, and 7 days after treatment with taxanes OR requires use

             failure, unstable angina pectoris, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, uncontrolled
             arterial thrombosis, symptomatic pulmonary embolism, or psychiatric illness that would
             limit compliance with study requirements, or any other conditions that would preclude
             the patient from study treatment as per the discretion of the Investigator.

         13. Significant cardiovascular history:

               -  History of myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease within 1 year before

         14. History of hemorrhagic diarrhea, inflammatory bowel disease, or active uncontrolled
             peptic ulcer disease. (Concomitant therapy with ranitidine or its equivalent and/or
             omeprazole or its equivalent is acceptable). History of ileus or other significant

             with detectable Hepatitis B surface Antigen (HBsAg) may be eligible provided the
             patient has a negative viral load. Patients with a positive HBsAg must have a negative
             viral load before each chemotherapy administration. Hepatitis B surface antibody (anti
             HBs) without detectable HBsAg does NOT exclude patients from the study. Hepatitis C
             infection (Hepatitis C antibody reactive) which requires treatment also excludes
             patients from the study.

         18. Female subject who is pregnant or lactating.
