    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this study is to determine the clinical benefit and safety of antiviral
      therapy for asymptomatic congenital cytomegalovirus (cCMV) infected hearing-impaired infants.
      We will conduct a multi-center double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial to determine
      whether hearing-impaired infants with asymptomatic cCMV have better hearing and language
      outcomes if they receive valganciclovir antiviral treatment. We will also determine the
      safety of antiviral valganciclovir therapy for asymptomatic cCMV-infected hearing impaired
      infants. This study will be unique in that the cohort enrolled will only include
      hearing-impaired infants with asymptomatic cCMV.

      Primary Objective: To determine if treatment of cCMV-infected hearing impaired infants with
      isolated hearing loss with the antiviral drug valganciclovir reduces the maximum worsening in
      left or right ear hearing 8 months after randomization compared to untreated cCMV-infected
      hearing impaired infants.

      Main Secondary Objectives:

        1. To determine if valganciclovir treatment improves the following outcomes when compared
           to the control group:

             1. The risk of a clinically significant worsening of hearing defined by occurrence of
                cochlear implantation due to progressive hearing loss or a ≥ 10 dB (decibel)
                increase in the minimum response level (MRL) at two or more audiometric test
                frequencies (from among 1 kHz, 2 kHz, and 4kHz) in either the left or right ear or
                a ≥ 15 dB increase at any of these frequencies in either the left or right ear
                between baseline and 8 months post-randomization.

             2. The MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventory (CDI) percentile score for
                words produced at 22 months of age.

             3. The change in the average MRL across the 2 and 4 kHz frequencies from baseline to 8
                months post-randomization in the best-ear.

        2. To evaluate safety measures based on all grade 3 or greater new adverse events
           designated by the NIAID Division of AIDS (DAIDS) toxicity tables.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cytomegalovirus (CMV) can be transmitted from the mother to the fetus and is a leading cause
      of sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), which is a condition where the inner ear is unable to
      convert sound into nerve impulses to the brain. This hearing loss and its detrimental effect
      on language development contribute nearly $4 billion annually to the health care costs in the
      U.S. Unlike other types of SNHL, CMV induced hearing loss can be treated. Several clinical
      trials have demonstrated that antiviral therapy may prevent progressive hearing loss if
      administered early in life for severely affected (symptomatic CMV) infants. These promising
      findings have given rise to a debate regarding the best method for identifying and treating
      the more numerous asymptomatic CMV-infected infants.

      One approach is to conduct universal newborn hearing screens, and then do CMV diagnostic
      testing only on the infants who fail the hearing screen. This targeted approach should
      identify those infants at greatest risk of developing progressive hearing loss and consequent
      communicative difficulties. Utah is the first state to mandate this approach whereby infants
      under three weeks of age who fail their newborn hearing screening undergo CMV testing. In
      this trial, the hearing screen targeted approach will be used to identify patients eligible
      for participation in a double blind placebo controlled randomized clinical trial of antiviral
      valganciclovir therapy. The results of this trial will inform public policy, potentially
      shift our current clinical practice regarding pediatric hearing loss evaluation, and
      potentially offer a therapeutic option to asymptomatic CMV-infected infants with SNHL.
