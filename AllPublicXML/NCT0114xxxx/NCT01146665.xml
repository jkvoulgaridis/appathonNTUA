  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol misuse amongst youth is a significant clinical and public health problem. The
      Emergency Department (ED) is an important setting for the treatment of alcohol-related
      problems as it is often the first point of contact between youth, their families, and the
      healthcare system. This pilot study will assess the feasibility and acceptability of a
      computer-based intervention in the ED for youth with alcohol-related presentations. The
      investigators research team will: (1) evaluate the methodological and operational processes
      involved in study recruitment and intervention implementation, (2) determine recruitment and
      retention rates, and (3) obtain preliminary data on the difference in alcohol consumption at
      different time points. The clinical and health service implications of this research will be
      used to plan further investigations designed to improve the standard of ED care among youth
      aged 12 to 16 with alcohol-related presentations. This research will also help optimize the
      planning and development of a full-scale randomized controlled clinical trial of a
      computer-based intervention designed to reduce higher-risk alcohol consumption and
      alcohol-related health and social problems in this target population.

    <description>AUDIT-C (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test Consumption subscale): 1 item regarding frequency of alcohol consumption, 1 item regarding the amount of alcohol consumption, and 1 item regarding the frequency of binge drinking. Scores range from 0 to 12 with higher scores reflecting more consumption. The change in alcohol use report below reflects the change in AUDIT-C scores with negative values indicating a reduction in score and positive values indicating an increase in score.</description>

    <measure>Receptivity to Receiving Services: Seeking Help/Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>As part of CASA measure (secondary outcome measure to measure health and social services utilization) adolescents were asked two additional questions on receptivity to receiving services. The data below reflects the first question: On a scale of 1-5, where 1 is it's definitely a bad idea and 5 it's definitely a good idea, do you think that if someone you knew had an alcohol use problem they should get help or seek treatment?</description>

    <measure>Perceived Barriers to Services</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>As part of CASA measure (secondary outcome measure to measure health and social services utilization) adolescents answered 8 additional questions on perceived barriers to services: 1) Do you have any feelings such as dislike, distrust or fear about talking with doctors, counselors or other professionals? 2) Do you have any feelings about what other people would think if you sought help? 3) Do you find there is a lack of information that affected health services sought? 4) Do you have any concerns about the amount of time it takes to get help? 5) Were the health services you sought just not readily available? 6) Did you feel you just didn't want to talk to anyone about such a sensitive problem? 7) Was there a problem with registration, setting up appointments or contacting professionals? 8) Was there a problem getting to where treatment was available?</description>

        <title>Change in Health Care System Utilization by Youth</title>
        <description>The Child and Adolescent Services Assessment (CASA) is a self-report instrument designed to assess the use of community- and hospital-based health and social services. We focused each question so that we collected service use for an alcohol use problem.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
        <population>Due to the large amount of missing data (at 1-month [52.3%] and 3-months [59.0%] post-intervention) we did not assess change in utilization from baseline to 1- and 3-months post-intervention (pre-specified secondary outcome) as the results would be prone to bias.</population>

            <description>Standard medical care followed by a brief intervention (computer-based personalized assessment feedback) that targeted norm misperceptions, for example summarizing a youth's drinking in comparison to same average male or female in the general population. Theoretically, such normative feedback corrects norm misperceptions and motivates drinkers to re-evaluate their consumption patterns.</description>

        <title>Receptivity to Receiving Services: Seeking Help/Treatment</title>
        <description>As part of CASA measure (secondary outcome measure to measure health and social services utilization) adolescents were asked two additional questions on receptivity to receiving services. The data below reflects the first question: On a scale of 1-5, where 1 is it's definitely a bad idea and 5 it's definitely a good idea, do you think that if someone you knew had an alcohol use problem they should get help or seek treatment?</description>

        <title>Perceived Barriers to Services</title>
        <description>As part of CASA measure (secondary outcome measure to measure health and social services utilization) adolescents answered 8 additional questions on perceived barriers to services: 1) Do you have any feelings such as dislike, distrust or fear about talking with doctors, counselors or other professionals? 2) Do you have any feelings about what other people would think if you sought help? 3) Do you find there is a lack of information that affected health services sought? 4) Do you have any concerns about the amount of time it takes to get help? 5) Were the health services you sought just not readily available? 6) Did you feel you just didn't want to talk to anyone about such a sensitive problem? 7) Was there a problem with registration, setting up appointments or contacting professionals? 8) Was there a problem getting to where treatment was available?</description>

            <description>Standard medical care followed by a brief intervention (computer-based personalized assessment feedback) that targeted norm misperceptions, for example summarizing a youth's drinking in comparison to same average male or female in the general population. Theoretically, such normative feedback corrects norm misperceptions and motivates drinkers to re-evaluate their consumption patterns.</description>

          <title>Perceived Barriers to Services</title>
          <description>As part of CASA measure (secondary outcome measure to measure health and social services utilization) adolescents answered 8 additional questions on perceived barriers to services: 1) Do you have any feelings such as dislike, distrust or fear about talking with doctors, counselors or other professionals? 2) Do you have any feelings about what other people would think if you sought help? 3) Do you find there is a lack of information that affected health services sought? 4) Do you have any concerns about the amount of time it takes to get help? 5) Were the health services you sought just not readily available? 6) Did you feel you just didn't want to talk to anyone about such a sensitive problem? 7) Was there a problem with registration, setting up appointments or contacting professionals? 8) Was there a problem getting to where treatment was available?</description>

        <title>Receptivity to Services: Doctors/Counselors Can Help</title>
        <description>As part of CASA measure (secondary outcome measure to measure health and social services utilization) adolescents were asked two additional questions on receptivity to receiving services. The data below reflects the second question: On a scale of 1-5, where 1 is it's definitely cannot help and 5 it definitely can help, do you think that doctors or counselors can help with alcohol use problems in general?</description>

        <description>The Child and Adolescent Services Assessment (CASA) is a self-report instrument designed to assess the use of community- and hospital-based health and social services. We focused each question so that we collected service use for an alcohol use problem.</description>
        <time_frame>3-months post-intervention</time_frame>
        <population>Due to the large amount of missing data (at 1-month [52.3%] and 3-months [59.0%] post-intervention) we did not assess change in utilization from baseline to 1- and 3-months post-intervention (pre-specified secondary outcome) as the results would be prone to bias.</population>

            <description>Standard medical care followed by a brief intervention (computer-based personalized assessment feedback) that targeted norm misperceptions, for example summarizing a youth's drinking in comparison to same average male or female in the general population. Theoretically, such normative feedback corrects norm misperceptions and motivates drinkers to re-evaluate their consumption patterns.</description>

          <population>Due to the large amount of missing data (at 1-month [52.3%] and 3-months [59.0%] post-intervention) we did not assess change in utilization from baseline to 1- and 3-months post-intervention (pre-specified secondary outcome) as the results would be prone to bias.</population>

          <title>Standard Medical Care Followed by Computer-based PAF</title>
          <description>Standard medical care followed by a brief intervention (computer-based personalized assessment feedback) that targeted norm misperceptions, for example summarizing a youth's drinking in comparison to same average male or female in the general population. Theoretically, such normative feedback corrects norm misperceptions and motivates drinkers to re-evaluate their consumption patterns.</description>
