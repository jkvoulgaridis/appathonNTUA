  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this research is to explore relations between impulsive behavior and
      smoking-cessation success among treatment-seeking teens enrolled in a quit-smoking program.

      It is hypothesized that teens who do not successfully stop smoking (or who drop out of the
      treatment program) will be more impulsive (from measures taken just prior to treatment) than
      those who do successfully stop or significantly reduce rate of smoking.
