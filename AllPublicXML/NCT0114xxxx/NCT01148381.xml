  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The influence of genes on addictive and neuropsychiatric disorders is complex, especially
      given that multiple genes likely influence certain behaviors that are correlated with
      addiction. Researchers are interested in looking at the genetic information of individuals
      who are enrolled on National Institute for Drug Abuse studies to investigate specific genetic
      variants that may be related to substance abuse. Researchers will study the effects of genes
      on several aspects of thinking such as attention, memory, decision making, problem solving,
      learning, and emotional feelings, and investigate the ways in which genetic information
      affects addictive behaviors and substance abuse. In addition, researchers will study how
      genes may explain differences in imaging data in substance users.

      Objectives:

      - To collect genetic information for research on genetic aspects of addiction and substance
      abuse.

      Eligibility:

        -  Adults age 18 or older

             -  (1) healthy, non-drug-using nonsmokers,

             -  (2) healthy smokers,

             -  (3) healthy individuals dependent on other commonly abused drugs, and

             -  (4) individuals with other psychiatric disorders.

        -  Participants must be right-handed, and must be enrolled in another National Institute on
           Drug Abuse, Intramural Research Program imaging protocol.

      Design:

        -  This study involves one to two visits to National Institute on Drug Abuse, Intramural
           Research Program that may be separate from the participant s current research protocol
           study visits or on the same day as those visits. .

        -  Participants will provide a blood sample and complete questionnaires about mood, memory,
           and learning.

        -  Participants may also be asked to do a few tasks, such as playing computer games
           involving coin tosses and money management, or responding to questions on a computer
           screen.

      Objective: To determine genetic variants as well as behavioral measures across different
      study group populations. Results of these will be used as regressors to help explain
      inter-individual differences in data collected across IRP protocols.

      Study Population: The study population will include 1) healthy non-smoking, participants with
      no substance use disorders 2) healthy individuals with nicotine use disorder 3) healthy
      individuals with other substance use disorders 4) individuals with other psychiatric
      disorders and 5) treatment-seeking individuals with substance use disorders. Participants
      must be under evaluation for another NIDA-IRP protocol, generally healthy, and age 18 or
      older.

      Design: The main study will require approximately 4-6 hours at the NIDA-IRP. Main study
      procedures may be done in 1 visit or multiple visits, and may be done in conjunction with
      another NIDA-IRP study. After being consented into the main study, the participant will be
      asked to submit a blood sample, an MRI scan, complete various questionnaires,
      characterization instruments and several behavioral tasks. Blood will only be drawn once,
      provided there are no technical problems (such as sample damage during collection,
      preparation, shipping or assay) requiring a repeat draw. Participants in more than one
      NIDA-IRP protocol will be asked to repeat a few of the time-sensitive questionnaires in this
      protocol during subsequent MRI visits, as required by other IRP imaging protocols in which
      the subject may be participating. Data acquired in this protocol will be compared to data
      acquired in other NIDA-IRP protocols.

      An arm of this protocol will be used to pilot test a phenotyping battery developed by the
      NIDA CTN. This battery overlaps with several of the assessments in the main protocol.
      Participants in the NIDA CTN pilot study who also meet criteria for the main study may
      participate in the main study as well.

      Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measures in this study are the genetic, behavioral and
      phenotypic factors that are related to addiction. Secondary outcome measures are to compare
      the genetic, behavioral and phenotypic factors to imaging and behavioral data acquired across
      other IRP protocols.

        For the main study, subjects will be recruited from the pool of subjects who are being
        considered for other NIDA-IRP protocols. Therefore, participant distribution in the main
        study will reflect that specified in other NIDA-IRP protocols. No preferences in
        participant recruitment will be made on the basis of gender, race, or ethnic background. In
        both the main study and the CTN pilot, efforts will be made to include ethnic minorities in
        proportion to their presence in the Baltimore City area, which is where the majority of our
        subjects reside.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA: Main Study.

        All participants must be:

          1. under evaluation for another NIDA-IRP study or the NIDA CTN pilot portion of this
             study. Justification: data acquired under other studies will be compared to data
             collected in this protocol.

          2. greater than or equal to 18 years of age. Justification: Some NIDA-IRP studies have
             includeed teens, aged 13 - 17, but no current studies include them so we will only
             include adults in this study for now.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Main Study.

        Exclusion criteria are limited to those in the NIDA IRP protocol for which the subject is
        being considered or has been consented.

        Exclusion for MRI portion:

          1. History of neurological illnesses including but not limited to CVA, CNS tumor, head
             trauma, MS or other demyelinating diseases, epilepsy, movement disorders, or migraine
             in treatment. Assessment tool: phone screen and history and physical (H&amp;P). Rationale:
             Neurological illnesses may impair ability to tolerate the procedures and alter
             neuronal activity, adding noise to the data.

          2. Cognitive impairment (unless this population of subjects is included in another IRP
             protocol in which the subject is also participating). Assessment tool: self-report
             during H&amp;P, of special education classes, history of specific learning disability or
             mental retardation, Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI). A WASI score
             below 70 will be exclusionary, however, the MAI reserves the right to exclude
             participants with higher WASI scores based on evaluation of their educational
             history.. Rationale: Cognitive impairment may impair ability to tolerate the
             procedures and alter neuronal activity, adding noise to the data.

          3. Current major mood, anxiety or psychotic disorder (unless this population of subjects
             is included in another IRP protocol in which the subject is also participating).
             Assessment tool: self-report, H&amp;P computerized SCID with follow up clinical interview
             and/or the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I). Rationale: Current
             major mood or psychotic disorders may impair ability to tolerate

             the procedures and alter neuronal activity, adding noise to the data.

          4. Pregnancy. Assessment tool: Urine pregnancy test. Rationale: fMRI is not accepted as a
             safe procedure purely for research purposes during pregnancy.

          5. HIV positive individuals. Assessment tool: oral HIV test with serum confirmation of
             positive results. Rationale: potential liver/metabolic/vascular disease can interfere
             with the physiological transduction mechanisms for fMRI (i.e. making the measurement
             unreliable).

          6. Unable to undergo MRI scanning due to possible pregnancy, metallic devices in the
             body, claustrophobia or body morphometry.

          7. Currently using respiratory, cardiovascular or anticonvulsant medications that may
             interfere with the BOLD MRI signal.

          8. Left-handed. Assessment tool: Edinburgh Handedness Inventory (under screening
             protocol). Rationale: Differences in hemispheric dominance will be a confound in
             structural and functional scans.

        Inclusion criteria: NIDA CTN Pilot Study

        All participants must:

          1. Either have a current DMS-5 nicotine, cocaine, marijuana or opiate use disorder,
             possibly in combination, or have no current DSM-5 substance use disorder (control
             participants). Justification: These criteria are consistent with the scope of this
             study to pilot this battery of tests for future use in similar populations enrolled in
             the NIDA CTN studies.

          2. Be greater than or equal to 18 years of age. Justification: The NIDA CTN will use this
             battery in adults.

        Exclusion criteria: NIDA CTN Pilot Study

        Participants may not have:

          1. A DSM-5 major psychiatric diagnoses unrelated to a substance use disorder including
             but not limited to bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Diagnoses secondary to
             substance use disorder will be allowable providing the participant s symptoms do not
             interfere with the ability to complete assessments. Assessment tool: self-report, H&amp;P,
             Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I).

             Rationale: Current major mood or psychotic disorders may impair ability to complete
             the assessments and would add unnecessary noise to the data.

          2. Cognitive impairment. Assessment tool: self-report during H&amp;P, of special education
             classes, history of specific learning disability or mental retardation. Rationale:
             Cognitive impairment may impair ability to complete the assessments and would add
             unnecessary noise to the data.
