    <time_frame>3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Elucidation of mb structures and identification of major metabolites in plasma, urine, and faeces. This endpoint was not analysed in the study report.
The contribution of volasertib and the metabolite CD 10899 to total radioactivity in plasma in the time interval 0 to 8 h after drug administration supports the suggestion that other metabolites in addition to CD 10899 are present in plasma. However, different methods used for the quantification of volasertib and CD 10899 (HPLC MS/MS) and total 14C-radioactivity (liquid scintillation counting) have to be taken into account for the interpretation of the difference between total 14C-radioactivity and analysis of volasertib and CD 10899 in plasma and the plasma metabolite pattern remains to be categorized.</description>

        <description>Elucidation of mb structures and identification of major metabolites in plasma, urine, and faeces. This endpoint was not analysed in the study report.
The contribution of volasertib and the metabolite CD 10899 to total radioactivity in plasma in the time interval 0 to 8 h after drug administration supports the suggestion that other metabolites in addition to CD 10899 are present in plasma. However, different methods used for the quantification of volasertib and CD 10899 (HPLC MS/MS) and total 14C-radioactivity (liquid scintillation counting) have to be taken into account for the interpretation of the difference between total 14C-radioactivity and analysis of volasertib and CD 10899 in plasma and the plasma metabolite pattern remains to be categorized.</description>
