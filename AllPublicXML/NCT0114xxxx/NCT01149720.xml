  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, randomized, open label, 2 treatment, 2 period, 2-way crossover study, with
      an extension phase design in which the steady state PK of ARQ 197 will be investigated using
      the tablet administered in fed state (test treatment) and capsule administered at least 1
      hour before or 2 hours after a meal (reference treatment) in subjects with advanced solid
      tumors.
