      This is a observational, multi-center study to assess progression of clinical features,
      imaging and biologic biomarkers in Parkinson disease (PD) patients compared to healthy
      controls (HC) and in PD patient subtypes.

      The primary objective of this study is to identify clinical, imaging and biologic markers of
      PD progression for use in clinical trials of disease-modifying therapies.

      Addition of PPMI Pathology Core/PPMI Brain and Tissue Bank Addition of Gait Assessment
      Companion Study (Select PPMI sites - Genetic Cohort only) Testing for additional GBA
      mutations - previously testing involved testing only for the GBA N370S mutation; however,
      going forward, testing will include tests for additional GBA mutations that are identified as
      being associated with certain ancestry.

      Amendment 10 - 05-Oct-2015 Extended study period for PD and Healthy Control subjects through
      8 years. For Prodromal subjects (RBD and Hyposmic) added iPSC companion study.

      mutation. Allocation of subjects in Genetic Cohort and Genetic Registry revised to account
      for inclusion of GBA subjects.

      Amendment 2 - 19-May-2011 Changed visit window from 30 days to 45 days for Baseline visit to
      be completed.

      Section on DAT and SPECT Imaging - section changed to account for subject travel to the
      Institute for Neurodegenerative Disorders to conduct SPECT scanning and injection of either
      DaTSCAN or BCIT.

      Main Protocol - PPMI will be a five-year natural history study (a minimum of 3-year
      involvement for each subject) of de novo idiopathic PD patients and healthy controls. This
      study will also include a SWEDD (subjects without evidence of dopaminergic deficit)and
      Prodromal populations.

      All subjects will be comprehensively assessed at baseline and every three to six months
      thereafter. Subjects will undergo clinical (motor, neuropsychiatric and cognitive) and
      imaging assessments and will donate blood, urine, and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF). A blood
      sample for DNA will be collected. Data will be collected by each site under uniformly
      established protocols and data will be analyzed and stored at designated core facilities.
