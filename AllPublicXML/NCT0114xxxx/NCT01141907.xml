  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure (HF) affects over 5 million Americans with HF morbidity reaching epidemic
      proportions. Annual rates of new and recurrent HF events including hospitalization and
      mortality are higher among African Americans. In this study, the investigators are testing an
      interdisciplinary model for heart failure care, with focus on enhancing self management and
      use of telehealth, which has significant potential to improve self management and outcomes.

      The main purpose of this study is to learn how to help African Americans with heart failure
      care for themselves at home. We hope to find out if a team including a nurse and community
      health navigator using a computer telehealth device can help people with heart failure stay
      healthier. The team will help people with heart failure to manage their medication, monitor
      their symptoms and weigh themselves every day after they leave the hospital. The team will
      also help people with heart failure learn to solve problems that may keep them from following
      their treatment plan.

    <description>The intervention is aimed at preventing HF exacerbations and hospitalizations by improving self management with the support of the Home Automated Telemonitoring (HAT) system. The intervention was delivered by a RN-community health navigator (CHN) team over three months to HF patients and their caregivers in their home and via telephone and HAT system. The intervention was initiated during the index hospitalization. The RN-CHN team collaborated with participants, caregivers, and their usual source of HF care. Intervention strategies included tracking of weight and HF symptoms to provide feedback regarding self management and plan of care, enhancing medication and symptom self management, promoting HF care follow up, and promoting communication with providers.</description>
