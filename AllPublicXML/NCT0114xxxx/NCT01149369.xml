  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The principal objective of this multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial is to
      evaluate whether 4 weeks of treatment with aprepitant will improve nausea as compared with
      placebo in patients with symptoms of chronic nausea and vomiting of presumed gastric origin.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      APRON is a multicenter, randomized, double-masked, placebo controlled trial of 4 weeks of
      treatment with aprepitant or placebo for patients with symptoms of gastroparesis and related
      disorders. Screening for eligibility and collection of baseline data will span up to 4 weeks
      after obtaining informed consent and registration. Eligible patients will consist of patients
      with symptoms of gastroparesis and will be randomized to either aprepitant (125 mg per day)
      or placebo for 4 weeks.

      The symptoms will be measured with the Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index Daily Diary
      (GCSIDD) for one week at baseline and for four weeks after randomization. In addition, the
      nausea symptom will be measured daily on a 0 to 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS) for one week
      at baseline and daily for four weeks after randomization. There will be a 2 week washout
      period at the end of the treatment to ensure patient safety following the end of treatment.

Higher scores are considered a worse outcome. The VAS is a line measuring 100mm in length. For 7 consecutive days, participants mark their severity of nausea with a vertical line at the point they feel represents their current severity of nausea. The distance to the vertical line is measured with a ruler to the nearest millimeter. The values presented are the mean of the 7 measurements.</description>

          <description>The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) survey is comprised of 21 multiple choice questions that relate to depression, cognition, and physical well-being and is extensively used to quantify depression in a range of clinical conditions. The BDI total score is the sum of the 21 items, where each item ranges from 0 to 3 (lower scores are less severe, higher scores are more severe). The range for the BDI total score is 0 to 63, where lower scores indicate less depression and higher scores indicate more sever depression. Higher scores are considered a worse outcome.</description>

        <description>The Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index Daily Diary (GCSI-DD): GCSI total score is the average of 3 subscores: Nausea (average of two items: nausea and vomiting), Early Satiety (average of two items: not able to finish normal size meal and feeling excessively full after meals), and Bloating (feeling like you need to loosen your clothes). Each item is the participant's assessment of severity of the symptom during the past 24 hours, where 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe, and 4=very severe. The range of scores is 0 to 4, where higher scores are considered a worse outcome. The outcome measure, change from baseline in GCSI total score, has a possible range from -4 to +4, with negative values indicating a better outcome (improvement) and positive values indicating a worse outcome.</description>

        <title>Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index Daily Diary (GCSI-DD): Nausea Severity</title>
        <description>Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index Daily Diary (GCSI-DD): Nausea severity is the participant's assessment of nausea (feeling sick to your stomach as if you were going to vomit or throw up) during the past 24 hours, where 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe, and 4=very severe. The range of scores is 0 to 4, where higher scores are considered a worse outcome. The outcome measure, change from baseline in GCSI score, has a possible range from -4 to +4, with negative values indicating a better outcome (improvement) and positive values indicating a worse outcome.</description>

          <description>Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index Daily Diary (GCSI-DD): Early Satiety Severity is the participant's assessment of early satiety (not able to finish normal-size meal) during the past 24 hours, where 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe, and 4=very severe. The range of scores is 0 to 4, where higher scores are considered a worse outcome. The outcome measure, change from baseline in Early Satiety Severity, has a possible range from -4 to +4, with negative values indicating a better outcome (improvement) and positive values indicating a worse outcome.</description>

        <description>PAGI-SYM Severity index: Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index (GCSI) score is the average of 3 subscores: Nausea (average of 3 items: nausea, retching, and vomiting), Fullness/Early Satiety (average of 4 items: stomach fullness, not able to finish normal size meal, feeling excessively full after meals, and loss of appetite), and Bloating (average if 2 items: bloating and stomach visibly larger). Each item is the participant's assessment of severity of the symptom during the past 24 hours, where 0=none, 1=very mild, 2=mild, 3=moderate, 4=severe, and 5=very severe. The outcome measure, change from baseline in GCSI score, has a possible range from -5 to +5, with negative values indicating a better outcome (improvement) and positive values indicating a worse outcome.</description>

          <description>The PAGI-SYM Severity index: Fullness/Early Satiety Subscore is the average of 4 items: stomach fullness, not able to finish normal size meal, felling excessively full after meals, and loss of appetite. Each item is the participant's assessment of severity of the symptom during the past 24 hours, where 0=none, 1=very mild, 2=mild, 3=moderate, 4=severe, and 5=very severe. The range of scores is 0 to 5, where higher scores are considered a worse outcome. The outcome measure, change from baseline in Fullness/Early Satiety Subscore, has a possible range from -5 to +5, with negative values indicating a better outcome (improvement) and positive values indicating a worse outcome.</description>

        <title>PAGI-SYM Severity Index: Upper Abdominal Discomfort Severity</title>
        <description>The PAGI-SYM Severity index: Upper Abdominal Discomfort severity is the participant's assessment of upper abdominal discomfort (above the navel) during the past 24 hours, where 0=none, 1=very mild, 2=mild, 3=moderate, 4=severe, and 5=very severe. The range of scores is 0 to 5, where higher scores are considered a worse outcome. The outcome measure, change from baseline in Upper Abdominal Discomfort severity, has a possible range from -5 to +5, with negative values indicating a better outcome (improvement) and positive values indicating a worse outcome.</description>

        <title>Brief Pain Inventory: Severity Score</title>
        <description>The Brief Pain Inventory: Severity Score is the average of four questions in which the participant rates his or her pain: the worse pain in the past 24 hours, the least pain in the past 24 hours, average pain, and pain right now. The range of possible scores is 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating more severe pain. The outcome measure, change from baseline in Brief Pain Inventory Severity Score, has a possible range from -10 to +10, with negative values indicating a better outcome (improvement) and positive values indicating a worse outcome.</description>

          <description>The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI): Trait anxiety score is the sum of scores from 20 questions pertaining to trait anxiety, which is a general propensity to be anxious. The possible range of scores is from 20 to 80, with increasing scores considered a worse outcome. The outcome measure, change from baseline in STAI Trait Anxiety score, has a possible range from -60 to +60, with negative values indicating a better outcome (improvement) and positive values indicating a worse outcome.</description>

        <title>Electrogastrography (EGG): Bradygastria (1-&lt;2.5 Cpm) at 4 Weeks, Baseline Measurement</title>
        <description>Electrogastrography (EGG) is a test which records the electrical pacemaking signals that travel through the stomach muscles and control the muscles' contractions. Normal pacing is considered 2.5-3.7 cycles per minute (cpm). Bradygastria is when the rate of electrical activity in the stomach is &lt;2.5 cycles per minute for at least 1 minute (a decrease in electrical activity in the stomach). The average power in frequency region is the percentage of time that the dominant EGG frequencies are in a given frequency: bradygastria, normal, tachygastria, or duodenal. The outcome measure is the change from baseline (here, baseline refers to the test performed during screening, not the baseline value of the EGG test) in percent of time with frequencies in the ranges, where negative values for bradygastria indicate improvement (less time in a dysrhythmic state).</description>

        <title>Electrogastrography (EGG): Normogastria (2.5-&lt;3.8 Cpm) at 4 Weeks, 0-30 Post-satiety Measurement</title>
        <description>Electrogastrography (EGG) is a test which records the electrical pacemaking signals that travel through the stomach muscles and control the muscles' contractions. The 0-30 post-satiety measurement that taken 30 minutes after the participant consumes Ensure until feeling completely full. Normal pacing (normogastria) is considered 2.5-3.7 cycles per minute (cpm). The average power in frequency region is the percentage of time that the dominant EGG frequencies are in a given frequency: bradygastria, normal, tachygastria, or duodenal. The outcome measure is the change from baseline (baseline refers to the test performed during screening, not the baseline value of the EGG test) in percent of time with frequencies in the ranges, where positive values for normal rates indicate an increase in the normal pacing (improvement).</description>

        <title>Electrogastrography (EGG): Duodenal (&gt;10-15 Cpm) at 4 Weeks, 0-30 Post-satiety Measurement</title>
        <description>Electrogastrography (EGG) is a test which records the electrical pacemaking signals that travel through the stomach muscles and control the muscles' contractions. The 0-30 post-satiety measurement that taken 30 minutes after the participant consumes Ensure until feeling completely full. Normal pacing is considered 2.5-3.7 cycles per minute (cpm). Duodenal is when the rate of electrical activity in the stomach is &gt;10-15 cycles per minute for at least 1 minute. The average power in frequency region is the percentage of time that the dominant EGG frequencies are in a given frequency: bradygastria, normal, tachygastria, or duodenal. The outcome measure is the change from baseline (here, baseline refers to the test performed during screening, not the baseline value of the EGG test) in percent of time with frequencies in the ranges, where negative values for duodenal indicate improvement (less time in a dysrhythmic state).</description>
