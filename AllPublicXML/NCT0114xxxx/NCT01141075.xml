  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the gene for
      mitochondrial enzyme methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MCM) or in one of the genes for
      adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl). Lack of these proteins causes toxic elevations of methylmalonic
      acid (MMacid) in blood, urine, and other tissues. A specific type of mutation, called a
      nonsense (premature stop codon) mutation, is the cause of the disease in approximately 5% to
      20% of participants with mutations in the MCM gene, and approximately 20% to &gt;50% of
      participants with mutations in one of the AdoCbl genes. Ataluren is an orally delivered,
      investigational drug that acts to overcome the effects of the premature stop codon,
      potentially enabling the production of functional MCM/AdoCbl. This study is a Phase 2a trial
      evaluating the safety and activity of ataluren in participants with MMA due to a nonsense
      mutation. The main purpose of this study is to understand whether ataluren can safely
      decrease MMacid levels.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, participants with MMA due to a nonsense mutation will be administered an
      investigational drug called ataluren. Evaluation procedures to determine if a participant
      qualifies for the study will be performed within 14 days prior to the start of drug
      administration. Eligible participants who elect to enroll in the study will then participate
      in 2 drug administration and follow-up periods. Within the first period, ataluren will be
      taken 3 times per day with meals for 28 days at doses of 5 milligrams/kilograms (mg/kg)
      (morning), 5 mg/kg (midday), and 10 mg/kg (evening); there will then be an interval of
      approximately 21 days without ataluren. Within the second period, ataluren will be taken 3
      times per day with meals for 28 days at doses of 10 mg/kg (morning), 10 mg/kg (midday), and
      20 mg/kg (evening); there will then be an interval of approximately 14 days without ataluren.
      During the study, ataluren activity, safety, and pharmacokinetics will be evaluated, and
      MMacid levels in blood and urine will be measured periodically.

    <measure>Plasma Methylmalonic Acid (MMacid) Levels</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 28 and Day 29 (last day of dosing) of Cycles 1 and 2</time_frame>
    <description>Normal plasma MMacid level is &lt;0.27 micromole/liters (umol/L). Plasma samples for MMacid levels were collected after a 2- to 4-hour fast. Plasma MMacid levels were measured by a standard gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (GC/MS) stable-isotope dilution method. Individual participant values in plasma MMacid levels at Baseline and end-to-treatment (Day 28 and Day 29 [last day of dosing]) in each cycle were recorded.</description>

    <description>The normal urinary MMacid level is &lt;4 millimole/mole (mmol/mol) creatinine. Urinary samples for MMacid levels were collected after a 2- to 4-hour fast. Urinary MMacid levels were measured by a standard GC/MS stable-isotope dilution method.</description>

    <description>Plasma samples for propionylcarnitine levels were evaluated to detect disease activity. The level of propionylcarnitine was measured using gas chromatography and LC/MS-MS. An increase in propionylcarnitine values indicates greater disease activity.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Day 112 (end of study follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that develops or worsens in severity during the conduct of a clinical study and does not necessarily have a causal relationship to the study drug. Severity was rated by the Investigator on a scale of mild, moderate and severe, with severe as an AE that prevents usual activities. Relationship of AE to treatment was determined by the Investigator. Serious AEs include death, a life-threatening AE, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, a congenital anomaly or birth defect, or an important medical event that jeopardized the participant and required medical intervention to prevent the previously listed serious outcomes. A summary of other non-serious AEs and all serious AEs, regardless of causality is located in Reported AE section.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Potentially Clinically Significant Laboratory (Hematology and Biochemistry) Abnormal Results</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Day 112 (end of study follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>Hematological and biochemistry data graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) severity grade (Grade 1 [mild], Grade 2 [moderate], Grade 3 [severe], Grade 4 [life-threatening], or Grade 5 [fatal]). Life-threatening (Grade 4) or severe (Grade 3) laboratory abnormalities were considered clinically significant. Recurrent or persistent moderate (Grade 2) abnormalities were also considered clinically significant in certain circumstances. Hematology assessments: white blood cell count with differential, hemoglobin, hematocrit, other red cell parameters, and platelet count. Biochemistry assessments: sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, magnesium, calcium, phosphorus, uric acid, glucose, total protein, albumin, bilirubin (direct and indirect), aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, glutamyl transferase, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase, total cholesterol, and triglycerides.</description>

    <description>Validated quantitative methods employing high performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectroscopy (HPLC-MS-MS) were used to determine plasma concentrations of unchanged ataluren.

        <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that develops or worsens in severity during the conduct of a clinical study and does not necessarily have a causal relationship to the study drug. Severity was rated by the Investigator on a scale of mild, moderate and severe, with severe as an AE that prevents usual activities. Relationship of AE to treatment was determined by the Investigator. Serious AEs include death, a life-threatening AE, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, a congenital anomaly or birth defect, or an important medical event that jeopardized the participant and required medical intervention to prevent the previously listed serious outcomes. A summary of other non-serious AEs and all serious AEs, regardless of causality is located in Reported AE section.</description>
