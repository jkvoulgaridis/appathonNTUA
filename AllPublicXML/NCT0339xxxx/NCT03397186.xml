      This research trial studies the immune changes following trabectedin in patients with sarcoma
      that has spread to other places in the body (metastatic) or cannot be removed by surgery
      (unresectable). Analyzing tumor tissue may help to understand the changes in immune cells in
      or around the tumor or if there is an increase in immune cells in the tumor after receiving
      trabectedin.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Percentage of tumor tissue in pre- and post-treatment biopsies comprised of T-cells, as
      determined by flow cytometry.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore additional potential biomarkers including: numbers of tumor associated
      macrophage (TAM) in tumor II. To explore additional potential biomarkers including: phenotype
      (classically activated macrophages [M1] versus [vs] alternatively activated macrophages [M2])
      as characterized by CD163, CD115, CD206 on infiltrating TAM.

      III. To explore additional potential biomarkers including: phenotype of T cells infiltrating
      tumor (CD4, CD8, markers of CD4 phenotype including FoxP3 and memory).

      IV. To explore additional potential biomarkers including: expression T cell inhibitory
      markers (PD-1, CTLA-4, TIM3).

      V. To explore additional potential biomarkers including: recognition of autologous tumor by
      expanded tumor infiltrating lymphocyte lines.

      VI. To explore additional potential biomarkers including: in tumor infiltrating lymphocyte
      (TIL) expanded from myxoid/round cell liposarcomas, recognition of cancer testis antigens.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo a biopsy at baseline and then receive trabectedin for up to 4 cycles.
      Beginning 1 week after completion of cycle 2 and prior to cycle 3, patients undergo a second
      biopsy. Patients who achieve clinical benefit (complete response [CR], partial response [PR],
      stable disease [SD]) after the first post-treatment scan and who continue trabectedin for 4
      cycles undergo a third biopsy after cycle 4.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up for 30 days.
