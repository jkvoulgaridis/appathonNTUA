  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain is considered as one of the most important causal factors of behavioral and
      psychological symptoms in patients Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (ADRD). The
      investigators plan to examine the effectiveness of pain relief, pain sensory change and
      immune biomarkers change (measured by serum biomarkers) after the auricular point acupressure
      (APA). A waitlist will be used to examine the feasibility of a 4-week APA intervention. The
      investigators will also explore potential analgesic pathways and underpinnings of APA on pain
      relief.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A waitlist pilot study will be conducted to examine the feasibility of a 4-week APA
      intervention. Participants and their caregivers will be enrolled into the study. Following
      the baseline assessment (1st home visit), participants will wait one month and will be
      randomized to an interventionist or caregiver-training group.

      Both groups will have a home/office visit at pre-intervention, followed by three home visits
      weekly, and a final home/office visit at post-intervention. Participants in both groups will
      have 1 monthly follow-up phone call after the completion of APA.

    <description>It will be measured using Zarit Burden.The Zarit Burden Interview, a popular caregiver self-report measure used by many aging agencies, originated as a 29-item questionnaire . The revised version contains 22 items. Each item on the interview is a statement which the caregiver is asked to endorse using a scale. Response options usually range from 0 (Never) to 4 (Nearly Always) The score ranges from 0 to 48.the greater the score, the higher the burden.</description>
