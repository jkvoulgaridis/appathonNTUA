  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart transplantation (HTx) is a procedure which is hindered by several complications. The
      HEARTS registry aims to allow the analysis of risk factors of all post-HTx complications. It
      consists in an exhaustive data collection at the moment of inclusion, i.e. HTx, knowing that
      patients underwent a full-fledged evaluation beforehand to evaluate their aptitude to being
      transplanted.

      Post-HTx complications include but is not limited to: all-cause mortality, AMR, ACR, CAV,
      AKI, sepsis, cancer, psychological disorders, metabolic disorders.

      Heart transplantation (HTx) is a procedure which is hindered by several complications. The
      HEARTS registry aims to allow the analysis of risk factors of all post-HTx complications. It
      consists in an exhaustive data collection at the moment of inclusion, i.e. HTx, knowing that
      patients underwent a full-fledged evaluation beforehand to evaluate their aptitude to being
      transplanted.

      Post-HTx complications include but is not limited to: all-cause mortality, AMR, ACR, CAV,
      AKI, sepsis, cancer, psychological disorders, metabolic disorders.

      To do so, patients are routinely monitored several times per year, the frequency of which
      depends on the proximity to the HTx.

      An endomyocardial biopsy is performed 3 times per month starting on day 15 until day 65 after
      HTx, then once every 20 days until four months, then monthly until six months, then once
      every 45 days until year 1, and every 3 months thereafter until year 2. Afterwards, they
      become twice per year until year 5, then once a year.

      An echocardiography is performed for every visit, with a complete blood analysis, including
      HLA antibodies screening with DSA evaluation, virologic evaluation.

      A coronarography is performed for the anniversary year of HTx, then once every 2 years.
