  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Delirium frequently occurs in hospitalized older people, and treatment options are limited.
      Acupuncture has been shown to reduce agitation in the setting of dementia. The investigators
      will test the hypothesis that it may also assist in treating delirium.

      This assessor-blinded randomized sham-controlled trial aims to evaluate the efficacy of
      acupuncture integrated with standard care as compared to sham-acupuncture integrated with
      standard care or standard care only for the treatment of delirium in hospitalized older
      persons.

      Patients aged 65 and older, hospitalized in the internal medicine departments of Bnai Zion
      Medical Center and diagnosed with delirium or subsyndromal delirium will be randomized to
      either true acupuncture with usual care, sham procedure with usual care or usual care only.
      Daily treatments and outcomes' follow-up will be conducted up to one week from recruitment or
      until resolution of delirium or subsyndromal delirium for 48 hours.

      The primary outcome will be between-groups comparison of the changes in delirium severity
      over time as defined by continuous variations in CAM-S scores (trajectory). Secondary
      outcomes will include time to first delirium resolution, percentage of delirium-free days in
      the one-week period, number of days in which psychotropic and antipsychotic drugs were used
      in the one-week evaluation period, changes between groups in pain, sleep, morning blood
      cortisol and T3 as well as midnight urinary cortisol/creatinine ratio, delirium
      complications, in-hospital mortality, length of hospital stay and functional status at
      discharge. Side effects will be monitored daily. The cost-effectiveness of acupuncture
      treatment of delirium will be also estimated.
