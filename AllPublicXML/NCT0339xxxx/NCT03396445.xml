  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of MK-5890 when
      administered alone and in combination with pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in adults with advanced
      solid tumors. The initial course of MK-5890 monotherapy or MK-5890 plus pembrolizumab
      combination therapy will be for up to 35 administrations (approximately 2 years). The safety
      and pharmacokinetics of MK-5890 when administered with pembrolizumab, pemetrexed and
      carboplatin will also be assessed in adults with non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC).

      Participants receiving MK-5890 monotherapy who experience disease progression may be eligible
      to switch to receiving MK-5890 plus pembrolizumab combination therapy for up to 35 cycles
      (approximately 2 years) at the discretion of the Investigator and approval of the Sponsor.
