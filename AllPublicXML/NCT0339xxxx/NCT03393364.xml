  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Goal of this study is to evaluate how pain is controlled after outpatient urologic surgeries.
      Patients will receive either opioid pain medication or non-opioid medication for pain
      control. A survey will be conducted at the post-operative appointment to evaluate for pain
      control.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be approached in the pre-operative area prior to their outpatient urologic
      surgery. Informed Consent will be obtained at that time. Patients will be instructed that
      they will receive a prescription for either opioid pain medication or non-opioid medication
      for after surgery. The opioid medication includes oxycodone, while the non-opioid includes
      ketoralac, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication. Subjects will be assigned randomly
      to either medication. Standard of care after outpatient urologic surgery is either oxycodone
      or ketoralac, however there is no previous research on whether one is superior than the
      other. These drugs were chosen because they are the most commonly used medications after
      outpatient urologic surgery. The study team and patients will not be blinded to the
      treatment.

      They will also receive instructions for non-opioid pain management. If the patients require
      additional pain medication after surgery, they are instructed to call the provider's office
      for further evaluation and treatment. The patient's physician will prescribe further
      medication if warranted. The post-operative appointment is scheduled 2-3 weeks after surgery.
      At the post-operative appointment, patients will then be given a four question paper survey
      inquiring how well their pain was managed, how many pills were taken, if any additional
      non-opioid medications were taken for pain, and how the extra pills were disposed. Other PHI
      that will be collected includes patient's age, gender, past medical history, past surgical
      history, renal function, prior medications, and current surgery.
