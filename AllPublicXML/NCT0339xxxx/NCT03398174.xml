  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this pilot single-blind randomized clinical trial is to assess the
      feasibility of implementing motor control exercise and patient education for the management
      of chronic low back pain (CLBP) in a low resource rural Nigerian community.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine whether supervised exercise training emphasizing motor control
      exercise (MCE) approach and a designed patient education (PE) program based on the
      psychosocial approach will be feasible and acceptable in reducing pain intensity and
      functional disability among rural dwellers with CLBP in Nigeria.

      Participants will be recruited and assigned to one of three intervention groups that include
      MCE group, PE group, or MCE plus PE gr using a simple random technique based on an electronic
      randomization table generated by a computer software program. Blinded assessment of all
      clinical outcomes will be performed at baseline and 6 weeks after randomization.

      Primary outcomes include pain intensity and functional disability while secondary outcomes
      include overall treatment satisfaction.

      Data will be analyzed using descriptive statistics, paired t-test, and ANOVA. All statistical
      analyses will be performed on SPSS (version 24.00) at an alpha level of 0.05.

    <description>Functional disability will be measured by Oswestry disability index (ODI). The questionnaire consists of 10 items with each item having six statements. All scores are summed, then multiplied by two to obtain the index (range 0 to 100) with higher score indicating greater disability.</description>

    <description>Patient satisfaction with treatment will be assessed using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from &quot;very dissatisfied&quot; (0) to &quot;very satisfied&quot; (4), with higher scores reflecting greater satisfaction.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive a total of 12 sessions (2 sessions per week) of exercise program consisting of motor control training and group patient education session once a week (6 sessions) all over 6-weeks.
The motor control training will be aiming at improving function of specific muscles of the lumbopelvic region and the control of posture and movement.
The patient education program will be aiming to provide non-threatening information to enable patients to better understand their pain, change any unhelpful beliefs about LBP, and integrate self-management and active coping strategies that deals with fear avoidance behavior and catastrophic thought.
In addition, participants will also perform stretching exercises and instructed to perform continuous overground walk.</description>
