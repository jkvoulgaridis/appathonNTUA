  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a combination of two targeted therapies as a possible
      treatment for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) with an EGFR mutation.

      The drugs involved in this study are:

        -  Osimertinib (Tagrisso)

        -  Selumetinib
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drugs work in treating a
      specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drugs are being studied.

      The EGFR gene produces a protein that helps cells divide. Specific changes or a mutation in
      the genetic information causes abnormal cell division and can lead to lung cancer. Patients
      who have NSCLC with an EGFR gene mutation can be treated by drugs called EGFR tyrosine kinase
      inhibitors (EGFR TKIs). They may stop (or &quot;inhibit&quot;) the effect of the mutation in the EGFR
      gene.

      Osimertinib alone has been shown to benefit some patients who have received prior treatment
      for their EGFR-mutant NSCLC. The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved
      the combination of Osimertinib and Selumetinib as a treatment for any disease, but it has
      been investigated in other clinical trials.

      The main purpose of the study is to look at information on any potential side effects that
      this drug combination may cause and collect data about how your cancer responds to the
      combination of drugs.

      Specific TKIs have been approved by the FDA for first-line treatment of NSCLC patients with
      an EGFR mutation.

             techniques or as ≥10 mm with spiral CT scan, MRI, or calipers by clinical exam.

          -  Participants can have no prior history of any EGFR-directed therapy, including TKIs or
             antibodies, and must also be chemotherapy and immunotherapy naïve for metastatic
             disease. Patients who have completed adjuvant or neo-adjuvant chemotherapy &gt; 6 months

             not have to be completed prior to study enrollment. Biopsy can be performed at an
             outside institution as long as sufficient tissue is available.

             --Note: if next generation sequencing has already been performed prior to study
             enrollment, it does not need to be repeated. Tissue is still requested for central
             NGS.

          -  Uncontrolled central nervous system (CNS) disease, including parenchymal brain
             metastases, leptomeningeal disease, or spinal cord compression. Patients with
             asymptomatic untreated brain metastases are eligible. Patients with treated CNS
             disease will be allowed to enroll provided they have clinically confirmed stable
             disease with ≥2 weeks since definitive CNS therapy (radiation or surgery) and ≥2 weeks
             without systemic steroids. Patients may undergo either whole brain radiation or
             stereotactic radiosurgery prior to study entry.

             males or &gt;/= 450 ms in females. Formula: QTc=QT/(RR^1/3)

          -  any factors that increase the risk of QTc prolongation or risk of arrhythmic events
             such as heart failure, hypokalemia, congenital long QT syndrome, family history of
             long QT syndrome or unexplained sudden death under 40 years of age in first degree
             relatives, or any concomitant medication known to the prolong the QT interval and
             listed in Appendix B that a patient is unable to stop.

          -  past medical history of interstitial lung disease, drug-induced interstitial lung
             disease, radiation pneumonitis which required steroid treatment, or any evidence of
             clinically active interstitial lung disease

          -  active bleeding diatheses, which in the investigator's opinion makes it undesirable
             for the patient to participate in the trial or which would jeopardize compliance with
             the protocol

          -  active infection or ongoing antiviral medication for viral infections including
             hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Screening for chronic
             conditions is not required. HIV-positive participants on combination antiretroviral
             therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with
             selumetinib or osimertinib.

          -  Baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) below the LLN or of &lt; 45% measured
             by echocardiography/MUGA; atrial fibrillation with a ventricular rate &gt; 100 bpm on ECG
             at rest.

          -  Any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic diseases, including active bleeding
             diatheses, which in the investigator's opinion makes it undesirable for the patient to
             participate in the trial or which would jeopardize compliance with the protocol

          -  Known to be T790M+ (on pre-treatment tumor or plasma) or known germline T790M.

          -  Ophthalmological conditions as follows:

          -  Current or past history of retinal pigment epithelial detachment (RPED)/central serous
             retinopathy (CSR) or retinal vein occlusion

          -  Uncontrolled glaucoma (irrespective of IOP)

          -  Males and females of reproductive potential who are not using an effective method of
             birth control and females who are pregnant or breastfeeding or have a positive (urine
             or serum) pregnancy test prior to study entry.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the effects of selumetinib and
             osimertinib on the development of the fetus are unknown, and there is potential for
             teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk
             for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with
             selumetinib or osimertinib, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is
             treated with these agents.
