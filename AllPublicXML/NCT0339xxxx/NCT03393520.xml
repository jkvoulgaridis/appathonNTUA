    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of AVP-786
      compared to placebo, for the treatment of agitation in participants with dementia of the
      Alzheimer's type.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible participants for this study must have a diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's disease
      (AD) and must have clinically significant, moderate/severe agitation secondary to AD.

      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-design study,
      consisting of 12 weeks of treatment.

      Approximately 412 participants will be enrolled at approximately 90 centers worldwide.

      Study medication will be administered orally twice-daily from Day 1 through Day 85. Screening
      will occur within approximately 4 weeks prior to randomization. Following screening
      procedures for assessment of inclusion and exclusion criteria, eligible participants will be
      randomized into the study.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's Disease (AD) according to the 2011 National
             Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) working groups criteria

          -  Participants with clinically significant, moderate/severe agitation at the time of
             screening and for at least 2 weeks prior to randomization that interferes with their
             daily routine and for which a prescription medication has been indicated, in the
             opinion of the investigator

          -  The diagnosis of agitation must meet the provisional consensus definition of agitation
             in participants with cognitive disorders developed by the International
             Psychogeriatric Association (IPA) Agitation Definition Work Group.

          -  A Clinical Global Impression of Severity of Illness scale for Agitation
             (CGIS-Agitation) score of ≥ 4 (moderately ill) at screening and baseline

          -  Participants must have a reliable caregiver who is able and willing to comply with
             study procedures, including not administering any prohibited medications during the
             course of the study.

          -  Caregiver who is able and willing to comply with all required study procedures. In
             order to qualify as a reliable informant (i.e., caregiver) capable of assessing
             changes in participant's condition during the study, the individual must spend a
             minimum of 2 hours per day for 4 days per week with the participant.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants with dementia predominantly of the non-Alzheimer's type (e.g., vascular
             dementia, frontotemporal dementia, Parkinson's disease, substance-induced dementia)

          -  Participants with symptoms of agitation that are not secondary to AD (e.g., secondary
             to pain, other psychiatric disorder, or delirium)

          -  Participants with co-existent clinically significant or unstable systemic diseases
             that could confound the interpretation of the safety results of the study (e.g.,
             malignancy, poorly controlled diabetes, poorly controlled hypertension, unstable
             pulmonary, renal or hepatic disease, unstable ischemic cardiac disease, dilated
             cardiomyopathy, or unstable valvular heart disease)

          -  Participants with myasthenia gravis
