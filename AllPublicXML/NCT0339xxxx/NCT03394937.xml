  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of cancer immunotherapy
      ECI-006 and to determine its ability to induce a measurable immune response against the tumor
      associated antigens.

      In Cohort 1, ECI-006 will be administered 5 times by intranodal injection in melanoma
      patients after resection of their tumor.

      In Cohort 2, ECI-006 will be administered 9 times by intranodal injection on top of standard
      of care pembrolizumab in metastatic melanoma patients with stable disease after 6 to 12
      months pembrolizumab treatment.

      ECI-006 activates key immunologically active cells to direct the immune system against the
      cancer. Expected potential risks for ECI-006 are non-serious and related to the local
      administration of the product. Hence, the therapy suggested here has the promise to offer
      considerable benefit to patients without any major risk.

        Main inclusion criteria Cohort 1:

          1. Age greater than or equal to 18 years and less than or equal to 80 years.

          2. Patients must have histologically proven primary malignant melanoma of skin which has
             been surgically removed (see exclusion criterion on patients with primary uveal
             melanoma or melanoma of the mucosae).

          3. Patients with American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Stage IIc, III or IV.

          4. Patients must have no evidence of disease as evidenced by a whole body 18F
             fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography [PET]/computed tomography [CT]
             scan to be done at maximum 2 weeks before Visit 2. To exclude the presence of tumor
             lesions in the brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be performed.

          5. Full recovery from all prior therapies. A maximum period of 12 weeks following major
             surgery, or any other major invasive procedure is allowed before start of the study
             medication; at least 4 weeks should be between major surgery and the start of the
             immunotherapy

          6. Female patients of childbearing potential should have a negative serum pregnancy test
             at Visit 1 (Screening) and should use an efficient method of birth control from
             screening until the first menses after a 4 week period after the last dose of study
             medication.

          1. Patients with primary uveal or mucosal melanoma.

          2. Patients who have received prior systemic therapy and/or active immunotherapy for
             melanoma, such as antigen loaded dendritic cells or chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T
             cells, are excluded. Systemic adjuvant treatment for melanoma that is more than 5
             years ago and prior local treatment of primary and metastatic tumor lesions (e.g.,
             surgical resection, isolated limb perfusion radiotherapy) are allowed.

          3. Patients with a history of autoimmune disease such as, but not restricted to,
             inflammatory bowel disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, ankylosing spondylitis,
             scleroderma, rheumatoid arthritis or multiple sclerosis. Vitiligo is not an exclusion
             criterion

          4. Patients with serious intercurrent chronic or acute illness such as pulmonary [asthma
             or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)] or cardiac (New York Heart
             Association [NYHA] class III or IV) or hepatic disease or other illness considered by
             the investigator to constitute an unwarranted high risk for investigational drug
             treatment.

          5. Concurrent second malignancy other than non-melanoma skin cancer, or controlled
             superficial bladder cancer. In the event of prior malignancies treated surgically, the
             patient must be considered NED (no evidence of disease) for a minimum of 3 years prior
             to enrolment.

          6. Patients on steroid therapy &gt; 10 mg prednisone (or equivalent) or other
             immunosuppressive agents such as azathioprine or cyclosporine A (but not limited to
             these) are excluded on the basis of potential immune suppression. Patients must have
             had 8 weeks of discontinuation of any steroid therapy exceeding &gt; 10 mg prednisone (or
             equivalent) before first dose.

        Main inclusion criteria Cohort 2:

          1. Histologically confirmed AJCC Stage III or Stage IV unresectable disease.

          2. Patient must have stable disease as defined by RECIST1.1 criteria after at least 6
             months but less than 12 months of first-line pembrolizumab therapy as assessed on 2
             consecutive imagings.

          3. Patient must continue with standard of care pembrolizumab during the study.

          4. Measurable disease by means of clinical examination, computed tomography (CT) or
             magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in
             Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1, defined as:

               -  At least 1 melanoma lesion that can be accurately and serially measured in at
                  least 1 dimension, and for which the greatest diameter is ≥ 10 mm as measured by
                  contrast enhanced or spiral CT scan for visceral or nodal/soft tissue disease
                  (including lymph nodes) and/or

               -  At least 1 superficial cutaneous melanoma lesion ≥ 10 mm as measured by calipers
                  and/or

               -  At least 1 subcutaneous melanoma ≥ 10 mm lesion and/or

               -  Multiple superficial melanoma lesions which in aggregate have a total diameter of
                  ≥ 10 mm

        Main exclusion criteria Cohort 2:

          1. Patient who received radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior to the start of treatment with
             study medication.

          2. Patients with active brain metastases. Patients with brain metastases are eligible if
             the brain metastases are deemed stable and if the patient is eligible to receive
             pembrolizumab as standard of care to treat his melanoma in the judgement of the
             investigator. There must also be no requirement for immunosuppressive doses of
             systemic corticosteroids (&gt; 10 mg/day prednisone equivalents) for at least 8 weeks
             prior to study drug administration.

          3. Patients with primary uveal or mucosal melanoma.

          4. Patients that are deemed at risk for autoimmune flare up (e.g. patients that had a
             controllable autoimmune disease that needed permanent stop of anti-PD1 treatment or
             had ongoing/recurrent irAE in the last 3 months), as determined by the investigator.

          5. Patients who have received prior treatment for advanced melanoma other than standard
             of care first-line pembrolizumab and targeted therapy (encorafenib, dabrafenib and
             trametinib) for BRAF positive patients preceding pembrolizumab.
