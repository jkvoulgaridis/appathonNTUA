      This clinical trial evaluates the use of novel decision support educational materials and
      services using health coaches. The study includes men newly diagnosed with low-risk prostate
      cancer. A 160 men will be recruited. Half of the men will receive a call from a health coach
      before their initial consultation visit with their urologist to review their treatment
      concerns and questions. The other half will receive usual care provided by the urologist,
      such as educational materials and services provided by the urologist.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A critical public health need exists for improved prognostic tools to distinguish aggressive
      from slow growing prostate cancer at diagnosis, and for better support systems to guide
      patients in decision-making regarding management options.

      Decision support interventions that are tailored to specific clinical conditions are known to
      have increased patient self-efficacy, knowledge, question-asking, and satisfaction; and
      decreased decisional conflict, regret, anxiety, and distress.

      To reduce the risk of over-treatment, our team has developed individual risk prediction
      models that we have now integrated into our decision support intervention (DSI).

      Delivering such decision support intervention should increase patient knowledge and
      question-asking by the patient to their doctor.

      The decision support intervention can be delivered by telephone and or the Internet.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a site-randomized, cluster-crossover clinical trial of a decision support intervention (DSI) vs. usual care, among men with low prognostic risk prostate cancer, to assess differences in informed decision making (i.e., knowledge), anxiety, and decision quality and self-efficacy.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Decision Quality Index (DQI) scores</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The DQI measures patient Knowledge, Concordance, and Decision process. For each fact about prostate cancer item, a correct response = 1 point. Missing responses=0 points. Total score is calculated for all patients who complete at least half of the items and scaled from 0‐100%, with higher scores indicating greater knowledge. Patients rate their goals and concerns on an 11‐point importance scale from 0 (not important at all) to 10 (extremely important). These questions + one question about patient's treatment preference can be used to calculate a concordance score. Patients are asked about whether they were offered a choice, how much pros and cons were discussed, and whether the health care provider asked for their preferences. Participants get 1 point for a response of &quot;yes&quot; / &quot;a lot/some.&quot;, total points are summed, then divided by total number of items for a decision making process score from 0‐100%. Higher scores indicate a more shared decision making process.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Memorial Anxiety Scale for Prostate Cancer (MAX-PC) scores</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The MAX-PC is an 18-item questionnaire with a 4-point Likert-type scale asking how frequently certain &quot;comments made by men about prostate cancer&quot; were true of the respondent (Roth et al., 2003). Each item is scored from 0 to 4 with anchors ranging from &quot;Not at all&quot; to &quot;Often.&quot; The scale can be scored in its entirety by summing all the items or summary scores can be grouped into Prostate Cancer Anxiety (11 items), Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) Anxiety (3 items), or Fear of Re-occurrence (4 items).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Decision Self-Efficacy (DSE) Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The DSE measures self-confidence or belief in one's ability to make informed decisions and participate in shared decision making with health professionals. It is a 11-item instrument with a five-point response scale ranging from 0 (not at all confident) to 4 (very confident).</description>

    <description>Participants assigned to the intervention will receive Decision Support Intervention in the form of a decision aid plus health coaching. The decision aid (delivered by internet and as a Portable Document Format (PDF) document) provides participants with a report on options and outcomes as described in the literature; along with more tailored risk information. The tailored risk information will include their estimated risk of harboring more aggressive prostate cancer based on their clinical/pathologic features (i.e., &quot;My Clinical Risk&quot;). The DSI was developed and piloted at UCSF according to the International Patient Decision Aid Standards (see http://ipdas.ohri.ca/) (IRS# 14-13332), and incorporates tailored risk models developed and validated.</description>

    <description>A question list (QL) that includes areas of patient concern are created by the health coach for use by the patient and the urologist at their first consultation visit where they discuss the extent of their cancer and consider treatment options. The coach uses the Prostate Cancer SCOPED model to complete a &quot;Prostate Cancer SCOPED Model Form&quot;. The SCOPED model uses concepts such as the situation, choices (treatment), objectives (personal goals and priorities), people (involved in supporting a treatment decision), evaluation and decisions (clarifying which choice is best and next steps).</description>
