  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This early phase I trial studies how well pembrolizumab works in treating patients with
      gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma that has spread to other places or cannot be removed by
      surgery. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's
      immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow
      and spread.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the overall response rate (ORR) of intravenous administration of pembrolizumab
      by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 in adult subjects with advanced
      (unresectable and/or metastatic) and previously treated gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the duration of response (DOR), disease control rate (DCR), time to
      progression (TTP), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) using RECIST
      1.1 and immune-related (ir)RECIST criteria.

      II. To perform exploratory biomarkers to study the correlation between immunological and
      molecular changes in tumor tissues and peripheral blood with clinical outcomes (DOR, DCR,
      TTP, PFS, and OS) using RECIST 1.1, and irRECIST rate of adverse events.

      III. To determine the safety and tolerability of intravenous administration of pembrolizumab
      or pembrolizumab plus ramucirumab in adult subjects with advanced (unresectable and/or
      metastatic) and previously treated gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore the association between PD-L1 expression by immunohistochemistry, shed PD-L1
      levels, somatic gene expression profiling and antitumor efficacy of pembrolizumab based on
      RECIST 1.1 imaging criteria as well as overall survival.

      II. To explore the relationship between genomic variation and response to the treatment
      administered.

      III. Tissue and blood immune monitoring will be conducted through our immune platform group
      as detailed per the biomarker section based on 3 biopsies done at the following time points:
      1) pre-treatment, 2) 6 weeks after therapy, and 3) and an optional biopsy upon progression.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats
      every 21 days for up to 35 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 12
      weeks thereafter.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject (or legally acceptable representative if applicable) provides written
             informed consent for the trial. The subject may also provide consent for future
             biomedical research. However the subject may participate in the main trial without
             participating in future biomedical research.

          -  Be willing and able to provide written informed consent/assent for the trial.

          -  Histologically and cytologically documented diagnosis as gastroesophageal
             adenocarcinoma.

          -  Have a documented advanced (metastatic and/or unresectable) gastroesophageal
             adenocarcinoma that is incurable and for which prior first-line or later-line standard
             of care (SOC) treatments have failed. There is no limit to the number of prior
             treatment regimens. Prior neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy included in initial
             treatment may not be considered first- or later-line SOC treatment unless such
             treatments were completed less than 12 months prior to the current tumor recurrence.

          -  Have submitted an evaluable tissue sample for biomarker analysis from a newly obtained

             specimen and of sufficient quantity and quality to allow biomarker study. A newly
             obtained tumor specimen, defined as a specimen obtained up to 6 weeks (42 days) prior
             to initiation of treatment on day 1, for biomarker characterization will be required
             for enrollment of all subjects. Tissue from tumor progressing at a site of prior
             radiation may be allowed for biomarker characterization upon agreement from Merck.
             Subjects for whom newly-obtained samples cannot be provided (e.g. inaccessible or
             subject safety concern) may submit an archived specimen only upon agreement from the
             Merck.

             1.5 X institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) (within 5 days prior to the start of
             study treatment). Creatinine clearance should be calculated per institutional
             standard.

          -  Serum total bilirubin =&lt; 1.5 X ULN OR direct bilirubin =&lt; ULN for subjects with total

             of anticoagulants (within 5 days prior to the start of study treatment).

          -  Female subject of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum
             pregnancy within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If
             the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test
