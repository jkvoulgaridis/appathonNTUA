  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is being conducted to learn more about a potential treatment
      (valoctocogene roxaparvovec) for people with severe hemophilia A. This research study will
      test and confirm the safety and effectiveness of the 4E13 vg/kg dose of the study drug
      (valoctocogene roxaparvovec) that contains the correct gene to make Factor VIII so that the
      body can make its own Factor VIII that functions properly. Only one dose of valoctocogene
      roxaparvovec is being given in this study, and this dose has been previously studied in
      another clinical trial in patients with hemophilia A. This is a phase 3 study which is meant
      to show that the study drug is safe and works to help treat hemophilia A. The study will see
      if liver cells are able to make Factor VIII that functions properly after receiving this
      study drug. The study will also examine the effects that the study drug has on how much
      Factor VIII concentrates patients have to inject into their veins and on their bleeding
      episodes after the study drug has been administered. Finally, the study will see if and how
      the body responds to the study drug - for example, whether liver cells become inflamed or
      whether the body makes antibodies (something the immune system makes to protect itself
      against things like bacteria and viruses) against the vector or the new Factor VIII gene.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males ≥ 18 years of age with hemophilia A and residual FVIII levels ≤ 1 IU/dL as
             evidenced by medical history, at the time of signing the informed consent.

          -  Must have been on prophylactic FVIII replacement therapy for at least 12 months prior
