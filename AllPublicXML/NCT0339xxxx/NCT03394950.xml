  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is the most common type of stroke, which has high rate of
      morbidity, mortality and disability. A large number of studies have confirmed that the
      thrombolytic therapy can effectively open blood vessels and improve the functional prognosis
      of acute ischemic stroke. Therefore, all guidelines recommend giving thrombolysis treatment
      to acute ischemic stroke patients within 4.5 hours of onset. However, about 1/3 patients
      receiving thrombolysis will have good prognosis, while a large number of patients will still
      be disabled and even dead. How to improve the neurofunctional prognosis of thrombolytic
      patients has been a hot topic in the world.

      Butyl phthalide is type I chemical drugs. Some multicenter randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled clinical trials have showed that acute ischemic stroke patients taking
      butyl phthalide has better lateral branch circulation and living ability score than patients
      taking placebo. Besides, butyl phthalide treatment is safe. The animal experiment indicated
      that buphthalein could significantly improve secondary side branch circulation, recover the
      microarterial diameter of the soft meninges in the ischemic region and increase the blood
      flow rate.

      Based on the discussion, we assume that: giving butyl phthalide to patients with acute
      ischemic stroke in advance, might promote and improve the formation of collateral circulation
      to freeze ischemia penumbra. Based on this hypothesis, we would like to explore the efficacy
      and safety of butyl phthalide combined with rtPA thrombolysis in the treatment of acute
      ischemic stroke.
