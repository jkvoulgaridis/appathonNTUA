    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the side effects and best dose of capecitabine when given
      together with pembrolizumab and bevacizumab, and investigates how well they work in treating
      patients with microsatellite stable colorectal cancer that has spread to nearby tissues or
      lymph nodes, has spread to other places in the body, or that cannot be removed by surgery.
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab and bevacizumab, may interfere with the ability
      of tumor cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as capecitabine, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving capecitabine together with
      pembrolizumab and bevacizumab may work better in treating patients with colorectal cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D)/maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of
      capecitabine when administered with pembrolizumab and bevacizumab. (Safety Lead-In Cohort)
      II. To evaluate the overall response rate (ORR) to pembrolizumab plus capecitabine and
      bevacizumab (complete or partial response rate per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
      Tumors [RECIST] 1.1) in subjects with metastatic or locally advanced unresectable
      microsatellite stable (MSS)/mismatch repair proficient (pMMR) colorectal carcinoma (CRC) that
      is stable or progressing on fluorouracil (5FU)-based therapy. (Phase II Expansion Cohort)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES (Phase II Expansion Cohort):

      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab in combination with capecitabine
      and bevacizumab.

      II. To evaluate ORR per immune-related RECIST (irRECIST). III. To evaluate duration of
      response (DOR), disease control rate (DCR) and progression-free survival (PFS) per RECIST 1.1
      and irRECIST and overall survival (OS).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Correlation of outcomes to line of therapy; stable disease or progression on a prior
      regimen containing infusional 5-FU or capecitabine; prior exposure to bevacizumab; and
      primary tumor location.

      II. To explore baseline immune profiles via PD-L1, and multiplex Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
      for identification of potentially predictive biomarkers in patients with metastatic or
      locally advanced, unresectable CRC treated with pembrolizumab-based combination therapy.

      III. To characterize the change in the populations of tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIICs)
      by IHC induced by pembrolizumab-based combination therapy in paired pre- and on-treatment
      tumor biopsies from patients with metastatic or locally advanced, unresectable MSS / pMMR
      CRC.

      IV. To determine the change in T cell repertoire via next generation sequencing (NGS) within
      blood and tumor biopsy samples induced by pembrolizumab-based combination therapy in patients
      with metastatic or locally advanced, unresectable MSS/pMMR CRC.

      V. To establish human immune system (HIS) patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models from
      pre-treatment biopsies to a) analyze change in immune cell profiles HIS PDX models using the
      same techniques as described for corresponding patients, above and b) correlate response to
      pembrolizumab-containing therapy in patients and HIS PDX.

      OUTLINE:

      An initial safety lead-in will be performed to define the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD)/recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over
      30 minutes on day 1, bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1, and capecitabine orally (PO)
      twice daily (BID) on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 35 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 9 weeks until
      disease progression, start of new anti-cancer therapy, death, or end of the study whichever
      comes first
