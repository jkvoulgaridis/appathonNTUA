      Background:

      Primary immunodeficiency disorders, or PIDs, are diseases that weaken the immune system. This
      makes it easier for a person to get sick. Some PIDs are mild and may not be diagnosed until
      later in life. Other kinds are severe and can be identified shortly after birth. Researchers
      want to learn more about PIDs by comparing data from relatives and healthy volunteers to
      people with a PID.

      Objective:

      To learn more about PIDs, including their genetic causes.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 0 75 with a PID or their healthy biological relatives the same ages

      Healthy volunteers ages 18 75

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical exam, and HIV blood test. They
      may have a pregnancy test.

      Participants may repeat the screening tests.

      Blood taken at screening will be used for genetic tests and research tests. Participants will
      be told test results that affect their health. Some blood will be stored for future research.

      Adult participants with a PID may have a small piece of skin removed. The area will be
      numbed. A small tool will take a piece of skin about the size of a pencil eraser.

      Researchers may collect fluid or tissue samples from PID participants regular medical care.
      They will use them for research tests.

      Participants with a PID will have 3 follow-up visits over 10 years (for infants, 2 years).
      Visits will include a physical exam, medical history, and blood draw.

      Participants with a PID and their relatives will be called once a year for 10 years. They
      will talk about how they are feeling and if they have developed any new symptoms or
      illnesses.

    <textblock>
      This is a natural history study designed to investigate forms of primary immunodeficiency
      disorders (PIDs), and to better define both new and previously described forms of PID,
      including severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), combined immunodeficiency, natural killer
      (NK) cell deficiency, and other disorders. Patients with clinical and/or laboratory evidence
      of PID will be recruited at Children s National Health System (CNHS) and the National
      Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). Infants identified at birth with a
      positive newborn screening for SCID and confirmed to have T-cell lymphocytopenia will also be
      recruited at CNHS. Subjects with a known or unknown PID and infants with T-cell
      lymphocytopenia will provide one or more blood donations during the course of the study to
      enable immunologic and genetic investigations of immune pathways contributing to PIDs. These
      subjects will also be followed clinically to longitudinally assess the natural history of
      novel and known PIDs. Subjects will be followed over time with regard to their immunologic
      phenotype, clinical disease (including incidence of infections, autoimmune phenomena,
      allergic disease, or malignancies), and response to both preventative and definitive
      therapies. Biological relatives who do not have PID and healthy adult volunteers will also be
      eligible to serve as controls for this study.

        Potential subjects with confirmed or suspected PIO and their biological relatives will be
        referred to the study from physicians at CNHS or at the NIH. In addition, patients who have
        a clinical diagnosis of PIO may also be referred from physicians at other institutions.
        Healthy volunteers may be recruited from the NIH Clinical Research Volunteer Program

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Subjects must meet one of the following 4 criteria:

               1. Patients (age 0-75 years) with a clinical diagnosis of a form of PID (either
                  known or unknown). PID is defined by laboratory and/or clinical findings on two
                  or more occasions that are consistent with a defect in innate or adaptive
                  immunity. Specific PIDs are defined by the International Union of Immunological
                  Societies guidelines. These subjects must also be willing to undergo genetic
                  testing and to allow their biospecimens to be modified into iPS cells. Women of
                  childbearing potential, or who are pregnant or lactating, may be eligible. The
                  volume of blood collected for research purposes will be reduced, and no skin
                  biopsies will be performed for research purposes in consideration of their
                  safety.

               2. Infants identified at birth with positive newborn screening for SCID and
                  confirmed to have T-cell lymphocytopenia. These subjects must be willing to
                  undergo genetic testing.

               3. Biological relatives (age 0-75 years) of a subject who meets criterion 1a or 1b
                  but who do not have a PID themselves.Relatives may be mother, father, siblings,
                  children, grandparents, aunts, uncles, and first cousins to a patient. There is
                  no limit due to sex,

                  race or disability. Women of child-bearing potential, or who are pregnant or
                  lactating, may be eligible, however the volume of blood collected for research
                  purposes will be reduced in consideration of their safety. Relatives must also be
                  willing to undergo genetic

                  testing

               4. Healthy volunteers (age 18-75 years) who are not related to another study
                  subject, who do not have a PID, and meet the folllowing:

                    -  Weight is greater than 110 pounds

                    -  Do not have a history of any heart, lung, or kidney disease, or bleeding
                       disorders,

                    -  Do not have a history of viral hepatitis (B or C), and have a negative

                    -  Not infected with HIV

                    -  Not to be pregnant

          2. All subjects must be willing to allow their samples to be stored for future research.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Subjects with secondary causes of immunodeficiency are excluded from this study.
             Secondary causes of immunodeficiency include HIV infection and immunodeficiency that
             is deemed to be secondary to chronic use of immunosuppressive medications or
             chemotherapeutic agents.

          2. Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, contraindicates participation
             in this study.
