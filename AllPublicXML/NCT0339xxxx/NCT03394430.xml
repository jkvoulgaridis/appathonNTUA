  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Induction with high sevoﬂurane concentrations may trigger epileptiform
      electroencephalographic activity without motor or cardiovascular manifestations in healthy
      patients. No other symptoms were associated in this series, and only electroencephalographic
      monitoring allowed the diagnosis. Midazolam and dexmedetomidine are sedatives commonly used
      in children before surgery. Although the mechanisms are different, both have been reported in
      antiepileptic effects.

      This study was designed to compare the effects between intranasal midazolam or
      dexmedetomidine on epileptiform EEG during sevoflurane mask induction in children.
      Anaesthesia was induced with 8% sevoﬂurane. The patients were randomly assigned to Group A
      (n=15, preoperative intranasal normal saline), Group B (n=15, preoperative intranasal
      0.25mg/kg midazolam), and Group C (n=15, preoperative intranasal 1μg/kg dexmedetomidine). An
      electroencephalogram was recorded before and during induction up to 10 min after the start of
      induction.

    <description>EEG were visually analyzed off-line by a neurophysiologist familiar with anesthesia EEG and blinded to the randomization. EEG abnormalities related to epileptic features were classiﬁed according to the description of Vakkuri and Jaaskelainen, and the recommendations of Constant: spikes and spikes with slow wave complexes (SW), rhythmic polyspikes corresponding to waveforms appearing at regular intervals (RPS) and periodic epileptiform discharge (PED), which refers to periodic hypersynchronized complexes occurring bilaterally. These entire electroencephalographic phenomena were considered as epileptiform EEG if their duration was longer than three seconds.</description>
