      This is a pilot study to test the feasibility and acceptability of a self-regulation
      theory-based mHealth behavior intervention for overweight or obese older adults with T2DM.
      The main purpose of the intervention is to increase participants' awareness of their behavior
      patterns and to self-regulate their daily lifestyle behaviors using the results of
      self-monitoring of weight and blood glucose. This is a One Group Pretest-Posttest Designed
      study. Ten participants will be recruited from Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston, MA. They will
      receive a 2-month, self-regulation theory-based weight loss intervention (five 60-minute,
      biweekly group sessions) and will be provided with a technology toolkit for self-monitoring
      including an (1) iPhone Plus, (2) the Lose It! app for self-monitoring of dietary intake, (3)
      Fitbit for self-monitoring of physical activity, (4) Bluetooth-enabled scale for daily
      weight, and (5) Bluetooth-enabled blood glucose monitor for testing blood glucose levels.
      There will be a 1-month follow-up after intervention. Assessments will occur at baseline and
      the end of follow-up. The individual interviews will be conducted with the participants to
      learn about their experience of technology use to self-manage their weight and diabetes at
      the end of study.

    <description>Participants will receive a self-regulation theory-based mHealth behavior intervention (5 biweekly group sessions, 60 minutes /session). An experienced Certified Diabetes Educator from the Joslin Diabetes Center and PI (Dr. Zheng) who has been trained using self-regulation for weight loss will co-facilitate group sessions. The intervention combines diet modification and increased physical activity with a weekly weight loss goal as well as focuses on improving participants' three typical self-regulation strategies - self-monitoring, self-evaluation and self-reinforcement. Intervention duration will last 2 months with subsequent 1-month follow.</description>
