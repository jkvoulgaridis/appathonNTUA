  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A study is to see if methyldopa can change the immune system's attack on insulin producing
      cells in people at early stages of type 1 diabetes.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled, multi-center crossover
      clinical trial.

      Eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 allocation ratio to one of two treatment
      schedules: first methyldopa then placebo vs. first placebo then methyldopa.

      The study objective is to assess the safety, efficacy, and mode of action of methyldopa to
      reduce DQ8 antigen presentation in individuals at Stage 1 and 2 of type 1 diabetes (T1D).

             parent or legal guardian provide Informed Consent

          -  Confirmed positive for one or more autoantibodies, one of which is insulin
             autoantibody (mIAA)

          -  Positive for at least one gene encoding HLA-DQ8 (DQB*0302)

          -  If a female participant with reproductive potential, willing to avoid pregnancy and
             undergo pregnancy testing prior to randomization and during the study

          -  Have normal or abnormal glucose tolerance on OGTT performed within 7 weeks of
             randomization

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inability or unwillingness of a participant to give written informed consent or comply
             with study protocol

          -  History of clinically significant anemia or Hemoglobin &lt;10 g/dl

          -  Evidence of liver dysfunction

          -  History of renal insufficiency

          -  Use of a treatment that is known to cause a significant, ongoing change in the course
             of diabetes or immunologic status, within 4 weeks prior to participation. This
             includes high-dose inhaled, extensive topical or systemic glucocorticoids

          -  Females who are pregnant at the time of screening, breastfeeding or unwilling to defer
             pregnancy during the 16-month study period. (Female participant must be at least 100

             testing that are not listed above, which, in the opinion of the investigator, may pose
             additional risks from participation in the study, may interfere with the participant's
             ability to comply with study requirements or that may impact the quality or
             interpretation of the data obtained from the study
