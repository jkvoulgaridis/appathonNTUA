  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase 2 multicenter, randomized, placebo controlled, single-blind study. The
      primary objective of the study is to compare the effect of weekly dosing of LJPC-401
      (synthetic human hepcidin) versus placebo on transferrin saturation (TSAT) in an adult
      hereditary hemochromatosis patient population.

    <description>Exploratory measure for change in quality of life as measured by the Short Form Health Survey version 2.0 questionnaire. The scale measures physical functioning; role-physical, bodily pain; general health; vitality; social functioning; role-emotional; mental health and reported health transition. The responses vary depending on the question: Range 1-6 (none to very severe); range 1-5 (all of the time to none of the time or definitely true to definitely false); range 1-4 not at all to quite a bit; range 1-3 (yes, limited a lot to no, not limited at all). All scoring will be tallied by a validated central system (Optum) and provided to the sponsor at the end of the study. Scoring will be analyzed as a change from baseline to end of treatment (Week 16).</description>
