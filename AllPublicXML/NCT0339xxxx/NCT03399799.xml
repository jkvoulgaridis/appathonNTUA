    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the safety of JNJ-64407564 and to determine the
      recommended Phase 2 dose(s) (RP2Ds) and dosing schedule assessed to be safe for JNJ-64407564
      (Part 1 [Dose Escalation]) and to further characterize the safety of JNJ-64407564 at the
      recommended Phase 2 dose(s) (RP2Ds) (Part 2 [Dose Expansion]).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in 2 parts, separately for intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SC)
      administration: dose escalation and dose expansion. The study will evaluate safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary antitumor activity of JNJ-64407564
      administered to adult participants with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. The overall
      safety of the study drug will be assessed by physical examinations, Eastern Cooperative
      Oncology Group performance status, laboratory tests, vital signs, electrocardiograms, adverse
      event monitoring, and concomitant medication usage. Disease evaluations will include
      peripheral blood and bone marrow assessments at screening (performed within 28 days) and to
      confirm stringent complete response (sCR), complete response (CR), or relapse from CR. The
      end of study (study completion) is defined as the last study assessment for the last
      participant in the study.
