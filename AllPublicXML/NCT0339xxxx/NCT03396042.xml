    <textblock>
      A prospective natural history study with systematic assessments and uniform follow-up to
      provide a high-quality dataset for assisting in the design of future clinical treatment
      trials involving patients with CEP290-related retinal degeneration caused by the common
      intron 26 mutation.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to describe the natural history of CEP290-related retinal
      degeneration caused by a compound heterozygous or homozygous intron 26 c.2991+1655A&gt;G
      mutation and to better understand the best assessments for evaluation of patients with this
      condition in a future interventional trial. Patients meeting the entry criteria will be
      enrolled in the study. Visits will occur at Screening, Baseline, and Months 3, 6, and 12, for
      a total duration of 1 year.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient and/or parent/legal guardian must complete/sign an informed consent form
             (ICF). If required on a per patient basis, provisions can be made for alternative
             forms of consent (eg, witnessed consent). Where required by the IRB/IEC, minors must
             also verbalize or sign a confirmation of assent. Refer to Section 11.3.

          -  Is at least 3 years of age at screening.

          -  Has abnormally decreased vision, defined as having light perception to 20/50 visual
             acuity in each eye, with examination and test results consistent with an inherited
             retinal degeneration due to mutations in the CEP290 gene.

          -  Has CEP290-related retinal degeneration caused by a compound heterozygous or
             homozygous intron 26 c.2991+1655A&gt;G mutation (ie, 1 or 2 copies of the intron 26
             c.2991+1655A&gt;G mutation) confirmed by deoxyribonucleic acid sequencing.

          -  Has ability to cooperate with assessments relative to age.

          -  Has clear ocular media and adequate pupil dilation in at least 1 eye, to permit good
             quality fundus examination and optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging.

          -  Must be able to successfully navigate the mobility courses at a level of difficulty
             that is below the maximum performance level (ie, below a passing score at 1) with each
             eye independently and both eyes together in the order specified by Investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has history or current evidence of a medical condition (systemic or ophthalmic
             disease, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical laboratory
             finding) that may, in the opinion of the Investigator, preclude adherence to the
             scheduled study visits, safe participation in the study, or affect the results of the
             study (eg, uncontrolled systemic hypertension, autoimmune disease, advanced coronary
             artery disease, or cerebral vascular disease, other unstable or progressive
             cardiovascular, pulmonary, Parkinson's, liver or renal disease, cancer, or dementia).

          -  Has history or current evidence of ocular disease in either eye that, in the opinion
             of the Investigator, may confound assessment of this inherited retinal disease or the
             assessments utilized herein (eg, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration, diabetic
             retinopathy, uveitis, or the presence of any condition that precludes adequate
             visualization of the fundus such as dense cataracts or corneal scarring).

          -  Is currently receiving gene therapy and/or has received gene therapy.

          -  Is currently enrolled in an investigational or interventional drug or device study
             and/or has participated in such a study within 30 days of Screening.
