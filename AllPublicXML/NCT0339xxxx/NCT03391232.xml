  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase I/II clinical trial investigates the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity and
      preliminary efficacy of multiple doses of PolyPEPI1018 CRC vaccine as an add-on treatment to
      the standard-of-care maintenance therapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.
      Clinical responses will be evaluated by indiction of T cell responses, T lymphocyte
      infiltration in accessible biopsy sites, and by objective tumor responses. This study will
      also explore the accuracy of the predicted T cell responses in each patient using the
      candidate companion diagnostic test and the correlations between clinical responses and
      predicted T cell responses.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/II, open-label, single-arm, multicenter study to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, immunogenicity and efficacy of a multiple subcutaneous injection of
      PolyPEPI1018 as an add-on immunotherapy to the standard-of-care maintenance therapy in
      approximately 15 subjects with metastatic colorectal cancer.

      The first part of the study investigates the administration of a single vaccine dose during
      12‑week follow‑up period on an outpatient basis. Screening is performed in parallel with the
      subject's completion of the standard-of-care first-line treatment and initiation of the
      standard-of-care maintenance treatment. A single dose of PolyPEPI1018 is administered after
      the subject initiates the maintenance regimen, and within 3 weeks after the eligibility CT
      scan was performed. Subjects are monitored every 3 weeks for 12 weeks.

      The second part of the study investigates the administration of 3 vaccine doses (Weeks 0, 13,
      26) then 12 weeks follow‑up on an outpatient basis.

    <description>The vaccine contains 6 synthetic peptides mixed with the adjuvant Montanide™. The peptides were selected to induce T cell responses against 12 dominant epitopes from 7 cancer testis antigens (CTAs), which are the most frequently expressed CTAs in colorectal cancer. The 6 peptides were optimized to induce long lasting CRC specific T cell responses.</description>
