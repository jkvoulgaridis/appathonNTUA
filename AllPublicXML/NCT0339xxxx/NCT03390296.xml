      This phase Ib/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of anti-OX40 antibody
      PF-04518600 (OX40) and how well it works alone or in combination with venetoclax, avelumab,
      glasdegib, gemtuzumab ozogamicin, and azacitidine in treating patients with acute myeloid
      leukemia that has come back or does not respond to treatment. Immunotherapy with monoclonal
      antibodies, such as OX40, avelumab, and gemtuzumab ozogamicin, may help the body's immune
      system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and
      spread. Glasdegib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed
      for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as venetoclax and azacitidine, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving OX40, venetoclax, avelumab,
      glasdegib, gemtuzumab ozogamicin, and azacitidine may work better in treating patients with
      acute myeloid leukemia.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety of multiple combination regimens of IO-agents (PF04518600 [Ox40
      agonist monoclonal antibody (mAb)], avelumab [PD-L1 antagonist mAb], hypomethylator therapy
      (azacitidine), anti CD33 mAb (gemtuzumab ozogamycin, GO), Bcl-2 inhibitor (venetoclax) and
      smoothened pathway inhibitor (glasdegib) in patients with relapsed/refractory (RR) acute
      myeloid leukemia (AML).

      II. To evaluate the composite complete response (CRc) defined as complete response (CR) +
      complete response with incomplete recovery of platelets (CRp) + complete response with
      incomplete recovery of counts (CRi) within 3 months of therapy initiation in patients with RR
      AML of: Arm A. PF-04518600 alone, Arm B. azacitidine + venetoclax + GO, Arm C. azacitidine +
      aveluma + GO, Arm D. azacitidine + venetoclax + avelumab, Arm E. Azacitidine + avelumab +
      PF-04518600, Arm F. GO + glasdegib.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the morphologic leukemia free survival (MLFS), partial response (PR),
      hematologic improvement (HI) rate of patients with RR AML treated on arms A-F.

      II. To assess relapse-free survival (RFS), time to next therapy (TNT), 4-week and 8-week
      mortality, and overall survival (OS) of patients with RR AML treated on arms A-F.

      III. To assess minimal residual disease (MRD) by multiparametric flow-cytometry at response
      (+/- 1 month) and assess correlation of MRD to OS in arms A-F.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To study immunological and molecular features at baseline and at predefined time-points
      on-therapy with each combination in the peripheral blood and bone marrow to include
      quantification of immune ligand expression by the AML/myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) blasts
      and AML/MDS stromal components (myeloid-derived suppressor cell [MDSC]s, monocytes and
      mesenchymal stem cell [MSC]s) including galectin 9, 4-1BBL, ICOSL, PD-L1, PD-L2, OX-40L,
      CD137L, others.

      II. To study immunological and molecular features at baseline and at predefined time-points
      on-therapy with each combination in the peripheral blood and bone marrow to include
      determination of the quantitative expression of positive and negative co-stimulatory
      molecules including 4-1BB, CTLA-4, ICOS, PD-1, OX40, LAG-3, TIM-3, HLA-DR, Ki67, others on
      T-lymphocyte subsets.

      III. To study immunological and molecular features at baseline and at predefined time-points
      on-therapy with each combination in the peripheral blood and bone marrow to include
      identification of the immunophenotype of tumor-infiltrating T-lymphocytes (TILs) pre- and
      post-therapy including CD8+, CD4+ effector, CD4+ regulatory TILs and central memory, effector
      memory, and naive T-cell subsets among the CD4 and CD8 populations.

      IV. To develop a micro-array based gene expression profile (GEP) predictor of response to the
      immune combinations using either baseline ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing and/or
      nanostring.

      V. To perform a validated next generation sequencing (NGS)-based analysis for the detection
      of somatic mutations in the coding sequences of 28 genes commonly mutated in AML at baseline
      and on treatment to identify baseline predictors and clonal evolution on treatment and/or
      whole exome sequencing (WES) in selected cases.

      VI. To identify clonal T-cells by performing T-cell repertoire analysis at baseline and
      longitudinally on therapy on the peripheral blood and/o bone marrow samples.

      VII. To assess levels of cytokines at baseline and longitudinally on therapy in peripheral
      blood and/or bone marrow.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose escalation study of anti-OX40 antibody PF-04518600 followed
      by a phase II study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 6 arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive anti-OX40 antibody PF-04518600 intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on
      days 1 and 14. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM B: Patients receive azacitidine IV over 10-40 minutes or via injection subcutaneously
      (SC) on days 1-7 or 1-5 and 8-9. Patients also receive venetoclax orally (PO) on days 1-28
      and GO IV over 2 hours on day 8. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  ARMS A-G: RR AML: Patients with AML who are refractory or relapsed (any salvage) with
             no available therapies or not candidates for available therapies. For patients with
             prior MDS or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) or myeloproliferative neoplasm
             (MPN) who transformed to AML, therapy received for MDS, CMML, or MPN is NOT considered
             as prior therapy for AML with the exception of MDS or CMML treated with
             hypomethylating agents (HMAs). Patients with MDS or CMML treated with HMA therapies
             who progress to AML, and have no available therapies or are not candidates for
             available therapies, will be eligible at the time of progression to AML.

          -  Prior therapy with hydroxyurea, chemotherapy, biological or targeted therapy (e.g.
             FLT3 inhibitors, other kinase inhibitors), or hematopoietic growth factors is
             permitted.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =&lt; 2.

          -  Total bilirubin =&lt; 2.0 times upper limit of normal (x ULN).

          -  Aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase =&lt; 2.5 x ULN (aspartate
             aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase =&lt; 5.0 x ULN if deemed related to
             leukemia by the treating physician).

          -  Adequate renal function defined by an estimated creatinine clearance &gt;= 40 mL/min
             according to the Cockcroft-Gault formula (or local institutional standard method).

          -  Patients must provide written informed consent.

          -  In the absence of rapidly progressive disease, the interval from prior treatment to
             the time of initiation of protocol therapy will be at least 14 days for prior
             anti-leukemic therapy, with the exception of hydroxyurea as noted below, OR at least 5
             half-lives for cytotoxic/noncytotoxic agents, whichever is shorter. The half-life for
             the therapy in question will be based on published pharmacokinetic literature
             (abstracts, manuscripts, investigator brochure's, or drug-administration manuals) and
             will be documented in the protocol eligibility document. The toxicity from prior
             therapy should have resolved to grade =&lt; 1, however alopecia and sensory neuropathy
             grade =&lt; 2 not constituting a safety risk based on investigators judgement is
             acceptable. Since the effect of most IO-agents, HMA-therapies, SMO-inhibitors,
             venetoclax may be delayed, use of hydroxyurea for patients with rapidly proliferative
             disease is allowed before the start of study therapy and will not require a washout.

          -  Concurrent therapy for central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis or continuation of
             therapy for controlled CNS disease is permitted. Patients with a known history of CNS
             disease or leukemic brain metastasis must have been treated locally, have at least 3
             consecutive lumbar punctures (LPs) with no evidence of CNS leukemia, and must be
             clinically stable for at least 4 weeks prior to enrollment and have no ongoing
             neurological symptoms that in the opinion of the treating physician are related to the
             CNS disease (sequelae that are a consequence of the treatment of the CNS disease are
             acceptable).

          -  Females must be surgically or biologically sterile or postmenopausal (amenorrheic for
             at least 12 months) or if of childbearing potential, must have a negative serum or
             urine pregnancy test within 72 hours before the start of the treatment.

          -  Women of childbearing potential must agree to use an adequate method of contraception
             during the study and until 3 months after the last treatment. Males must be surgically
             or biologically sterile or agree to use an adequate method of contraception during the
             study until 3 months after the last treatment. Adequate methods of contraception
             include:

               -  Total abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of
                  the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
                  contraception.

               -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without
                  hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment.
                  In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has
                  been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment.

               -  Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). For female patients on
                  the study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that
                  patient.

               -  Combination of any of the two following:

                    -  Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or
                       other forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure
                       rate &lt; 1%), for example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone
                       contraception.

                    -  Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS).

                    -  Barrier methods of contraception: condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or
                       cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/ vaginal
                       suppository in case of use of oral contraception, women should have been
                       stable on the same pill before taking study treatment.

               -  Note: Oral contraceptives are allowed but should be used in conjunction with a
                  barrier method of contraception due to unknown effect of drug-drug interaction.
                  Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they
                  have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate
                  clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have
                  had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal
                  ligation at least six weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the
                  reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level
                  assessment is she considered not of child bearing potential.
