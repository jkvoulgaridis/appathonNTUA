  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial studying the effects of time-restricted eating (TRE) on
      weight loss in obese humans. Obesity is the number one risk factor for type 2 Diabetes
      Mellitus (T2DM), and numerous studies demonstrate that weight loss is an effective strategy
      to prevent T2DM and improve the metabolic health of people diagnosed with T2DM.
      Unfortunately, classical calorie restriction diets often fail to produce long-term weight
      loss due to low compliance, reduced resting metabolic rate (RMR), and other factors.
      Therefore, novel dieting techniques must be explored in order to successfully treat obesity
      and prevent T2DM. Studies in mice provide compelling evidence that feeding/fasting cycles can
      be altered to produce beneficial effects on weight loss and metabolic health markers in the
      absence of calorie restriction. Limited research in human subjects suggests that this feeding
      paradigm may translate to human health as well, however, more research needs to be done in
      order to confirm this hypothesis. This study will determine if TRE can lead to weight loss in
      obese human subjects. Secondary outcomes include changes in body composition, HOMA-IR,
      hormonal and biochemical serum markers, RMR, and total energy expenditure (TEE).
