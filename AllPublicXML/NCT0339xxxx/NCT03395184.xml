      The objectives of this study are to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of PF-06651600 (200 mg for 8 weeks followed by 50 mg
      for 4 weeks) dosed once daily and PF-06700841 (60 mg for 12 weeks) dosed once daily during an
      induction period of 12 weeks, followed by an open label extension period at doses of 50 mg
      and 30 mg of PF 06651600 and PF 06700841, respectively, for 52 weeks.
