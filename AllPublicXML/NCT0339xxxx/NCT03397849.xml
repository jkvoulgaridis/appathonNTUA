  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the present study, investigators aim to compare intervention using mobile technology (IMT)
      plus usual care with only usual care in patients with a high risk for cardiovascular diseases
      (CVD). Investigators hypothesize that IMT plus usual care reduces the CVD risk and improves
      the secondary outcomes in this population through 12 months of follow-up period. Patients
      presented to the outpatient clinics in a tertiary hospital (Dr. Siyami Ersek Thoracic and
      Cardiovascular Surgery Research and Training Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey) who were considered
      to be eligible according to inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enrolled to the study.
      The eligibility criteria is; Patients between 20 to 79 years old who are in high risk for CVD
      (10 years ASCVD risk ≥ 7.5%). Patients with prior CVD events (myocardial infarction,
      percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary artery by-pass grafting operation, stroke and
      peripheral artery disease), pregnancy, communication problems, severe neuropsychiatric
      problems and chronic kidney disease are excluded from the study. In addition, patients that
      are unable to use smartphone phone are also excluded.

    <intervention_model_description>Patients that are randomized to usual care group will receive guideline-standardized medications and lifestyle recommendations. Cardiovascular risk management and compliance to medication and lifestyle recommendation will be assessed and controlled by three cardiologists in clinical visits performed at 6 and 12 months. For the necessary cases counseling to other specialities will be performed for smoke cessation and weight management.
Each study patients that are randomized to IMT plus usual care group will receive a group of smart devices including mobile phone (Vestel Venus e2) (Vestel, Manisa, Turkey), wristband (Xiaomi band 2) (Beijing Xiaomi Technology Co., Beijing, China), weight scale (Bluecat, Yongkang Tiansheng Electronic Co., Zhejiang, China) and blood pressure monitor (Clever Chek TD-3250) (TaiDoc Technology Co., Taipei County, Taiwan).</intervention_model_description>
