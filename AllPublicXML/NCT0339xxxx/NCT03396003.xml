    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the Ziemer Ophthalmic Systems AG GALILEI G6 Lens
      Professional to the Oculus Pentacam® AXL for taking images and measurements of the anterior
      segment of the eye, including the cornea, pupil, anterior chamber and lens, to assist in
      determining the power of the intraocular lens for implantation.

    <textblock>
      A corneal topographer/biometer named GALILEI G6 Lens Professional was developed by Ziemer
      Ophthalmic Systems AG for the measurement of anterior segment geometry and axial intraocular
      distances. The measurement principle of the corneal topographer corresponds to that of the
      commercially available Galilei G4 Dual Scheimpflug Analyzer, whereas the measurement
      principle of the biometer is based on low coherence interferometry/reflectometry, which has
      been widely used and applied clinically by a number of predicate devices.

      One complete measurement consists of a corneal topography/ tomography scan followed by three
      consecutive, axial biometry scans of the anterior segment (cornea and crystalline lens) and
      three consecutive, axial biometry scans of the retina. The measurement process is continuous
      but divided into three alignment-click-steps.

      Such measurements can be applied to given Intra Ocular Lens (IOL) types and IOL equations, to
      permit the calculation of recommended IOLs to be implanted during cataract surgery in order
      to achieve the desired vision correction.

      The primary objectives of this clinical study are to: 1) evaluate the inter-device
      repeatability, inter-operator repeatability and reproducibility of the GALILEI G6 Lens
      Professional in repeated measurements of anterior segment geometry and axial intraocular
      distances and, 2) demonstrate substantial equivalence through examining agreement of the
      GALILEI measurements to those of the predicate device, the Pentacam® AXL.
