             Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03 grade 1, or to
             levels dictated in the eligibility criteria) with the exception of alopecia or
             toxicities from prior anti-tumor therapy that are considered irreversible [defined as
             having been present and stable for &gt; 28 days] which may be allowed if they are not
             otherwise described in the exclusion criteria AND there is agreement to allow by both

          -  Exclusion of hepatitis infection based on the following results and/or criteria:
             Positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) (indicative of chronic hepatitis B or
             recent acute hepatitis B); Negative HBsAg and positive for hepatitis B core antibody:
             hepatitis B virus DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is necessary. Detectable
             hepatitis B virus DNA suggests occult hepatitis B

          -  Positive Hepatitis C virus antibody (HCVAb): hepatitis C virus RNA by PCR is
             necessary. Detectable hepatitis C virus RNA suggests chronic hepatitis C

          -  History or evidence of any other clinically significant disorder, condition or disease
             that, in the opinion of the investigator or Amgen physician, if consulted, would pose

             completion

In general, Amgen does not grant external requests for individual patient data for the purpose of re-evaluating safety and efficacy issues already addressed in the product labelling. Requests are reviewed by a committee of internal advisors, and if not approved, may be further arbitrated by a Data Sharing Independent Review Panel. Upon approval, information necessary to address the research question will be provided under the terms of a data sharing agreement.
