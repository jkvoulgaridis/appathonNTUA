    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open label, single-arm, phase 3 study to assess the efficacy and
      safety of tabelecleucel for the treatment of Epstein-Barr virus-associated post-transplant
      lymphoproliferative disease (EBV+ PTLD) in the setting of allogeneic hematopoietic cell
      transplant (HCT) after failure of rituximab.

      This is a multicenter, open label, single-arm, phase 3 study to assess the efficacy and
      safety of tabelecleucel for the treatment of EBV+ PTLD in the setting of allogeneic HCT after
      failure of rituximab.

      Tabelecleucel will be selected for the subject from the bank of available tabelecleucel cell
      products based on matching &gt;= 2 human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles, at least one of which
      is a restricting HLA allele, shared between the tabelecleucel donor and the subject's EBV+
      PTLD. Sites will provide high resolution subject and subject's graft donor HLA typing results
      and other information as required by the protocol.

      Tabelecleucel will be administered in cycles lasting 5 weeks (35 days). During each cycle,
      subjects will receive intravenous (IV) tabelecleucel at a dose of 2×10^6 cells/kg on Days 1,
      8, and 15, followed by observation through Day 35.

      NOTE, 29 April 2020: Study sites/locations with status &quot;completed&quot; may be screening EBV+ PTLD
      HCT subjects in clinical study ATA129-EBV-302 (NCT03394365).

      NOTE, 29 April 2020: Enrollment is temporarily paused at study site/locations with status
      &quot;active, not recruiting&quot; due to COVID-19 restrictions.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant

          2. A diagnosis of locally-assessed, biopsy-proven EBV+ PTLD with a pathology sample
             available for central review

          3. Availability of appropriate partially HLA-matched and restricted tabelecleucel cell
             product

          4. Measurable, 18F-deoxyglucose (FDG)-avid (Deauville score &gt;= 3) systemic disease (using

             (PET)-diagnostic computed tomography (CT). Baseline scans must be of acceptable
             quality to the central radiology laboratory prior to Cycle 1 Day 1.

          5. Failure of rituximab for first-line treatment of PTLD. Note: Subjects with CD20
             negative disease are eligible to enroll without prior anti-CD20 therapy after failure
             of first-line treatment (reduction of immunosuppression is not considered first-line
             therapy) and discussion with the sponsor's medical monitor.

          6. Males and females of any age

          7. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status &lt;= 3 for subjects aged &gt;

          8. Underlying primary disease, for which the subject underwent transplant, is in
             morphologic remission

                  &lt; 50,000/µL but &gt;= 20,000/µL, with or without transfusion support, is permissible
                  if the subject has not had Grade &gt;= 2 bleeding in the prior 6 months (where
                  grading of the bleeding is determined per the National Cancer Institute's Common
                  Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE], version 5.0)

                  and TBILI each &lt;= 5 x ULN is acceptable if the elevation is considered by the
                  investigator to be due to PTLD involvement of the liver

               4. Creatinine &lt; 3 x ULN

         10. Subject or subject's representative is willing and able to provide written informed

             ipilimumab) within three drug half-lives from the most recent dose to Cycle 1 Day 1

          5. Active adenovirus viremia
