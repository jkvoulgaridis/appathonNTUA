        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Non-smoking healthy male subjects, 18-50 years old inclusive

          -  Body Mass index is between 19 to 30 kg/m2, inclusive

          -  NO history of hypersensitivity or allergic reaction to the active ingredient, murine
             proteins, or excipients, spontaneous or following drug administration.

          -  For subjects with female partners of child-bearing potential, an adequate form of
             contraception must be adhered to prior to entry into the study and for a further 3
             months after the end of study. Adequate contraception is defined as the usage by the
             female partner of any form of hormonal contraception or intra-uterine device (which
             should be established prior to the start of study) plus usage by one of the partners
             of an additional spermicide-containing barrier method of contraception. The use of a
             barrier method alone or reliance on abstinence is not considered adequate.

          -  Subjects must agree not to donate sperm during the study and for 4 months following
             treatment with the study medication or until scheduled End Of Study (EOS), whichever
             is longer.

          -  Subjects must be able to communicate well with the investigator, to understand and
             comply with the requirements of the study, and understand and sign the written
             informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinically significant abnormalities in physical examination, laboratory test results
             or electrocardiogram (ECG)

          -  Systolic blood pressure &gt; 140 mmHg or &lt; 90 mmHg , or diastolic blood pressure &gt; 90
             mmHg or &lt;50 mmHg

          -  Proteinuria (with a urine dipstick value of 2+ or above)

          -  Coagulation abnormalities ( i.e., INR &gt; 2x ULN)

          -  Bleeding diathesis, history of duodenal ulcers, concomitant use of anticoagulants, or
             any hemorrhage within 6 months prior to study enrollment.

          -  Surgical procedure within 2 months of screening, or planned surgical procedure within
             2 months of EOS

          -  Positive test result for drugs of abuse or alcohol breathing test.

          -  Positive test result for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis C (HCV), or
             human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 1 or 2.

          -  Donated or lost &gt; 500ml of blood in the previous 3 months

          -  Taken an investigational drug within 3 months (or 5 half-lives), whichever is longer.

          -  Taken any prescription medications within 14 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is
             longer) of the first dose of study drug or non-prescription drugs (with the exception
             of paracetamol, which is allowed).

          -  Previously received bevacizumab or any product considered to be biosimilar to
             bevacizumab, or any other antibody or protein targeting VEGF or VEGFR.

          -  Unwillingness or inability to comply with the study protocol for any reason.

          -  Male subject whose partner is pregnant.

          -  History or evidence of a clinically significant disorder (including cardiovascular,
             cerebrovascular, endocrine or psychiatric), or immunocompromised condition, or disease
             that, in the opinion of the investigator, would pose a risk to subject safety or
             interfere with the study evaluation, procedures or completion.

          -  History of alcohol and/or drug abuse within 12 months of screening.
