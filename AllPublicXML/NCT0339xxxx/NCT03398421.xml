  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nemiralisib is a potent anti-inflammatory agent for the treatment of chronic obstructive
      pulmonary disease (COPD) and other inflammatory lung diseases. The Cytochrome P450 3A4
      (CYP3A4) is a major route of clearance for nemiralisib. The co-administration of drug
      therapies, which modulate CYP3A4, may alter the exposure of nemiralisib. Hence, this clinical
      drug interaction study with itraconazole (a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor) is required. The study
      will evaluate the PK, safety and tolerability of nemiralisib when administered alone and when
      administered concomitantly with repeat doses of itraconazole in healthy males and females.
      Subjects will receive treatment with nemiralisib alone in Period 1 and itraconazole followed
      by nemiralisib in Period 2 in single sequence crossover manner. Approximately 20 subjects
      will be enrolled such that approximately 16 evaluable subjects complete the study. Each
      subject will participate in the study for approximately 7 weeks including screening visit, 2
      treatment periods and a follow up visit.

Day -1 was defined as Baseline for hematology parameters. Change from Baseline is calculated as the value at specified time point minus the Baseline value.</description>

        <description>Urine samples were collected for analysis of urine pH. pH is calculated on a scale of 0 to 14, values on the scale refer to the degree of alkalinity or acidity. A pH of 7 is neutral. A pH of less than 7 is acidic and a pH of greater than 7 is basic. Normal urine has a slightly acidic pH (5.0-6.0).</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Abnormal Microscopic Examinations: Casts, Epithelial Cells, Erythrocytes and Leukocytes</title>
        <description>A microscopic examination was performed as part of a routine urinalysis. The microscopic exam was performed on urine sediment - urine was centrifuged to concentrate the substances in it at the bottom of a tube. The fluid at the top of the tube was then discarded and the drops of fluid remaining were examined under a microscope. Cells, crystals, and other substances were counted and reported either as the number observed &quot;per low power field&quot; (LPF) or &quot;per high power field&quot; (HPF).</description>
