  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the efficacy and implementation of a telehealth-supported, integrated
      diabetes group visit program led by Community Health Workers (CHWs). PHASE ONE (N=89) relates
      to efficacy and PHASE TWO (N=37) addresses implementation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The number of Hispanics diagnosed with diabetes is escalating in the US with
      disproportionately higher prevalence and complication rates than other ethnicities. CHWs are
      a well-established and culturally sensitive means to bridge gaps in care to individuals with
      diabetes. However CHWs are often left unsupported, placing patients at risk of substandard
      care or harm. Telehealth is a term used to describe a range of technologies to support
      healthcare delivery via communication with the patient or a member of the healthcare delivery
      team. Though telehealth has been implemented into diabetes programs for many years, there is
      a paucity of data showing the use of telemedicine for CHW training and support. PHASE ONE of
      the current study compares clinical outcomes and treatment satisfaction of individuals who
      receive diabetes care in a 12-month telehealth supported, integrated CHW-led group visit
      program compared to those in usual care (wait list control). Group visits are 6-months and
      CHWs contact patients weekly to bimonthly (mobile health (mHealth)) for 12-months. This phase
      with have two cohort waves, separated by 6-months. The wait list control group for Cohort 2
      will explore telehealth, clinician-patient encounters. PHASE TWO occurs at a new clinic and
      evaluates the ability to implement the program in the first phase. This phase with have one
      cohort wave (Cohort 3), which follows the first phase. During both phases, CHWs receive
      training and support via telehealth and we will analyze its feasibility and acceptability.

    <description>The survey totaled 12 questions and assessed participant satisfaction, mental relaxation, and open-ended comments. Questions were ranked as followed: 1-3 (4-point Likert Scale), 4-7 (10-point Likert Scale), 8-11 (open-ended, descriptive), 12 (days of exercise/week). The Use of Mental Stress Management/Relaxation Techniques questionnaire and our pilot study survey templates were used to evaluate patient group visit and CHW satisfaction. We defined acceptability as high (3.5-4/4 or 8-10/10), moderate (2-3.4/4 or 4-7/10), and low (1-1.9/4 or 1-3/10) and totaled the items to create an overall score.</description>
