  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain (LBP) is the leading cause of years lived with disability globally with
      increasing concern about its impact in low-income countries like those situated in Africa
      where most people are rural residents with limited access to health care. In Nigeria, the
      prevalence of LBP is on the increase and even higher than in other African countries.
      Moreover, rural dwellers seem to have a greater burden of LBP compared to urban dwellers but
      lack access to rehabilitation services such as physiotherapy even at the rural primary health
      care centres. While exercise and education are commonly recommended in the management of
      chronic LBP, with many trials using these interventions being conducted on urban dwellers,
      there is a dearth of community studies in the way of randomized clinical trials, testing the
      benefits of exercise and education in the management of chronic LBP among adults rural
      Nigerian community.

      The purpose of this project is to assess the effect of a supervised exercise therapy that
      emphasize on motor control approach and a cognitive-based patient education for the
      management of chronic LBP among community-dwelling adults in a rural Nigeria.

      The hypothesis of this study is that MCE plus PE will be superior in all outcomes than using
      either MCE or PE alone among adults with CLBP following 8-weeks of therapeutic session, at
      3-month follow-up.

      Participants will be recruited and assigned to one of four intervention groups that include
      MCE plus PE group, MCE group, or PE group using a block random technique based on an
      electronic randomization table generated by a computer software program. Blinded assessment
      of all clinical outcomes will be performed at baseline, 8 weeks after randomization and at 3
      months follow up.

      Primary outcomes will be pain intensity and functional disability. Secondary outcomes will be
      quality of life, fear-avoidance beliefs, pain catastrophizing, global perceived recovery and
      physical performance (finger-floor test, repeated sit-to-stand test, and the 50-foot walk
      test) Data will be analysed using descriptive statistics, ANOVA and post hoc tests. All
      statistical analyses will be performed on IBM SPSS Statistics ver. 23.0 (IBM Co., Armonk, NY,
      USA) at alpha level of 0.05.

    <measure>Change in pain Intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 weeks after beginning treatment, and 3 months follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Pain Intensity will be measured by an 11-point (0-10) Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS), in which 0 represents &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 represents &quot;worst pain imaginable&quot;.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in functional disability</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 weeks after beginning treatment, and 3 months follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Functional disability will be measured by Oswestry disability index (ODI). The questionnaire consists of 10 items with each item having six statements. All scores are summed, then multiplied by two to obtain the index (range 0 to 100) with higher score indicating greater disability.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 weeks after beginning treatment, and 3 months follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life will be measured using the SF-12 health survey. The questionnaire consists of 12 items questioned weighted and summed to provide physical and mental health scores (PCS and MCS). The two composite scores are computed using the scores on twelve questions that range from 0 to 100, with higher score indicating better health.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in fear avoidance beliefs</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 8 weeks after beginning treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Fear avoidance beliefs will be measured by the fear avoidance beliefs questionnaire (FABQ). The questionnaire consists of 16 self-response items, rated on a seven-point ordinal scale from 0 to 6. It also contains two subscales, a 7-item subscale concerning work, and a 4-item subscale concerning physical activity. Each subscale scores are summed giving possible ranges for the physical activity subscale of 0-24 and for the work subscale between 0-42. Higher score indicate greater fear and avoidance beliefs.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in pain catastrophization</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 8 weeks after beginning treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Pain catastrophization will be measured by the pain catastrophizing scale (PCS). The scale consists of 13 items rated on 5-point ordinal scale (0-5).The total score ranges from 0-52 with higher score indicating more catastrophic thoughts.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in global impression of recovery</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 8 weeks after beginning treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>Global impression of recovery will be measured by an 11-point Global Perceived Effect Scale (GPES). it range from -5 (vastly worse) to 0 (unchanged) to +5 (completely recovered). Higher scores indicate better recovery.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in mobility of the spine and pelvis</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 8 weeks after beginning treatment</time_frame>
