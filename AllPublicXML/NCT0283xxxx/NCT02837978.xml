  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to observed prospectively the efficacy and safety of 6 months
      treatment of Tacrolimus alone or with methotrexate (MTX) in moderate and severe Chinese RA
      patients who shown insufficiency response or intolerance to DMARDs

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will enroll 100 cases of refractory rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients in
      Chinese，who are in moderate or severe disease activity and insufficiency response or
      intolerance to DMARDs. The participants plan to be treated with Tacrolimus alone, or along
      with methotrexate (MTX) if participants were tolerant to MTX. The efficacy and safety of 6
      month Tacrolimus treatment in RA patients will be evaluated with DAS28 and other disease
      activity indices.
