      A Phase 1, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Dose-Ranging Trial to Determine the
      Safety and Immunogenicity of an Adenoviral-Vector Based Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) F
      Protein Vaccine (VXA-RSV-f) Expressing Protein F and dsRNA Adjuvant Administered Orally to

    <textblock>
      The study will enroll 66 subjects in four cohorts. All subjects will receive a single
      administration of VXA-RSV-f at a low dose, a high dose or placebo.

      Two sentinel groups will enroll 3 subjects each in an open-label manner (Cohorts 1 and 3) to
      receive VXA-RSV-f prior to enrolling either of the randomized, controlled cohorts (Cohorts 2
      and 4). Within the double-blinded Cohorts (2 and 4), placebo subjects will receive the same
      number of tablets as the vaccine subjects in that Cohort. Subjects will be enrolled and dosed
      in the low dose groups prior to initiation of dosing in the high dose group.

      Cohort 1: 3 subjects at low dose Cohort 2: 20 subjects at low dose and 10 placebo Cohort 3: 3
      subjects at high dose Cohort 4: 20 subjects at low dose and 10 placebo

      Subjects will be followed for 28 days post vaccination for preliminary immunogenicity.
      Subjects will continue to be followed for 1 year post-vaccination for long term safety.
