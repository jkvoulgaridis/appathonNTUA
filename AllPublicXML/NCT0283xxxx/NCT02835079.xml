  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive devastating disease that affects mainly
      boys, with an incidence of about 1:3,500 live births. The pathology of DMD is a result of
      non-repaired muscle damage that leads to muscle-tissue replacement by scar tissue, a process
      known as fibrosis. Currently, there is no effective treatment for the disease. The only
      therapy offered to these boys are steroids which slightly delayed the disease progression.
      The boys lose their ability to walk at around the age of 12, and die in the 4th decade of
      life from severe heart and lung problems.

      In this study investigators will test the efficacy of Tamoxifen treatment in ambulatory DMD
      boys. Tamoxifen is a drug used for palliative treatment of breast cancer patients and has an
      outstanding safety profile. In addition, Tamoxifen was tested in the past in boys, for other
      pediatric indications, and showed an excellent safety with no side effects.

      Tamoxifen is being tested in this study, as a therapy for DMD, for the following reasons:

      (i) it was shown to have anti-fibrotic effect in multiple in-vivo systems; (ii) it assists in
      the repair of damaged muscles.

      In other words, Tamoxifen is expected to have a synergistic effect on DMD patients, due to
      its dual mechanism of action. Indeed, Tamoxifen was shown to have significant beneficial
      effects in the mdx mouse model of DMD. Also, a small compassionate cohort of 3 boys, treated
      for 6 months with Tamoxifen, yielded very encouraging results.
