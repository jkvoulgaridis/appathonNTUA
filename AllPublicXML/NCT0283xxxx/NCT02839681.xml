  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Anetumab ravtansine is a new drug. It kills cancer cells that carry mesothelin. That is a
      protein on the surface of tumor cells in many types of tumors, including most lung cancers.
      Researchers want to find a safe dose for the study drug for lung cancer. They want to see if
      it can shrink tumors in mesothelin-positive lung cancer.

      Objectives:

      To test the safety and effectiveness of anetumab ravtansine for lung cancer.

      Eligibility:

      Adults 18 years and older who have lung cancer that has gotten worse on other therapy

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with:

      Medical history

      Physical exam

      Tumor tissue sample. This can be from a previous procedure.

      Blood and urine tests

      Heart tests

      Scans. For one scan, a small amount of radioactive substance is injected into the blood.

      Eye exam

      The study will have 21-day cycles.

      On day 1 of each cycle, participants will get the study drug through a tube inserted in a
      vein.

      Participants will repeat a heart test in cycles 1 and 2.

      They will have blood tests weekly in cycle 1, twice in all other cycles.

      They will have scans every 6 weeks for the first 6 months, every 9 weeks until the end of
      year 2, then every 12 weeks.

      Participants will have samples of tumor tissue taken twice.

      About 30 days after stopping the study drug, participants will have a follow-up visit. This
      will include medical history, physical exam, blood and pregnancy tests, and heart and eye
      tests.

      Some will be called a few times a year to discuss their health and treatment.

      Background:

        -  Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, accounting for more
           than one million deaths every year.

        -  Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) constitutes approximately 85% of lung cancers and
           about 40% of patients with newly diagnosed NSCLC have advanced disease. The median year
           overall survival for advanced NSCLC is at least 1 year.

        -  In recent years, identification of oncogenic alterations such as mutations in epidermal
           growth factor receptor (EGFR) and anaplastic large-cell lymphoma kinase (ALK)
           translocations and therapies targeting tumor immune escape mechanisms have led to a
           substantial improvement in the prognosis of patients with advanced lung cancer;

      however, such alterations have been detected in less than half of all advanced NSCLC patients
      in only a small subset of patients respond to immunotherapeutic interventions available
      today.

        -  Anetumab ravtansine (BAY 94-9343) is an antibody-drug conjugate targeting mesothelin, a
           protein normally present on mesothelial cells. A Phase I trial showed the overall
           acceptable and manageable safety profile. It is being developed for patients with
           mesothelin expressing cancers; clinical development is furthest along in mesothelioma
           where it is in a registration phase II clinical trial.

        -  National Cancer Institute (NCI) researchers have demonstrated that mesothelin messenger
           ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and protein are present in a substantial number of lung
           adenocarcinoma cell lines; mesothelin expression has been observed in over 50% of
           advanced lung adenocarcinomas by immunohistochemical assessment.

      Objectives:

      Safety Run-in

      -To evaluate safety and tolerability of anetumab ravtansine in patients with previously
      treated unresectable mesothelin expressing advanced lung adenocarcinoma (stage IIIB or IV).

      Phase 2

      -To determine the efficacy (objective response rate) of anetumab ravtansine in patients with
      advanced (Stage IIIb) or metastatic (Stage IV) mesothelin expressing lung adenocarcinoma.

      Eligibility:

        -  Age &gt;18 years.

        -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed previously treated unresectable mesothelin
           expressing advanced lung adenocarcinoma (stage IIIB or IV)

        -  Positive mesothelin expression in the archival tumor tissue, defined as the mesothelin
           membrane intensity score of 2+ or 3+ (on the 0-3 scale) expressed on the membrane of
           greater than or equal to 10% of tumor cells.

        -  Should have received at least one prior platinum based chemotherapy and an immune
           checkpoint targeted agent. In addition, subjects with epidermal growth factor receptor
           [EGFR]-mutated and anaplastic lymphoma kinase [ALK]-translocated NSCLC should have
           received Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved targeted therapies as appropriate.

        -  Normal organ function

      Design:

        -  This is an open label, single center, phase I/II study of anetumab ravtansine in
           subjects with mesothelin positive lung adenocarcinoma.

        -  During the safety run-in portion of the study, de-escalating doses will be assessed to
           determine a recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D).

        -  During the phase 2 portion of the study, the (RP2D) will be assessed for objective
           response rate.

        -  During both portions of the study, anetumab ravtansine will be administered
           intravenously every 3 weeks until disease progression in the absence of clinical
           benefit, patient withdrawal or the occurrence of intolerable toxicities.

        -  Response assessments (imaging) will occur every 6 weeks for the first 6 months, then
           every 9 weeks until the end of year 2, then every 12 weeks thereafter.

        -  Up to 12 evaluable patients will be enrolled in the safety run-in portion of the study.
           Approximately twenty patients, including 6 from the safety run-in portion of the study,
           will be evaluated in the phase 2 portion of the study. The accrual ceiling will be set
           at 55 to accommodate screen failures (a 50% failure rate with regard to mesothelin
           expression) and inevaluable subjects.

        consultation with the ophthalmologist/optometrist. Low grades of superficial punctate
        keratitis, within the range seen in the normal population, should not lead to the exclusion
        of the patient

        lesions (measurable disease) within 4 weeks before the start of treatment, except if there
        is objective evidence of progression of the lesion by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
        Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 between the

        prior radiotherapy and the screening computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging
        (MRI) scan. Palliative radiotherapy to nontarget lesions is allowed at the investigators

        <description>Length of time from start of treatment to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first. Response was assessed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Progression is at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.

        <title>Duration of Response</title>
        <description>Duration of Response is from the time measurement criteria are met for Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR). Length of time criteria are met for partial response or complete response (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented. Response was assessed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Progression is at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions). A complete response is disappearance of all target lesions. A partial response is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters.</description>
