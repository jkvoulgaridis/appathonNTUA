    <description>This includes physician and nursing assessment and intervention for any identified AEs. Of note, there is not currently standard follow-up that patients receive from nursing or physician staff while on an OAM treatment. Patients are encouraged to call their physician's office with any questions or changes in their medical status but are not called routinely by MSK staff.</description>
