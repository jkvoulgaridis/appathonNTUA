      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of treatment with 0.017% P-321 on Dry Eye
      Symptoms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, parallel group Phase
      2b trial designed to evaluate symptoms and signs in subjects with mild to moderate dry eye
      disease. Eligible patients, will be treated with placebo during 2-week placebo run-in period.
      Subjects will then be randomly assigned in a double-masked, 1:1 ratio to either 0.017% P-321
      Ophthalmic Solution or placebo TID for 28 days. This study is designed to evaluate the
      changes in symptoms. Safety will be assessed throughout the study by adverse events.

    <measure>Change From Baseline (Visit 2) to Day 29 (Visit 4) in the Subject-reported Dry Eye Symptom Questionnaire.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Day 29</time_frame>
    <description>Dry Eye symptoms were obtained using the Symptom Assessment in Dry Eye (SANDE) questionnaire. The questionnaire utilizes separate Visual Analog Scales (VAS) for the frequency and the Severity of symptoms. The scores range from 0 to 100 where 0 = Rarely or Very Mild, and 100 = All the Time or Very Severe for the Frequency and Severity of the symptoms, respectively. The Global Score as reported in the Primary Outcome is obtained by taking the square root of the product of the frequency score multiplied by the severity score. Negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline (Visit 2) to Day 29 in Symptom Frequency Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Day 29</time_frame>
    <description>Dry Eye symptom frequency was obtained using the Symptom Assessment in Dry Eye (SANDE) questionnaire. The questionnaire utilizes a 100 mm horizontal Visual Analog Scale (VAS). The scores range from 0 to 100 where 0 = Rarely and 100 = All the Time. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

    <description>Dry Eye symptom severity was obtained using the Symptom Assessment in Dry Eye (SANDE) questionnaire. The questionnaire utilizes a 100 mm horizontal Visual Analog Scales (VAS). The scores range from 0 to 100 where 0 = Very Mild and 100 = Very Severe. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Day 29 in Fluorescein Staining of the Cornea.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Day 29</time_frame>
    <description>Corneal staining was performed to grade the corneal epithelial cell injury as measured by fluorescence using slit lamp examination. The staining was graded with the NEI scale. The corneal surface is divided into 5 corneal regions (1, Central; 2, Inferior; 3, Nasal; 4, Temporal; 5, Superior). The scores for each of these 5 regions ranged from 0 to 3 (0=no staining; 1=staining with low density; 2=staining with moderate density; 3=staining with severe density). The total staining score (sum of all regions, maximal score =15) is reported. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline to Day 29 in Lissamine Green Staining of the Conjunctiva.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Day 29</time_frame>
    <description>Conjunctival staining was performed to grade the conjunctival epithelial cell injury as measured by Lissamine Green using slit-lamp examination. The staining was graded with the NEI scale. The bulbar conjunctival surface is divided into 6 regions (1, Temporal; 2 Temporal Superior; 3, Temporal Inferior; 4, Nasal Superior; 5, Nasal Inferior; 6, Nasal). The scores for each of these 6 regions ranged from 0 to 3 (0=no staining; 1=staining with low density; 2=staining with moderate density; 3=staining with severe density). The total staining score (sum of all regions, maximal score =18) is reported. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With at Least 20% Improvement in Symptoms From Baseline to Day 29</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Day 29</time_frame>
    <description>Improvement in symptoms was evaluated using the Symptom Assessment in Dry Eye (SANDE) questionnaire. The questionnaire utilizes separate Visual Analog Scales (VAS) for the frequency and the Severity of symptoms. The scores range from 0 to 100 where 0 = Rarely or Very Mild, and 100 = All the Time or Very Severe for the Frequency and Severity of the symptoms, respectively. The Global Score is obtained by taking the square root of the product of the frequency score multiplied by the severity score. Lower scores indicate improvement in symptoms.</description>

        <description>Dry Eye symptoms were obtained using the Symptom Assessment in Dry Eye (SANDE) questionnaire. The questionnaire utilizes separate Visual Analog Scales (VAS) for the frequency and the Severity of symptoms. The scores range from 0 to 100 where 0 = Rarely or Very Mild, and 100 = All the Time or Very Severe for the Frequency and Severity of the symptoms, respectively. The Global Score as reported in the Primary Outcome is obtained by taking the square root of the product of the frequency score multiplied by the severity score. Negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Day 29 in Fluorescein Staining of the Cornea.</title>
        <description>Corneal staining was performed to grade the corneal epithelial cell injury as measured by fluorescence using slit lamp examination. The staining was graded with the NEI scale. The corneal surface is divided into 5 corneal regions (1, Central; 2, Inferior; 3, Nasal; 4, Temporal; 5, Superior). The scores for each of these 5 regions ranged from 0 to 3 (0=no staining; 1=staining with low density; 2=staining with moderate density; 3=staining with severe density). The total staining score (sum of all regions, maximal score =15) is reported. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <description>Improvement in symptoms was evaluated using the Symptom Assessment in Dry Eye (SANDE) questionnaire. The questionnaire utilizes separate Visual Analog Scales (VAS) for the frequency and the Severity of symptoms. The scores range from 0 to 100 where 0 = Rarely or Very Mild, and 100 = All the Time or Very Severe for the Frequency and Severity of the symptoms, respectively. The Global Score is obtained by taking the square root of the product of the frequency score multiplied by the severity score. Lower scores indicate improvement in symptoms.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline (Visit 2) to Day 15 (Visit 3) in the Subject-reported Dry Eye Symptom Score.</title>
        <description>Dry Eye symptoms were obtained using the Symptom Assessment in Dry Eye (SANDE) questionnaire. The questionnaire utilizes separate Visual Analog Scales (VAS) for the frequency and the Severity of symptoms. The scores range from 0 to 100 where 0 = Rarely or Very Mild, and 100 = All the Time or Very Severe for the Frequency and Severity of the symptoms, respectively. The Global Score as reported in the Primary Outcome is obtained by taking the square root of the product of the frequency score multiplied by the severity score. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>
