  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess whether Toll like receptor 7 (TLR7)-mediated pharmacology, with
      intranasal (i.n.) GSK2245035 20 nanogram (ng) administered weekly for a period of 8 weeks,
      will lead to reduced allergic reactivity in the lower airways in subjects with mild allergic
      asthma.

      This will be a randomised, double-blind (sponsor open), placebo-controlled, parallel group,
      8-week treatment study.

      The study will consist of a screening period of up to approximately 4 weeks (involving two
      screening visits), a blinded treatment period of 8 weeks, followed by a follow-up period of
      up to 3 months. The total duration of the study for each subject will therefore be a maximum
      of approximately 6 months.

    <measure>Late Asthmatic Response (LAR): Absolute Change From Saline in Minimum Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) Between 4-10 Hours Following Allergen Challenge One Week After Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 9</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 is a measure of lung function and is defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. Participants were exposed to bronchial allergen challenge (BAC) at the one-week follow-up visit (one week after the eighth dose of the study treatment). Minimum FEV1 over 4-10 hours post-allergen challenge (minimum LAR) is the minimum value of all of the post-saline time points between 4 and 10 hours post-allergen challenge, inclusive of the 4 and 10 hours timepoints. Absolute change from saline in minimum FEV1 was calculated as the minimum FEV1 minus the saline FEV1 value. Per-Protocol Population comprises of all randomized participants who received at least one dose of study treatment and commence a BAC at follow-up and comply with the protocol.</description>

    <measure>LAR: Absolute Change From Saline in Weighted Mean FEV1 Between 4-10 Hours Following Allergen Challenge One Week After Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 9</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 is a measure of lung function and is defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. Participants were exposed to BAC at the one-week follow-up visit (one week after the eighth dose of the study treatment). Weighted mean FEV1 over 4-10 hours post-allergen challenge includes all post-saline time points between 4 and 10 hours post-allergen challenge, inclusive of the 4 and 10 hours timepoints. The weighted mean FEV1 was derived by calculating the area under the curve, and dividing the value by the relevant time interval. Absolute change from saline at each time point was calculated as the highest allergen challenge FEV1 value minus the highest saline FEV1 value.</description>

    <measure>Early Asthmatic Response (EAR): Absolute Change From Saline in Minimum FEV1 Between 0-2 Hours Following Allergen Challenge One Week After Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 9</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 is a measure of lung function and is defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. Participants were exposed to BAC at the one-week follow-up visit (one week after the eighth dose of the study treatment). Minimum FEV1 over 0-2 hours post-allergen challenge (minimum LAR) is the minimum value of all of the post-saline time points between 0 and 2 hours post-allergen challenge, inclusive of the 0 and 2 hours timepoints. Absolute change from saline in minimum FEV1 was calculated as the minimum FEV1 minus the saline FEV1 value.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 20</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. Any untoward event resulting in death, life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly/birth defect, any other situation according to medical or scientific judgment or all events of possible drug-induced liver injury with hyperbilirubinemia were categorized as SAE. Number of participants with AEs and SAEs have been reported.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Abnormal Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The PEF is defined as the greatest rate of airflow that can be achieved during forced exhalation beginning with the lungs fully inflated. Participants were instructed to record their PEF readings each morning and evening into the diary card that was provided by the investigator. The minimum and maximum range ranges for PEF were &lt;=205 and &gt;=980 liters per minute.</description>

      <recruitment_details>This study investigated the safety, pharmacodynamics, and effect of the Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) agonist, GSK2245035, on allergen-induced asthmatic response in participants with mild allergic asthma. Participants received either intranasal 20 nanogram (ng) GSK2245035 or placebo once weekly for 8 weeks.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 36 participants were randomized at different centers in United Kingdom and Germany..</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Late Asthmatic Response (LAR): Absolute Change From Saline in Minimum Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) Between 4-10 Hours Following Allergen Challenge One Week After Treatment</title>
        <description>FEV1 is a measure of lung function and is defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. Participants were exposed to bronchial allergen challenge (BAC) at the one-week follow-up visit (one week after the eighth dose of the study treatment). Minimum FEV1 over 4-10 hours post-allergen challenge (minimum LAR) is the minimum value of all of the post-saline time points between 4 and 10 hours post-allergen challenge, inclusive of the 4 and 10 hours timepoints. Absolute change from saline in minimum FEV1 was calculated as the minimum FEV1 minus the saline FEV1 value. Per-Protocol Population comprises of all randomized participants who received at least one dose of study treatment and commence a BAC at follow-up and comply with the protocol.</description>

        <title>LAR: Absolute Change From Saline in Weighted Mean FEV1 Between 4-10 Hours Following Allergen Challenge One Week After Treatment</title>
        <description>FEV1 is a measure of lung function and is defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. Participants were exposed to BAC at the one-week follow-up visit (one week after the eighth dose of the study treatment). Weighted mean FEV1 over 4-10 hours post-allergen challenge includes all post-saline time points between 4 and 10 hours post-allergen challenge, inclusive of the 4 and 10 hours timepoints. The weighted mean FEV1 was derived by calculating the area under the curve, and dividing the value by the relevant time interval. Absolute change from saline at each time point was calculated as the highest allergen challenge FEV1 value minus the highest saline FEV1 value.</description>

        <title>EAR: Absolute Change From Saline in Weighted Mean FEV1 Between 0-2 Hours Following Allergen Challenge One Week After Treatment.</title>
        <description>FEV1 is a measure of lung function and is defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. Participants were exposed to BAC at the one-week follow-up visit (one week after the eighth dose of the study treatment). Weighted mean FEV1 over 0-2 hours post-allergen challenge includes all post-saline time points between 0-2 hours post-allergen challenge, inclusive of 0 and 2 hours timepoints. The weighted mean FEV1 was derived by calculating the area under the curve, and dividing the value by the relevant time interval. Absolute change from saline at each time point was calculated as the highest allergen challenge FEV1 value minus the highest saline FEV1 value.</description>
