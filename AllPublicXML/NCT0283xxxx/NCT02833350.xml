    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, Phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, active
      comparator (Cohort 1 only), parallel-group, dose-ranging study to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of GDC-0853 in participants with moderate to severe active RA and an inadequate
      response to previous methotrexate (MTX) therapy (Cohort 1) or MTX and tumor necrosis factor
      (TNF) therapy who may have also had exposure to no more than one non-TNF inhibitor biologic
      (Cohort 2).

    <description>CDAI was derived as the sum of the following: tender joint count (TJC), swollen joint count (SJC), participant global assessment (PGA) of disease activity, and physician assessment of disease activity. TJC and SJC were taken as the number of tender and swollen joints, respectively, out of 28 assessed joints. PGA and physician assessment of disease activity were scored 0-100 millimeters (mm) and rounded to the nearest centimeter (cm) on a visual analog scale (VAS), where higher scores indicate greater perceived disease activity. The total CDAI score range was 0-76, where higher scores indicate increased disease activity. Change from baseline at a particular time point was calculated among patients with data available at both baseline and the time point of interest. Negative values indicate improvement/reduction in RA disease activity.</description>

    <description>The Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire disability index is a patient-reported outcome used to assess difficulty in performing activities of daily living. It consists of 20 questions referring to eight domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip and common daily activities.
To respond to each question, a four-level response with higher scores showing larger functional limitations, was chosen. Scoring is as follows with respect to performance of participant's everyday activities: 0 (equals)=without difficulties; 1= with some difficulties; 2=with great difficulties; and 3=unable to perform these actions at all. The composite HAQ-DI score is the mean of the eight domain scores and the score ranges from 0 (no functional impairment) to 3 (maximum functional impairment). A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Change in Disease Activity Score From Baseline Based on 28-Joints Count and C-Reactive Protein (3 Variables) (DAS28-3 [CRP])</title>
        <description>The DAS28 score is a measure of the patient's disease activity calculated using the tender joint count (TJC) [28 joints], swollen joint count (SJC) [28 joints], patient's global assessment of disease activity [visual analog scale: 0=no disease activity to 100=maximum disease activity] and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) for a total possible score of 0 to approximately 10. Scores below 2.6 indicate best disease control and scores above 5.1 indicate worse disease control. DAS28 Remission is defined as a DAS28 score &lt; 2.6.</description>

        <description>The DAS28 score is a measure of the patient's disease activity calculated using the tender joint count (TJC) [28 joints], swollen joint count (SJC) [28 joints], patient's global assessment of disease activity [visual analog scale: 0=no disease activity to 100=maximum disease activity] and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) for a total possible score of 0 to approximately 10. Scores below 2.6 indicate best disease control and scores above 5.1 indicate worse disease control. DAS28 Remission is defined as a DAS28 score &lt; 2.6.</description>

        <title>Change in Disease Activity Score From Baseline Based on 28-Joints Count and Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (3 Variables) (DAS28-3 [ESR])</title>
        <description>The DAS28 score is a measure of the patient's disease activity calculated using the tender joint count (TJC) [28 joints], swollen joint count (SJC) [28 joints], patient's global assessment of disease activity [visual analog scale: 0=no disease activity to 100=maximum disease activity] and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) for a total possible score of 0 to approximately 10. Scores below 2.6 indicate best disease control and scores above 5.1 indicate worse disease control. DAS28 Remission is defined as a DAS28 score &lt; 2.6.</description>

        <title>Change in Disease Activity Score From Baseline Based on 28-Joints Count and Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (4 Variables) (DAS28-4 [ESR])</title>
        <description>The DAS28 score is a measure of the patient's disease activity calculated using the tender joint count (TJC) [28 joints], swollen joint count (SJC) [28 joints], patient's global assessment of disease activity [visual analog scale: 0=no disease activity to 100=maximum disease activity] and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) for a total possible score of 0 to approximately 10. Scores below 2.6 indicate best disease control and scores above 5.1 indicate worse disease control. DAS28 Remission is defined as a DAS28 score &lt; 2.6.</description>

          <title>Change in Disease Activity Score From Baseline Based on 28-Joints Count and Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (4 Variables) (DAS28-4 [ESR])</title>
          <description>The DAS28 score is a measure of the patient's disease activity calculated using the tender joint count (TJC) [28 joints], swollen joint count (SJC) [28 joints], patient's global assessment of disease activity [visual analog scale: 0=no disease activity to 100=maximum disease activity] and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) for a total possible score of 0 to approximately 10. Scores below 2.6 indicate best disease control and scores above 5.1 indicate worse disease control. DAS28 Remission is defined as a DAS28 score &lt; 2.6.</description>
          <population>Intent-to-Treat (ITT) All randomized participants who received any part of an infusion of study medication were included in the ITT analysis. Number of participants for whom data were collected is indicated for each time point.</population>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With DAS Low Disease Activity</title>
        <description>The DAS28 score is a measure of the patient's disease activity calculated using the tender joint count (TJC) [28 joints], swollen joint count (SJC) [28 joints], patient's global assessment of disease activity [visual analog scale: 0=no disease activity to 100=maximum disease activity] and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) for a total possible score of 0 to approximately 10. Scores below 2.6 indicate best disease control and scores above 5.1 indicate worse disease control. LDAS is defined as DAS28 ≤ 3.2</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With DAS Remission</title>
        <description>The DAS28 score is a measure of the patient's disease activity calculated using the tender joint count (TJC) [28 joints], swollen joint count (SJC) [28 joints], patient's global assessment of disease activity [visual analog scale: 0=no disease activity to 100=maximum disease activity] and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) for a total possible score of 0 to approximately 10. Scores below 2.6 indicate best disease control and scores above 5.1 indicate worse disease control. DAS28 Remission is defined as a DAS28 score &lt; 2.6</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants With DAS Remission</title>
          <description>The DAS28 score is a measure of the patient's disease activity calculated using the tender joint count (TJC) [28 joints], swollen joint count (SJC) [28 joints], patient's global assessment of disease activity [visual analog scale: 0=no disease activity to 100=maximum disease activity] and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) for a total possible score of 0 to approximately 10. Scores below 2.6 indicate best disease control and scores above 5.1 indicate worse disease control. DAS28 Remission is defined as a DAS28 score &lt; 2.6</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI)</title>
        <description>CDAI was derived as the sum of the following: tender joint count (TJC), swollen joint count (SJC), participant global assessment (PGA) of disease activity, and physician assessment of disease activity. TJC and SJC were taken as the number of tender and swollen joints, respectively, out of 28 assessed joints. PGA and physician assessment of disease activity were scored 0-100 millimeters (mm) and rounded to the nearest centimeter (cm) on a visual analog scale (VAS), where higher scores indicate greater perceived disease activity. The total CDAI score range was 0-76, where higher scores indicate increased disease activity. Change from baseline at a particular time point was calculated among patients with data available at both baseline and the time point of interest. Negative values indicate improvement/reduction in RA disease activity.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI)</title>
        <description>Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI) is the numerical sum of five outcome parameters: TJC and SJC (based on a 28-joint assessment), PtGA and PhGA (based on 0-10 cm VAS, where 0 = no disease activity and 10 = worst disease activity), and CRP. SDAI total score ranges from 0 (no disease activity) to 86 (maximal disease activity), where higher scores represents higher disease activity. The SDAI =&lt; 3.3 indicates disease remission, &gt; 3.4 to 11 indicates low disease activity, &gt; 11 to 26 indicates moderate disease activity, and &gt; 26 indicates high disease activity</description>

          <description>Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI) is the numerical sum of five outcome parameters: TJC and SJC (based on a 28-joint assessment), PtGA and PhGA (based on 0-10 cm VAS, where 0 = no disease activity and 10 = worst disease activity), and CRP. SDAI total score ranges from 0 (no disease activity) to 86 (maximal disease activity), where higher scores represents higher disease activity. The SDAI =&lt; 3.3 indicates disease remission, &gt; 3.4 to 11 indicates low disease activity, &gt; 11 to 26 indicates moderate disease activity, and &gt; 26 indicates high disease activity</description>
          <population>Intent-to-Treat (ITT) All randomized participants who received any part of an infusion of study medication were included in the ITT analysis. Number of participants for whom data were collected is indicated for each time point.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) Version 2.0 (V2) Scores for Physical and Mental Components</title>
        <description>The 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36v2) is a questionnaire used to assess functional health and well-being and consists of eight domains: Physical Functioning, Role-Physical, Bodily Pain, General Health, Vitality, Social Functioning, Role-Emotional and Mental Health.
The SF-36v2 is summarized into Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS) scores. The PCS and MCS scores range from 0 to 100, with 0=worst score (or quality of life) and 100=best score. A positive change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

          <description>The 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36v2) is a questionnaire used to assess functional health and well-being and consists of eight domains: Physical Functioning, Role-Physical, Bodily Pain, General Health, Vitality, Social Functioning, Role-Emotional and Mental Health.
The SF-36v2 is summarized into Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS) scores. The PCS and MCS scores range from 0 to 100, with 0=worst score (or quality of life) and 100=best score. A positive change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F) Score</title>
        <description>The FACIT-Fatigue Scale consists of 13 items designed to measure the degree of fatigue experienced by the patient in the previous 7 days. For each question, there are five possible responses: 0 (not at all), 1 (a little bit), 2 (somewhat), 3 (quite a bit), 4 (very much).
A total fatigue score is calculated by summing all items, and possible total scores range from 0 (maximum fatigue) to 52 (no fatigue). A positive change from baseline indicates an improvement in the patient's fatigue (less fatigue).</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Swollen Joint Count (66 Joint Count)</title>
          <description>Swollen Joint Count: a total of 66 joints will be assessed for swelling. Each joint is assessed for the presence/absence of swelling. 66 joints were assessed for swelling and joints are classified as swollen/not swollen giving a total possible swollen joint count score of 0 to 66. A negative change from Baseline indicated improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Patient Global Assessment Score of Arthritis Pain</title>
        <description>Participant-assessed arthritis pain was scored on a 100-mm VAS, where the distance from 0 mm represented the participant's self evaluation of arthritis pain (0 mm=none; 100 mm=very severe). Change from baseline at a particular time point was calculated among patients with data available at both baseline and the time point of interest, where negative change indicated a decrease in participant-assessed arthritis pain.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Physician's Global Assessment Score of Arthritis</title>
        <description>Physician's assessment of participant's disease activity was scored on a 100-mm VAS, where the distance from 0 mm represented the physician's assessment of the participant's disease activity (0 mm=very good; 100 mm=very poor). Change from baseline at a particular time point was calculated among patients with data available at both baseline and the time point of interest, where negative change from baseline indicated an improvement in physician-assessed disease activity.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) Score</title>
        <description>The Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire disability index is a patient-reported outcome used to assess difficulty in performing activities of daily living. It consists of 20 questions referring to eight domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip and common daily activities.
To respond to each question, a four-level response with higher scores showing larger functional limitations, was chosen. Scoring is as follows with respect to performance of participant's everyday activities: 0 (equals)=without difficulties; 1= with some difficulties; 2=with great difficulties; and 3=unable to perform these actions at all. The composite HAQ-DI score is the mean of the eight domain scores and the score ranges from 0 (no functional impairment) to 3 (maximum functional impairment). A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>
