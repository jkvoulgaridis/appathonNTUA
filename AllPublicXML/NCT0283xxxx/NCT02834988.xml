  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that SLND (unlike lymphadenectomy) decreases complications such
      as hemorrhage, lower extremity lymphedema and lymphocyst formation while enhancing quality of
      life in EC patients with low risk for nodal involvement.

      The investigators also hypothesize that SLND is an effective method of staging these
      patients. Studies have shown that SLN mapping identifies positive lymph nodes in women with
      newly diagnosed EC and this prognostic information obtained from SLND could guide selection
      of adjuvant treatment and improve overall survival.

      Using SLND as an alternative to lymphadenectomy may also have additional medical and economic
      impacts, such as, decreasing prolonged hospitalization and associated costs by shortening
      overall surgery duration.

      This is a non-interventional prospective chart review evaluating the clinical utility of SLND
      for detecting nodal metastasis of early stage endometrial cancer through data collection.

      Patients who are scheduled to undergo standard-of-care (SOC) surgical staging for EC
      (sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) via laparotomy, laparoscopy or robotic surgery,
      ±hysterectomy, ±bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO)) (pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy
      may (or may not) also be performed in addition to SLND) will be approached for consent. After
      these patients have completed the above SOC surgical procedures, research staff will review
      and collect data from their medical charts. For the subset of these patients who are found,
      during their SOC surgery, to have positive nodes, research staff will continue to review and
      collect data from their medical charts after their standard of care follow-up visits with
      their oncologist

      All of the patients enrolled on this trial are those who were scheduled to have their
      sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) removed; that is, all patients enrolled on this trial were
      consented by the research team because they were already scheduled to undergo sentinel lymph
      node dissection (SLND) via laparotomy, laparoscopy or robotic surgery, ±hysterectomy,
      ±bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO)). As part of this same SOC surgery, some of these
      patients also may have undergone pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy in addition to SLND.

      Within the research database built for this study, patients will be classified into risk
      strata (either low or high risk EC) as per the Modified Mayo Criteria. This classification
      will be partly based on the SOC post-surgical International Federation of Gynecology and
      Obstetrics (FIGO) staging. To establish progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival
      (OS), research staff will intermittently perform medical chart reviews for only those
      patients with nodal metastasis for a minimum of 2 years (maximum of 6 years).

    <description>The rate of SLND positivity rate overall and by risk group in patients with clinically apparent early-stage EC. EC patients will be classified as high or low risk group based on the modified Mayo Criteria (Mariani A 2008, Milam 2012).</description>

    <measure>Rate of NPV and FNPV of the SLND Procedure in Study Participants Who Undergo Partial or Full Lymphadenectomy.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 years</time_frame>
    <description>The rate of the negative predictive value (NPV) and its complement the false negative predictive value (FNPV) rate of the SLND procedure in the subset of patients who also undergo partial or full lymphadenectomy. Negative Predictive Value (NPV) will be calculated by dividing the number of true negatives by the total number of patients with a negative SLN (false negatives and true negatives. False Negative Predictive Value (FNPV) rate will be calculated as the number false negatives divided by all patients without nodal metastasis (the number of false negatives and true negatives). FNPV rate is also known as the False Omission Rate (FOR); FNPV is the complement of NPV.</description>

    <description>Proportion of type(s) of lymph node metastases (isolated tumor cells (ITC), micrometastases, or macrometastases) described by SLND in true positive (TP) and false negative (FN) patients. True positives (TPs) are those patients with positive SLN who also have nodal metastasis. False negatives (FNs) are those patients with negative SLN who have nodal metastasis.</description>

    <measure>Comparison of Nodal Positivity Rates and the Pathologic Protocol for Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsies.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 years</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will compare nodal positivity rates using sentinel lymph node biopsies, and the pathologic protocol for sentinel lymph node biopsies. Positivity rates will be correlated to traditional pathologic factors, including grade, depth of invasion, lymphovascular space invasion, cervical involvement, and histology. Once this information is collected, the investigators will try to assess rates of sentinel lymph node positivity, and its association with these factors.</description>
