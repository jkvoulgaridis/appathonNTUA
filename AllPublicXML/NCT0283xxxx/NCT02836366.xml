    <textblock>
      With this study results of the Targon® PH+ nail, developed for the treatment of humeral head
      fractures, will be investigated clinically, radiological evaluation is optional. The primary
      objective of this study is to examine the effect of a plating treatment on the speed of
      recovery of functional capacity in adult patients. Secondary aims are to examine the level of
      pain, patient satisfaction, shoulder function, quality of life, radiological evaluation and
      complications.

      Targon PH+ is CE certified. The study is a non-interventional cohort study sponsored by
      Aesculap

    <description>The DASH score (Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand) will be used to determine the recovery of functional capacity. It provides a summary of the responses on a scale of 0 (no disability) to 100 (severe disability)</description>

    <measure>Level of pain</measure>
    <time_frame>3, 12 and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>10-point Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) from no pain (0) to most extreme pain imaginable (10)</description>

    <measure>Shoulder Function</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months, 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Shoulder function outcome is measured with the Constant-Murley score, this score system combines shoulder function tests (65 points) with a subjective evaluation of the patients (35 points) including activities of daily living, level of work</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Radiological outcome (only if it could be raised in clinical standard)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The X-rays are examined regarding adverse events as screw perforation, screw breakage, cut-out, re-dislocation of the fracture</description>
