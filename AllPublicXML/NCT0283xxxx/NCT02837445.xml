  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this double blind randomized study is the evaluation of the safety and
      efficacy of the Moderato System.

      The Moderato implantable pulse generator is indicated for patients who have hypertension and
      also require a dual chamber pacemaker in order to reduce their blood pressure.

      The primary objectives of this study are to provide evidence of safety and clinical efficacy
      of the anti-hypertensive effects of the Moderato System. This will be accomplished by
      evaluating changes in blood pressure in an active treatment vs. a control patient population
      for a period of 6 months.

      The device will be considered to have a clinical effectiveness with regard to its
      anti-hypertension functions if there is a statistically significant and clinically meaningful
      reduction in mean 24-hour ambulatory systolic blood pressure in the treatment group compared
      to the control group.

      Protocol CS-03 Ver 1.1 (NCT02837445) was amended at the advice of the Scientific Advisory to
      protocol CS-03 Version 3.0 with more stringent hypertension inclusion criteria and different
      observation intervals for efficacy and safety.

      In CS-03 Version 3.0 the time of the primary efficacy endpoint was reduced from 6 months to 3
      months post randomization which was deemed a suitable interval for the chronic effect,
      whereas for the safety endpoint, the period was lengthened from 6 month to 12 months post
      randomization to better monitor potential risks of the treatment on cardiac function
      (Blinding period was increased from 6 to 12 months). Protocols were thus split in order to
      allow better clarification to the difference in the time to the primary endpoints for
      efficacy and safety between the two CIP versions and simplify data analysis.

      Protocol Ver 3.0 prescribes data analysis of all patients randomized under version 1.1 to be
      performed once they complete the 6 months follow-up as set in protocol version 1.1
      (NCT0283744). It is expected that ~40 patients will be randomized according to protocol
      version 1.1 prior to the enrollment of patients according to protocol version 3.0. The
      results will be considered as interim analysis.

      The recruitment for the protocol version 1.1 is now completed. Total of 47 patients were
      randomized according to protocol version 1.1 and all patients completed the follow-up period
      for the primary endpoint.

      Patients are currently being followed up for the study &quot;extension period&quot;.
