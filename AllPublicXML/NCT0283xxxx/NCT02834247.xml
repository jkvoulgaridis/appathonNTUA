  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended
      Phase 2 dose (RP2D), safety and efficacy of TAK-659 in combination with nivolumab in
      participants with advanced solid tumors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested is TAK-659.This study will look at the determination of the MTD/RP2D
      and efficacy measured by ORR in participants who take TAK-659 in combination with nivolumab.
      The study will include a dose escalation phase (Part 1), a potential nivolumab fixed dose
      cohort, and a dose expansion phase (Part 2).

      The study will enroll approximately 120 participants, approximately 9-12 in the dose
      escalation phase and approximately 36 in each of the 3 dose expansion cohorts. Participants
      will be assigned to 1 of the 4 treatment groups:

        -  Part 1: Advanced Solid Tumors

        -  Potential Nivolumab Fixed Dose Cohort

        -  Part 2: Metastatic TNBC

        -  Part 2: Metastatic NSCLC

        -  Part 2: Metastatic HNSCC

      All participants will be asked to take the tablets of TAK-659 at the same time each day
      throughout the study. Participants will also receive intravenous infusion of nivolumab
      (within 30 minutes after the TAK-650 dose) once every 2 weeks. This multi-center trial will
      be conducted globally. The overall time to receive treatment in this study is approximately
      12 months. Participants will be assessed for disease response and PD during the PFS follow-up
      of 6 months (for participants who discontinue due to reasons other than PD) and OS follow-up
      of 12 months from the last dose of study drug.

    <time_frame>From the start of study treatment until the start of subsequent anticancer therapy (up to 28 months)</time_frame>
    <description>ORR was defined as the percentage of participants who's best overall response (BOR) was either complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). The ORR assessment was based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. The BOR was defined as the best response recorded from the start of the study treatment until the start of subsequent anticancer therapy. CR: was disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (target or non-target) had to be reduced in short axis to less than (&lt;) 10 millimeter (mm). PR: was at least a 30 percent (%) decrease in sum of diameter (SOD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline SOD.</description>

    <description>After RP2D of TAK-659 has been identified, based on evaluation of combination with weight-based dose of nivolumab (3 mg/kg), RP2D may be evaluated in combination with a fixed dose of 240 mg IV nivolumab after discussion between investigator and sponsor for all types of advanced solid tumors. For single-agent nivolumab, fixed dose is expected to have equal exposure, safety, and efficacy as weight-based (3 mg/kg) dose. If nivolumab fixed dose is evaluated with TAK-659 RP2D, 3 participants will be initially enrolled into cohort. Following evaluation of safety, efficacy, and any available PK data, along with discussions between investigator and sponsor, 3 additional participants may be enrolled into cohort for a total of 3 to 6 participants. If &gt;=1 out of 6 participants experiences dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in Cycle 1, or significant safety issues are seen in Cycle 2 and beyond, re-evaluation of TAK-659 RP2D when administered with a fixed dose of nivolumab is permitted.</description>

                  nivolumab combination treatment (approximately 10/30 response-evaluable
                  participants); adequate, newly obtained, core or excisional biopsy of a
                  metastatic tumor lesion not previously irradiated is required. Mandatory biopsies
                  will be taken before TAK-659 monotherapy, after the 2 weeks of TAK-659
                  monotherapy, and TAK-659 after 6 weeks of TAK-659 plus nivolumab combination
                  therapy. An optional biopsy may be taken at progression with additional consent
                  from the participants.

The ORR assessment was based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. The BOR was defined as the best response recorded from the start of the study treatment until the start of subsequent anticancer therapy. CR: was disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (target or non-target) had to be reduced in short axis to less than (&lt;) 10 millimeter (mm). PR: was at least a 30 percent (%) decrease in sum of diameter (SOD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline SOD.</description>

        <title>Part 2, Dose Expansion Phase: Disease Control Rate (DCR)</title>
        <description>DCR was the percentage of participants who had BOR with either CR, PR, or stable disease (SD). The DCR assessment was based on RECIST version 1.1. The BOR was defined as the best response recorded from the start of the study treatment until the start of subsequent anticancer therapy. CR: was disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (target or non-target) had to be reduced in short axis to &lt;10 mm. PR: was at least a 30% decrease in SOD of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline SOD. SD: neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest SOD.</description>
