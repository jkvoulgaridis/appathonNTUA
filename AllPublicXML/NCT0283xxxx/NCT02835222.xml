    <textblock>
      This pilot phase II trial studies how well selinexor works when given together with
      induction, consolidation, and maintenance therapy in treating older patients with acute
      myeloid leukemia. Selinexor may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the
      enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cytarabine and
      daunorubicin hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either
      by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.
      Selinexor with induction, consolidation, and maintenance therapy may kill more cancer cells
      in older patients with acute myeloid leukemia.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the feasibility of adding selinexor to induction, consolidation and maintenance
      therapy of elderly acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety of administering selinexor under the proposed study regimen.

      II. To assess response and survival endpoints of patients receiving the proposed study
      regimen.

      III. To assess the rate of allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

      OUTLINE:

      INDUCTION THERAPY: Patients receive cytarabine intravenously (IV) on days 1-7, daunorubicin
      hydrochloride IV on days 1-3, and selinexor orally (PO) twice weekly from day 1. Treatment
      continues for 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      RE-INDUCTION THERAPY: Patients whose disease has not responded receive cytarabine IV on days
      1-5, daunorubicin hydrochloride IV on days 1-2, and selinexor PO twice weekly. Treatment
      continues for 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      CONSOLIDATION THERAPY: Patients in remission receive cytarabine IV every 12 hours on days 1,
      3 and 6, and selinexor PO twice weekly from day 1. Treatment repeats every 42 days for up to
      3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Patients who have had a response and have not gone on to transplant
      receive selinexor PO twice weekly. Treatment continues for 4 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 14 days and then every 3
      months for up to 1 year.

             barrier method of contraception if sexually active with a female of childbearing
             potential. For both male and female patients, effective methods of contraception must
             be used throughout the study and for 3 months following the last dose of study
             treatment. Please refer to Section 6.4.4 of this protocol.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign an IRB-approved informed consent
             document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have received any therapy other than hydroxyurea or ATRA with the purpose
             of treating their AML or patients with Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia are not eligible.

          -  Patients with a secondary AML (defined as a history of prior radiation therapy or
             systemic chemotherapy, CMML or MDS not treated with a hypomethylating agent) however
             history of previous MDS treated with a hypomethylating agent IS allowed.

          -  Patients having received prior radiotherapy, treatment with cytotoxic agents,
             treatment with biologic agents or any anti-cancer therapy for a non-AML malignancy
             within the 4 weeks prior to treatment with selinexor, or those who have not fully
             recovered from the acute, non-hematological, non-infectious toxicities of any prior
             treatment with cytotoxic drugs, radiotherapy or other anti-cancer modalities (returned
             to baseline status as noted before most recent treatment).

          -  Patients with another active malignancy that requires treatment excluding non-melanoma
             skin cancers.

          -  Patients that have received a chemotherapy regimen with stem cell support in the
             previous 6 months.

          -  Patients with known central nervous system involvement should be excluded from this
             clinical trial because the penetration of selinexor into the CNS is not currently
             known.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to selinexor.

          -  Uncontrolled concurrent illness including, but not limited to symptomatic congestive
             heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, or cardiac arrhythmia

          -  Psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
             requirements.

          -  Patients with known HIV infection or hepatitis (Note: Patients with known HIV
             infection are excluded because patients with an immune deficiency are at increased
             risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because of the potential for teratogenic
             or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother, breastfeeding should
             be discontinued.

          -  Patients unable to swallow tablets, patients with malabsorption syndrome, or any other
             GI disease or GI dysfunction that could interfere with absorption of study treatment
