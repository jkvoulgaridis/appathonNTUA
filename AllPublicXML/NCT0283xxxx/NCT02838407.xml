        <title>Number of Subjects With Bacterial Identification &gt;10^4 Cfu/mL in BAL Fluid Samples (S. Pneumoniae and H. Influenzae Results for the &quot;Negative M. Catarrhalis&quot; BAL Fluid Samples Results Category)</title>
        <description>S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis were confirmed by bacterial identification load higher than (&gt;) 10^4 colony forming units per milliliter (cfu/mL), if bacterial species were present alone. Bacterial load referred to Negative M. catarrhalis - Negative S. pneumoniae - Negative H. influenzae (N.M.c.-N.S.p.-N.H.i.), Negative M. catarrhalis - Negative S. pneumoniae - Positive H. influenzae (N.M.c.-N.S.p.-P.H.i.), Negative M. catarrhalis - Positive S. pneumoniae - Negative H. influenzae (N.M.c.-P.S.p.-N.H.i.), Negative M. catarrhalis - Positive S. pneumoniae - Positive H. influenzae (N.M.c.-P.S.p.-P..H.i.).
Notes: bacterial identification for the N.M.c.-P.S.p.-P.H.i. category was confirmed as a co-infection with a bacterial load &gt;10^5 cfu/mL. For one subject who underwent BAL procedure, no BAL fluid was available for study analyses.</description>

        <title>Number of Qualitative Positive Unique Isolates of Subjects With S. Pneumoniae Serogroups and Serotypes in BAL Fluid Samples</title>
        <description>Two isolates of S.p., H.i. and M.c. were selected per specimen type per subjects. For analyses, the 2 isolates were compared to determine if they were clones vs. different (&quot;unique&quot;) pathogen. Isolates were considered &quot;unique&quot; based on the comparison of serotype and antibiotic susceptibility (AS) profile for S.p. and H.i. and on the AS profile alone for M.c.. If the 2 isolates had different serotypes, or the same serotype but a different AS profile, then the 2 isolates were considered &quot;unique&quot;, and both isolates were retained in the analyses. S.p. serogoups and serotypes isolates included: 3, 6B, 7C, 10A, 11A, 11D, 12F, 14, 15B, 16F, 18C, 18F, 19A, 19F, 21, 22F, 23A, 23B, 31, 35F, 42, 48, NT (not typeable), Synflorix serotypes (1, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, 23F) and Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) 13 serotypes (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, 23F).

        <description>The H. influenzae typing results included &quot;f&quot; and &quot;NT&quot; (not typeable). Unique isolate definition: 2 isolates of S.p., H.i. and M.c. were selected per specimen type per subjects. For analyses, the 2 isolates were compared to determine if they were clones vs. different (&quot;unique&quot;) pathogen. Isolates were considered &quot;unique&quot; based on the comparison of serotype and antibiotic susceptibility (AS) profile for S.p. and H.i. and on the AS profile alone for M.c.. If the 2 isolates had different serotypes, or the same serotype but a different AS profile, then the 2 isolates were considered &quot;unique&quot;, and both isolates were retained in the analyses.
Note: For one subject who underwent BAL procedure, no BALF was available for study analyses.</description>

        <description>The H. influenzae typing results include &quot;f &quot; and &quot;NT&quot; (not typeable). Unique isolate definition: 2 isolates of S.p., H.i. and M.c. were selected per specimen type per subjects. For analyses, the 2 isolates were compared to determine if they were clones vs. different (&quot;unique&quot;) pathogen. Isolates were considered &quot;unique&quot; based on the comparison of serotype and antibiotic susceptibility (AS) profile for S.p. and H.i. and on the AS profile alone for M.c.. If the 2 isolates had different serotypes, or the same serotype but a different AS profile, then the 2 isolates were considered &quot;unique&quot;, and both isolates were retained in the analyses.</description>

        <title>Descriptive Statistics of the Antimicrobial Susceptibility Response of H. Influenzae for Unique Isolates Among Qualitative Positive Subjects, for Penicilin and Erythromycin</title>
        <description>Antibiotic response of H. influenzae was tested against antibiotics which included: Penicilin and Erythromycin (following Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute [CLSI] guidelines [CLSI, 2015]).
Samples assessed were BAL fluid (BALF) samples and Nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) samples.
Unique isolate definition: 2 isolates of S.p., H.i. and M.c. were selected per specimen type per subjects. For analyses, the 2 isolates were compared to determine if they were clones vs. different (&quot;unique&quot;) pathogen. Isolates were considered &quot;unique&quot; based on the comparison of serotype and antibiotic susceptibility (AS) profile for S.p. and H.i. and on the AS profile alone for M.c.. If the 2 isolates had different serotypes, or the same serotype but a different AS profile, then the 2 isolates were considered &quot;unique&quot;, and both isolates were retained in the analyses.
Note: For one subject who underwent BAL procedure, no BAL fluid was available for study analyses.</description>

          <title>Descriptive Statistics of the Antimicrobial Susceptibility Response of H. Influenzae for Unique Isolates Among Qualitative Positive Subjects, for Penicilin and Erythromycin</title>
          <description>Antibiotic response of H. influenzae was tested against antibiotics which included: Penicilin and Erythromycin (following Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute [CLSI] guidelines [CLSI, 2015]).
Samples assessed were BAL fluid (BALF) samples and Nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) samples.
Unique isolate definition: 2 isolates of S.p., H.i. and M.c. were selected per specimen type per subjects. For analyses, the 2 isolates were compared to determine if they were clones vs. different (&quot;unique&quot;) pathogen. Isolates were considered &quot;unique&quot; based on the comparison of serotype and antibiotic susceptibility (AS) profile for S.p. and H.i. and on the AS profile alone for M.c.. If the 2 isolates had different serotypes, or the same serotype but a different AS profile, then the 2 isolates were considered &quot;unique&quot;, and both isolates were retained in the analyses.

        <title>Descriptive Statistics of the Antimicrobial Susceptibility Response of M. Catarrhalis for Unique Isolates Among Qualitative Positive Subjects, for Penicilin</title>
        <description>Antibiotic response of M. catarrhalis was tested against antibiotics which included: Penicilin.
Samples assessed were BAL fluid (BALF) samples and Nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) samples.
Unique isolate definition: 2 isolates of S.p., H.i. and M.c. were selected per specimen type per subjects. For analyses, the 2 isolates were compared to determine if they were clones vs. different (&quot;unique&quot;) pathogen. Isolates were considered &quot;unique&quot; based on the comparison of serotype and antibiotic susceptibility (AS) profile for S.p. and H.i. and on the AS profile alone for M.c.. If the 2 isolates had different serotypes, or the same serotype but a different AS profile, then the 2 isolates were considered &quot;unique&quot;, and both isolates were retained in the analyses.
Note: For one subject who underwent BAL procedure, no BAL fluid was available for study analyses.</description>

        <title>Descriptive Statistics of the Antimicrobial Susceptibility Response of H.Influenzae for Unique Isolates Among Quantitative Positive Subjects, for Penicilin and Erythromycin</title>
        <description>Antibiotic response of H.ifluenzae was tested against antibiotics which included: Penicilin and Erythromycin (following Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute [CLSI] guidelines [CLSI, 2015]).
Samples assessed were BAL fluid (BALF) samples and Nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) samples.
Unique isolate definition: 2 isolates of S.p., H.i. and M.c. were selected per specimen type per subjects. For analyses, the 2 isolates were compared to determine if they were clones vs. different (&quot;unique&quot;) pathogen. Isolates were considered &quot;unique&quot; based on the comparison of serotype and antibiotic susceptibility (AS) profile for S.p. and H.i. and on the AS profile alone for M.c.. If the 2 isolates had different serotypes, or the same serotype but a different AS profile, then the 2 isolates were considered &quot;unique&quot;, and both isolates were retained in the analyses.
Note: For one subject who underwent BAL procedure, no BAL fluid was available for study analyses.</description>

        <title>Descriptive Statistics of the Antimicrobial Susceptibility Response of M. Catarrhalis for Unique Isolates Among Quantitative Positive Subjects, for Penicilin</title>
        <description>Antibiotic response of M. catarrhalis was tested against antibiotics which included: Penicilin (following Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute [CLSI] guidelines [CLSI, 2015]).
Samples assessed were BAL fluid (BALF) samples and Nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) samples.
Unique isolate definition: 2 isolates of S.p., H.i. and M.c. were selected per specimen type per subjects. For analyses, the 2 isolates were compared to determine if they were clones vs. different (&quot;unique&quot;) pathogen. Isolates were considered &quot;unique&quot; based on the comparison of serotype and antibiotic susceptibility (AS) profile for S.p. and H.i. and on the AS profile alone for M.c.. If the 2 isolates had different serotypes, or the same serotype but a different AS profile, then the 2 isolates were considered &quot;unique&quot;, and both isolates were retained in the analyses.
Note: For one subject who underwent BAL procedure, no BAL fluid was available for study analyses.</description>

          <title>Number of H. Influenzae and M. Catarrhalis Unique Isolates With Antimicrobial Susceptibility Positive Response From Quantitative Positive Subjects, for Beta-lactamase</title>
          <description>Antimicrobial response of H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis was tested for Beta-lactamase (following Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute [CLSI] guidelines [CLSI, 2015]).
Samples assessed were BAL fluid (BALF) samples and Nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) samples.
Unique isolate definition: 2 isolates of S.p., H.i. and M.c. were selected per specimen type per subjects. For analyses, the 2 isolates were compared to determine if they were clones vs. different (&quot;unique&quot;) pathogen. Isolates were considered &quot;unique&quot; based on the comparison of serotype and antibiotic susceptibility (AS) profile for S.p. and H.i. and on the AS profile alone for M.c.. If the 2 isolates had different serotypes, or the same serotype but a different AS profile, then the 2 isolates were considered &quot;unique&quot;, and both isolates were retained in the analyses.
Note: For one subject who underwent BAL procedure, no BAL fluid was available for study analyses.</description>
