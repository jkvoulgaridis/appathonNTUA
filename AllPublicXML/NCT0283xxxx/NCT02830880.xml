  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess if using
      anti-1-amino-3-[18F]fluorocyclobutane-1-carboxylic acid (FACBC or fluciclovine) PET scan will
      be useful in determining if participants are responding to chemotherapy treatment.
      Investigators will enroll participants whose cancer has been treated with hormone therapy and
      now the cancer is not responding to the treatment (castration -resistant), and so therefore
      will be started on chemotherapy. Investigators aim to enroll thirty participants in this
      study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the investigation is to examine therapeutic monitoring of chemotherapy in
      castrate resistant prostate carcinoma with anti-3-[18F]FACBC in prostate carcinoma to
      determine if anti-3-[18F]FACBC amino acid imaging can serve as an accurate and efficient
      imaging biomarker.

      Investigators will perform a baseline anti-3-[18F]FACBC PET-CT of the whole body. All
      participants will also undergo conventional staging including 99mTc methylene diphosphonate
      (MDP) bone scanning and computed tomography scan (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MR) of
      the abdomen and pelvis which are standard of care at the enrolling institution. This study
      will not interfere with standard patient evaluation or delay therapy.

      All 30 participants will receive chemotherapy every 3 weeks for 6 cycles. Participants will
      undergo a repeat anti-3-[18F]FACBC PET-CT after 1 and 6 cycles and also repeat conventional
      imaging including bone scanning CT or MR of the abdomen and pelvis after 6 cycles. At the end
      of the study, the study team will then record the response (or lack thereof) on
      anti-3-[18F]FACBC PET-CT and correlate that response with response per standard clinical
      criteria including bone scan uptake for skeletal lesions, CT or MR for soft tissue and
      skeletal lesions, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression or regression, and other
      clinical parameters such as declining performance status.

    <measure>Percent Change Assessed by FACBC PET Scan</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Cycle 1 (Week 2), Cycle 6 (Week 17)</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical response will be assessed with FACBC PET imaging. The same measurements of the lesions and background structures will be undertaken at baseline and post-therapy scan. The researchers utilized the following parameters to follow response to therapy: maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of most intense lesion each of bone and node, sum and mean SUVmax of up to 5 index lesions for each of bone and node of most intense lesion each of bone and node of the 5 index lesions for each of bone and node. SUVmax measures uptake of the radiotracer by malignant cells. Percent change after therapy, compared to baseline, was calculated and a positive percent increase indicates greater uptake of FACBC by cancer cells.</description>

    <measure>Prostate Specific Antigen Level</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Cycle 1 (Week 2), Cycle 6 (Week 17)</time_frame>
    <description>Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) serum biomarker will be used to assess response to treatment. PSA level will be collected via blood draw. While a formal cutpoint signifying prostate cancer is not generally used as PSA levels vary between men, in general, higher PSA levels indicate prostate cancer.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Responding to Treatment Assessed by MRI</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Cycle 1 (Week 2), Cycle 6 (Week 17)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will have an MRI or a CT scan to assess response to treatment. Treatment response will be reported as follows:
Complete Response (CR) Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm.
Complete Response Unknown (CRU)
Partial Response (PR) At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters.
Stable Disease (NR/SD) Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD.
Progressive Disease (PD) At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this may include the baseline sum). The sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With a Clinical Response Assessed by Bone Scan</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, After Cycle 6 (Week 17)</time_frame>
    <description>Each patient underwent 99mTc MDP whole body bone scanning at baseline, and after the 6th cycle. Bone scans findings were interpreted based on recommendations from Prostate Cancer Clinical Trial Working Group 3 (PCCTWG3) using a specialized Bone Scan Assessment Tool. The change in disease response after cycle 6 compared to the baseline assessment is presented here.</description>

        <title>Percent Change Assessed by FACBC PET Scan</title>
        <description>Clinical response will be assessed with FACBC PET imaging. The same measurements of the lesions and background structures will be undertaken at baseline and post-therapy scan. The researchers utilized the following parameters to follow response to therapy: maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of most intense lesion each of bone and node, sum and mean SUVmax of up to 5 index lesions for each of bone and node of most intense lesion each of bone and node of the 5 index lesions for each of bone and node. SUVmax measures uptake of the radiotracer by malignant cells. Percent change after therapy, compared to baseline, was calculated and a positive percent increase indicates greater uptake of FACBC by cancer cells.</description>

        <description>Participants will have an MRI or a CT scan to assess response to treatment. Treatment response will be reported as follows:
Complete Response (CR) Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm.
Complete Response Unknown (CRU)
Partial Response (PR) At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters.
Stable Disease (NR/SD) Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD.
Progressive Disease (PD) At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this may include the baseline sum). The sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.</description>

        <description>Each patient underwent 99mTc MDP whole body bone scanning at baseline, and after the 6th cycle. Bone scans findings were interpreted based on recommendations from Prostate Cancer Clinical Trial Working Group 3 (PCCTWG3) using a specialized Bone Scan Assessment Tool. The change in disease response after cycle 6 compared to the baseline assessment is presented here.</description>
