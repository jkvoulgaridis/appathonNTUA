  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will evaluate organ donation educational videos with a 2x3 single blinded
      Randomized Control Trial (RCT) in partnership with our 26 Latino Owned Barbershops (LOBs).
      The testimonial video about Uncontrolled Donation after Circulatory Determination of Death
      (uDCDD) with an uplifting ending will serve as control. Experimental videos may include live
      uDCDD footage, differing endings, or combinations. Video production will be informed by the
      entertainment education model and produced with experts including an Academy Award winning
      filmmaker. The primary outcome is whether participants immediately enroll in the NY State
      Organ Donor Registry (either online or by our RA mailing in the official form with prepaid
      postage). Investigators hypothesize that each video will induce differences in registration
      compared to the control and that there is an interaction effect with video genre and story
      outcome.

    <intervention_name>Control ending - Uplifting</intervention_name>
    <description>The control ending is emotionally uplifting. In this video, the decedent previously registered as an organ donor through online registration and discussed his decision with family. The scene cuts to the family affirming the deceased's wish. In the next scene, the donor family and recipient meet for the first time, ending with a plea from both parties for viewers to register for donation.</description>

    <intervention_name>Negative Consequences Ending</intervention_name>
    <description>A sad ending where the decedent did not register or discuss their position with family; family is asked to consider donation as an option, but they do not agree. The patient with kidney failure misses the window of opportunity, and the final scene is of both families grieving at their respective family members' grave plotsâ€¦a missed opportunity.</description>

    <intervention_name>Unresolved Ending</intervention_name>
    <description>In this ending, the team checks for registration status, and while searching, the scene cuts to physicians discussing the death with family and whether they might consider preservation and organ donation. The video then cuts to the potential recipient and family hoping for a kidney transplant before it is too late. The story ends without resolution, leaving viewers to contemplate how they might respond in the same situation</description>
