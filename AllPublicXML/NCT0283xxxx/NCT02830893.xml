  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the effectiveness of a new lever drive wheelchair, LARA - Lever Actuated
      Resonance Assistance. LARA facilitates patients in performing a high amount of practice using
      their moderate to severely impaired upper extremity after stroke.

      Investigators will recruit 44 subjects with subacute strokes to participate in the study
      through the acute rehabilitation unit of the UC Irvine Douglas Hospital. Study participants
      will be randomized into 2 groups: LARA therapy group or standard therapy group. The LARA
      therapy group will use LARA to propel themselves to therapy appointments in the unit and to
      play video games with the affected upper extremity for 30 mins / day. The standard therapy
      group will use a standard wheelchair to propel themselves using their unaffected upper and
      lower extremities. They will be asked to perform a matched duration of standard arm exercises
      for 30 mins/ day. This program of standard arm exercises was developed by an OT at the
      Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago which consists of graded-difficulty table-supported
      exercises.

      This study will have 3 assessment visits: baseline, 3 weeks after therapy or upon discharge
      from the acute rehabilitation unit if sooner, and a 3-month follow up.

    <measure>Fugl-Meyer (FM) Motor Assessment of the Upper Extremity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Post-intervention evaluation at 3 weeks, and 3-month evaluation after the end of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>We measure the change of the Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment scores from the baseline evaluation to the 3-month follow up evaluation after the end of intervention. Fugl-Meyer is a 66-point scale measuring the movement pattern of the upper extremities. For the study, we analyze the total score only. The higher scores indicate a better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Modified Ashworth Spasticity Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Post-intervention evaluation at 3 weeks, and 3-months after the end of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>We measure the spasticity of the upper extremity at baseline, post-intervention, and at the 3-month follow up evaluation. Spasticity is described as the resistance to passive movement. Participants are asked to relax and evaluators assess muscle resistance to passive movement at one joint at a time: Shoulder, Elbow, Wrist, and Fingers. The evaluator will then grade the resistance on a 6-point scale for each joint. Higher scores indicate more rigid movement or more muscle tone resistance. The minimum score is zero and the maximum score is 4. For this study, we combine all subscores from each joint to compute a total spasticity score.</description>

    <measure>Timed 10-meter Walk</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Post-intervention evaluation at 3 weeks, and 3-months after the end of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>We measure the time one takes to complete a 10-meter walk at baseline evaluation, the post-intervention evaluation, and the 3-month follow up evaluation. Participants are instructed to walk at a distance of 10-meter over a level surface with 2 meters for acceleration and 2 meters for deceleration. Participants are instructed to walk at their comfortable or normal speed over the entire distance. Participants are timed once the first foot passes the acceleration path; the time is stopped once the first foot enters the deceleration path. The lower scores indicate a better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Box and Blocks Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Post-intervention evaluation at 3 weeks, and 3-months after the end of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>We measured the Box and Blocks Test scores at baseline evaluation, the post-intervention, and at the 3-month follow up evaluation. Participants are instructed to move as many blocks as possible, one at a time, from one compartment in a box to a second compartment over a divider for a period of 60 seconds; each block that is moved is counted, and multiple blocks moved at the same time are counted are counted as a single block. The higher scores indicate a better outcome.</description>

Fugl-Meyer is a 66-point scale measuring the movement pattern of the upper extremities. For the study, we analyze the total score only. The higher scores indicate a better outcome.</description>

LARA is a system that facilitates patients to perform high amounts of arm movement with the affected upper extremity. Study participants are able to actively propel themselves in the unit.
LARA: Study participants will use LARA to propel themselves and to play computer games with the impaired upper extremity for 30 min/day in addition to standard of care rehabilitation therapy for 3 weeks or the duration of their stay.</description>

Standard: Study participants will receive no exposure to LARA, will use a standard wheelchair, and will be asked to perform a program of conventional arm exercises for 30 min/day, also in addition to standard of care rehabilitation therapy for 3 weeks or the duration of their stay.</description>

        <title>Modified Ashworth Spasticity Scale</title>
        <description>We measure the spasticity of the upper extremity at baseline, post-intervention, and at the 3-month follow up evaluation. Spasticity is described as the resistance to passive movement. Participants are asked to relax and evaluators assess muscle resistance to passive movement at one joint at a time: Shoulder, Elbow, Wrist, and Fingers. The evaluator will then grade the resistance on a 6-point scale for each joint. Higher scores indicate more rigid movement or more muscle tone resistance. The minimum score is zero and the maximum score is 4. For this study, we combine all subscores from each joint to compute a total spasticity score.</description>

        <title>Timed 10-meter Walk</title>
        <description>We measure the time one takes to complete a 10-meter walk at baseline evaluation, the post-intervention evaluation, and the 3-month follow up evaluation. Participants are instructed to walk at a distance of 10-meter over a level surface with 2 meters for acceleration and 2 meters for deceleration. Participants are instructed to walk at their comfortable or normal speed over the entire distance. Participants are timed once the first foot passes the acceleration path; the time is stopped once the first foot enters the deceleration path. The lower scores indicate a better outcome.</description>

            <title>The LARA Therapy</title>
            <description>The LARA arm of this study will use the LARA system while study participants are staying at the acute rehabilitation unit of UC Irvine Douglas Hospital. LARA is a system that facilitates patients to perform high amounts of arm movement with the affected upper extremity. Study participants are able to actively propel themselves in the unit.
LARA: Study participants will use LARA to propel themselves and to play computer games with the impaired upper extremity for 30 min/day in addition to standard of care rehabilitation therapy for 3 weeks or the duration of their stay.</description>

            <description>The control arm of this study will use a standard wheelchair while study participants are staying at the acute rehabilitation unit of UC Irvine Douglas Hospital. Study participants will have no exposure to LARA and they will use a standard wheelchair. They will use their unaffected upper and lower extremities to propel themselves in the unit.
Standard: Study participants will receive no exposure to LARA, will use a standard wheelchair, and will be asked to perform a program of conventional arm exercises for 30 min/day, also in addition to standard of care rehabilitation therapy for 3 weeks or the duration of their stay.</description>

        <description>We measured the Box and Blocks Test scores at baseline evaluation, the post-intervention, and at the 3-month follow up evaluation. Participants are instructed to move as many blocks as possible, one at a time, from one compartment in a box to a second compartment over a divider for a period of 60 seconds; each block that is moved is counted, and multiple blocks moved at the same time are counted are counted as a single block. The higher scores indicate a better outcome.</description>
