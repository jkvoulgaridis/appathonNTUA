      Background: Provision of anticipatory guidance to parents is recommended as an effective
      strategy to prevent injuries among young children. Internet-based anticipatory guidance is
      suggested to reinforce the effectiveness of injury prevention, and improve parents' knowledge
      on child safety. Parents receiving the guidance can reduce children's exposure to injury risk
      by adopting better childcare practices and using appropriate child safety devices at home.

      Objective: This study will examine the effectiveness of Internet-based injury prevention
      program with parental anticipatory guidance in enhancing mothers' knowledge on child safety.
      It aims at increasing mothers' knowledge and motivation of learning about domestic injury
      prevention through a new Internet-based intervention model. It also targets to improve
      mothers' attitude and perceived behavioral control of domestic safety practice.

      Methods: The study would adopt a randomized controlled trial design and recruit 934 mothers
      from the antenatal clinics and postnatal wards of two major public hospitals in Hong Kong.
      Participating mothers will be randomized into the intervention or control group with equal
      likelihood. Mothers in intervention group will be provided with free access to an
      Internet-based injury prevention program with anticipatory guideline whereas those in the
      control group will receive relevant parenting booklet.

      Results: It is hypothesized that mothers' general and age-appropriate knowledge on child
      safety and motivation of learning about domestic injury prevention as the primary outcome
      measures will be enhanced.

      Conclusions: The Internet is increasingly recognized as a practical and cost-effective
      platform for health education and safety information delivery. The goals of this study are to
      examine the effectiveness of a new Internet-based intervention program for improving mothers'
      knowledge, and raising mothers' awareness about the importance and consequences caused by
      domestic injuries.
