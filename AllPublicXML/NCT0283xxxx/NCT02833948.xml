  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aortic valve is located between the left ventricle and the aorta. Patients with
      symptomatic, severe aortic valve stenosis conventionally have it surgically replaced
      requiring direct access to the heart through the chest. Transcatheter aortic valve
      replacement (TAVR) is now a well-established alternative for treating severe aortic valve
      stenosis. Both types of intervention improve prognosis and alleviate symptoms.

      The optimal choice of blood thinning therapy after TAVR is unknown. It has been reported that
      leaflet thrombosis with reduced leaflet motion can occur and this phenomenon has been
      suggested to be potentially related with neurological events. In addition, the occurence of
      this phenomenon can be reduced with anticoagulation blood thinning therapy.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate if anticoagulation compared to the usual double
      platelet inhibitor therapy after TAVR can reduce the risk of leaflet thrombosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has become an established
      therapeutic option for patients with symptomatic, severe aortic valve stenosis, who are
      ineligible or at high risk for conventional surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). It was
      recently reported that leaflet thickening and reduced leaflet motion, verified by
      four-dimensional computed tomography (4DCT), was not uncommon after both TAVR and SAVR. It
      has been emphasized that this phenomenon should be further investigated for its effect on
      clinical outcomes (e.g. stroke) and valve durability. As this valve leaflet thickening and
      reduced motion could be reversed by oral anticoagulant (OAC) treatment and was not observed
      in patients on chronic OAC therapy, it has been hypothesized that this phenomenon could be
      related to possible leaflet thrombosis or a &quot;thrombotic film&quot; on the leaflets.

      AIM: To evaluate whether a rivaroxaban-based strategy, following successful TAVR, compared to
      an antiplatelet-based strategy, is superior in reducing subclinical valve leaflet thickening
      and motion abnormalities - as detected by 4DCT-scan.

      POPULATION: All patients undergoing successful TAVR by ileofemoral or subclavian access with
      an approved TAVR device will be screened for eligibility. Included subjects must provide
      written informed consent. Inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed below.

      DESIGN: The GALILEO-4D trial will be conducted as a substudy of the multicenter, open-label,
      randomized, event-driven, active-controlled GALILEO trial. Patients will be 1:1 randomized to
      an antiplatelet-based strategy vs. rivaroxaban-based strategy - the randomization will adopt
      the same 1:1 randomization of the main GALILEO trial. In case the GALILEO-4D trial should
      still be continued after completion of the main GALILEO trial, this 1:1 randomization will be
      continued until inclusion of 150 patients in both treatment groups. In total, 300 patients
      will be randomized in the GALILEO-4D trial.

      INTERVENTION: Subjects in the GALILEO-4D substudy will receive the same intervention as in
      the main GALILEO study. In addition, a 4DCT-scan and echocardiography will be performed at 90
      days after randomization.

      END POINTS: The primary endpoint constitutes the rate of patients with at least one
      prosthetic leaflet with &gt; 50% motion reduction as assessed by cardiac 4DCT-scan (total N =
      300). The secondary endpoints are listed below.

Quantitative assessment of leaflet motion is performed with a blood pool inversion volume rendered cine reconstruction throughout the cardiac cycle evaluating the bioprosthetic leaflets.</description>

          <description>ASA (Acetylsalicylic acid) 75-100mg + Clopidogrel 75mg for 90 days, followed by ASA 75-100mg monotherapy
Acetylsalicylic acid: Drug: Acetylsalicylic acid:
75 - 100 mg OD (for first 90 days only in arm 1)
Clopidogrel: Drug: Clopidogrel 75 mg OD for first 90 days
If new-onset atrial fibrillation occurred within three months, clopidogrel was replaced by vitamin K antagonist targeting an international normalized ratio of 2 to 3 and combined with acetylsalicyclic acid 75mg to 100mg once-daily (which was discontinued at three month post-TAVR); however, if new-onset atrial fibrillation occurred after three months, acetylsalicyclic acid 75mg to 100mg once-daily was replaced by vitamin K antagonist targeting an international normalized ratio of 2 to 3.</description>

If new-onset atrial fibrillation occurred within this group, the rivaroxaban drug dose was increased from 10mg once-daily to 20mg once-daily (or 15mg once-daily in patients with moderate renal dysfunction as per drug label) plus acetylsalicyclic acid 75mg to 100mg once-daily; acetylsalicyclic acid was discontinued at three months post-TAVR.</description>

          <description>The risk model of the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) uses an algorithm that is based on the presence of coexisting illnesses to predict 30-day operative mortality. The STS score equals the predicted mortality expressed as a percentage.
A score of greater than 8% indicates high risk, 3 to 8% intermediate risk, and les than 3% low risk.</description>

        <title>Rate of Patients With at Least One Prosthetic Leaflet With &gt;50% Motion Reduction as Assessed by Cardiac 4DCT-scan</title>
        <description>Reduced systolic leaflet excursion is classified as: (I) normal, (II) mildly reduced (&lt;50%), (III) moderate to severely reduced (&gt;50%), and (IV) immobile. Reduced systolic leaflet excursion is considered significant when it is &gt; 50% or immobile. Quantitative assessment of leaflet motion is performed with a blood pool inversion volume rendered cine reconstruction throughout the cardiac cycle evaluating the bioprosthetic leaflets.</description>

75 - 100 mg OD (for first 90 days only in arm 1)
Clopidogrel: Drug: Clopidogrel 75 mg OD for first 90 days
If new-onset atrial fibrillation occurred within three months, clopidogrel was replaced by vitamin K antagonist targeting an international normalized ratio of 2 to 3 and combined with acetylsalicyclic acid 75mg to 100mg once-daily (which was discontinued at three month post-TAVR); however, if new-onset atrial fibrillation occurred after three months, acetylsalicyclic acid 75mg to 100mg once-daily was replaced by vitamin K antagonist targeting an international normalized ratio of 2 to 3.</description>

If new-onset atrial fibrillation occurred within this group, the rivaroxaban drug dose was increased from 10mg once-daily to 20mg once-daily (or 15mg once-daily in patients with moderate renal dysfunction as per drug label) plus acetylsalicyclic acid 75mg to 100mg once-daily; acetylsalicyclic acid was discontinued at three months post-TAVR.</description>

Clopidogrel: Drug: Clopidogrel 75 mg OD for first 90 days
If new-onset atrial fibrillation occurred within three months, clopidogrel was replaced by vitamin K antagonist targeting an international normalized ratio of 2 to 3 and combined with acetylsalicyclic acid 75mg to 100mg once-daily (which was discontinued at three month post-TAVR); however, if new-onset atrial fibrillation occurred after three months, acetylsalicyclic acid 75mg to 100mg once-daily was replaced by vitamin K antagonist targeting an international normalized ratio of 2 to 3.</description>

If new-onset atrial fibrillation occurred within this group, the rivaroxaban drug dose was increased from 10mg once-daily to 20mg once-daily (or 15mg once-daily in patients with moderate renal dysfunction as per drug label) plus acetylsalicyclic acid 75mg to 100mg once-daily; acetylsalicyclic acid was discontinued at three months post-TAVR.</description>
