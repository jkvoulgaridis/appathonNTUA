      This is a single center study to assess metabolic effects in subjects after a Jejunal to
      Ileal Diversion procedure was performed using colonoscopes.

    <textblock>
      The Jejunal to Ileal Diversion procedure is an adaptation of a biliopancreatic diversion with
      duodenal switch, which is a surgical procedure used to treat metabolic syndrome conditions.
      The small bowel diversion of the jejunum into the ileum by creating a single anastomosis just
      beyond the ligament of Trietz will be studied. Up to 15 eligible subjects will be enrolled
      into the trial. Enrollment will stop once 10 subjects have undergone the Jejunal to Ileal
      Diversion procedure.

    <description>The Jejunal to Ileal Diversion procedure will be performed using colonoscopes to place magnets to create a side to side compression anastomosis. The colonoscope delivered magnet creates the proximal end of the anastomosis approximately 100 cm distal from the ligament of Treitz. The colonoscope delivered magnets creates the distal end of the anastomosis approximately 100 cm proximal from the ileocecal junction.</description>
