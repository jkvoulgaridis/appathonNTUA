        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Signed informed consent/authorization is obtained prior to conducting any
             study-specific screening procedures.

          -  18 years of age or order

          -  Histologic or cytologic diagnosis of cancer

          -  Patients without a curative therapy or whose tumor does not have standard chemotherapy

          -  At least 4 weeks after the last dose of chemotherapy or radiation therapy; 6 weeks for
             mitoxantrone or mitomycin therapy

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status must be ≤2 (Appendix A).

          -  Adequate hepatic, renal, and bone marrow function:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,000/microliter (uL)

               -  Platelets ≥ 100,000/uL

               -  Total bilirubin ≤2.0

               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤ 2.5 X institutional ULN

               -  Creatinine ≤1.2 mg/dL or clearance ≥50ml/min (Cockcroft-Gault)

          -  All participants (male and female) with reproductive potential must practice an
             effective method of contraception while on this study in order to minimize risks to
             fetuses.

          -  Radiographic evidence of measurable disease tumor lesion (≥ 1cm in greatest dimension)
             or nodal disease (&gt;1.5cm in greatest dimension)

          -  Men and women of all ethnic groups are eligible for this trial.

          -  Females at reproductive age must have a negative urine pregnancy test prior to entry
             to this study

          -  Life expectancy is greater than 12 weeks.

          -  Patients with controlled CNS disease and off steroids are eligible.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, symptomatic
             congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmias not well
             controlled with medication, myocardial infarction within the previous 6 months, or
             psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
             requirements.

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other concurrent investigational agents, or have
             received any investigational agent within four weeks of commencing this protocol.

          -  Since the teratogenic potential of this combination is currently unknown, females who
             are pregnant or lactating are excluded. Males and females should perform abstinence or
             use barrier to prevent pregnancy.

          -  History of any other malignancies in the last 2 years except in-situ cancer,
             non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, basal or squamous cell skin cancer are eligible

          -  Patients known to be HIV(+), Hep BsAg(+), or Hep C(+) are excluded as the effect of
             the agent on immune system has not been assessed

          -  Patients with history of hypersensitivity to liposomal products

          -  Patients with primary CNS malignancies or leptomeningeal disease are excluded
