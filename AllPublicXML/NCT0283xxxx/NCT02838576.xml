  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Arthralgia has been a common complaint in postmenopausal period which seems to be involved
      with estrogen depletion, although, its pathophysiology isn´t completely clarified. It seems
      to relate with the level of physical activity, climacteric symptoms and pain catastrophizing.
      In view of the multiple dimensions involved in arthralgia in postmenopausal women which
      characterize it as a complex phenomenon, this study aims to describe the effects of hormone
      replacement therapy in women aged between 45 and 55 years, considering estrogen as a possible
      anti-nociceptive factor.

      This study is a randomized double-blind controlled clinical trial with postmenopausal women
      aged between 45 and 55 years with chronic arthralgia related to climacteric. They will be
      evaluated climacteric symptoms, pain intensity, level of physical activity, pain
      catastrophising, depression, anxiety, quality of sleep and quality of life. The volunteers
      will be randomized, in the proportion 1:1, to treatment with either 0,625 mg conjugated
      equine estrogen, via oral administration, for 12 weeks or placebo, via oral administration,
      for 12 weeks. The randomization will be performed by a computer-generated random numbers
      list. The investigators will be blinded until completion of 12 weeks. Evaluation of
      climacteric symptoms, pain intensity, level of physical activity, pain catastrophising,
      depression, anxiety, quality of sleep and quality of life will be performed in the hospital
      at baseline, 1, 2, 3, 6 months and 15 days. In each visit, participants will be evaluated
      about adverse effects such as diarrhea, nausea and vomit.

    <description>Thirty-six healthy postmenopausal women aged between 45 and 55 years will receive 0,625 mg/day conjugated equine estrogen (CEE) for 12 weeks. These 1 active pill containing conjugated equine estrogen, 0,625 mg will be provided by a laboratory with no trademark identification.
The bottles will be numbered in code by a pharmaceutist not involved directly in study and they will donated to volunteers.
During the intervening period, use of conjugated equine estrogen, there will be blinding. After this phase, blinding will be interrupted in order to identify volunteers who used the active drug.</description>

During the intervening period, use of placebo, there will be blinding. After this phase, blinding will be interrupted in order to identify volunteers who used the active drug and placebo.</description>
