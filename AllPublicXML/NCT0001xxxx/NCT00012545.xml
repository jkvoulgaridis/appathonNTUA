      This study will determine the best ways to collect, process and store umbilical cord blood
      from babies with sickle cell disease, sickle cell trait and unaffected babies. Sickle cell
      disease is an abnormality of the hemoglobin in red blood cells that causes the cells to
      change shape and clump together, preventing their normal flow in the bloodstream. This
      impairs blood flow to various organs, and the resulting oxygen deprivation causes organ
      damage.

      Cord blood is rich in stem cells (cells produced in the bone marrow that mature to different
      types of blood cells), which may prove useful in new sickle cell therapies. However, cord
      blood from babies with sickle cell trait, sickle cell disease and normal babies may act
      differently under laboratory conditions, so it is important to learn how best to work with
      blood from all three groups of babies for future use in possible treatments.

      Pregnant women between 18 and 45 years of age who are at risk of having an infant with sickle
      cell disease and normal volunteers who are pregnant and not at risk for this disease may be
      eligible for this study. Potential participants will be counseled about donating her infant s
      blood in order to make an informed choice.

      All women who participate in the study will provide a medical history and have blood
      collected from the umbilical cord and placenta (afterbirth) after the baby s delivery. The
      blood will be tested for various infectious diseases, processed, frozen and stored for
      research purposes. In addition, blood from women with babies at risk for sickle cell disease
      will be tested for the presence of the sickle cell gene, tissue typed, and used for research
      as follows:

        -  Sickle cell disease If cord blood tests show the baby has sickle cell disease, the blood
           will be frozen for an indefinite period of time for possible use in future treatment of
           the child. This treatment could include stem cell transplantation or gene therapy,
           treatments are not currently considered routine for sickle cell disease.

        -  Sickle cell trait or normal hemoglobin If cord blood tests show the baby has sickle cell
           trait or is unaffected, the blood will be processed and stored for up to 3 years, during
           which time it may possibly be used to treat a currently living or future sibling with
           sickle cell disease. After 3 years, the participant may agree to either have the blood
           discarded, given to research or moved to another facility for continued storage at the
           participant s expense, if there is a storage fee. Alternatively, if there is no
           anticipated future need for the collected blood, or if it does not meet standards needed
           for future treatment, it will be used in NIH-approved research studies.

      Participants and their family doctor or the baby s pediatrician will be contacted twice a
      year for information about changes in the baby s health. Participants may also be asked
      permission to perform new tests developed by researchers.

      Umbilical cord blood is a source of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) for transplantation or
      gene therapy. Our goal is to procure umbilical cord blood (UCB) from newborns at risk for
      sickle cell disease, sickle cell trait, and related disorders as well as normal newborns and
      store clinical grade cord blood units (CBU) for future use in clinical transplantation or
      gene therapy. Cord blood units will be collected from an indefinite number of subjects until
      50 CBU from newborns with homozygous sickle cell disease have been cryopreserved. Maternal
      subjects will be identified as being at risk to have an infant with sickle cell disease, will
      be between the ages of 18 and 45 years, and will meet specified medical history criteria.
      Mothers will have to deliver at INOVA Fairfax Hospital (collection provider site) and the CB
      will be collected by NCBP collectors ex utero, will be transported to the NCBP CB facility
      and will be processed, tested and stored. Frozen CBU will be transferred to the NIH for
      clinical transplantation or gene therapy studies upon NIH request.

        This is a pilot feasibility study for which umbilical cord blood samples will be collected
        and transported to the NIH Clinical Center for our developmental research. Pregnant women
        whose babies are at risk for sickle cell anemia will be identified and referred to the NIH
        Research Coordinator for evaluation and entry into the study. The NIH Research Coordinator
        is experienced in performing patient education and counseling concerning sickle cell
        disease, and obtaining informed consent.

               -  Maternal subjects deliver at INOVA Fairfax Hospital (insurance approval)

               -  Maternal subjects enrolled on other studies are not excluded, unless the other
                  study may interfere with the present one.

               -  Maternal subjects in active labor will be enrolled at the discretion of her
                  physician. (Note: in rare cases that a mother is identified as a potential
                  candidate for the study during labor, it is at the discretion of her physician
                  whether she could be in a condition to discuss about the study and provide
                  informed consent (then IFH has to obtain the Informed Consent). After labor and
                  delivery, the study will be discussed again with the mother.)

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  The maternal subject will not be eligible for study if she is known to be positive for
             one or more of the following diseases transmissible by blood: HIV, hepatitis B,
             hepatitis C, or HTLV or ZIKV.

          -  Maternal subject will not be eligible for the study if she has active syphilis,
             toxoplasmosis, malaria or babesia during pregnancy.

          -  Maternal subject delivers at another facility, not INOVA Fairfax Hospital.

          -  Maternal subject has cancer or received treatment for cancer during pregnancy

          -  Maternal subject may be excluded at the time of delivery if the attending physician or
             collection staff deems that the cord blood collection is inadvisable, due to
             unanticipated obstetrical complications.
