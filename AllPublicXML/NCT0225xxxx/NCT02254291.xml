  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Japan. The purpose is to compare the safety of once-weekly dosing
      of semaglutide (0.5 and 1.0 mg) versus sitagliptin (100 mg) once daily, both as monotherapy
      during 30 weeks of treatment in Japanese subjects with type 2 diabetes.

    <measure>Number of Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 0-30</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse events (AEs) was defined as any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a product, whether or not considered related to the product. All AEs mentioned here are treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE) defined as an event that had onset date (or increase in severity) on or after the first day of exposure to randomised treatment (week 0-30 treatment period) and no later than the follow-up visit during the on-treatment observation period (date of last dose + 42 days).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Severe or Blood Glucose (BG) Confirmed Symptomatic Hypoglycaemic Episodes</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 0-30</time_frame>
    <description>Severe or blood glucose (BG) confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemic episodes were defined as episodes that were severe and/or BG confirmed by a plasma glucose value of &lt;56 mg/dL (3.1 mmol/L), with symptoms consistent with hypoglycaemia. Severe hypoglycaemia was an episode requiring assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or take other corrective actions. The episodes mentioned here are treatment emergent hypoglycaemic episodes and defined as an event that had onset date (or increase in severity) on or after the first day of exposure to randomised treatment (week 0-30 treatment period) and no later than the follow-up visit during the on-treatment observation period (date of last dose + 42 days).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Glycosylated Haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 and week 30</time_frame>
    <description>Mean changes in HbA1c values from baseline after 30 weeks of treatment. Changes in HbA1c were analysed using a mixed model for repeated measurements (MMRM) with treatment and pre-trial treatment at screening as fixed factors and baseline value as covariate. The data were analysed for the &quot;on-treatment without rescue medication&quot; observation period which includes observations noted at or after the date of first dose of randomised treatment and not after the last dose of the trial product (+ a 7-day visit window) or initiation of rescue medication.</description>

             for subjects treated with oral antidiabetic drug (OAD) monotherapy and between 7.0%
             and 10.5% (53-91 mmol/mol) (both inclusive) for subjects treated with diet and
             exercise therapy at screening

      <pre_assignment_details>Subjects were either on stable diet and exercise therapy only or on stable oral anti-diabetic drug (OAD) monotherapy (a maximum dose of 750 mg metformin or 2250 mg METGLUCO according to approved Japanese labelling) in addition to stable diet and exercise therapy for at least 30 days prior to screening (week -8 or week -2).</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Subjects were randomized to receive semaglutide 0.5 mg once weekly subcutaneously (s.c.; under the skin) in the thigh, abdomen, or upper arm for a duration of 30 weeks. Subjects followed a fixed dose escalation pattern to improve tolerability concerns, starting with once-weekly doses of 0.25 mg for 4 weeks (4 doses), then escalated to 0.5 mg once weekly maintenance dose for 26 weeks (maximum dose). Doses were not changed during the trial after the maintenance dose was reached. Semaglutide 1.34 mg/mL was supplied in a 1.5 mL pre-filled PDS290 pen-injector and administered on the same day of every week during the trial. For subjects previously treated with OAD monotherapy, their 8-week pre-trial OAD was washed out before randomisation. All subjects continued their pre-trial treatment of diet and exercise therapy throughout the trial.</description>

          <description>The subjects in this arm received oral fixed dose of sitagliptin 100 mg tablet once daily for a duration of 30 weeks. For subjects previously treated with OAD monotherapy, their pre-trial OAD was washed out before randomisation. Doses of sitagliptin were not changed throughout the trial. All subjects continued their pre-trial treatment of diet and exercise therapy throughout the trial.</description>

          <description>Subjects were randomized to receive semaglutide 0.5 mg once weekly subcutaneously (s.c.; under the skin) in the thigh, abdomen, or upper arm for a duration of 30 weeks. Subjects followed a fixed dose escalation pattern to improve tolerability concerns, starting with once-weekly doses of 0.25 mg for 4 weeks (4 doses), then escalated to 0.5 mg once weekly maintenance dose for 26 weeks (maximum dose). Doses were not changed during the trial after the maintenance dose was reached. Semaglutide 1.34 mg/mL was supplied in a 1.5 mL pre-filled PDS290 pen-injector and administered on the same day of every week during the trial. For subjects previously treated with OAD monotherapy, their 8-week pre-trial OAD was washed out before randomisation.

        <title>Change in Glycosylated Haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)</title>
        <description>Mean changes in HbA1c values from baseline after 30 weeks of treatment. Changes in HbA1c were analysed using a mixed model for repeated measurements (MMRM) with treatment and pre-trial treatment at screening as fixed factors and baseline value as covariate. The data were analysed for the &quot;on-treatment without rescue medication&quot; observation period which includes observations noted at or after the date of first dose of randomised treatment and not after the last dose of the trial product (+ a 7-day visit window) or initiation of rescue medication.</description>
        <time_frame>Week 0 and week 30</time_frame>
        <population>The full analysis set (FAS) included all randomised subjects who have received at least one dose of trial product. All subjects contributed to the statistical model of the data analysis, but not all subjects had a value at week 30.</population>

            <title>Semaglutide 0.5 mg</title>
            <description>Subjects were randomized to receive semaglutide 0.5 mg once weekly subcutaneously (s.c.; under the skin) in the thigh, abdomen, or upper arm for a duration of 30 weeks. Subjects followed a fixed dose escalation pattern to improve tolerability concerns, starting with once-weekly doses of 0.25 mg for 4 weeks (4 doses), then escalated to 0.5 mg once weekly maintenance dose for 26 weeks (maximum dose). Doses were not changed during the trial after the maintenance dose was reached. Semaglutide 1.34 mg/mL was supplied in a 1.5 mL pre-filled PDS290 pen-injector and administered on the same day of every week during the trial. For subjects previously treated with OAD monotherapy, their 8-week pre-trial OAD was washed out before randomisation. All subjects continued their pre-trial treatment of diet and exercise therapy throughout the trial.</description>
