  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesis is that electrical stimulation to the tongue that directly
      stimulates two cranial nerve nuclei (Trigeminal and Facial Nerve Nuclei), will excite neural
      impulses to the brainstem and cerebellum. The investigators call this cranial nerve
      non-invasive neuromodulation (CN-NINM). The activation of these structures induces
      neuroplasticity when combined with specific physical exercises, can reduce symptoms of
      advanced MS, targeting primarily postural stability (sitting and standing), upper extremity
      movement, and ability to perform self-transfers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intervention will be similar to that used in the investigators previous work with
      movement disorders, and will be tailored to the address issues unique to individuals with
      advanced MS.

      The study will enroll a total of 6 subjects having advanced MS that present with significant
      seated and standing balance, posture, or movement control deficits due to MS.

      Subjects will complete twice-daily lab training for two weeks (5 days/week). Each lab
      training (morning and afternoon) includes 1.5 to 2 hours of instruction in balance, posture
      and gait activities; therapeutic exercise for isolated muscle control; transfer training; and
      relaxation training.

      Activities are performed in 20-minute sessions with concomitant electrical stimulation of the
      tongue. The intervention is customized according to each subject's particular symptoms and
      tolerance. If a subject is not able to perform this amount of training, the training will be
      adapted to a level that is tolerable.

      After these 2 weeks, subjects will continue to perform these same intervention activities at
      home for 4 weeks. They will return to the lab for 1 week of training and testing, then
      perform home training for 4 weeks. This cycle is repeated for a total of 5 cycles.

      After the 6 months have been completed, subjects may choose to participate in an optional
      second phase of the study. The second phase includes an additional 12 months of participation
      in which subjects perform the intervention activities at home training and return to the lab
      on time per month for 2 hours of testing and 2 hours of training.

      If successful, this study would indicate that CN-NINM intervention may reduce the symptoms of
      advanced MS.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must be age 18 or older.

          -  Subjects will have a score between 6.5 to 7.5 on the Kurtzke Expanded Disability
             Status Scale (EDSS). The EDSS is a method of quantifying disability in people with
             multiple sclerosis.

               -  Score of 6.5: needs constant bilateral support to walk 20 meters without resting.

               -  Score of 7.0: unable to walk beyond five meters even with aid, and is essentially
                  restricted to a wheelchair; wheels self and transfers alone, and is active in
                  wheelchair about 12 hours a day.

               -  Score of 7.5: unable to take more than a few steps and is restricted to
                  wheelchair, and may need aid to transfer; wheels self, but may require a
                  motorized chair for a full day's activities.

          -  Subjects will have reached a plateau in an MS focused physical rehabilitation program
             in the 6 months prior to enrollment.

               -  Requiring prior physical therapy will ensure that subjects have a core level of
                  function that will allow them to participate in the study.

               -  Requiring that subjects have reached a plateau will ensure that subjects'
                  response to the intervention is due to the use of the device and not to the
                  physical exercises alone.

               -  Subjects who have participated in a physical rehabilitation program demonstrate
                  that they are willing and able to commit to a rigorous training regimen.

          -  Subjects will have a maximum score of 20 on the Trunk Impairment Scale (TIS). The TIS
             assesses static dynamic sitting balance and trunk coordination in a sitting position.
             A score of 20 or lower indicates that their ability to adequately maintain sitting
             posture is affected.

          -  Subjects may have upper extremity involvement.

          -  Subjects may have additional symptoms of nystagmus, dysarthria, sensory disturbance,
             pain, and/or bowel and bladder function. As they present, we will use appropriate
             assessments at baseline and successive study test points.

          -  Subjects are their own legal guardians, and are able to understand and give informed
             consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects will have no major co-morbidities, especially neurological disorders, uncontrolled
        pain, hypertension or diabetes. All subjects, if on medications, will not have had any
        major changes in type or dosage in within 3 months of enrollment. Additionally, candidates
        will be excluded if they:

          -  have Functional Systems Scores (FSS) 4 or greater for pyramidal, cerebellar,
             brainstem, and sensory functions; 3 or greater for bowel and bladder function; and 2
             or greater for cerebral function;

          -  are able to walk independently;

          -  use tobacco products (these activities tend to reduce tactile sensitivity in the oral
             cavity);

          -  have any oral abrasions, cuts, cold sores, piercings, tissue inflammation, or have had
             oral surgery within the previous 3 months;

          <title>EDSS Score</title>
          <description>Participants with MS are assessed by a clinician using the Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Scores range 0-10 (higher numbers indicate greater disability). Participants scoring 1-4.5 can walk without aid, 5.0-7.0 are walking impaired, scores of 7.5+ indicate wheelchair restriction. EDSS draws on the Kurtzke Functional Systems Scores (FSS) that assess 7 physiologic systems affected by MS. FSS ranges from 0-10 in each subsystem, where higher numbers indicate greater levels of dysfunction. The resulting EDSS characterizes the overall ability of the individual.</description>

          <title>MS Subtype</title>
          <description>Secondary Progressing MS (SPMS) follows an initial Relapsing-Remitting (RRMS) diagnosis (~85 percent of initial MS diagnoses), characterized by relapses of increased disease activity and worsening symptoms, followed by remissions when the disease does not progress. SPMS is characterized as a gradual increase in disability as the disease progresses, with or without evidence of relapse or changes in an MRI scan. Primary Progressive MS (PPMS) is occurs in ~15 percent of initial MS diagnoses and presents as a steady progression of the disease with no clear relapses or remissions.</description>

        <description>Clinician measures standing balance for up to 30 seconds in each of 5 conditions: feet 10 cm apart, feet together, stride stance, tandem stance, and single leg stance with eyes open and eyes closed. Total score is the sum of all 5 conditions. Higher scores indicate better balance. Performance-based and tested in participants who possessed the ability to perform the assessment. Effect size is reported (quantified difference between baseline and time point). The larger the absolute value, the stronger the effect. Cohen's guidelines for social sciences indicate 0.10 as a &quot;small&quot; effect size, 0.30 as a &quot;medium&quot; effect size, and 0.50 as a &quot;large&quot; effect size.</description>

        <title>Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Pain Effects Scale (PES)</title>
        <description>A self-report scale that assesses the ways in which pain and unpleasant sensation interfere with mood, ability to walk or move, sleep, work, recreation, and enjoyment of life. This assessment is used for subjects who have pain. Scores can range from 6-30. Items are scaled so that higher scores indicate a greater impact of pain on a patient's mood and behavior. Symptom specific test, only used for participants who presented symptom. Effect size is reported (quantified difference between baseline and time point). The larger the absolute value, the stronger the effect. Cohen's guidelines for social sciences indicate 0.10 as a &quot;small&quot; effect size, 0.30 as a &quot;medium&quot; effect size, and 0.50 as a &quot;large&quot; effect size.</description>

It was postulated that the physical limitations of two subjects with EDSS score of 7.5 presented special challenges to measuring changes in function with the available assessment mechanisms for this clinical population.</population>

        <description>A brief, clinician-administered test that helps determine the neuropsychological status of adults who have neurologic injury or disease such as dementia, head injury, and stroke. This tool consists of a battery of tests. Raw scores are transformed to a 0-120 scale, with a higher score indicating higher function. Effect size is reported (quantified difference between baseline and time point). The larger the absolute value, the stronger the effect. Cohen's guidelines for social sciences indicate 0.10 as a &quot;small&quot; effect size, 0.30 as a &quot;medium&quot; effect size, and 0.50 as a &quot;large&quot; effect size.</description>

        <title>Box &amp; Blocks (B&amp;B) Assessment - Right</title>
        <description>A standardized clinical assessment of gross upper limb dexterity. Subjects move small blocks from one side of a box to the other within a time period (one minute). Each side is tested separately. The score is the number of blocks moved from 0-150. A higher score indicates improvement. Effect size is reported (quantified difference between baseline and time point). The larger the absolute value, the stronger the effect. Cohen's guidelines for social sciences indicate 0.10 as a &quot;small&quot; effect size, 0.30 as a &quot;medium&quot; effect size, and 0.50 as a &quot;large&quot; effect size.</description>

It was postulated that the physical limitations of two subjects with EDSS score of 7.5 presented special challenges to measuring changes in function with the available assessment mechanisms for this clinical population.</population>

        <title>Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS-29) - Physical</title>
        <description>A 29-item self-report tool that measures the impact of MS on day-to-day life. There are 3 scores, physical, psychological, and total score. Raw scores are transformed to a 0-100 scale. A higher score indicates a greater impact of disease on daily function. Effect size is reported (quantified difference between baseline and time point). The larger the absolute value, the stronger the effect. Cohen's guidelines for social sciences indicate 0.10 as a &quot;small&quot; effect size, 0.30 as a &quot;medium&quot; effect size, and 0.50 as a &quot;large&quot; effect size.</description>

        <population>Effect sizes from baseline reported for 4 subjects with EDSS 6.5 - 7.0. It was postulated that the physical limitations of two subjects with EDSS score of 7.5 presented special challenges to measuring changes in function with the available assessment mechanisms for this clinical population.</population>

        <title>Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS)</title>
        <description>A self-report tool that assesses the perceived impact of fatigue on daily activities. Consists of 21 items selected from the Fatigue Impact Scale. Scored on a 0-84 scale. A higher score indicates a greater impact of fatigue on daily activities. Effect size is reported (quantified difference between baseline and time point). The larger the absolute value, the stronger the effect. Cohen's guidelines for social sciences indicate 0.10 as a &quot;small&quot; effect size, 0.30 as a &quot;medium&quot; effect size, and 0.50 as a &quot;large&quot; effect size.</description>

        <description>The GMFM a standardized observational instrument that measures change in gross motor function. Subscales include lying &amp; rolling; sitting; crawling &amp; kneeling; standing; and walking, running &amp; jumping. For the complete test, the raw scores are converted to a 0-100 scale, with higher scores indicating greater functional mobility. The items that we used were scored on a 0-3 scale and changes reported in percent improvement. Performance-based and tested in participants who possessed the ability to perform the assessment. Effect size is reported (quantified difference between baseline and time point). The larger the absolute value, the stronger the effect. Cohen's guidelines for social sciences indicate 0.10 as a &quot;small&quot; effect size, 0.30 as a &quot;medium&quot; effect size, and 0.50 as a &quot;large&quot; effect size.</description>

          <population>The Slump Test was ultimately not used because the investigators decided to use the TIS instead. The TIS was realized to be the more appropriate assessment of the two, and the investigators wanted to avoid both data redundancy and test fatigue</population>

        <description>An 8 item assessment that quantifies the ability to perform transfers. It has been validated in persons with stroke and a mixed neurologic population (43% MS). Score is a 0-40 scale. A higher score indicates higher function. Performance-based and tested in participants who possessed the ability to perform the assessment. Effect size is reported (quantified difference between baseline and time point). The larger the absolute value, the stronger the effect. Cohen's guidelines for social sciences indicate 0.10 as a &quot;small&quot; effect size, 0.30 as a &quot;medium&quot; effect size, and 0.50 as a &quot;large&quot; effect size.</description>
