  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to improve the health of African-American adults who have poorly
      controlled asthma. The study compares a home-based exposure reduction and asthma control
      intervention to enhanced in-clinic care that includes a standard clinical appointment as well
      as information from a detailed exposure history, asthma education, assessment for allergies,
      and a customized asthma self-management plan developed using motivational interviewing. The
      interventional group receives enhanced in-clinic care, as well as a customized home-based
      environmental exposure assessment and multicomponent exposure reduction and asthma control
      intervention (five home visits over approximately 12 months).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study hypothesis is that the addition of a holistic, home-based environmental exposure
      reduction and asthma control intervention to enhanced in-clinic care will result in
      statistically significant improvements in key measures of health and quality of life among
      Houston-area African-American adults with poorly controlled asthma.

      This is a pragmatic randomized controlled clinical trial that compares the effectiveness of a
      customized, holistic, patient-centered, home-based environmental intervention for improving
      asthma control (the &quot;intervention&quot;) with enhanced clinic-based care. Both arms receive
      identical in-clinic care, including collected self-report information from detailed health
      and exposure questionnaires, asthma education, assessment for allergies, and a customized
      asthma self-management plan developed using motivational interviewing. The intent of the
      study is to assess-real-life effectiveness of a home-based intervention in African-American
      adults with poorly controlled asthma.

    <measure>Change in Asthma Control Test (ACT) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline (enrollment) and exit (approximately 12 mo after enrollment)</time_frame>
    <description>Self report. The ACT is a validated 5-question scale assessing asthma control over the previous four weeks. Each question has five possible responses, from 1 (worst) to 5 (best). The total score ranges from 5 (worst control) to 25 (best control). In general, a total score of 19 or less suggests poor control.</description>

    <measure>Change in Juniper Mini Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire Score (MiniAQLQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline (enrollment) and exit (approximately 12 mo after enrollment)</time_frame>
    <description>Self report. A validated 15-item questionnaire, with each question having seven possible answers score from 1 (worst) to 7 (best). Minimum total score is 15 (worst asthma quality of life). Maximum total score is 105 (best asthma quality of life). By design, an individual's score is reported as the mean (total score/15). Thus the possible mean reported score ranges from 1 (worst asthma quality of life) to 7 (best asthma quality of life).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Emergency Department (ED) Visits for Asthma</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline (enrollment) and exit (approximately 12 mo after enrollment)</time_frame>
    <description>Self report. The healthcare utilization questions were from the validated CDC-BRFSS Asthma Survey. For this outcome measure, we used patient responses to a question that asked &quot;During the past 12 months, how many times to you visit an emergency room of urgent care center because of your asthma?&quot;. We collected this information for the 12 months preceding their baseline and exit clinic visits. A higher number of visits suggests poorer asthma control.</description>

This information is delivered to participants at clinic and/or at home visits as appropriate. Laboratory results may be mailed as well. Aggregate data were made available to participants at a regional Town Hall 5/1/2018 and by mail as requested at exit by participants. Aggregate and/or de-identified data were and are being made available to the Patient / Stakeholder Advisory Board and to researchers through presentations, websites, publications and data sharing arrangements.

    <ipd_time_frame>The study protocol and ICF have been shared and are available on request. At the aggregate level, the initial findings of the pragmatic clinical trial were made available to our Patient/Stakeholder Advisory Panel at the February 12, 2018 meeting of the panel; at a regional Town Hall on asthma on May 1, 2018; and to participants who requested results by mail in November 2018. The Draft Final Research Report was submitted to PCORI in September 2018 and is undergoing external peer review. Two manuscripts--on methods and initial results--are being finalized for journal submission. The SAP and analytic code are currently undergoing refinement as we begin our secondary analyses and should be available in 2019.</ipd_time_frame>
    <ipd_access_criteria>Access criteria are based on protection of individual participant data as described in the protocol and ICF. Aggregate and de-identified data will be made available electronically, in the Rice University Kinder Urban Data Base Platform, and in presentations and manuscripts.</ipd_access_criteria>

          <description>The ACT is a validated 5-question scale assessing asthma control over the previous four weeks. Each question has five possible responses, from 1 (worst) to 5 (best). The total score ranges from 5 (worst control) to 25 (best control). In general, a total score of 19 or less suggests poor control.</description>
          <population>One participant consented and withdrew before any baseline characteristics (aside from age, gender and race) were collected. A second participant chose not to answer all five questions.</population>

          <title>Juniper Mini Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire</title>
          <description>Self report. A validated 15-item questionnaire, with each question having seven possible answers score from 1 (worst) to 7 (best). Minimum total score is 15 (worst asthma quality of life). Maximum total score is 105 (best asthma quality of life). By design, an individual's score is reported as the mean (total score/15). Thus the possible mean reported score ranges from 1 (worst asthma quality of life) to 7 (best asthma quality of life).</description>
          <population>In the enhanced clinical care (&quot;control&quot;) group, one person withdrew immediately after consent, and two individuals chose not to answer one of the 15 questions. In the home-visit (&quot;intervention&quot;) group, three individuals chose not to answer one question. Interpolation (inserted worst answer) was used in some of the analyses.</population>

          <description>Total IgE is a measure of the immunoglobulin E antibody in the blood, and an estimate of allergic status. The laboratory lowest level of detection was 18 kU/L. Guidelines vary and must be assessed in conjunction with clinical presentation and allergen-specific testing, but for this population we consider a Total IgE &gt; 100 kU/L to be of clinical relevance.</description>
          <population>One participant withdrew immediately after consent, permission for a blood draw was not given by two patients, and blood could not be obtained or was insufficient for analysis in four patients.</population>

        <title>Change in Asthma Control Test (ACT) Score</title>
        <description>Self report. The ACT is a validated 5-question scale assessing asthma control over the previous four weeks. Each question has five possible responses, from 1 (worst) to 5 (best). The total score ranges from 5 (worst control) to 25 (best control). In general, a total score of 19 or less suggests poor control.</description>

        <population>At baseline, one individual in each group chose not to answer all five ACT questions; therefore a total ACT score could not be calculated for those two individuals (missing data are addressed in the analyses). At exit, among those who completed the study, one person in the enhanced in-clinic group chose not to answer all five ACT questions.</population>
