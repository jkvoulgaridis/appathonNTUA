  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of pembrolizumab (MK-3475, KEYTRUDA®) versus standard treatment
      (methotrexate, docetaxel or cetuximab) for the treatment of recurrent or metastatic head and
      neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC). Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either
      pembrolizumab or Investigator's choice of standard treatment. The primary study hypothesis is
      that pembrolizumab treatment prolongs Overall Survival (OS) when compared to standard
      treatment.

    <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a study treatment and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the study treatment or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a pre-existing condition that is temporally associated with the use of study treatment, is also an AE.

        <title>Progression-free Survival (PFS) Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1 for All Participants</title>
        <description>PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first documented disease progression per RECIST 1.1 based on blinded central imaging vendor review or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Per RECIST 1.1, progressive disease was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also have demonstrated an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. Note: The appearance of one or more new lesions was also considered progression. The PFS per RECIST 1.1 for all participants is presented. These efficacy results are after complete acquisition of all outstanding survival data using a 15-May-2017 data cutoff date with a database update date of 13-Oct-2017.</description>

        <title>PFS Per RECIST 1.1 in Participants With PD-L1 ≥1% CPS</title>
        <description>PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first documented disease progression per RECIST 1.1 based on blinded central imaging vendor review or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Per RECIST 1.1, progressive disease was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also have demonstrated an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. Note: The appearance of one or more new lesions was also considered progression. The PFS per RECIST 1.1 for all participants with PD-L1 expression ≥1% CPS is presented. These efficacy results are after complete acquisition of all outstanding survival data using a 15-May-2017 data cutoff date with a database update date of 13-Oct-2017.</description>

        <title>DOR Per RECIST 1.1 in Participants With PD-L1 ≥1% CPS</title>
        <description>For participants who demonstrated a confirmed CR or PR per RECIST 1.1, DOR was defined as the time from first documented evidence of a confirmed CR or PR per RECIST 1.1 until disease progression per RECIST 1.1 or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Per RECIST 1.1, progressive disease was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also have demonstrated an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. Note: The appearance of one or more new lesions was also considered progression. DOR assessments were based on blinded central imaging vendor review with confirmation. The DOR per RECIST 1.1 for all participants with PD-L1 ≥1% CPS who experienced a confirmed CR or PR is presented. These efficacy results are after complete acquisition of all outstanding survival data using a 15-May-2017 data cutoff date with a database update date of 13-Oct-2017.</description>

        <title>PFS Per Modified RECIST 1.1 in Participants With PD-L1 ≥1% CPS</title>
        <description>PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progressive disease (PD) per RECIST 1.1 based on blinded central imaging vendor review or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Per RECIST 1.1, PD was defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also have demonstrated an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. Note: The appearance of one or more new lesions was also considered PD. Modified RECIST is similar to RECIST 1.1 with the exception that a confirmation assessment of PD (&gt;4 weeks after the initial PD) is required for participants who remain on treatment following a documented PD per RECIST 1.1. The PFS per modified RECIST for all participants with PD-L1 ≥1% CPS is presented. These efficacy results are after complete acquisition of all outstanding survival data using a 15-May-2017 data cutoff date with a database update date of 13-Oct-2017.</description>
