  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Consenting adults will be interviewed for demographic and medical information, and then will
      be asked to provide two expectorated sputum specimens. In the study laboratory, sputa will be
      tested using conventional and investigational diagnostic tests for tuberculosis.

      -  For each of isoniazid, ofloxacin, moxifloxacin, amikacin, and kanamycin: sensitivity and

           phenotypic drug susceptibility testing as the reference comparator

        -  Proportion of participants with drug resistant tuberculosis, by drug resistance pattern
           and by tuberculosis categorization (new case or not new case)
