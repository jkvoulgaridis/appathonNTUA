      Background:

      - The immune system helps the body fight infection and disease. People with immune system
      problems can get infections, blood disorders, and other health problems. Researchers want to
      learn more about the immune system, like what causes it to not work properly.

      Objectives:

      - To evaluate people with certain types of immune system disorders.

      Eligibility:

      - Adults and children with an immune disorder or symptoms of one, and their relatives. Some
      disorders are not included in this study.

      Design:

        -  Researchers will review participants medical records.

        -  Participants may mail in a blood or saliva sample, or be evaluated at the clinic. At the
           clinic, they may have a medical history, physical exam, blood tests, and imaging scans
           (with dye given through a needle in the arm). They may have genetic testing done on a
           sample of blood, saliva, hair, or nail clipping.

        -  Participants may choose to have a skin biopsy. Up to 2 skin samples will be taken from
           their arm, back, or other area. A biopsy punch is inserted into the skin and rotated. A
           small circle of skin is removed.

        -  Participants 10 and older may also choose to have leukapheresis. Blood is taken through
           a needle in one arm. It passes through a machine that separates the white blood cells.
           The rest of the blood is returned by needle in the other arm.

        -  Researchers may recommend medicines, but no treatments are being studied.

        -  Participants may be invited to return for visits over several years. At those visits,
           they may repeat some or all of the above tests. Or they may mail in blood or other
           samples. They may also send medical records.

      This study is designed to evaluate patients with suspected or identified novel immune
      disorders, with a focus on abnormal immune homeostasis potentially due to defects in
      activation or apoptosis. Blood relatives of enrolled patients will also be evaluated.
      Affected individuals may have Mendelian gene defects involving mostly single or occasionally
      multiple genes. These patients may have signs and symptoms suggestive of clinically
      significant lymphocyte homeostasis disorders. However, some selected patients manifesting
      autoimmunity, autoinflammatory conditions, end-organ dysfunction, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)
      and cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia, frequent infections, allergies, or laboratory
      abnormalities consistent with immune defects of research interest to the Laboratory of
      Clinical Immunology and Microbiology may also be studied under this protocol at the
      discretion of the Investigators.

      This protocol will facilitate the discovery of the role of genetic pathways and modes of
      inheritance associated with pathophysiological events leading to immune system dysregulation,
      particularly disorders of immune cell homeostasis. A better understanding of the genetics as
      well as biochemical and molecular basis of complex immune disorders could also lead to the
      development of novel therapeutic targets and approaches.

      Patients will undergo clinical evaluations that include history and physical examinations,
      blood sampling, radiological exams, genetic testing, skin biopsy, and other medically
      indicated procedures. Genetically related family members of patients may also be screened and
      evaluated for clinical, in vitro, and genetic correlates of immune abnormalities. Patients
      and blood relatives unable or too sick to travel to NIH Clinical Center (CC) may be evaluated
      through mail-in blood samples. Patients and their relatives will remain enrolled on this
      study to observe the natural history of the disorder and obtain blood, saliva, skin biopsy,
      or other specimens at periodic intervals. This study aims to enroll up to a total of 500
      patients and their family members.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        The following inclusion criteria apply to all subjects:

          -  Patient and relatives aged 0-99 years old to include women who are pregnant or
             breastfeeding. Only patients &gt;2 years of age, in stable clinical status and meeting
             the weight requirement of the NIH CC will be physically evaluated at the NIH CC.

          -  Willingness to allow storage of blood, saliva, and other tissue specimens for future
             use in medical research.

          -  Willingness to participate in genetic testing and allow sharing of genetic information
             in secure databases like dbGAP. These tests may include, but are not limited to, whole
             exome and whole genome sequencing.

          -  Priority may be given to individuals with a family history (if readily available)
             suggestive of multiple affected members with a constellation of signs and symptoms
             suggestive of immune dysfunction among first- or second-degree relatives.

          -  Eligibility of special populations

               -  A. NIH employees are eligible

               -  B. Women who are pregnant or breast feeding are eligible to enroll as probands
                  Pregnant relatives are also eligible for inclusion as

        they can provide important controls, genetic reference and historic clinical information.
        This protocol is not actively seeking women who are pregnant.

        --C. Pediatric populations are eligible, with restrictions, in order to learn about the
        natural history of the immune disorders under investigation and to provide diagnostic work
        up for their ongoing clinical care. Healthy pediatric relatives can provide important
        diagnostic and genetic reference for affected patients.

        -Pediatric populations are eligible, with restrictions, in order to learn about the natural
        history of the immune disorders under investigation and to provide diagnostic work up for
        their ongoing clinical care. Healthy pediatric relatives can provide important diagnostic
        and genetic reference for affected patients.

        Patients must have:

          -  An identified genetic basis for an immune disorder or signs and symptoms suggestive of
             clinically significant immune dysregulation and/or immunodeficiency manifesting with
             features including but not limited to autoimmunity, autoinflammatory conditions,
             lymphadenopathy, end-organ dysfunction, unusual infections, allergies, or laboratory
             abnormalities consistent with immune dysregulation.

          -  A primary physician outside of the NIH and will be required to submit a letter or
             clinical summary from their referring physician that documents their relevant health
             history.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients will be excluded for any of the following:

          -  Known genetic disorders that are already well characterized, such as severe combined
             immunodeficiency (SCID), chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), etc., and those in which
             we do not have an enduring research interest in the LCIM.

          -  Patients with unknown immune disorders will be excluded if they have received
             chemotherapy within the last 6 months for a malignancy or have infections such as HIV
             or mycobacterial infections.

          -  Severe clinical illness requiring highly specialized teams and institutions. The NIH
             may not be able to provide appropriate care for certain referred cases. The Principal
             Investigator (PI) may determine that the patient is eligible for enrollment but
             ineligible for admission to the Clinical Center. Patients and relatives with certain
             obstetric issues may pose a safety risk for travel and evaluation here. Eligibility
             for this group will be determined on a case by case basis by the PI.

          -  Patients with well-defined autoimmune conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus
             (SLE), Hashimoto s thyroiditis, Addison s disease, Graves disease, sarcoidosis and
             rheumatoid arthritis, among others.

        Blood relatives will be excluded for the following:

        -Any condition which in the opinion of the investigator may interfere with evaluation of an
        immune system abnormality that is the subject of study under this protocol.
