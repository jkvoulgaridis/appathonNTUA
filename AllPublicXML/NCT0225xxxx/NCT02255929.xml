  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine effects (good and bad) of gamma knife radiosurgery
      for essential tremor. The gamma knife places a small lesion in the brain to suppress tremors.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done because although multiple studies evaluating gamma knife for
      essential tremor show good results, few studies evaluating patients prospectively have been
      done. Prior studies have looked at patient outcomes following treatment - also known as
      retrospective studies. In this study, data collection will initiate before treatment, to
      obtain consistent baseline evaluations from all study participants undergoing the gamma knife
      treatment and at specific intervals following treatment.
