  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite decades of research, affective disorders are prevalent and associated with
      significant morbidity and mortality. Unraveling the pathophysiology of affective disorders
      has been uniquely challenging because depressive syndromes are heterogeneous and have diverse
      etiologies. Thus, past studies aimed at identifying neural and genetic biomarkers that would
      improve the prediction of susceptibility, course of illness, and treatment response have
      yielded inconsistent results. The investigator proposes to address this problem by studying
      perimenopausal major depressive disorder (MDD), a depression subtype with a specific
      endocrine trigger (i.e., ovarian hormone withdrawal). Evidence supporting ovarian hormone
      withdrawal as a trigger for affective dysfunction in perimenopausal MDD includes the
      following: perimenopausal women show a temporal association between ovarian hormone
      withdrawal and the onset of mood symptoms; treatment with estrogen reduces mood symptoms; and
      blinded estradiol withdrawal re-precipitates depression in women with a history of
      perimenopausal MDD (manuscript in preparation). Focusing on perimenopausal MDD, a more
      homogeneous subtype with a specific endocrine trigger, will increase the likelihood of
      identifying meaningful neurobiological markers.One of the most powerful tools for
      understanding the neural mediators of MDD is brain imaging. Prior research suggests that the
      frontostriatal reward system is regulated by estradiol and implicated in MDD. However, neural
      mechanisms of perimenopausal MDD have never been studied. We will assess the neural reward
      system in perimenopausal women with and without MDD using functional magnetic resonance
      imaging (fMRI) at baseline and following estradiol treatment. The central hypothesis is that
      the neural reward system is hypoactive in perimenopausal MDD, and the antidepressant effects
      of a three-week transdermal estradiol intervention will be mediated by increased activity in
      the neural reward system, assessed using fMRI. The investigator will test the hypothesis by
      executing the following aims:

      Aim 1: To measure the frontostriatal response to reward in perimenopausal MDD and test the
      effects of estradiol on neural activation in perimenopausal women. The investigator will use
      fMRI at baseline and following estradiol treatment in women with and without MDD to probe
      frontostriatal reward circuitry.

      Aim 2: To quantify motivated behavior at baseline and following estradiol administration in
      perimenopausal women with and without MDD. Motivated behavior will be operationally defined
      as the response latency to reward versus non-reward during the fMRI reward task.

      Aim 3: To measure the psychological correlates of the frontostriatal response to reward in
      women with perimenopausal MDD at baseline and following estradiol administration. Depressive
      symptoms will be assessed at baseline and following estradiol administration.

      The results will provide critical information about the neuroendocrine pathophysiology of
      perimenopausal depression and may subsequently contribute to the development of novel
      pharmacologic interventions.

    <time_frame>Pre-treatment (visit 3)</time_frame>
    <description>Caudate reactivity to reward during the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task was measured between the two groups. During MID the task, participants respond to &quot;win&quot; trials by pressing a button on a button box in the MRI as quickly as possible when the see a target. Reactivity is measured by examining participant's change in blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) (i.e., measurement of oxygen level that is carried to neurons by red blood cells since areas of the brain that are thought to be more &quot;active&quot; or involved in certain tasks require more oxygen) in response to a stimulus of interest (win trials) versus non-stimulus (non-win trials). Percent signal change in BOLD activation between monetary reward versus non-reward is the outcome of interest. Percent signal change is then compared between the two groups at pre-treatment.</description>

    <description>The Dysphoria Scale of the Inventory of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms (IDAS) will be used to assess the change in depressive symptom severity. The IDAS Dysphoria Scale consists of 10 items and uses a 5-point Likert-type scale, ranging from 1 to 5 with 1 indicating &quot;not at all&quot; and 5 indicating &quot;extremely&quot;. As such, the range of possible scores is 10 to 50. The Dysphoria scale includes items assessing feelings of depression, inadequacy, psychomotor agitation, guilt, discouragement, anhedonia, poor concentration, difficulty with decision-making, psychomotor retardation, and worry. Higher scores indicate worse depression symptoms.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Perimenopause Status: We will employ the Stages of Reproductive Aging Workshop (STRAW)
             criteria70 to confirm perimenopausal status. The stages are primarily based on the
             characteristics of the menstrual cycle and secondarily on follicle stimulating hormone
             (FSH) levels. The anchor for the staging system is the final menstrual period (FMP).
             We will enroll women who have ≥ 2 skipped cycles and an interval of amenorrhea ≥ 60
             days, consistent with the late menopause transition (stage -1), and who demonstrate an
             FSH level &gt; 25 IU/mL. Because extremes of body weight (BMI &lt; 18 or &gt; 30 kg/m2) or a
             history of chronic menstrual cycle irregularity can contribute to inaccurate
             reproductive staging, these will serve as additional exclusion criteria;

          2. MDD Group Eligibility Criterion: current diagnosis of MDD with an onset associated
             with menstrual cycle irregularity, and no history of psychiatric illness during the 2
             years before the onset of the current depressive episode as determined by the
             Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-4-Text
             Revision) for Axis I Disorders (SCID);

          3. Control Group Eligibility Criterion: absence of any past or present psychiatric
             disorder as assessed by the SCID.

          1. current medication use (i.e., psychotropics, anti-hypertensives, statins, hormonal
             preparations, or frequent use of anti-inflammatory agents (&gt; 10 times/month)). Women
             will be allowed to enroll who take medications without known mood effects (e.g. stable
             thyroid hormone replacement and occasional (&lt; 5 times/month) use of Ambien)*;

          2. pregnant, breastfeeding or trying to conceive;

          3. FMP more than 12 months prior to enrollment;

          4. history of undiagnosed vaginal bleeding;

          5. undiagnosed enlargement of the ovaries;

          6. polycystic ovary syndrome;

          7. history of breast or ovarian cancer;

          8. first degree relative with ovarian cancer;

          9. first degree relative with premenopausal onset or bilateral breast cancer;

         10. 2+ first degree relatives with breast cancer (regardless of onset);

         11. 3+ relatives with postmenopausal breast cancer;

         12. abnormal finding in a provider breast exam and/or mammogram;

         13. known carrier of BRCA1 or 2 mutation;

         20. recurrent migraine headaches that are preceded by aura;

         21. gallbladder or pancreatic disease**;

         22. heart or kidney disease**;

         23. liver disease;

         24. cerebrovascular disease (stroke);

         25. first degree relative with history of heart attack or stroke;

         26. current cigarette smoking;

         27. current suicidal ideation or psychosis;

         28. past suicide attempts or psychotic episodes requiring hospitalization;

         29. chronic depression (i.e., episode(s) lasting 3+ years);

         30. recurrent depression (i.e., more than 1 prior episode, not including episodes with
             postpartum onset)

         31. depressive episode(s) within 2 years of enrollment;

         32. self-reported claustrophobia

         33. peanut allergy

               -  all reported prescription medications will be reviewed and cleared by a study
                  physician prior to a participant's enrollment; **participants will be given the
                  opportunity to describe these conditions in the online screening survey. Reported
                  conditions that are acute in nature and/or benign will be reviewed by a study
                  physician and exclusions will be decided case-by-case. All chronic conditions
                  will be exclusionary.

        <title>Caudate Signal Intensity in Response to Reward During the MID fMRI Task at Pre-treatment</title>
        <description>Caudate reactivity to reward during the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task was measured between the two groups. During MID the task, participants respond to &quot;win&quot; trials by pressing a button on a button box in the MRI as quickly as possible when the see a target. Reactivity is measured by examining participant's change in blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) (i.e., measurement of oxygen level that is carried to neurons by red blood cells since areas of the brain that are thought to be more &quot;active&quot; or involved in certain tasks require more oxygen) in response to a stimulus of interest (win trials) versus non-stimulus (non-win trials). Percent signal change in BOLD activation between monetary reward versus non-reward is the outcome of interest. Percent signal change is then compared between the two groups at pre-treatment.</description>

        <title>Caudate Signal Intensity in Response to Reward During the MID fMRI Task Following Estradiol Treatment.</title>
        <description>Caudate reactivity to reward during the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task was measured between the two groups. During MID the task, participants respond to &quot;win&quot; trials by pressing a button on a button box in the MRI as quickly as possible when the see a target. Reactivity is measured by examining participant's change in blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) (i.e., measurement of oxygen level that is carried to neurons by red blood cells since areas of the brain that are thought to be more &quot;active&quot; or involved in certain tasks require more oxygen) in response to a stimulus of interest (win trials) versus non-stimulus (non-win trials). Percent signal change in BOLD activation between monetary reward versus non-reward is the outcome of interest. Percent signal change is then compared between the two groups following treatment.</description>

        <title>Change in Inventory of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms (IDAS) Dysphoria Scores</title>
        <description>The Dysphoria Scale of the Inventory of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms (IDAS) will be used to assess the change in depressive symptom severity. The IDAS Dysphoria Scale consists of 10 items and uses a 5-point Likert-type scale, ranging from 1 to 5 with 1 indicating &quot;not at all&quot; and 5 indicating &quot;extremely&quot;. As such, the range of possible scores is 10 to 50. The Dysphoria scale includes items assessing feelings of depression, inadequacy, psychomotor agitation, guilt, discouragement, anhedonia, poor concentration, difficulty with decision-making, psychomotor retardation, and worry. Higher scores indicate worse depression symptoms.</description>
