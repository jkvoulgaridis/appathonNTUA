  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the effect of multi-dose administration of itraconazole on the
      single-dose pharmacokinetics (PK) of alisertib.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called alisertib. Alisertib is being tested in adult
      participants with advanced solid tumors or relapsed refactory lymphoma. The study will look
      at the effect of the pharmacokinetics (how the drug moves through the body) of alisertib in
      the presence and absence of itraconazole.

      This is an open label study. Participants will receive:

        -  Alisertib tablets 30 mg in Part A and 50 mg in Part B

        -  Itraconazole oral solution 200 mg in Part A

      Participation in Part A is approximately 25 days. Part B participation is repeating 21-day
      cycles. The maximum duration of treatment with alisertib will be 12 months (approximately 16
      cycles) unless it is determined by the investigator, with agreement by the sponsor, that a
      participant would derive clinical benefit from continued treatment beyond 12 months.

      This multi-center study will take place in the United States.

    <description>An AE is considered any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease associated with the use of the study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug. Preexisting conditions that worsened during the study were reported as adverse events. A SAE is any experience that suggests a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect or precaution that: results in death, is life-threatening, required in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is medically significant. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</title>
        <description>An AE is considered any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease associated with the use of the study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug. Preexisting conditions that worsened during the study were reported as adverse events. A SAE is any experience that suggests a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect or precaution that: results in death, is life-threatening, required in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is medically significant. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug.</description>
