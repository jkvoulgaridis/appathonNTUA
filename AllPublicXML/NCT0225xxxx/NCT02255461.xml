    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of palbociclib isethionate in
      treating younger patients with central nervous system tumors that have grown, come back, or
      not responded to treatment. Palbociclib isethionate may stop the growth of tumor cells by
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/phase II recommended dose and describe
      toxicities related to PD-0332991 (palbociclib isethionate) in children with retinoblastoma
      protein 1 (Rb1) positive recurrent, progressive or refractory primary central nervous system
      (CNS) tumors.

      II. To determine plasma pharmacokinetics of PD-0332991 in children with Rb1positive
      recurrent, progressive or refractory primary CNS tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To record preliminary evidence of efficacy of PD-0332991 in children with recurrent CNS
      tumors.

      II. To evaluate cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)4/6, cyclin D1-3, Ink4a-ARF copy-number
      variations in available tumor tissue by array comparative, genomic hybridization (aCGH).

      III. To explore the potential relationships between the pharmacokinetics of PD-0332991 and
      pharmacodynamic response (e.g. percentage change in absolute neutrophil count [ANC], platelet
      counts).

      IV. To explore the pharmacogenetic polymorphisms in PD-0332991 metabolizing enzymes and
      transporters and relate these polymorphisms to PD-0332991 pharmacokinetics.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive palbociclib isethionate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Treatment
      repeats every 4 weeks for 26 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.

    <description>Rolling-6 design was used to estimate MTD. The MTD was empirically defined as the highest dose level at which six patients were treated with at most one patient experiencing a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and the next higher dose level had been determined to be too toxic. Stratum I consisted of less-heavily pre-treated patients.</description>

    <description>DLTs were defined as any of the following adverse events that were at least possibly related to palbociclib that occurred during the first 4 weeks of therapy regardless of expectedness. Hematologic DLTs included grade 3 neutropenia with fever and sepsis, grade 3 thrombocytopenia and/or requiring a platelet transfusion on 2 separate days within a 7-day period, or any grade 4 hematologic toxicity except lymphopenia. Non-hematologic DLTs included any grade 4 non-hematologic toxicity, any grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity with some exceptions (e.g., nausea and vomiting of &lt; 5 days; diarrhea and/or electrolyte disturbances which have not been maximally treated; AST/ALT elevation that returns to levels meeting eligibility criteria within 7 days of study drug interruption and does not recur upon restarting drug), or any grade 2 non-hematologic toxicity that persists for &gt; 7 days and is considered medically significant or sufficiently intolerable by patients requires treatment interruption.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Patients between 4 and 21 years of age with histologically confirmed retinoblastoma protein (Rb1) positive, primary recurrent, progressive, or refractory central nervous system tumors were enrolled at Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium member institutions. The first patient was enrolled on 12/8/2014 and the last patient was enrolled on 10/10/2018.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>All 35 eligible patients enrolled were included. The ‘Completed’ row included patients who completed all protocol therapy or who experienced a protocol endpoint which took them off therapy. These included dose limiting toxicities and progression/relapse events. Adverse events not related to study agent were included in the ‘Not Completed’ row.</pre_assignment_details>
