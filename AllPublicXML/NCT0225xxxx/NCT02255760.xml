      This is a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose escalation study
      evaluating the safety and tolerability of a single ascending IV dose of MEDI3902 in healthy
      adult subjects 18 to 60 years of age. Approximately 40 subjects will be enrolled across 4
      fixed dose cohorts at 1 study site. This study will last approximately 90 days, constituting
      a screening period of up to 28 days, 1 day of investigational product administration, and a
      60 day safety follow up period.

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any unfavourable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug. A TEAE is defined as events present at baseline that worsened in intensity after administration of study drug or events absent at baseline that emerged after administration of study drug.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Serious Adverse Events (TESAEs) and Treatment Emergent Adverse Events of Special Interest (TEAESIs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to Day 61</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence attributed to study drug in a participant who received investigational product. TESAE was an event resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly that occurred after the initial receipt of the study drug. An AESI was one of scientific and medical interest specific to understanding of study product and may have required close monitoring and rapid communication by investigator to the sponsor. TEAESIs were collected from the time of dosing through Day 61 after the last dose of study drug and included anaphylaxis, other serious allergic reactions, infusion-related reactions, hepatic function abnormalities and immune complex disease.</description>

        <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence attributed to study drug in a participant who received investigational product. TESAE was an event resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly that occurred after the initial receipt of the study drug. An AESI was one of scientific and medical interest specific to understanding of study product and may have required close monitoring and rapid communication by investigator to the sponsor. TEAESIs were collected from the time of dosing through Day 61 after the last dose of study drug and included anaphylaxis, other serious allergic reactions, infusion-related reactions, hepatic function abnormalities and immune complex disease.</description>

          <title>MEDI3902 Serum Clearance (CL) of MEDI3902</title>
          <description>Clearance of a drug is a measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. The PK parameter CL was estimated based on the serum concentrations of MEDI3902. Non-compartmental PK data analysis was performed to estimate the serum PK parameters of MEDI3902.</description>
