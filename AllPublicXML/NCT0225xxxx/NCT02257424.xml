        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must be at least 18 years of age.

          -  Patients must have histologically confirmed melanoma unresectable Stage III or Stage
             IV positive for BRAF V600E, V600K, V600R or V600D by a CLIA approved assay.

          -  Patients must have an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1.

          -  Patients must have adequate baseline organ function as determined by table 2.

        Table 2. Definitions for adequate baseline organ function

        Laboratory Values

        Hematologic:

          -  ANC (absolute neutrophil count) ≥1.2 × 109/L

          -  Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL

          -  Platelet count ≥100 x 109/L

          -  PT/INR and PTT ≤ 1.3 x ULN (PT = prothrombin time; INR = international normalized
             ratio; PTT = partial thromboplastin time; ULN = upper limit of normal)

        Hepatic

          -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN

          -  AST (aspartate aminotransferase) and ALT (alanine transaminase) ≤ 2.5 x ULN

        Renal -- Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL

        Cardiac

        -- Left Ventricular Ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ LLN (lower limit of normal) by ECHO

        Subjects receiving anticoagulation treatment may be allowed to participate with INR
        established within the therapeutic range prior to randomization.

        If serum creatinine is &gt; 1.5 mg/dL, calculate creatinine clearance using standard
        Cockcroft-Gault formula. Creatinine clearance must be ≥ 50 mL/min to be eligible.

        Except subjects with known Gilbert's syndrome. ECHO scans must be used throughout the study
        when indicated

          -  Patients must be able to provide written informed consent.

          -  Negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to commencement of dosing in
             premenopausal women. Women of non-childbearing potential may be included without serum
             pregnancy test if they are either surgically sterile or have been postmenopausal for ≥
             1 year. Women must use an effective method of contraception from 14 days prior to
             randomization, throughout the treatment period, and for at least 6 months after the
             last dose of study treatment as directed by their physician. Effective methods of
             contraception are defined as those which result in a low failure rate (i.e., less than
             1% per year) when used consistently and correctly (for example implants, injectables,
             or intra-uterine devices). At the discretion of the investigator, acceptable methods
             of contraception may include total abstinence in cases where the lifestyle of the
             patient ensures compliance. (Periodic abstinence [e.g., calendar, ovulation,
             symptothermal, postovulation methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
             contraception.) Hormonal-based methods (e.g., oral contraceptives) are NOT permitted
             as contraception due to potential drug-drug interactions with dabrafenib.

          -  Patients with brain metastases treated with whole brain radiation that have been
             stable for 2 months are eligible; patients with brain metastases treated with gamma
             knife or surgery are allowed to participate after 2 weeks have elapsed since their
             procedure. Subjects are excluded if they have leptomeningeal or metastases causing
             spinal cord compression that are symptomatic or untreated or not stable for ≥3 months
             (must be documented by imaging) or requiring corticosteroids. Subjects on a stable
             dose of corticosteroids &gt;1 month or who have been off of corticosteroids for at least
             1 week can be enrolled with approval of the medical monitor

             or chemotherapy at least 4 weeks prior to entering the study and oral targeted therapy
             at least 2 weeks prior to entering the study. Patients must not receive any other
             investigational anticancer therapy during the period on study or the four weeks prior
             to entry.

          -  All prior anti-cancer treatment-related toxicities (except alopecia and laboratory
             values as listed in Eligibility Criteria #4) must be Grade 1 according to the Common
             Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4 (CTCAE version 4.03, 2009) at the
             time of starting treatment. Patients that are asymptomatic on low dose maintenance
             hormone replacement delivered at a stable dose for prior toxicities are eligible.

          -  Patient much have measurable disease as defined by RECIST 1.1.

          -  Patients must be able to swallow and retain oral medication and must not have any
             clinically significant gastrointestinal abnormalities that may alter absorption such
             as malabsorption syndrome or major resection of the stomach or bowels.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with known serious concurrent infection or medical illness, including
