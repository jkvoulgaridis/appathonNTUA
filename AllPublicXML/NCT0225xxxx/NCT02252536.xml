    <time_frame>Weeks 22-25</time_frame>
    <description>Timeline Follow Back data is used to calculate the % of participants that decrease at least 1-level WHO drinking risk category. The WHO has developed a drinking risk categorical scale that can be used in a responder analysis approach to assess clinically relevant decreases in alcohol consumption (Aubin et al-2015). The WHO 1- and 2-level decrease endpoints are the percentage of subjects experiencing at least 1- and 2-level decrease in WHO levels of alcohol consumption, respectively, from the level at baseline (the period including the 28 days before screening) to the level during the last 4 weeks of the maintenance phase (Study Weeks 22-25). The WHO levels are as follows:
Males Females Low Risk 1 to 40g 1 to 20g Medium Risk 41 to 60g 21 to 40g High Risk 61 to 100g 41 to 60g Very High Risk 101+g 61+g</description>

    <measure>Alcohol Craving Score [Alcohol Craving Scale - Short Form (ACQ-SR-R)]</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 24 and 26</time_frame>
    <description>The ACQ-SR-R contains 12-items adapted from the 47-item ACQ-NOW developed by Singleton et al (1994) to assess craving for alcohol among alcohol users in the current context (right now). Each item has a 1 to 7 raw score (from strongly disagree to strongly agree). Items 3, 8, and 11 are reverse keyed. A general craving index is derived by summing all items and dividing by 12. Minimum score is 1 and maximum score is 7. Higher scores are indicative of higher craving.
Mixed effects models as stated in Section 9.4.3 of the SAP will be generated for the total score and for the 4 subscales. Covariates for these models will be identified</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Alcohol Related Consequences (ImBIBe) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 24 and 26</time_frame>
    <description>ImBIBe is a 15-item questionnaire in which the subject responds on a 5-point scale (0-4) responses to questions on the consequences of alcohol use. This scale was adapted from the Drinker Inventory of Consequences questionnaire based on FDA recommendations on patient reported outcomes (Miller &amp; Tonigen-1995). The potential range is 0-60. A higher score indicates a worse outcome. The questions are added together. A question that is missing is imputed with the average value of all other questions in the questionnaire.The total score is the sum of the individual item scores.
Mixed effects models as stated in Section 9.4.3 will be generated for the total score. Covariates for these models will be identified</description>

    <measure>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>The PSQI is a 19-item questionnaire assessing the subject's overall sleep experience in the past 30 days (Buysse et al-1989). The lower the overall score, the better the person sleeps. The tool has an adequate internal reliability, validity and consistency for clinical and community samples of the various populations. Range is (0-21); &gt;6 indicative of &quot;poor&quot; sleep quality.</description>

    <measure>Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>The BAI consists of 21 questions about how the subject has been feeling in the last week, expressed as common symptoms of anxiety (such as numbness and tingling, sweating not due to heat, and fear of the worst happening). This inventory was designed to minimize the overlap with depression scales (Beck et al-1988).The BAI has a maximum score of 63. The standardized cutoffs for anxiety severity are: 0-7: minimal level of anxiety 8-15: mild anxiety 16-25: moderate anxiety 26-63: severe anxiety</description>

        <description>Timeline Follow Back data is used to calculate the % of participants that decrease at least 1-level WHO drinking risk category. The WHO has developed a drinking risk categorical scale that can be used in a responder analysis approach to assess clinically relevant decreases in alcohol consumption (Aubin et al-2015). The WHO 1- and 2-level decrease endpoints are the percentage of subjects experiencing at least 1- and 2-level decrease in WHO levels of alcohol consumption, respectively, from the level at baseline (the period including the 28 days before screening) to the level during the last 4 weeks of the maintenance phase (Study Weeks 22-25). The WHO levels are as follows:
Males Females Low Risk 1 to 40g 1 to 20g Medium Risk 41 to 60g 21 to 40g High Risk 61 to 100g 41 to 60g Very High Risk 101+g 61+g</description>

          <description>Timeline Follow Back data is used to calculate the % of participants that decrease at least 1-level WHO drinking risk category. The WHO has developed a drinking risk categorical scale that can be used in a responder analysis approach to assess clinically relevant decreases in alcohol consumption (Aubin et al-2015). The WHO 1- and 2-level decrease endpoints are the percentage of subjects experiencing at least 1- and 2-level decrease in WHO levels of alcohol consumption, respectively, from the level at baseline (the period including the 28 days before screening) to the level during the last 4 weeks of the maintenance phase (Study Weeks 22-25). The WHO levels are as follows:
Males Females Low Risk 1 to 40g 1 to 20g Medium Risk 41 to 60g 21 to 40g High Risk 61 to 100g 41 to 60g Very High Risk 101+g 61+g</description>

Each item has a 1 to 7 raw score (from strongly disagree to strongly agree). Items 3, 8, and 11 are reverse keyed. A general craving index is derived by summing all items and dividing by 12. Minimum score is 1 and maximum score is 7. Higher scores are indicative of higher craving.
Mixed effects models as stated in Section 9.4.3 of the SAP will be generated for the total score and for the 4 subscales. Covariates for these models will be identified</description>

This scale was adapted from the Drinker Inventory of Consequences questionnaire based on FDA recommendations on patient reported outcomes (Miller &amp; Tonigen-1995). The potential range is 0-60. A higher score indicates a worse outcome. The questions are added together. A question that is missing is imputed with the average value of all other questions in the questionnaire.The total score is the sum of the individual item scores.

A question that is missing is imputed with the average value of all other questions in the questionnaire.The total score is the sum of the individual item scores.
Mixed effects models as stated in Section 9.4.3 will be generated for the total score. Covariates for these models will be identified</description>

        <title>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) Score</title>
        <description>The PSQI is a 19-item questionnaire assessing the subject's overall sleep experience in the past 30 days (Buysse et al-1989). The lower the overall score, the better the person sleeps. The tool has an adequate internal reliability, validity and consistency for clinical and community samples of the various populations. Range is (0-21); &gt;6 indicative of &quot;poor&quot; sleep quality.</description>

        <description>The BAI consists of 21 questions about how the subject has been feeling in the last week, expressed as common symptoms of anxiety (such as numbness and tingling, sweating not due to heat, and fear of the worst happening). This inventory was designed to minimize the overlap with depression scales (Beck et al-1988).The BAI has a maximum score of 63. The standardized cutoffs for anxiety severity are: 0-7: minimal level of anxiety 8-15: mild anxiety 16-25: moderate anxiety 26-63: severe anxiety</description>
