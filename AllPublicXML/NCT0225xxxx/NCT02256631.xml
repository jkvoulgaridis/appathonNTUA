      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of three
      monoclonal antibodies, VRC01, VRC01LS, and VRC07-523LS, in HIV-exposed infants who are at
      increased risk of mother-to-child HIV transmission.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      VRC01, VRC01LS, and VRC07-523LS are anti-HIV neutralizing monoclonal antibodies that may help
      prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV. This study will enroll HIV-infected mothers who
      are at increased risk of passing HIV on to their children. The purpose of this study is to
      assess the safety and PK of VRC01, VRC01LS, and VRC07-523LS in HIV-exposed infants.

      This study will enroll mother-infant pairs into five groups. Infants enrolled in Dose Group 1
      and Dose Group 2 will receive a single VRC01 injection less than 72 hours after birth.
      Infants in Dose Group 3 will receive a VRC01 injection less than 5 days after birth. They
      will then receive additional VRC01 injections monthly for at least 6 months and no more than
      18 months while breastfeeding.

      Dose Groups 4 and 5 will each enroll infants into two cohorts: Cohort 1 (non-breastfeeding)
      or Cohort 2 (breastfeeding). Infants in Dose Group 4, Cohort 1 will receive a single VRC01LS
      injection less than 72 hours after birth. Infants in Dose Group 4, Cohort 2 will receive an
      initial VRC01LS injection no longer than 5 days after birth, and a second VRC01LS injection
      at Week 12 if they are still breastfeeding. Infants in Dose Group 5, Cohort 1 will receive a
      single VRC07-523LS injection less than 72 hours after birth. Infants in Dose Group 5, Cohort
      2 will receive an initial VRC07-523LS injection no longer than 5 days after birth, and a
      second VRC07-523LS injection at Week 12 if they are still breastfeeding.

      The mothers will not receive any VRC01, VRC01LS, or VRC07-523LS injections. At study entry,
      all mothers will undergo a medical history review and a blood collection. Infants in Dose
      Groups 1 and 2 will attend several study visits through Week 48. Infants in Dose Group 3, 4,
      and 5 will attend several study visits through Week 96. Visits will include a medical history
      review, physical examination, blood collection, and oral fluid collection.

             tested must be whole blood, serum, or plasma. For this protocol, the results for
             sample #2 may be pending at the time of enrollment. Results documented in the clinical
             record from past testing may be used to satisfy the criteria for documentation of
             HIV-1 infection. More information on this criterion can be found in the protocol.

          -  Documented or suspected serious medical illness or immediate life-threatening
             condition (other than HIV infection) in the mother that may interfere with the ability
             to complete study requirements, as judged by the examining clinician

        Infant Inclusion Criteria:

             investigational.)

          -  Receipt of or anticipated need for blood products, immunoglobulin, or
             immunosuppressive therapy. This includes infants who require hepatitis B

             B vaccine in the newborn period.

          -  Documented or suspected serious medical illness, serious congenital anomaly, or
             immediate life-threatening condition in the infant that may interfere with the ability
             to complete study requirements, as judged by the examining clinician

          -  Any requirement for supplemental oxygen beyond 24 hours of life or requiring
             supplemental oxygen at the time of the VRC01, VRC01LS, or VRC07-523LS dose

          -  Baseline laboratory results:

               -  Hemoglobin less than 12.0 g/dL

               -  Platelet count less than 100,000 cells/mm^3

          -  Dose Groups 4 and 5 (Cohort 1), only: Infant is breastfeeding at time of enrollment or
             mother has indicated an intention to initiate breastfeeding. Note: if a child is
             breastfed prior to known maternal diagnosis (in the case of a woman diagnosed in the
             intrapartum period), the child is still eligible as long as breastfeeding is stopped
             by the time the child is enrolled and there is no plan to resume breast milk feeding.
