  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of ruxolitinib phosphate when
      given together with decitabine and to see how well they work in treating patients with acute
      myeloid leukemia that has come back or is not responding to treatment, or has developed from
      a type of bone marrow diseases called myeloproliferative neoplasms. Ruxolitinib phosphate may
      stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs
      used in chemotherapy, such as decitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer
      cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from
      spreading. Giving ruxolitinib phosphate together with decitabine may be an effective
      treatment for acute myeloid leukemia.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the tolerability of the combination of decitabine and ruxolitinib phosphate
      (ruxolitinib [DI]) in patients with leukemia. (Phase I) II. To determine the efficacy of
      ruxolitinib in increasing and prolonging response induced by decitabine alone in patients
      with post myeloproliferative neoplasm acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (post MPN-AML)
      alternatively referred to as (myeloproliferative neoplasm - blast phase; MPN-BP). (Compared
      to historical response rate with decitabine alone) (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare whether there is a difference in response rate patients with post-MPN AML with
      janus kinase 2 (JAK2) mutations and patients without JAK2 mutations.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of ruxolitinib phosphate followed by a
      phase II study.

      Patients receive ruxolitinib phosphate orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28 and
      decitabine intravenously (IV) over 1-2 hours on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 4-6 weeks
      for up to 24 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
