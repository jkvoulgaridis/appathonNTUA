  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the time, dose dependence, and fraction-size dependence
      of radiation (RT)-induced changes in regional lung and heart perfusion/function/structure
      following thoracic RT delivered using newer IMRT/conformal/radiosurgery techniques. The PI
      hopes to develop models to better relate and predict RT-induced changes in regional lung and
      heart perfusion/function/structure with changes in global cardiopulmonary function. Patients
      will undergo pre- and serial post-RT lung and heart assessments to better understand
      RT-induced regional heart/lung changes.

          3. Patients receiving incidental RT to portions of the heart are eligible.

          4. Estimated minimum expected life expectancy of one year
