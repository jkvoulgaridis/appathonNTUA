  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study it was the rationale to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combined
      administration of nilotinib and increasing dose of ruxolitinib in patients with chronic
      myeloid leukemia and patients with Philadelphia positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

    <description>The study included two strata, which were to be treated in parallel. The first stratum consisted of CML-patients in CP, which had been on nilotinib treatment before entering the study. These patients did not optimally respond to the previous treatment. The second stratum consisted of patients with CML in AP or BC and patients with relapsed/refractory Ph+ ALL and Ph+ ALL patients with MRD, with or without previous nilotinib treatment. Patients were treated with 300mg nilotinib BID during the escalation phase (12 months) with increasing doses of ruxolitinib. The dose expansion phase (12 months) began following the determination of the MTD of the combination and the decision to explore the cohort for confirmation of RPIID. In this phase, safety and tolerability of the MTD and/or potential RPIID was to be further evaluated, with the purpose of establishing that this dose is suitable for use in this patient group.</description>

    <description>Nilotinib was supplied by Novartis as 150 mg and 200 mg hard gelatin capsules. Nilotinib was not dosed by weight or body surface area. Medication labels were in German and complied with the legal requirements of Germany. They included storage conditions for the drug but no information about the patient. The investigator emphasized compliance and instructed the patient to take nilotinib exactly as prescribed.</description>

        Patient must not have evidence of active malignancy other than the existing CML or ALL

        Patient must not receive drugs that interfere with coagulation or inhibits platelet
        function, with the exception of aspirin ≤ 150 mg per day or low molecular weight heparin.

        Patient must not have history of platelet dysfunction, bleeding diathesis, and/or
        coagulopathy in the 6 months prior to screening;

        similar chemical classes and their excipients;

        Patients must not take other investigational drugs within 28 days prior to screening;

        Patient must not be pregnant or lactating at screening and/or baseline;

        Patient must not have impaired cardiac functions
