    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate a treatment regimen called IRD which will
      be given to participants after their stem cell transplant in an effort to help prolong the
      amount of time the participants are disease-free after transplant. IRD is a three-drug
      regimen consisting of ixazomib, lenalidomide (also called Revlimid), and dexamethasone. After
      4 cycles of IRD, the participants will be randomized to receive maintenance therapy either
      with ixazomib or lenalidomide.

      09/23/2019: Upon review of the interim analysis that suggested inferior progression-free
      survival in the ixazomib maintenance arm, there will be no further randomizations into the
      maintenance portion of the trial. All patients will be enrolled into the lenalidomide arm
      with the exception of those who discontinue lenalidomide during the consolidation phase due
      to toxicity. Patients who discontinue lenalidomide may be enrolled into the ixazomib arm
      following approval from the principal investigator.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Based on the further need to improve progression-free survival and overall survival
      post-autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) for multiple myeloma and the benefits seen
      of consolidation/maintenance treatment with immunomodulatory drugs thalidomide and
      lenalidomide and the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, the natural next step is to evaluate
      combination regimens of immunomodulatory drugs and proteasome inhibitors as
      consolidation/maintenance post-ASCT. The regimen consisting of ixazomib, lenalidomide, and
      dexamethasone (IRD) has been shown to have low toxicity, and the availability of an oral
      formulation of ixazomib allows for easier administration when compared to bortezomib.

      In this study, following consolidation with IRD, patients will be randomized to maintenance
      therapy with lenalidomide or ixazomib in order to collect pilot data comparing the toxicity
      and efficacy of maintenance therapy with immunomodulatory drugs and proteasome inhibitors.

      09/23/2019: Upon review of the interim analysis that suggested inferior progression-free
      survival in the ixazomib maintenance arm, there will be no further randomizations into the
      maintenance portion of the trial. All patients will be enrolled into the lenalidomide arm
      with the exception of those who discontinue lenalidomide during the consolidation phase due
      to toxicity. Patients who discontinue lenalidomide may be enrolled into the ixazomib arm
      following approval from the principal investigator.

             of study participation, and for 28 days following the last dose of lenalidomide. Women
             of childbearing potential must also agree to ongoing pregnancy testing.

          -  Men must agree to use a latex condom during sexual contact with a woman of
             childbearing potential even if they have had a successful vasectomy. All patients must
