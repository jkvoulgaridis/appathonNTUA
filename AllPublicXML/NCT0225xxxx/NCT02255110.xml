    <description>BOR was planned to be determine according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1) and as adjudicated by an Independent Central Review. BOR is defined as the best response of any of complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD) and progressive disease (PD) recorded from date of randomization until disease progression or recurrence (taking the smallest measurement recorded since start of treatment as reference). CR: Disappearance of all evidence of target and non-target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes must have reduction in short axis to &lt; 10 millimeter (mm). PR: At least 30 percent (%) reduction from baseline in the sum of the longest diameter (SLD) of all lesions.

    <description>An adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. An AE was any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. A serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death; life threatening; persistent/significant disability/incapacity; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; congenital anomaly/birth defect or was otherwise considered medically important. The term TEAE is defined as AEs starting or worsening after the first intake of the stud drug.</description>

        <description>BOR was planned to be determine according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1) and as adjudicated by an Independent Central Review. BOR is defined as the best response of any of complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD) and progressive disease (PD) recorded from date of randomization until disease progression or recurrence (taking the smallest measurement recorded since start of treatment as reference). CR: Disappearance of all evidence of target and non-target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes must have reduction in short axis to &lt; 10 millimeter (mm). PR: At least 30 percent (%) reduction from baseline in the sum of the longest diameter (SLD) of all lesions. Stable disease (SD)=Neither sufficient increase to qualify for PD nor sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR. PD is defined as at least a 20 % increase in the SLD, taking as reference the smallest SLD recorded from baseline or appearance of 1 or more new lesions.</description>

        <description>An adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. An AE was any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. A serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death; life threatening; persistent/significant disability/incapacity; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; congenital anomaly/birth defect or was otherwise considered medically important.

          <description>An adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. An AE was any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. A serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death; life threatening; persistent/significant disability/incapacity; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; congenital anomaly/birth defect or was otherwise considered medically important. The term TEAE is defined as AEs starting or worsening after the first intake of the stud drug.</description>
