    <textblock>
      The proposed study is to evaluate the effectiveness of ExAblate Transcranial MRgFUS as a tool
      for creating a unilateral lesion in the Vim thalamus or the globus pallidus (GPi) in patients
      with treatment-refractory symptoms of movement disorders.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and initial effectiveness of MRI-guided
      focused ultrasound thermal ablation of a designated area in the brain of patients suffering
      from movement disorder symptoms:

        -  FUS under MRI-guidance and MRI-based thermometry can be safely delivered to patients
           suffering from treatment-refractory movement disorders through an intact human skull
           with a low risk of transient adverse effects as evaluated during follow-up of up to
           12-months.

        -  A pre-defined target volume inside the brain can be accurately ablated, as demonstrated
           on post-treatment MRI.

        -  Lesions generated with ExAblate Neuro will result in clinical effects that are similar
           to those seen with ablative procedures using other surgical techniques (e.g. RF
           procedure).
