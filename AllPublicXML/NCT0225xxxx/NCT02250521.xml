  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to determine the first attempt success rate of tracheal intubation
      with the McGRATH™ MAC laryngoscope using direct visualization in patients with known
      difficult airways, as well as exploring the possibility of identifying a particular direct
      Cormack-Lehane (C-L) grade view where indirect (video) visualization can be most beneficial
      during laryngoscopy and intubation.

    <description>All 100 patients will be intubated using the McGRATH® MAC video laryngoscope, either through direct or indirect vision laryngoscopy. The LCD monitor of the McGRATH™ MAC was initially covered; if the anesthesiologist visualized a modified C-L grade 1-3 view, the patient was intubated utilizing this direct view. If the anesthesiologist observed a modified C-L grade 4 view during their initial direct view, the patient was intubated using the indirect method. If intubation via direct laryngoscopy was unsuccessful on the first attempt, the patient was intubated using the indirect view. If both methods of laryngoscopy were unsuccessful, the rescue intubation technique was performed at the discretion of the anesthesiologist.</description>
