  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a Phase 1, dose-escalation, non-randomized, open-label, single-center study of
      DS-8895a in patients with advanced or metastatic Ephrin type-A receptor 2 (EphA2)-positive
      cancers. The primary study objective was to determine the safety of DS-8895a, with secondary
      objectives of determining the biodistribution, tumor uptake (bioimaging), pharmacokinetics
      (PK), antitumor and pharmacodynamic response, and correlations between pharmacodynamics and
      clinical outcomes, as appropriate.

      Patients received an initial ^89Zr trace-labelled infusion of DS-8895a on Day 1, followed by
      safety assessments, positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, and PK sampling over a 1-week
      period. DS-8895a was infused again on Days 8, 22, and 36. The Day 36 infusion of DS-8895a was
      also trace labelled with ^89Zr, with subsequent PET imaging and PK sampling. Four dose levels
      (1, 3, 10 and 20 mg/kg) were to be evaluated, with 3 to 6 patients entered at each dose
      level. Patients who responded or had stable disease per the Response Evaluation Criteria in
      Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 at the Day 50 restaging may have continued to receive
      biweekly treatment with DS-8895a until disease progression, with restaging performed by
      computed tomography (CT) scans every 6 weeks.

    <description>Toxicity was graded in accordance with the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0.

    <measure>Number of Patients With Tumor Uptake of ^89Zr-Df-DS-8895a</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 43</time_frame>
    <description>The biodistribution and tumor uptake of ^89Zr-Df-DS-8895a was determined based on qualitative analysis of whole body positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) images. PET imaging was performed following the ^89Zr-Df-DS-8895a infusions on Day 1 (Days 1, 4/5, and 7/8) and Day 36 (Days 36, 39/40 and 42/43). Qualitative parameters assessed included tumor uptake of reference lesions (scored on a 0-3 point scale: none, low, med, high). The reference lesions were initially identified on fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET scans with a score of 3 for [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake. The summary table presents the maximum reference lesion ^89Zr-Df-DS-8895a uptake score reported for individual patients.</description>

    <measure>Number of Patients With Best Overall Tumor Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 58 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Tumor responses were evaluated using computed tomography and categorized according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (version 1.1) at Screening (up to 21 days before the first dose of study drug), on Day 50, and approximately every 6 weeks thereafter for patients who received continued study dosing. Per RECIST, target lesions are categorized as follows: Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR): ≥ 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Progressive Disease (PD): ≥ 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Stable Disease (SD): small changes that do not meet above criteria.</description>

    <description>The pharmacodynamic (metabolic) response of DS-8895a was assessed by ^18F-FDG PET at Screening, Day 29, and Day 50. Tumor metabolism response was evaluated as the difference in standardized uptake values between the pre- and post-treatment FDG PET scans. The measurement of [18F]-FDG uptake for tumor metabolic response monitoring was performed according to the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) PET response criteria (Young et al.

For Cycle 2 onward, HAHA samples were collected on Day 1 (pre-infusion) and at the end of the study (anytime). HAHA samples were analyzed using ELISA and were categorized as either positive or negative for a HAHA response. HAHA positivity indicates that a patient has developed an antibody response.</description>

        <description>The biodistribution and tumor uptake of ^89Zr-Df-DS-8895a was determined based on qualitative analysis of whole body positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) images. PET imaging was performed following the ^89Zr-Df-DS-8895a infusions on Day 1 (Days 1, 4/5, and 7/8) and Day 36 (Days 36, 39/40 and 42/43). Qualitative parameters assessed included tumor uptake of reference lesions (scored on a 0-3 point scale: none, low, med, high). The reference lesions were initially identified on fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET scans with a score of 3 for [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake. The summary table presents the maximum reference lesion ^89Zr-Df-DS-8895a uptake score reported for individual patients.</description>

Serum samples for gamma counting were drawn on Day 1 (pre-infusion and 5 minutes, 1, 2, and 4 hours post-infusion), Day 2 (24 hours post-infusion), Day 4/5 (anytime), Day 36 (pre-infusion, and 5 minutes, 1, 2, and 4 hours post infusion), Day 37 (24 hours post-infusion), Day 39/40 (anytime), Day 42/43 (anytime), and Day 50 (anytime). For Cycle 2 onward, blood samples for PK were taken at pre- and 0 to 30 minutes post-infusion on Days 1, 15, and 29.</description>

        <title>Number of Patients With Pharmacodynamic (Metabolic) Response</title>
        <description>The pharmacodynamic (metabolic) response of DS-8895a was assessed by ^18F-FDG PET at Screening, Day 29, and Day 50. Tumor metabolism response was evaluated as the difference in standardized uptake values between the pre- and post-treatment FDG PET scans. The measurement of [18F]-FDG uptake for tumor metabolic response monitoring was performed according to the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) PET response criteria (Young et al. Eur J Cancer 1999;35:1773-82).</description>
