  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with a total hip replacement may require early revision surgery due to an adverse
      local tissue reaction or bone resorption that occurs due to wear debris released from the
      implant. MRI provides a non-invasive biomarker for clinicians and surgeons to detect early
      adverse synovial reactions which may exist in the absence of clinical symptoms, thus
      imparting essential information for clinical management. This study will address two of the
      most commons causes of hip implant failure, including adverse local tissue reaction in
      implants not traditionally associated with adverse tissue reactions, as well as the presence
      of aseptic loosening and loss of implant-bone integration.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Total hip arthroplasty (THA) has been successful in achieving pain reduction, but recent
      concerns have been raised regarding the development of adverse local tissue reactions
      (ALTRs). Our group has previously found that: 1) Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect
      and distinguish wear debris from THA; 2) MRI is sensitive to ALTR damage from different
      articulating surfaces; and 3) variable host-mediated response to wear debris mounts distinct
      morphologic patterns on MRI. There is continued interest in the evaluation of soft tissues
      near THAs as traditional THA designs, including metal-on-polyethylene (MOP) and
      ceramic-on-polyethylene (COP) bearing surfaces, have recently been implicated in ALTRs. It is
      believed that fretting and corrosion at the head-neck junction is responsible for ALTRs,
      secondary to flexural rigidity and other implant mechanical features. If a greater prevalence
      of ALTR is found in components with more flexible connections, this could drive the practice
      of THA to stiffer connections.

      In this study, we will evaluate two important causes of implant failure: (1) in designs not
      traditionally associated with ALTRs such as metal-on-polyethylene (MOP) and
      ceramic-on-polyethylene (COP) we will assess patients indicated for revision THA surgery with
      MRI and correlate the imaging metrics to targeted biopsy retrieval obtained at the time of
      revision (including the trunnion), the extent of tissue damage documented at surgery, and
      implant retrieval analysis of the neck trunnion, including flexural rigidity analysis; and
      (2) to longitudinally assess implant integration using qualitative MRI evaluation of the
      bone-implant interface as well as quantitative MRI techniques, T2 mapping and T2* mapping
      using MAVRIC-UTE, to evaluate relaxometry at the interface.

    <measure>Mode of total hip arthroplasty failure</measure>
    <time_frame>An expected average of 1 year post-operatively</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be classified as symptomatic with mechanical symptoms and symptomatic with unexplained pain. These groups are based on the categories used by the National Joint Registry of England and Wales. Patients presenting with loosening, instability, or malalignment will be classified as &quot;mechanical&quot; failure. In cases of loosening, patients will be categorized as having acetabular or femoral loosening, only when documented intra-operatively by the surgeon. Patients presenting with pain not attributable to implant loosening, instability, or component malposition will be classified as &quot;unexplained&quot; failure. No specific unit of measure will be used for this outcome measure.</description>

    <description>Blood samples will be drawn into lithium-heparin containing tubes with non-contamination precautions, and analyzed with high resolution inductively coupled mass spectrometry for the most accurate assessment of Cobalt and Chromium metal ion levels, to be measured in parts per million (ppm) or microgram per liter (ug/L)</description>

    <measure>Intraoperative damage assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Measurement during revision surgery for total hip arthroplasty patients</time_frame>
    <description>A subjective scoring system will be used for intraoperative damage assessment of the hip joint. The system is based on a 0 to 3 scale denoting the level of involvement of the soft tissues surrounding the joint (capsule, synovium, and muscle): 0 = Normal tissue; 1 = Fluid collection ± mild synovial reaction with or capsular dehiscence; 2 = the same findings as a score of 1, but with moderate synovial reaction; and 3 = the same findings as a score of 2, but with the addition of damage to the abductor muscle and/or osteolysis. No specific unit of measure will be used for this outcome measure.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Histologic analysis of retrieved tissues</measure>
    <time_frame>Measurement at an expected average of 1 year post operatively for revision total hip arthroplasty patients.</time_frame>
    <description>Histological evaluation will be using a 10 point aseptic lymphocytic vasculitis associated lesion (ALVAL) score to assess tissue reaction to a total hip replacement. The ALVAL score is a summation of individual grades assigned to the integrity of the synovial lining, presence and extent of inflammatory cell infiltrates, necrosis and tissue organization.
We will use a supplemental grading system intended for metal-on-poly and ceramic implants since ALVAL grading is used primarily for metal-on-metal (MOM) articulations and may not detect similar features of wear debris in non-MOM articulations, polyethylene, metal or corrosion products. The presence of ceramic and polyethylene particles and the relative number of macrophages, giant cells, histiocytes, acute or chronic inflammatory cells, and presence of necrotic tissue will be graded using the scale of: 1) absent (-), little (+), moderate (++), extensive (+++). No specific unit of measure will be used for this outcome measure.</description>
