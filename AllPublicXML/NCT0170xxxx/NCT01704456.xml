      This randomized trial, nicknamed the COMFORT (Cognitive therapy or Mindfulness FOR Treatment
      of pvd) study, will compare the effects of an 8-session group Mindfulness-based Cognitive
      Therapy (MBCT) to an 8-session group Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) for women with
      provoked vestibulodynia (PVD). Women with PVD will be randomly assigned to attend either
      eight sessions of group MBCT or CBT. Each session is 2.25 hours long and spaced 1 week apart.
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the 8-session MBCT intervention for PVD is
      no worse than an 8-session CBT intervention for decreasing women's pain intensity, sexual
      distress, catastrophizing and hypervigilance towards pain.

      PURPOSE:

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether an 8-session MBCT intervention for PVD is
      no worse than an 8-session CBT intervention for improving women's pain intensity and reducing
      their sexual distress, catastrophizing and hypervigilance towards pain. The investigators
      will also examine whether pain improvements at follow-up are mediated by changes in
      self-compassion and mindfulness (in the MBCT arm only) and moderated by pre-treatment
      credibility, personality, and anxiety sensitivity.

      HYPOTHESES:

        1. At follow-up (4 weeks, 6 months and 12 months post-treatment), women in the MBCT arm
           will experience a greater decline (vs. pre-treatment) in vestibular pain intensity
           compared to women in the CBT arm.

        2. At follow-up (4 weeks, 6 months and 12 months post-treatment), women in the MBCT arm
           will experience a greater decline (vs. pre-treatment) in sex-related distress, pain
           catastrophizing, hypervigilance, and self-reported pain during intercourse/other
           penetrative sex compared to women in the CBT arm.

        3. The investigators hypothesize that improvements in pain intensity during vestibular
           touch will be mediated by changes in self-compassion and mindfulness in the MBCT arm
           only at 6 and 12 months follow-up.

        4. The investigators hypothesize that pre-treatment credibility, personality, and anxiety
           sensitivity will significantly moderate improvements in pain intensity during vestibular
           touch at 6 and 12 months follow-up.

        5. The investigators hypothesize improvements in both arms on the &quot;Patient Global
           Impression of Change Scale&quot; and significantly greater improvements in the MBCT arm
           relative to the CBT arm at follow-up (4 weeks, 6 months and 12 months post-treatment).

    <measure>Change in Vulvslgesiometer Pain Rating From Baseline to One Month Post-treatment to 6 Months Post-treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment, one month post-treatment and 6 months post-treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators have selected pain intensity during a controlled examination as the primary endpoint in this study. Specifically, pain intensity at the vulvar vestibule will be assessed using a vulvalgesiometer. The vulvalgesiometer is an instrument that provides a measure of pain/sensitivity that can be standardized across time points. The vulvalgesiometer is calibrated to exert a fixed amount of pressure. In this study, 30 grams of pressure at the 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, and 11 o'clock positions (randomly) around the vestibule will be applied using the vulvalgestiometer. Women will also report their pain at each site using a numeric rating scale from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain ever).</description>

    <measure>Self-reported Pain During Penetration</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment,one month post-treatment, and 6 months follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will measure self-report of pain during attempted or completed intercourse (or dildo entry for non-heterosexual women). Numeric Rating Scale that asked participants to rate the &quot;intensity of pain during vaginal penetration attempts with sexual intercourse or penetration over the past 4 weeks&quot; This question was rated on a 0 to 10 scale from no pain (0) to worst possible pain (10).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sexual Function</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment, one month post-treatment, and 6 months post-treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will examine women's self-reported sexual function by administering the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI). The Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) is a 19-item self-report questionnaire which assesses sexual function in women. It covers six sexual domains: lubrication, arousal, desire, pain, orgasm and satisfaction. Scores range from 7.2 - 36 where increase in sexual dysfunction is represented by lower scores.
Subscales:
Desire- 2, 3 [Subscale scores Range: 1.2 - 6] Arousal- 5,6,7,8 [Subscale Scores Range: 1.2 - 6] Lubrication- 9,10,11,12 [Subscale Scores Range: 1.2 - 6] Orgasm- 13, 14, 15 [Subscale Scores Range: 1.2 - 6] Satisfaction- 1, 16, 17 [Subscale Scores Range: 1.2 - 6] Pain- 18, 19, 20 [Subscale Scores Range: 1.2 - 6] Extra item: (4) have you been sexually active in past 4 weeks? (yes/no) [Scores Range 0 (no) - 1 (yes)]
Note: Ranges applicable only if question 4 was answered &quot;yes&quot;.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sexual Distress</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment, one month post-treatment, and 6 months post-treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will examine women's self-reported sexual distress by administering the Female Sexual Distress Scale-Revised. This is a 12-item self-report questionnaire assessing for sexuality related personal distress. Scores on the scale range from 0 - 48, where higher scores represent higher levels of distress.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Catastrophizing</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment, one month post-treatment, and 6 months post-treatment..</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will examine women's self-reported pain catastrophizing by administering the Pain Catastrophizing Scale. The Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) is a self-report questionnaire that asks participants to think about past painful experiences, or a specific experience of pain, and to indicate the degree to which they have any of the presented thoughts or feelings when they are experiencing pain. Each one of the 13-items is rated on a Likert scale from 0 (not at all) to 4 (all the time), where a higher total score indicates higher pain catastrophizing.
Subscales: Rumination- (4 items) 8, 9, 10, and 11 [Scores Range: 0 - 16] Magnification- (3 items) 6, 7, and 13 [Scores Range: 0 - 12] Helplessness- (6 items) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 12 [Scores Range: 0 - 24] Sum of all items [Overall Range: 0 - 52]</description>

        <title>Change in Vulvslgesiometer Pain Rating From Baseline to One Month Post-treatment to 6 Months Post-treatment</title>
        <description>The investigators have selected pain intensity during a controlled examination as the primary endpoint in this study. Specifically, pain intensity at the vulvar vestibule will be assessed using a vulvalgesiometer. The vulvalgesiometer is an instrument that provides a measure of pain/sensitivity that can be standardized across time points. The vulvalgesiometer is calibrated to exert a fixed amount of pressure. In this study, 30 grams of pressure at the 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, and 11 o'clock positions (randomly) around the vestibule will be applied using the vulvalgestiometer. Women will also report their pain at each site using a numeric rating scale from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain ever).</description>

        <title>Pain Catastrophizing</title>
        <description>The investigators will examine women's self-reported pain catastrophizing by administering the Pain Catastrophizing Scale. The Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) is a self-report questionnaire that asks participants to think about past painful experiences, or a specific experience of pain, and to indicate the degree to which they have any of the presented thoughts or feelings when they are experiencing pain. Each one of the 13-items is rated on a Likert scale from 0 (not at all) to 4 (all the time), where a higher total score indicates higher pain catastrophizing.
Subscales: Rumination- (4 items) 8, 9, 10, and 11 [Scores Range: 0 - 16] Magnification- (3 items) 6, 7, and 13 [Scores Range: 0 - 12] Helplessness- (6 items) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 12 [Scores Range: 0 - 24] Sum of all items [Overall Range: 0 - 52]</description>

          <title>Chronic Pain Acceptance, CPAQ Pain Willingness</title>
          <description>The investigators will examine women's self-reported pain acceptance, activities engagement, by administering the CPAQ chronic pain acceptance questionnaire. The Chronic Pain Acceptance Questionnaire (CPAQ) measures the degree of acceptance of pain by chronic pain patients. It consists of 20 items measuring two domains: Activities Engagement and Pain Willingness. Total score range is from 0 - 120, with higher scores indicating higher levels of pain acceptance.
Subscales:
Activities engagement (11 items)- Q 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 19 [Scores Range: 0 - 66] Pain willingness (9 items)- Q 4, 7, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 20 [Scores Range: 0 - 54]</description>
