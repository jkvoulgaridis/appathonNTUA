  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies infusion of expanded cord blood hematopoietic progenitor
      cells following combination chemotherapy in treating younger patients with acute myeloid
      leukemia that has relapsed or has not responded to treatment. Chemotherapy drugs work in
      different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Chemotherapy also kills healthy
      infection-fighting cells, increasing the risk of infection. The infusion of expanded cord
      blood hematopoietic progenitor cells may be able to replace blood-forming cells that were
      destroyed by chemotherapy. This cellular therapy may decrease the risk of infection following
      chemotherapy.
