  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive aging is a major source of disability in an increasingly aging population. The
      paucity of effective treatments for cognitive aging disorders, and most importantly in
      Alzheimer's disease instigates a need for further research into novel therapeutic
      possibilities. Alzheimer's disease is the most common neurodegenerative disorder and its
      prevalence steeply increases. Glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity in neuropsychiatric disorders
      and in particular in Alzheimer's disease has been shown to cause significant cerebral damage.
      Early effective therapeutic intervention in Alzheimer's disease is critical in order to
      prevent or at least slow down neuropathological progression that will lead to widespread
      irreversible neuronal loss and significant cognitive dysfunction. Riluzole, a glutamate
      modulator agent, will be tested in mild Alzheimer's disease patients. Cognitive functional
      changes along with two established in vivo biomarkers, namely, Magnetic Resonance
      Spectroscopy (MRS) and Fluorodeoxyglucose (18F) positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) will
      be evaluated.

  <detailed_description>

      A double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled study will be performed. Forty-two
      individuals with a diagnosis of mild Alzheimer's disease between 50-95 years old will
      complete the study. All forty-two individuals will have been on an acetylcholinesterase
      inhibitor, which is FDA approved for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, for at least 2
      months prior to initiating the study, unless the medication was not previously tolerated.
      Twenty to twenty-two mild Alzheimer's disease patients will receive riluzole and another
      20-22 will receive a placebo. All patients will have a neurological evaluation and
      neuropsychological tests performed to confirm that they meet criteria for probable
      Alzheimer's disease set out by the National Institute on Aging - Alzheimer's disease
      Association that recently revisited the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria along with FDG-PET biomarker
      consistent with Alzheimer's disease.

          -  Male or female; 50 - 95 years old with mild Alzheimer's disease determined after
             neurological and neuropsychological evaluation following the National Institute on
             Aging - Alzheimer's disease Association criteria that recently revisited the
             NINCDS-ADRDA criteria. For mild Alzheimer's disease, Clinical Dementia Ratings Scale
