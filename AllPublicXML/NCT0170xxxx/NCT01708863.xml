  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) is a severe form of congenital heart disease that
      consists of multiple obstructions to flow through the left heart and aorta, as well as
      hypoplasia of the left ventricle. Most patients require a three-stage surgical protocol
      starting within days of birth. Stage I of this process is the Norwood reconstruction (within
      the first few days of life), Stage II (usually required within 3-8 months) involves creation
      of a direct connection between the patient's superior vena cava and the pulmonary arterial
      confluence (bidirectional Glenn anastomosis), and the last stage is creation of a Fontan
      circulation (typically within the first 2-4 years). This &quot;single ventricle&quot; approach requires
      the right ventricle to perform as the only circulatory pump for the entire body.

      Our long-term goal is to develop regenerative strategies to strengthen and augment the right
      ventricular muscle of the single-ventricle heart following surgical palliation in HLHS
      patients. To determine the safety and feasibility of a cell-based therapeutic intervention at
      the Stage II surgery, we aim to document the natural history of post-surgical care in HLHS
      patients having undergone standard of care with protocol specific follow-up over the course
      of a 6-month period.

      This prospective study will document the natural history in patients with HLHS after planned
      Stage II surgical palliation with a focus on cardiovascular parameters within 6 months
      following surgery in 10 patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Individuals with HLHS having undergone Stage I surgical palliation and undergoing
             planned Stage II palliative Glenn surgery.

          -  Individuals up to 18 months of age are eligible if written informed consent can be
             obtained from both parents and/or legal guardians, unless one parent is not reasonably
             available.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Severe chronic diseases, extensive extra-cardiac syndromic features, or history of
             cancer

        The following complications of congenital heart disease:

          -  Any condition requiring urgent, or unplanned procedure within 15 days prior to Stage
             II surgical repair.

          -  Severe pulmonary hypertension (reported in the medical record as &gt;70% systemic
             pressure).

          -  Other clinical concerns as documented by a site investigator that would predict (more
             likely to happen than not to happen) a risk of severe complications or very poor
             outcome during or after Stage II surgical repair.
