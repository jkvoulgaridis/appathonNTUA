  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Clinical Trial is being conducted to study two adjunctive treatments for rotator cuff
      repair; soft tissue and bone trephination. &quot;Trephination&quot; is a procedure that involves making
      small perforations either in the torn tendon near its edge, or in the bone that the tendon is
      repaired to. The rotator cuff is repaired by sewing the tendon down to the bone in the
      shoulder. Trephination is a new technique that is used in addition to the standard method of
      repairing the rotator cuff tendon.

      This study will help to determine whether this technique improves the speed of healing, the
      strength and the re-tear rate of the repair. You are being asked to take part in this study
      because you have a tear of the rotator cuff that requires surgical treatment. A total of 90
      participants will participate in this study.

    <description>The Western Ontario Rotator Cuff Index (WORC) is a disease specific evaluation, proven to be an accurate and valid assessment of function after shoulder replacement. The WORC is a patient-reported measure, 19-question survey. Each question is measured using a visual analog scale rated from 0-100, where higher scores mean better outcome. These scores are combined and translated into a percentage out of 100. A higher total score indicates a better outcome.</description>

    <measure>American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Standardized Shoulder Assessment Form (ASES) Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to up until 24-Months Post-Operative</time_frame>
    <description>The ASES is a shoulder specific assessment divided into two sections: pain and activities of daily living (ADL). Pain is recorded on a visual analogue scale (0-10), lower scores indicate better outcomes. There are 10 activities of daily living questions, each are recorded on a 4 level likert scale (0-3), which a higher score indicates a better outcome. The overall score is an equal weight of the two sections and produces a score out of 100. The higher the score, the better the outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Constant Score</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to up until 24-Months Post-Operative</time_frame>
    <description>The Constant Score reflects an overall clinical functional assessment. This instrument is based on a 100-point scoring system. Subjective findings (pain, activities of daily living, and working in different positions) make up a total of 35 points. Objective measurements make up the remaining 65 points.The test is divided into four sub-categories: (1) pain is measured using 4 likert levels (15 points maximum), where a higher score indicates a better outcome; activities of daily living are measured using a likert scale, where a higher number indicates better outcomes (20 points maximum); mobility is measured by an assessor, and rated using a likert scale where a higher score indicates better outcomes (40 points maximum); finally, strength is measured by an assessor where 1 point is given per 0.5kg of force (maximum 25 points), a higher score indicates better outcomes. All categories are added together, and a total score out of 100 is given (higher score indicates better outcome).</description>

    <measure>Healing Rates</measure>
    <time_frame>From surgery to up until 24-Months Post-Operative</time_frame>
    <description>Imaging parameters will be examined using ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These images will be analyzed to determine healing status of the tissues post-operatively. Imaging will determine whether the tissue is healed, partially torn, or fully torn after surgery. Higher incidence of tearing will be compared between groups. A higher incidence of tearing indicates worse outcomes.</description>

    <description>Ten days prior to the standard rotator cuff repair, a trephination procedure will be carried out. The trephination procedure will take approximately 30 minutes to complete and will be carried out under local anesthesia. A needle will be placed through the skin over the shoulder and either into the bone or into the edge of the cuff tendon, depending on whether you are allocated to the &quot;bone trephination&quot; or &quot;soft tissue trephination&quot; groups. The needle will be used to make 6 small holes in either bone or the tendon in the shoulder in the area where the cuff is to be repaired.</description>

        <title>Western Ontario Rotator Cuff Index</title>
        <description>The Western Ontario Rotator Cuff Index (WORC) is a disease specific evaluation, proven to be an accurate and valid assessment of function after shoulder replacement. The WORC is a patient-reported measure, 19-question survey. Each question is measured using a visual analog scale rated from 0-100, where higher scores mean better outcome. These scores are combined and translated into a percentage out of 100. A higher total score indicates a better outcome.</description>

The trephination procedure will take approximately 30 minutes to complete and will be carried out under local anesthesia. A needle will be placed through the skin over the shoulder and either into the bone or into the edge of the cuff tendon, depending on whether you are allocated to the “bone trephination” or “soft tissue trephination” groups. The needle will be used to make 6 small holes in either bone or the tendon in the shoulder in the area where the cuff is to be repaired.

        <description>The ASES is a shoulder specific assessment divided into two sections: pain and activities of daily living (ADL). Pain is recorded on a visual analogue scale (0-10), lower scores indicate better outcomes. There are 10 activities of daily living questions, each are recorded on a 4 level likert scale (0-3), which a higher score indicates a better outcome. The overall score is an equal weight of the two sections and produces a score out of 100. The higher the score, the better the outcome.</description>

        <description>The Constant Score reflects an overall clinical functional assessment. This instrument is based on a 100-point scoring system. Subjective findings (pain, activities of daily living, and working in different positions) make up a total of 35 points. Objective measurements make up the remaining 65 points.The test is divided into four sub-categories: (1) pain is measured using 4 likert levels (15 points maximum), where a higher score indicates a better outcome; activities of daily living are measured using a likert scale, where a higher number indicates better outcomes (20 points maximum); mobility is measured by an assessor, and rated using a likert scale where a higher score indicates better outcomes (40 points maximum); finally, strength is measured by an assessor where 1 point is given per 0.5kg of force (maximum 25 points), a higher score indicates better outcomes. All categories are added together, and a total score out of 100 is given (higher score indicates better outcome).</description>

          <title>Soft Tissue Trephination</title>
          <description>Ten days prior to the standard rotator cuff repair, a trephination procedure will be carried out. The trephination procedure will take approximately 30 minutes to complete and will be carried out under local anesthesia. A needle will be placed through the skin over the shoulder and either into the bone or into the edge of the cuff tendon, depending on whether you are allocated to the “bone trephination” or “soft tissue trephination” groups. The needle will be used to make 6 small holes in either bone or the tendon in the shoulder in the area where the cuff is to be repaired.

      <restrictive_agreement>There is NOT an agreement between Principal Investigators and the Sponsor (or its agents) that restricts the PI's rights to discuss or publish trial results after the trial is completed. </restrictive_agreement>

    <limitations_and_caveats>The sample size achieved would have detected a clinically significant difference based on power analysis but remains susceptible to type II error. The lack of a prospective control group also restricts the interpretation of the study finding.</limitations_and_caveats>
