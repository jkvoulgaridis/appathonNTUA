  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial was to identify at least one next generation ring (NGR)
      that demonstrates inhibition of ovulation (which was considered confirmed if in the subset of
      participants ovulation was observed in less than 15% of the participants at any time during
      the 3 treatment cycles of the study) and cycle control that was non-inferior to NuvaRing®, as
      judged by the incidence of breakthrough bleeding and/or spotting (BTB-S) during Cycle 3. The
      primary hypothesis was that at least 1 of the 6 NGRs would show inhibition of ovulation and
      cycle control during Treatment Cycle 3 that is non-inferior to NuvaRing®, as judged by the
      incidence of BTB-S.

    <time_frame>Day 1 of Treatment Cycle 1 through Day 28 of Treatment Cycle 3 (Up to ~92 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Ovulation was defined as having 2 or more consecutive progesterone concentrations &gt;16 nmol/L within 5 days, confirmed by ultrasound evidence of ovulation (follicular rupture or preceding presence of a follicle-like structure &gt;15 mm in size).</description>

    <description>Maximum progesterone (Max P) was defined as the maximum progesterone value. Ovulation was defined as 2 or more consecutive progesterone concentrations &gt;16 nmol/L within 5 days during the 3 treatment cycles, supported by ultrasound evidence of ovulation. The Max P values greater than 16 nmol/L are presented by vaginal ring group and cycle.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Breakthrough Bleeding and/or Spotting During Cycle 3</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 Cycle 3 through Day 28 Cycle 3 (Up to ~28 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Breakthrough bleeding and/or spotting (BTB-S) is defined as any bleeding or spotting episode that occurred during the expected non-bleeding period that was neither an early nor a continued withdrawal bleeding. Bleeding = any bloody vaginal discharge that required one or more sanitary pads or tampons per day; Spotting = any bloody vaginal discharge that required no sanitary pads or tampons per day.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Absence of Withdrawal Bleeding and/or Spotting During Cycle 2</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 Cycle 2 through Day 28 Cycle 2 (Up to ~28 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Withdrawal bleeding and/or spotting is considered any bleeding or spotting episode that starts during or continues into the expected bleeding period (i.e., when the ring has been removed the last week of the cycle). Absence of withdrawal bleeding is no withdrawal bleeding and/or spotting episodes during an expected bleeding period when the ring has been removed.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Intensity of Withdrawal Bleeding During Cycle 2</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 Cycle 2 through Day 28 Cycle 2 (Up to ~28 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Intensity of withdrawal bleeding during Cycle 2 was defined as the ratio of the number of withdrawal bleeding days divided by the number of withdrawal bleeding and/or spotting days. Withdrawal bleeding and/or spotting is considered any bleeding or spotting episode that starts during or continues into the expected bleeding period (i.e., when the ring has been removed the last week of the cycle). Absence of withdrawal bleeding is no withdrawal bleeding and/or spotting episodes during an expected bleeding period when the ring has been removed.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 1 Cycle 3 through Day 28 Cycle 3 (Up to ~ 28 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Intensity of breakthrough bleeding and/or spotting (BTB-S) during Cycle 3 was defined as the ratio of the number of breakthrough bleeding days divided by the number of breakthrough bleeding and/or spotting days. Breakthrough bleeding and/or spotting (BTB-S) is defined as any bleeding or spotting episode that occurred during the expected non-bleeding period that was neither an early nor a continued withdrawal bleeding.

          <description>Withdrawal bleeding and/or spotting is considered any bleeding or spotting episode that starts during or continues into the expected bleeding period (i.e., when the ring has been removed the last week of the cycle). Absence of withdrawal bleeding is no withdrawal bleeding and/or spotting episodes during an expected bleeding period when the ring has been removed.</description>
          <population>The analysis population included all participants in whom vaginal rings were inserted and had an evaluable cycle with non-missing bleeding data in the respective cycle, excluding participants who were protocol violators in terms of ring use, daily diary entry or prohibited medications.</population>

        <title>Intensity of Breakthrough Bleeding and/or Spotting During Cycle 3</title>
        <description>Intensity of breakthrough bleeding and/or spotting (BTB-S) during Cycle 3 was defined as the ratio of the number of breakthrough bleeding days divided by the number of breakthrough bleeding and/or spotting days. Breakthrough bleeding and/or spotting (BTB-S) is defined as any bleeding or spotting episode that occurred during the expected non-bleeding period that was neither an early nor a continued withdrawal bleeding. Bleeding = any bloody vaginal discharge that required one or more sanitary pads or tampons per day; Spotting = any bloody vaginal discharge that required no sanitary pads or tampons per day.</description>
        <time_frame>Day 1 Cycle 3 through Day 28 Cycle 3 (Up to ~ 28 days)</time_frame>
        <population>The analysis population included all participants in whom vaginal rings were inserted and had an evaluable cycle with non-missing bleeding data in the respective cycle, and with at least one breakthrough bleeding and/or spotting day, excluding protocol violators in terms of ring use, daily diary entry or prohibited medications.</population>

          <description>A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE that results in death, is life threatening, requires or prolongs an existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, is a congenital anomaly or birth defect, is a cancer, is associated with an overdose; or is another important medical event deemed such by medical or scientific judgment. A drug-related SAE was defined as any SAE for which there is reasonable possibility of drug relationship as assessed by the Investigator.</description>
