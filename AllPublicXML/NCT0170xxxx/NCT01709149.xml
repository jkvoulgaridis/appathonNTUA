      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of CK-2017357
      when taken with or without riluzole (also called Rilutek®) in patients with Amyotrophic
      Lateral Sclerosis (ALS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The length of the study, including screening, dosing, and follow-up, is approximately 20
      weeks. After a one-week open-label phase during which all patients will receive CK-2017357
      125 milligrams (mg) twice daily, patients who tolerate the open-label 125 mg of CK-2017357
      will be randomized one to one (fifty-fifty) to receive double-blind CK-2017357 or matching
      placebo. The CK-2017357/placebo dose will be increased no faster than weekly to each
      patient's highest tolerated daily dose, with a maximum of 250 mg twice daily. The dose may be
      decreased based on tolerability. Patients will continue treatment at the highest tolerated
      dose to complete a total of 12 weeks of double-blind treatment. Patients may be on riluzole
      or not on riluzole at study entry. Patients not on riluzole must stay off riluzole. Patients
      on riluzole who are getting double-blind CK-2017357 will be given riluzole at half the
      labeled dosage (50 mg once a day instead of 50 mg twice a day). Blood tests for safety will
      be performed. Information about any side effects that may occur will also be collected.

    <measure>The Change From Baseline in ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) Total Score to the Average of Values Obtained at the End of Weeks 8 and 12 of Double-blind Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The ALSFRS-R is used to measure the progression and severity of disease; it consists of 12 questions, assessing a patient's capability and independence in functional activities relevant to ALS, categorized in 4 domains: gross motor tasks, fine motor tasks, bulbar functions, and respiratory function. Each question is scored from 0 (indicating incapable or dependent) to 4 (normal). The total score ranges from 0 to 48, with higher scores reflecting more normal function and lower scores reflecting more impaired function.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Maximum Voluntary Ventilation (MVV) to the Average of Values Obtained at the End of Weeks 8 and 12 of Double-blind Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>MVV was measured as the volume (in liters) of air that could be exhaled during 12 seconds of rapid deep breathing; for analysis purposes, the measured volume was extrapolated to 1 minute (to give units of L/min).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Sniff Nasal Inspiratory Pressure (SNIP) to the Average of Values Obtained at the End of Weeks 8 and 12 of Double-blind Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>SNIP was measured at functional residual capacity, the bottom of the tidal breathing cycle, through 1 plugged nostril while the other remained open. Inspiratory pressure is a negative number where a larger negative number represents . . . A forceful, maximal inspiratory sniff was performed and a peak pressure value reported. The best result (ie, the highest number) from 5 tests was recorded as the SNIP.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Slow Vital Capacity (SVC) to the Average of Values Obtained at the End of Weeks 8 and 12 of Double-blind Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>SVC was measured using a spirometer (in units of liters). Following 3 to 5 breaths at rest, the patients were instructed to take as deep an inspiration as possible followed by a maximum exhalation (blowing out all the air in their lungs). Values obtained were converted to % predicted values (ie, the test result as a percent of predicted values for the patients of similar demographic and baseline characteristics [eg, height, age, sex]).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Maximum Handgrip Strength in the Weaker Hand to the Average of Values Obtained at the End of Weeks 8 and 12 of Double-blind Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Maximum handgrip strength was measured using an electronic hand dynamometer; patients were asked to squeeze the device with the maximum possible force.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Handgrip Fatigability (at 60% of Target in the Weaker Hand) to the Average of Values Obtained at the End of Weeks 8 and 12 of Double-blind Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Handgrip fatigability was measured immediately following determination of maximum handgrip strength (via an electronic hand dynamometer). Once maximum handgrip strength was achieved, the force of the grip was timed for 2 minutes or until the grip strength had dropped to 60% of the maximum, whichever came first.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Muscle Strength Mega-Score Based on Percent Change in Muscle Strength Measurements to the Average at the End of Weeks 8 and 12 of Double-blind Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A hand-held dynamometer (HHD), with a scale of 0 to 300 pounds, was used to measure muscle strength and handgrip strength (bilateral); the muscle groups tested were: elbow flexion (bilateral), wrist extension (bilateral), knee extension (bilateral), and ankle dorsiflexion (bilateral). For each assessment time point, the percent change from baseline was calculated for each muscle group and handgrip strength. The muscle strength mega-score was calculated as the average of the changes (ie, percent change from baseline) observed for each muscle groups as well as handgrip strength. For this endpoint, negative values indicate a decline in muscle strength.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Patients with familial or sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis were enrolled at 73 sites in Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The first patient was screened on 23 October 2012 and the last subject completed follow-up on 21 March 2014.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 711 patients were enrolled in the study and began treatment with open-label tirasemtiv during the 7-day lead-in phase of the study. Patients who completed this phase were randomized (1:1) to receive either placebo (N=295) or tirasemtiv (N=301) in the double-blind treatment period.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Per El Escorial criteria, ALS was diagnosed as: Possible (upper motor neuron [UMN] and lower motor neuron [LMN] signs in 1 region, or UMN signs in at least 2 regions, or UMN and LMN signs in 2 regions with no UMN signs rostral to LMN signs); Probable, Laboratory Supported (UMN signs in 1 or more regions and LMN signs defined by electromyography in at least 2 regions); Probable (UMN and LMN signs in 2 regions with some UMN signs rostral to the LMN signs); and Definite (UMN and LMN signs in 3 regions).
The El Escorial criteria do not relate to grading of ALS nor to outcome.</description>

        <title>The Change From Baseline in ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) Total Score to the Average of Values Obtained at the End of Weeks 8 and 12 of Double-blind Treatment</title>
        <description>The ALSFRS-R is used to measure the progression and severity of disease; it consists of 12 questions, assessing a patient's capability and independence in functional activities relevant to ALS, categorized in 4 domains: gross motor tasks, fine motor tasks, bulbar functions, and respiratory function. Each question is scored from 0 (indicating incapable or dependent) to 4 (normal). The total score ranges from 0 to 48, with higher scores reflecting more normal function and lower scores reflecting more impaired function.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Handgrip Fatigability (at 60% of Target in the Weaker Hand) to the Average of Values Obtained at the End of Weeks 8 and 12 of Double-blind Treatment</title>
        <description>Handgrip fatigability was measured immediately following determination of maximum handgrip strength (via an electronic hand dynamometer). Once maximum handgrip strength was achieved, the force of the grip was timed for 2 minutes or until the grip strength had dropped to 60% of the maximum, whichever came first.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Muscle Strength Mega-Score Based on Percent Change in Muscle Strength Measurements to the Average at the End of Weeks 8 and 12 of Double-blind Treatment</title>
        <description>A hand-held dynamometer (HHD), with a scale of 0 to 300 pounds, was used to measure muscle strength and handgrip strength (bilateral); the muscle groups tested were: elbow flexion (bilateral), wrist extension (bilateral), knee extension (bilateral), and ankle dorsiflexion (bilateral). For each assessment time point, the percent change from baseline was calculated for each muscle group and handgrip strength. The muscle strength mega-score was calculated as the average of the changes (ie, percent change from baseline) observed for each muscle groups as well as handgrip strength. For this endpoint, negative values indicate a decline in muscle strength.</description>
