  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lumbar fusion has been widely used for spinal disorders when conservative treatment has
      failed. However, a number of studies have reported that the rate of re-operation is high for
      lumbar fusion surgery. Swelling, atrophy or fat infiltration of the paraspinal muscles at the
      surgery site can cause weakness and pain. After fusion, the range of motion is constrained at
      the fused spine and might facilitate compensative movement of the adjacent levels and
      increase degeneration rate of the spine.

      Evidence has shown that core muscles play an important role to stabilize and support the
      spine. Whether core stability exercise can enhance spinal stability after lumbar fusion
      surgery remains unclear. Therefore, the overall goal of this proposed research is to
      investigate how core muscles affect outcomes after lumbar spinal fusion. The investigators
      will explore this issue hierarchically and systematically in 3-year duration.

        All subjects will be recruited from the National Taiwan University Hospital and Far Eastern
        Memorial Hospital. The study is approved by the Institutional Medical Research Ethics
        Committees in both National Taiwan University Hospital and Far Eastern Memorial Hospital.
        Our neurological surgeon will response for subject screening and medical diagnose.
        According to the power analysis, fifty subjects will be enrolled in this study. The
        eligible subject will be given the subjects informed consent and sign it before the
        enrollment.
