    <textblock>
      Nearly 1 in 10 older Veterans have dementia, which is a devastating condition that leads to a
      progressive loss of independence and functional status. Currently available dementia
      medications do not alter the disease course. Therefore, it is critically important to
      identify effective strategies for helping older Veterans living with dementia to enhance
      their functional status and quality of life. The investigators have developed a novel,
      integrative group movement program called Preventing Loss of Independence through Exercise
      (PLIE) that incorporates elements from Eastern and Western exercise modalities and is
      designed to build and maintain the capacity to perform basic functional movements while
      increasing mindful body awareness and enhancing social connection. Pilot study results
      suggested that PLIE is associated with meaningful improvements in physical function,
      cognitive function and quality of life as well as reduced caregiver burden. The goal of the
      current study is to perform a full-scale randomized, controlled trial to test the efficacy of
      PLIE in older Veterans with dementia.

      The goal of the proposed study is to perform a randomized, controlled trial (RCT) to test the
      efficacy of a novel integrative group movement program called Preventing Loss of Independence
      through Exercise (PLIE) on function and quality of life in older Veterans living in the
      community with dementia. Dementia is a devastating condition that affects nearly 1 in 10
      older Veterans (~1 million individuals). Current dementia medications have minimal impact on
      function and quality of life and do not stop or slow the disease course; however, there is
      growing evidence that behavioral interventions such as exercise have a variety of beneficial
      effects in individuals with dementia. PLIE was developed based on recent discoveries in
      neuroscience and experimental psychology that have found that, although explicit memory (the
      ability to consciously recall new information) is impaired in individuals with dementia,
      implicit memory (unconscious learning that typically occurs through repeated exposure) is
      relatively preserved. Therefore, PLIE focuses on training procedural memory (unconscious
      learning of procedures) to build the strength and capacity to perform the movements that are
      most needed for daily function (e.g., transitioning safely from sitting to standing). In
      addition, to maximize the benefits of the training, PLIE integrates elements of Eastern and
      Western exercise modalities to develop mindful body awareness and enhance social connection.
      The investigators completed a pilot study of the PLIE program at an adult day center in San
      Francisco, CA, finding that it was associated with clinically meaningful improvements in
      cognitive function, physical performance and quality of life as well as reduced caregiver
      burden when compared with usual care at the facility. The current study will enable the
      investigators to build on these pilot study results by performing a full-scale RCT at adult
      day centers in Northern California. Most VA Medical Centers currently contract with
      community-based organizations to provide adult day care to eligible Veterans with dementia.
      Therefore, sites for the current study will be adult day centers that have current contracts
      with local VA medical centers. Within each center, study participants will be randomly
      assigned to receive the PLIE intervention program (1 hour, 2-3 days/week, 4 months) or Usual
      Care (UC) control (standard center activities, 1 hour, 2-3 days/week, 4 months) (N=120,
      60/group) using a waitlist design. The co-primary outcomes are 4-month change in physical
      function (Short Physical Performance Battery, SPPB), cognitive function (Alzheimer's Disease
      Assessment Scale - cognitive subscale, ADAS-cog) and quality of life (Quality of Life in
      Alzheimer's Disease, QOL-AD). Changes in caregiver feelings (Caregiver Burden Inventory, CBI;
      Positive Aspects of Caregiving, PAC), mood (Geriatric Depression Scale, GDS), fear of falling
      (Falls Efficacy Scale, FES), independence (Disability Assessment for Dementia, DAD) and
      dementia-related behaviors (Neuropsychiatric Inventory, NPI) will be examined as secondary
      outcomes. To account for the waitlist design, all outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 4
      months and 8 months. The proposed project will address a critically important Veterans'
      health problem related to optimizing functional status and quality of life in older Veterans
      with dementia. It is directly responsive to Request for Applications (RFA) RX-14-011 (RR&amp;D
      Merit Review Award for Research on Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Parkinson's Disease and
      Alzheimer's Disease), which has identified &quot;pioneering new and innovative rehabilitation
      methodologies to restore function and improve quality of life for Veterans living with
      [these] neurodegenerative diseases&quot; as a &quot;major focus.&quot; Many patients and caregivers
      currently feel that little is being done to help individuals with dementia maintain function
      and quality of life. The current study will utilize rigorous research methods to test the
      efficacy of an innovative and promising new program for older adults with dementia. If the
      program is successful, the investigators will work with VA and community-based organizations
      to implement PLIE more broadly.

    <measure>Quality of Life Scale in Alzheimer's Disease (QOL-AD)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Quality of Life Scale in Alzheimer's Disease (QOL-AD) is a standard quality of life measure that asks parallel questions of affected individuals and caregivers. Current quality of life is rated as poor (1 point), fair (2 points), good (3 points) or excellent (4 points) in 13 areas: physical health, energy, mood, living situation, memory, family, marriage, friends, self as a whole, ability to do chores around the house, ability to do things for fun, money, and life as a whole. Scores may range from 13 to 52 with higher scores reflecting better quality of life. Prior studies have found that the QOL-AD is a valid and reliable measure, with Cronbach's alpha of 0.84 for patient reports and 0.86 for caregiver reports and interrater reliability based on Cohen's kappa values &gt;0.70.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB)-Modified</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The SPPB was developed by the National Institute on Aging to provide an objective tool for measuring physical performance in older adults. Lower body strength is assessed based on time to complete 5 chair stands without using arms. Balance is assessed based on the ability to hold different stands for 10 seconds, including the side-by-side, semi-tandem and full tandem stands. Mobility is assessed based on usual walking speed over a 3-meter walking course. The total SPPB score is the sum of the 3 component scores and may range from 0 to 12. Higher scores reflect better performance.</description>

    <measure>Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-cog)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) is one of the most commonly used outcome measures in dementia drug treatment trials and is one of the measures considered by the Food and Drug Administration for approval of dementia medications. It includes direct assessment of learning (10-word list), naming (objects), following commands, constructional praxis (figure copying), ideational praxis (mailing a letter), orientation (person, time, place), recognition memory and remembering test instructions. Scores may range from 0 to 70 with higher scores reflecting worse cognitive function. Prior studies have found the ADAS-cog to be valid and reliable with Cronbach's alpha greater than 0.8 and test-retest reliability above 0.9.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Caregiver Burden Inventory (CBI)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Caregiver Burden Inventory (CBI) is a standard measure that includes 24 items and 5 domains. Caregivers are asked to rate how often each statement describes their feelings (never, rarely, sometimes, quite frequently, nearly always). The total score may range from 0 to 96 with higher scores reflecting greater feelings of burden.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disability Assessment for Dementia (DAD)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Disability Assessment for Dementia (DAD) is a standard measure of functional independence that asks caregivers whether the participant performed 17 basic and 23 instrumental activities of daily living over the past 2 weeks without reminder or assistance. Each item is rated as yes, no, or not applicable (i.e., never performed, no opportunity to perform). The score reflects the percent of items performed independently, excluding those that were not applicable. Therefore, scores may range from 0 to 100 with higher scores reflecting greater independence. The DAD has high established validity and high test-retest reliability (ICC, 0.96), inter-rater reliability (ICC, 0.95) and internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha, 0.96).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neuropsychiatric Inventory - Frequency*Severity (NPI-FS)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Neuropsychiatric Inventory - Frequency*Severity subscale (NPI-FS) assesses the frequency and severity of 12 common dementia-related behaviors (delusions, hallucinations, agitation/aggression, depression/dysphoria, anxiety, elation/euphoria, apathy/indifference, disinhibition, irritability/lability, aberrant motor behavior, sleep and appetite/eating) by caregiver report. NPI-FS was calculated by multiplying the frequency*severity of behaviors, which had a range of 0-144. Higher scores indicate worse outcomes (greater frequency/severity).</description>

          <title>Participant MOCA Score</title>
          <description>Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) is a standard measure of global cognitive function in which scores may range from 0 to 30 with higher scores indicating better cognitive function and scores less than 26 indicating cognitive impairment.</description>
          <population>The MOCA was administered immediately after obtaining informed consent and was missing for 2 participants. The baseline assessment was typically performed at a separate visit. Some participants withdrew after consenting but before completing the baseline assessment, and their scores are included.</population>

        <title>Quality of Life Scale in Alzheimer's Disease (QOL-AD)</title>
        <description>The Quality of Life Scale in Alzheimer's Disease (QOL-AD) is a standard quality of life measure that asks parallel questions of affected individuals and caregivers. Current quality of life is rated as poor (1 point), fair (2 points), good (3 points) or excellent (4 points) in 13 areas: physical health, energy, mood, living situation, memory, family, marriage, friends, self as a whole, ability to do chores around the house, ability to do things for fun, money, and life as a whole. Scores may range from 13 to 52 with higher scores reflecting better quality of life. Prior studies have found that the QOL-AD is a valid and reliable measure, with Cronbach's alpha of 0.84 for patient reports and 0.86 for caregiver reports and interrater reliability based on Cohen's kappa values &gt;0.70.</description>

        <title>Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB)-Modified</title>
        <description>The SPPB was developed by the National Institute on Aging to provide an objective tool for measuring physical performance in older adults. Lower body strength is assessed based on time to complete 5 chair stands without using arms. Balance is assessed based on the ability to hold different stands for 10 seconds, including the side-by-side, semi-tandem and full tandem stands. Mobility is assessed based on usual walking speed over a 3-meter walking course. The total SPPB score is the sum of the 3 component scores and may range from 0 to 12. Higher scores reflect better performance.</description>

It includes direct assessment of learning (10-word list), naming (objects), following commands, constructional praxis (figure copying), ideational praxis (mailing a letter), orientation (person, time, place), recognition memory and remembering test instructions. Scores may range from 0 to 70 with higher scores reflecting worse cognitive function. Prior studies have found the ADAS-cog to be valid and reliable with Cronbach's alpha greater than 0.8 and test-retest reliability above 0.9.</description>

        <title>Disability Assessment for Dementia (DAD)</title>
        <description>The Disability Assessment for Dementia (DAD) is a standard measure of functional independence that asks caregivers whether the participant performed 17 basic and 23 instrumental activities of daily living over the past 2 weeks without reminder or assistance. Each item is rated as yes, no, or not applicable (i.e., never performed, no opportunity to perform). The score reflects the percent of items performed independently, excluding those that were not applicable. Therefore, scores may range from 0 to 100 with higher scores reflecting greater independence. The DAD has high established validity and high test-retest reliability (ICC, 0.96), inter-rater reliability (ICC, 0.95) and internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha, 0.96).</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>Final enrollment lower than planned due to: 1) unexpected study site relocation and 2) enrollment difficulty at one study site. In addition, withdrawal was higher than anticipated primarily due to declining health status unrelated to the study.</limitations_and_caveats>
