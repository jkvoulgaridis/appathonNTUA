  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, phase 1 dose escalation study of BBI503 monotherapy, or
      BBI503 in combination with Sorafenib. This study population is adult patients with advanced
      solid tumors in monotherapy, or adult patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma in
      combination therapy.
