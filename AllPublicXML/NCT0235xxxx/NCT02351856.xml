      This is a rollover study designed to investigate the safety and effectiveness of
      investigational study drug ARRY-371797 in patients who previously received ARRY-371797 in a
      study for patients with LMNA-related dilated cardiomyopathy sponsored by Array BioPharma and
      may, in the Investigator's opinion, derive benefit from continued treatment.
