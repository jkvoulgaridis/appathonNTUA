  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of a novel nicotine product
      for continuous abstinence from smoking. Efficacy of product will be evaluated by assessments
      of self-reported abstinence, verified by exhaled carbon monoxide (CO) levels.

        <description>Participants were asked if during the last 24 hours they experienced each of 7 withdrawal symptoms on a 5-grade categorical scale of 0 - 4 (where 0=not at all and 4=extremely so). The aggregated withdrawal symptom score was the sum of the scores of the 7 withdrawal symptoms (irritability-frustration-anger, restlessness, difficulty concentrating, anxiety, dysphoric or depressed mood, insomnia, and increased appetite). The total scores are reported with a minimum possible score of 0 and a maximum possible score of 28.</description>
