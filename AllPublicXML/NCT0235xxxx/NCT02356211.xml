      Objective To reduce subsequent falls following Multifactorial Falls Assessment Design:
      Prospective Case Control

      Population: Frail elderly Veteran outpatient population referred for falls assessment

      Methods: Prospective controlled trial of Geriatric Multifactorial Falls Assessment Clinic
      patients followed for 1 year and outcomes compared to Acute Geriatric Evaluation and
      Management (GEM) Inpatient Unit discharge control group.

  <detailed_description>

      We designed a prospective controlled trial to compare the effectiveness of outpatient falls
      assessment and treatment for community-dwelling frail elderly patients with history of falls
      referred to an active management Geriatric Multifactorial Falls Assessment Clinic with a
      control group of patients discharged from an Acute Geriatric Evaluation and Management (GEM)
      Inpatient Unit during the same time period, but who were not specifically referred for falls
      assessment. We hypothesized that a population of frail elderly referred by their primary care
      physicians and who reported for evaluation to a Geriatric Multifactorial Falls Assessment
      Clinic would show a reduction in falls compared to controls, when provided a time-limited
      consult evaluation with active follow-up for 1 year.

    <description>The Geriatric Multifactorial Falls Assessment Clinic is a component of GERIATRIC-PACT, a frail-elderly primary care patient-centered medical home with care provided by an inter-professional teamlet consisting of a geriatrician, geriatric nurse practitioner, clinical pharmacist, licensed practical nurse, nurse care manager, social worker, and dietitian. GERIATRIC-PACT operates with increased ancillary support compared to Primary Care PACT. Falls assessment patients were referred by primary care providers and were evaluated and treated by the GERIATRIC-PACT teamlet, including ordering of tests and medication adjustment, with an average of two visits and active follow-up for one year.</description>
