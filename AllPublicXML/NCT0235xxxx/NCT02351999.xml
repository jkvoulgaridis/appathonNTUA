  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective, multi-center, non-randomized single arm interventional
      investigation with the TSP Crosser Transseptal Access System, a new complete solution for
      transseptal puncture and left atrial access and catheter navigation, for patients with atrial
      fibrillation ablation referred for radiofrequency catheter ablation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transseptal (TS) catheterization is a critical step for left atrial (LA) interventions
      (atrial fibrillation ablation, LA appendage closure, mitral valve interventions). The
      availability of suitable tools and techniques is essential to safely perform the TS puncture,
      effectively deliver radiofrequency lesions, deploy LA devices, and anticipate difficult
      procedural situations in which complications may arise. This study is intended to assess the
      safety, performance and usability of the TSP Crosser System in facilitating access to the
      left atrium and catheter navigation to the pulmonary veins (PV) during catheter based
      ablation procedures for the treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF). Moreover, the study will
      assess the impact of the TSP Crosser System on procedural times, including time to achieve
      left atrial accesses, total procedure times, total fluoroscopy time, left atrial mapping time
      and radiofrequency isolation times. The study is a prospective, multicenter, non-randomized
      single arm interventional investigation. Enrolled subjects who meet the study
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be evaluated during the catheter mapping and ablation
      procedures and followed until release from hospital post procedure per institutional standard
      of care. After 30 days, patient will be contacted by telephone to obtain information on their
      clinical condition and any adverse events; if necessary, a clinic visit may be performed when
      required by the physician.
