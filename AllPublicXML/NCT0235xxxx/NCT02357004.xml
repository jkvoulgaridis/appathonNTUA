    <textblock>
      The purpose of this protocol is test whether patients with hypertension refractory to
      antihypertensive treatment have evidence of excessive sympathetic (i.e., nervous system)
      activity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Refractory hypertension refers to high blood pressure that is failing conventional
      antihypertensive therapies. In a retrospective assessment of such patients in our clinic we
      observed that resting clinic heart rates were higher in patients with refractory hypertension
      compared to patients with controlled hypertension. This observation has led to the hypothesis
      that refractory hypertension is caused by excessive sympathetic output. This protocol is
      designed to test this hypothesis by comparing the BP response to carvedilol verses
      chlorthalidone in patients with refractory hypertension. If their extreme treatment
      resistance is neurogenic is etiology, a significantly larger BP response to carvedilol should
      occur compared to chlorthalidone.
