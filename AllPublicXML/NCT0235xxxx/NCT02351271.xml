    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to demonstrate the performance and safety of the Femtosecond
      laser-assisted anterior capsulotomy and lens fragmentation on human eyes using the FEMTO LDV
      Z8 compared to conventional technique in cataract surgery.

    <textblock>
      Cataract Surgery according to conventional procedure, with the exception of two steps
      (Capsulotomy and Lens Fragmentation) which are performed with a Femtosecond Laser in the
      study group. Used equipment for measurements is the same for both groups and in line with the
      normal equipment used for the conventional cataract treatment (group A) Cataract surgery will
      be performed conventionally, this means the capsulorhexis will be performed manually by a
      hook, and the lens extraction will be done by phacoemulsification. (group B)

    <description>Effective Phacoemulsification Time (EPT): EPT for eyes receiving Intervention A being statistically same or lower than EPT for eyes receiving Intervention B at p&lt;0.05 will be considered positive for superior efficacy of application of FEMTO LDV Z8 over the manual procedure
Effective Phaco Time is a unit. It is commonly understood in the area of cataract surgery to be the standard way to describe phaco energy during a procedure over different manufactured phaco devices.
Effective phaco time is the total phaco time at 100 percent phaco power. It can be less than the total foot-pedal time. Less EPT indicates proportionately less energy delivered to the eye thereby reducing the side effects of phaco power.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Ease of Phacoemulsification</measure>
    <time_frame>during surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Ease of phacoemulsification was performed as a subjective observation by the surgeon. Four classifications were possible: easy - phacoemulsification was fast and uncomplicated; 'slight resistance' - phacoemulsification encountered some difficulty; 'resistance noted' - phacoemulsification was somewhat complex; 'difficult' - phacoemulsification was difficult and complex to complete.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Complete Treatment Pattern</measure>
    <time_frame>during surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Completeness of capsulotomy is a subjective metric given by the surgeon. Measurements were scaled into the following four categories: 1: complete treatment pattern; 2: micro-adhesion; 3: incomplete treatment pattern; 4: complete pattern but not continuous. &quot;Complete treatment pattern&quot; is considered the best result, &quot;micro adhesion&quot; indicates a minor but manageable problem, &quot;incomplete treatment pattern&quot; indicates a treatable, but more complex suboptimal outcome and &quot;complete treatment but discontinuous pattern&quot; indicates the treatable but suboptimal outcome.</description>

    <description>Safety will be assessed by evaluating observed and/or reported device and non-device related Adverse Events and/or Adverse Device Effects between treatment intervention groups A and B. No serious adverse events were reported. One AE in the femto group and two in the manual group were reported.</description>

          <description>Effective Phacoemulsification Time (EPT): EPT for eyes receiving Intervention A being statistically same or lower than EPT for eyes receiving Intervention B at p&lt;0.05 will be considered positive for superior efficacy of application of FEMTO LDV Z8 over the manual procedure
Effective Phaco Time is a unit. It is commonly understood in the area of cataract surgery to be the standard way to describe phaco energy during a procedure over different manufactured phaco devices.
Effective phaco time is the total phaco time at 100 percent phaco power. It can be less than the total foot-pedal time. Less EPT indicates proportionately less energy delivered to the eye thereby reducing the side effects of phaco power.</description>
