  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, open-label, single arm study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      niraparib in ovarian cancer patients who have received three or four previous chemotherapy
      regimens. Niraparib is an orally active PARP inhibitor. Niraparib will be administered once
      daily continuously during a 28-day cycle. Health-related quality of life will be measured by
      Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG). Safety and tolerability will be
      assessed by clinical review of adverse events (AEs), physical examinations,
      electrocardiograms (ECGs), RECIST tumor assessments and safety laboratory values.

    <measure>Objective Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The ORR was defined as the percentage of participants achieving complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as assessed by the Investigator per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (version1.1). Primary Analysis Population comprised of participants who received 3 or 4 prior lines of therapy (LOT), had homologous recombination deficiency positive (HRDpos) tumors, had platinum-sensitive disease, and were poly(adenosine 5'-diphosphate [ADP]-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) naïve.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response (DoR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>DoR was defined as the time from first documentation of CR or PR until the time of first documentation of disease progression (PD) as assessed by the Investigator per RECIST (version1.1). DoR was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier (KM) method.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>ORR by HRD Status and Breast Cancer Gene (BRCA) Status</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The ORR was defined as the percentage of participants achieving CR or PR as assessed by the Investigator per RECIST (version1.1). ORR was evaluated for participants with following characteristics: HRD status (positive, negative and unknown) and BRCA status (mutation positive, wild-type and unknown).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disease Control Rate (DCR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Disease control rate was defined as the percentage of participants achieving CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) as assessed by the Investigator per RECIST (version1.1). The exact (Clopper-Pearson) method was used to calculate 95% confidence interval.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression Free Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival was defined as the time from the date of first dose to the earlier date of assessment of progression or death by any cause in the absence of progression as assessed by the Investigator per RECIST (version 1.1) or clinical criteria.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Overall Survival was defined as the time from the date of the first dose to the date of death by any cause. It was calculated as [Date of Death minus First dose date plus 1] divided by 30.4375.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to First Subsequent Therapy (TFST)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Time to first subsequent therapy (TFST) was defined as the time from the date of first dose to the date of first subsequent therapy or death, whichever occurs first. It was calculated as (Earlier of [First dose of first subsequent therapy or death] minus First dose date plus 1) divided by 30.4375.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Any Non-serious Adverse Event (Non-SAE) or Any SAE</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence that occurs in a participant or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product, and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with study treatment. Any untoward event resulting in death, life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly or birth defect or any other situation according to medical or scientific judgment was categorized as SAE.</description>

      <recruitment_details>This was a Phase 2, open-label, single arm study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of niraparib in ovarian cancer participants who have received three or four previous chemotherapy regimens. The results of the study are based on primary analysis (up to 3 years).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 729 participants were screened, of which 463 participants received study treatment, niraparib.</pre_assignment_details>

Primary Analysis Population comprised of participants who received 3 or 4 prior lines of therapy (LOT), had homologous recombination deficiency positive (HRDpos) tumors, had platinum-sensitive disease, and were poly(adenosine 5'-diphosphate [ADP]-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) naïve.</description>
