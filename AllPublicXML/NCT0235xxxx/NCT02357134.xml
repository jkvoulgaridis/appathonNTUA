  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well high-flow oxygen works in reducing difficulty
      breathing during exercise (exertional dyspnea) in patients with cancer. Dyspnea is linked to
      decreased lung function, quality of life, and survival. High-flow oxygen is a device that
      delivers heated and humidified oxygen through the nose. This may be effective in reducing
      dyspnea, and may help patients' lungs function better and improve their quality of life.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Obtain preliminary estimates of the effect size of oxygen and high flow rate on exertional
      dyspnea (modified Borg Scale adjusted for work rate and baseline dyspnea).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the completion rate of a randomized controlled trial of exertional dyspnea in
      cancer patients.

      II. Obtain preliminary estimates of the effects of oxygen and flow rate on physiologic
      function (respiratory rate and oxygen saturation) and exercise capacity (work rate and
      exercise duration).

      OUTLINE: All patients undergo a baseline structured exercise session with air. Patients are
      then randomized to 1 of 4 treatments for a second session approximately 3 days later.

      ARM I: Patients receive high-flow oxygen via nasal prongs during a structured stationary
      bicycle exercise session.

      ARM II: Patients receive high-flow air via nasal prongs during a structured stationary
      bicycle exercise session.

      ARM III: Patients receive low-flow oxygen via a nasal cannula during a structured stationary
      bicycle exercise session.

      ARM IV: Patients receive low-flow air via a nasal cannula during structured stationary
      bicycle exercise session.

    <description>Dyspnea Borg score is a 0 to 10 categorical scale for rating the severity of dyspnea by the patient.

    <measure>Effects of Oxygen and Flow Rate on Physiologic Function</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to day 3 (during structured exercise)</time_frame>
    <description>The effect of the flow rate (i.e., the adjusted mean difference between high and low flow) can be calculated as b1 for ambient air and b1 + b3 for oxygen. Similarly, the effect of oxygen can be calculated as b2 for low flow and b2 + b3 for high flow.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to day 3 (during structured exercise)</time_frame>
    <description>To measure the effects of oxygen and flow rate on exercise capacity, mixed-effects linear models will be used.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to day 3 (after intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events will be assessed using a numeric rating scale from 0 to 10 before and after intervention. Differences in these scores for each type of adverse event will be analyzed using general linear models.</description>
