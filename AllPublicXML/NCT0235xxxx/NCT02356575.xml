  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine which of two treatments (acupuncture or cognitive
      behavioral therapy) works better for treating insomnia in cancer survivors. The investigator
      also wants to study the factors that might impact why someone might prefer or do better in
      one treatment over the other.

      Group 1 will get Acupuncture - Acupuncture is an ancient Chinese Technique of using very thin
      needles inserted in the skin to treat different symptoms and illness, and to promote healing.

      Group 2 will get Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) - CBT-I is a treatment to
      address behaviors and thoughts that are known to effect problems with sleep.

    <measure>Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) at Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>At Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) is one of the few well-validated patient-reported outcome measure designed to specifically assess the impact on daytime functioning and the amount of associated distress. The ISI includes 7 items that are scored on a five-point scale ranging from 0 to 4 with higher scores representing more severe insomnia symptoms. The optimal cutoff scores are 0-7 (no clinically significant sleep difficulties), 8-14 (sleep difficulties warrant further investigation), and 15+ (presence of clinically significant insomnia). Maximum score on this scale is 28.</description>

    <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index was specifically designed for use in clinical populations to assess seven component scores (subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication, and daytime dysfunction) and a global score. It consists of 19 self-rated questions that are scored on a 0 to 3 scale over a period of one month, whereby 3 reflects the negative extreme on the Likert Scale. A global sum of 5 or greater indicates a &quot;poor&quot; sleeper. Overall score ranges from 0 to 21.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  English-speaking, age ≥ 18 years old

          -  A diagnosis of cancer with no restrictions placed on type of cancer or stage.
             Eligibility criteria are not be restricted to MSK confirmed biopsy/diagnosis.
             Participating institution's testing is sufficient for other study sites.

          -  Completed active treatment (surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiotherapy) at least one
             month prior to study initiation (patients on continued hormone treatment or
             maintenance targeted therapies will not be excluded).

          -  A score &gt;7 on our primary outcome (the Insomnia Severity Index)

          -  A diagnosis of insomnia disorder as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
             of Mental disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5), per the diagnostic interview. According to
             this nosology, insomnia is defined as dissatisfaction with sleep quality or quantity
             characterized by difficulty initiating sleep, maintaining sleep, or early morning
             awakenings that cause significant distress or impairment in daytime functioning and
             occur at least three nights per week for at least three months despite adequate
             opportunity for sleep.

          -  Patients using psychotropic medication (e.g. antidepressants) will remain eligible for
             study participation provided that the dose was not recently altered (stable over the
             previous 6-weeks).

          -  Patients using hypnotics or sedatives will be eligible for study participation.
             Considering the high use of benzodiazepines within the oncology population, past
             research has included participants who met diagnostic criteria for insomnia, despite
             the use of benzodiazepines, and included monitoring of medication use.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Another sleep disorder, other than sleep apnea, that is not adequately treated.

          -  Previous experience with CBT or acupuncture to treat insomnia

          -  Currently participating in another acupuncture trial or a trial to treat insomnia

          -  The presence of another Axis I disorder not in remission

          -  Employment in a job requiring shift work that would impair the ability to establish a
             regular sleep schedule

        <description>The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) is one of the few well-validated patient-reported outcome measure designed to specifically assess the impact on daytime functioning and the amount of associated distress. The ISI includes 7 items that are scored on a five-point scale ranging from 0 to 4 with higher scores representing more severe insomnia symptoms. The optimal cutoff scores are 0-7 (no clinically significant sleep difficulties), 8-14 (sleep difficulties warrant further investigation), and 15+ (presence of clinically significant insomnia). Maximum score on this scale is 28.</description>

          <title>Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) Change From Baseline at 8 Weeks</title>
          <description>A greater negative value represents improvement in symptoms.
The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) is one of the few well-validated patient-reported outcome measure designed to specifically assess the impact on daytime functioning and the amount of associated distress. The ISI includes 7 items that are scored on a five-point scale ranging from 0 to 4 with higher scores representing more severe insomnia symptoms. The optimal cutoff scores are 0-7 (no clinically significant sleep difficulties), 8-14 (sleep difficulties warrant further investigation), and 15+ (presence of clinically significant insomnia). Maximum score on this scale is 28.</description>

        <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index was specifically designed for use in clinical populations to assess seven component scores (subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication, and daytime dysfunction) and a global score. It consists of 19 self-rated questions that are scored on a 0 to 3 scale over a period of one month, whereby 3 reflects the negative extreme on the Likert Scale. A global sum of 5 or greater indicates a &quot;poor&quot; sleeper. Overall score ranges from 0 to 21.</description>

        <title>Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory-Short Form (MFSI-SF) Change From Baseline at Week 20</title>
        <description>A greater negative value represents improvement in symptoms.
A 30 item self-report measure comprised of five subscales (general, emotional, physical, mental, vigor) and a total fatigue score. We reported the total fatigue score by summing all the items. Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory-Short Form / MFSI-SF total score ranges from 0 to 120 with higher score indicates more fatigue.</description>

        <description>The 10-item Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Global Health Scale (PROMIS® Global 10) was used to assess key quality of life domains including pain, fatigue, mental health, physical health, social health, and overall health. There are two 4-item domains: global physical health (domain score ranges from 4 to 20) and global mental health (domain score ranges from 4 to 20). Higher score indicates better quality of life. A greater positive value represents improvement in symptoms from baseline.</description>
