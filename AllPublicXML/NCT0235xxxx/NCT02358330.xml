  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Smoking is the leading preventable cause of cancer mortality in the US. Despite its profound
      health and economic costs, smoking treatment is infrequently provided in healthcare settings,
      and when provided, it is not sufficiently effective. To address this, this project will
      develop and evaluate more efficient electronic health record (EHR) methods to identify
      smokers and engage them in evidence-based treatment.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Specifically, this Project will develop and test new EHR enhancements and associated
      healthcare practices that are designed to efficiently identify smokers and recruit them into
      a chronic care treatment for smoking (which will be developed and evaluated in Projects 2-4).
      The EHR enhancements will include: 1) smoker identification and documentation aids, 2) a
      &quot;Smoker Registry&quot; (which stores relevant data on smokers and facilitates tracking their
      smoking status over time), 3) a 1-click system to refer smokers to the chronic care treatment
      for smoking, 4) a closed-loop function to provide EHR feedback to clinicians on the outcomes
      of their referrals, and 5) communications resources to inform smokers of treatment options
      and to increase their recruitment into treatment. The effects of the EHR-based enhancements
      and the chronic care smoking treatment will be evaluated with a multiple baseline design
      involving 18 primary care clinics in three healthcare systems in Wisconsin; all participants
      for affiliated clinical research Projects will be recruited from these clinics. This highly
      innovative research will evaluate the impact of an integrated set of EHR enhancements—coupled
      with a chronic care approach to smoking treatment—on smoker identification, and smoking
      treatment referral and engagement. In addition, this research will explore factors that
      influence the use of EHR-based enhancements in clinics. In sum, this research will develop a
      set of EHR-based health system enhancements that increase both the adoption of chronic care
      treatment by healthcare systems and smokers' engagement in that treatment.

    <description>A set of standard EHR modifications will be implemented in 18 clinics as part of the MBD (multiple baseline design) experiment.The key new EHR functions that will be implemented and tested are: 1) a modified &quot;screen for smoking sta-tus&quot; to enhance the identification and documentation of all smokers visiting targeted primary care clinics; 2) a &quot;Smoker Registry&quot; to track smokers, document their receipt of treatment services, and organize direct-to-consumer communications; 3) a 1-click referral system to evidence-based smoking treat-ment with UW-CTRI case managers; 4) a closed-loop feedback feature to communicate to the clinician the fate of a referral, documenting receipt of the referral and treatment engagement; and 5) EHR-based communication options to inform smokers of treatment resources</description>

    <description>10 control clinics will also be inducted into the study. These clinics will use existing EHR resources to identify smokers (e.g., the expanded vital signs) and to document their smoking status, and then use the standard paper fax-to-quit methods to refer patients to the Wisconsin Tobacco Quit Line</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The clinics participating in the MBD experiment will be selected based on the
             following criteria:

               1. Size: clinics will be fairly large, including at least 4-6 clinicians, to ensure
                  adequate recruitment for clinical trials connected with thye EHR recruitment.

               2. Location: clinics will be concentrated in Southcentral and Southeastern Wisconsin
                  so that case managers from UW-CTRI Madison and Milwaukee research sites can
                  provide services at multiple clinics.

               3. Diversity: clinics from each of the two health systems will include both urban
                  and rural locations, and at least one high- and one low-SES clinic (based on
                  rates of Medicaid and uninsured patients).

               4. Independence: clinics will not share staff or be physically adjacent to one
                  another to combat bleeding of interventions across clinics (see 87 for the
                  independence requirement for MBD).

               5. All clinics will routinely collect the data that will serve as dependent
                  variables in the MBD design (this will be universal among the three health system
                  clinics).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any clinic not meeting the above inclusion criteria
