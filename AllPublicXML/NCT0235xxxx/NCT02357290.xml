  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children between the ages of 5-17 years old who have or display symptoms of emotional
      dysregulation (explosiveness, mood swings, irritability, and/or violent behavior) are invited
      to participate in a 12-week research study to determine the effectiveness and safety of the
      natural treatment N-acetylcysteine (NAC) for children with emotional and behavioral problems.
      After undergoing a comprehensive evaluation by medical doctors with a specialty in this area,
      children who are found eligible to participate in this research study will be treated with
      NAC. Following the evaluation period, this research study requires 12 weekly visits, either
      in our office or over the phone, in an effort to closely monitor each child's response to the
      medication. Eligible participants will receive study-related evaluations and weekly study
      visits with our study doctors at no cost.

      This will be a 12-week, open-label study of NAC in the treatment of bipolar disorder in
      children and adolescents. Subjects will include youth ages 5-17 years with a bipolar spectrum
      disorder (type I, II, or NOS), mixed, manic, or hypomanic state, according to the Diagnostic
      and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition DSM-5 (American Psychiatric
      Association, 2013). The primary outcome measures will be improvement in manic symptoms as
      measured by the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) and improvement in depressive symptoms as
      measured by the Child Depression Rating Scale (CDRS).

      Bipolar diagnoses will be made according to the DSM-5 in a clinical evaluation by a Child
      Psychiatrist and confirmed using the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for
      School-Age Children - Epidemiological Version (K-SADS-E)(Orvaschel, 1994). All subjects must
      have a YMRS score of at least 15. Only patients who are not responding to their current
      treatment regimen will be tapered from their medications; youth on concomitant psychiatric
      medications will be permitted to continue those medications as listed in the concomitant
      medication section.

        <title>Mean Change in the Children's Depression Rating Scale (CDRS) Score</title>
        <description>The Children's Depression Rating Scale (CDRS) is a clinician-rated instrument with 17 items scored on a 1 to 5 or 1 to 7 scale. A rating of 1 indicates normal, thus the minimum score is 17. The maximum score is 113. Scores of 20-30 suggest borderline depression. Scores of 40-60 indicate moderate depression.</description>
