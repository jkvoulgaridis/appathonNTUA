      The widespread neonatal detection of cystic fibrosis in France since 2002 permits to treat
      children from birth. New treatments used for young children involve to assess efficacy
      criteria specific to this population. Standard respiratory function criteria for older
      children and adults is forced expiratory volume/second.

      This technique is not suited for preschool aged children (3 to 6 years old) because they are
      too old to be sedated and too young and immature to be able to make forced expiration
      technique that are correct, reproducible and prolonged during more than 1 second.

      For preschool aged children, in order to assess distal damage and her consequence, the
      evaluations are: airway resistance by debit interruption technic (Rint), plethysmographic
      measure of specific resistance (sRaw), functional residual capacity by Helium dilution
      technique (CRF He), arterial blood gas measurement, pulmonary clearance index.

      All these methods have a better success rate and can be used in alternative or with forced
      spirometry. However, each of them gives only a part of information on airway and lung damage
      of detected children. It is necessary to combine them for a better information on overall
      respiratory damage.

      In France, each respiratory function test laboratory uses one or any of these methods in
      addition to flow-volume curve, in function of his practices and his equipment.

      So, respiratory function test of preschool aged children is going to diversify more and more
      to the detriment of an homogeneity of practices between different centers.

      A referent population during a longitudinal multicenter monitoring on large cohorts that
      describe the evolution of pulmonary function, obtained by a standardized methodology is
      necessary to assess the efficacy of any new treatment. And, with the homogenization of care
      of children detected of cystic fibrosis in different centers, the description of natural
      evolution of pulmonary function by a standardized methodology will improve the discriminative
      power of measure of respiratory function to assess the presence of a worsening in
      preschool-aged children.
