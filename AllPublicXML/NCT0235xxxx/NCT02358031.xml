  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants with recurrent or metastatic (R/M) squamous cell cancer of the head and neck
      (HNSCC) will be randomly assigned to receive pembrolizumab monotherapy [pembro mono],
      pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy with a platinum-based drug (cisplatin or carboplatin) and
      5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) [pembro combo], or cetuximab plus a platinum-based drug (cisplatin or
      carboplatin) and 5-FU [control]. The overall primary study hypotheses are as follows in all
      participants and in participants with Programmed Cell Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1) positive
      expression defined by Combined Positive Score (CPS) ≥1 and CPS ≥20: 1) pembrolizumab
      monotherapy prolongs progression free survival (PFS) per Response Evaluation Criteria in
      Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR)
      and prolongs overall survival (OS) compared to standard treatment, and 2) pembrolizumab
      combination with chemotherapy prolongs PFS per RECIST 1.1 assessed by BICR and prolongs OS
      compared to standard treatment.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The 12 primary superiority hypotheses will be evaluated by comparing the pembro mono arm or
      pembro combo arm separately to the control arm, for PFS and OS in all first line (1L) R/M
      HNSCC participants and in 1L R/M HNSCC participants with positive PD-L1 expression (PD-L1 CPS
      ≥1 and CPS ≥20).

    <description>PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progressive disease (PD) per RECIST 1.1 based on BICR, or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Per RECIST 1.1, PD was defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum had to demonstrate an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions was also considered PD.
Per protocol, PFS in the pembro combo arm was compared to the control arm as a pre-specified primary analysis of the Intent-To-Treat (ITT) population. PFS is reported here for all participants in the pembro combo arm and control arm. Per protocol, PFS was compared separately between all participants of the pembro mono arm and control arm and is presented later in the record.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Participants with first line recurrent or metastatic (R/M) head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) were recruited to examine the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab monotherapy (pembro mono) versus pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy (pembro combo) versus cetuximab plus chemotherapy (control).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Of 1228 participants screened, 882 were randomized to the pembro mono arm, pembro combo arm, or control arm. 22 participants in the control arm that enrolled during an enrollment pause of the pembro combo arm were excluded from efficacy comparisons between the pembro combo arm and control arm.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Pembro Combo vs Control: Progression Free Survival (PFS) Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) in All Participants</title>
        <description>PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progressive disease (PD) per RECIST 1.1 based on BICR, or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Per RECIST 1.1, PD was defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum had to demonstrate an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions was also considered PD.
Per protocol, PFS in the pembro combo arm was compared to the control arm as a pre-specified primary analysis of the Intent-To-Treat (ITT) population. PFS is reported here for all participants in the pembro combo arm and control arm. Per protocol, PFS was compared separately between all participants of the pembro mono arm and control arm and is presented later in the record.</description>

        <population>All participants in the ITT population randomized to either the pembro combo arm or control arm during active enrollment were analyzed. 22 participants in the control arm enrolled during an enrollment pause of the pembro combo arm were excluded.

          <title>Pembro Combo vs Control: PFS Per RECIST 1.1 by BICR in Participants With Programmed Cell Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1) Combined Positive Score (CPS) ≥1</title>
          <description>PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first documented PD per RECIST 1.1 based on BICR, or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Per RECIST 1.1, PD was defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum had to demonstrate an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions was also considered PD.
Per protocol, PFS in the pembro combo arm was compared to the control arm as a pre-specified primary analysis of the ITT population. PFS is reported here for all participants in the pembro combo arm and control arm with PD-L1 biomarker positive expression defined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) as Combined Positive Score ≥1 (hereafter referred to as CPS ≥1). Per protocol, PFS was compared separately between CPS ≥1 participants of the pembro mono arm and control arm and is presented later in the record.</description>

Per RECIST 1.1, PD was defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum had to demonstrate an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions was also considered PD.

        <title>Pembro Mono vs Control: PFS Per RECIST 1.1 by BICR in Participants With PD-L1 CPS ≥20</title>
        <description>PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first documented PD per RECIST 1.1 based on BICR, or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Per RECIST 1.1, PD was defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum had to demonstrate an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions was also considered PD.
Per protocol, PFS in the pembro mono arm was compared to the control arm as a pre-specified primary analysis of the ITT population. PFS is reported here for all participants in the pembro mono arm and control arm with PD-L1 biomarker positive expression defined by IHC as CPS ≥20. Per protocol, PFS was compared separately between CPS ≥20 participants of the pembro combo arm and control arm and is presented earlier in the record.</description>

          <title>Pembro Mono vs Control: OS in Participants With PD-L1 CPS ≥20</title>
          <description>OS was defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause. Participants without documented death at the time of the final analysis were censored at the date of the last follow-up. Per protocol, OS in the pembro mono arm was compared to the control arm as a pre-specified primary analysis of the ITT population. OS is reported here for all participants in the pembro mono arm and control arm with PD-L1 biomarker positive expression defined by IHC as CPS ≥20. Per protocol, OS was compared separately between CPS ≥20 participants of the pembro combo arm and control arm and is presented earlier in the record.</description>

        <description>PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first documented PD per RECIST 1.1 based on BICR, or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Per RECIST 1.1, PD was defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum had to demonstrate an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions was also considered PD.
Per protocol, PFS in the pembro combo arm was compared to the control arm as a pre-specified secondary analysis of the ITT population. The percentage of participants with PFS (PFS rate) at 6 months is reported here out of all participants in the pembro combo arm and control arm. Per protocol, the percentage of participants with PFS at 6 months was compared separately between all participants of the pembro mono arm and control arm and is presented later in the record.</description>

          <title>Pembro Combo vs Control: Percentage of Participants With PFS at 12 Months Per RECIST 1.1 by BICR Among All Participants</title>
          <description>PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first documented PD per RECIST 1.1 based on BICR, or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Per RECIST 1.1, PD was defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum had to demonstrate an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions was also considered PD.
Per protocol, PFS in the pembro combo arm was compared to the control arm as a pre-specified secondary analysis of the ITT population. The percentage of participants with PFS (PFS rate) at 12 months is reported here out of all participants in the pembro combo arm and control arm. Per protocol, the percentage of participants with PFS at 12 months was compared separately between all participants of the pembro mono arm and control arm and is presented later in the record.</description>
          <population>All participants in the ITT population randomized to either the pembro combo arm or control arm during active enrollment were analyzed. 22 participants in the control arm enrolled during an enrollment pause of the pembro combo arm were excluded.

        <description>The EORTC-QLQ-C30 is a 30-item questionnaire developed to assess the quality of life of cancer patients. Participant responses to the Global Health Status (GHS) question &quot;How would you rate your overall health during the past week?&quot; (Item 29) and the Quality of Life (QoL) question &quot;How would you rate your overall quality of life during the past week?&quot; (Item 30) were scored on a 7-point scale (1=Very Poor to 7=Excellent). Using linear transformation, raw scores were standardized so that scores ranged from 0 to 100, with a higher score indicating a better overall outcome. Per protocol, change from baseline to Week 15 in the GHS/QoL combined score was compared between all participants of the pembro combo arm and the control arm as a pre-specified secondary analysis. As specified by the protocol, change from baseline to Week 15 in the GHS/QoL combined score was compared separately between all participants of the pembro mono arm and control arm and is presented later in the record.</description>

        <description>EORTC-QLQ-C30 is a 30-item questionnaire developed to assess the QoL of cancer patients. Participant responses to the GHS question &quot;How would you rate your overall health during the past week?&quot; (Item 29) and the QoL question &quot;How would you rate your overall quality of life during the past week?&quot; (Item 30) were scored on a 7-point scale (1=Very Poor to 7=Excellent). Raw scores were standardized by linear transformation so that scores ranged from 0 to 100, with a higher score indicating a better overall outcome. TTD in GHS/QoL defined as the time from baseline to the first onset of a ≥10 point decrease from baseline in GHS/QoL combined score, with confirmation. Per protocol, TTD in GHS/QoL combined score was compared between all participants of pembro combo arm and control arm as a pre-specified secondary analysis. Also per protocol, TTD in GHS/QoL combined score was compared separately between all participants of pembro mono arm and control arm and is presented later in the record.</description>

          <title>Pembro Combo vs Control: Time to Deterioration (TTD) in the EORTC QLQ-C30 Global Health Status/Quality of Life (Items 29 and 30) Combined Score (Kaplan-Meier Method)</title>
          <description>EORTC-QLQ-C30 is a 30-item questionnaire developed to assess the QoL of cancer patients. Participant responses to the GHS question &quot;How would you rate your overall health during the past week?&quot; (Item 29) and the QoL question &quot;How would you rate your overall quality of life during the past week?&quot; (Item 30) were scored on a 7-point scale (1=Very Poor to 7=Excellent). Raw scores were standardized by linear transformation so that scores ranged from 0 to 100, with a higher score indicating a better overall outcome. TTD in GHS/QoL defined as the time from baseline to the first onset of a ≥10 point decrease from baseline in GHS/QoL combined score, with confirmation. Per protocol, TTD in GHS/QoL combined score was compared between all participants of pembro combo arm and control arm as a pre-specified secondary analysis. Also per protocol, TTD in GHS/QoL combined score was compared separately between all participants of pembro mono arm and control arm and is presented later in the record.</description>
          <population>All participants in the pembro combo arm and the control arm who completed the EORTC QLQ-C30 and had received ≥1 dose of study drug. 20 in the control arm enrolled during an enrollment pause of the pembro combo arm were excluded. Per protocol, the pembro mono arm was compared to the control arm separately and not included in this analysis.</population>

        <title>Pembro Mono vs Control: Percentage of Participants With PFS at 6 Months Per RECIST 1.1 by BICR Among All Participants</title>
        <description>PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first documented PD per RECIST 1.1 based on BICR, or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Per RECIST 1.1, PD was defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum had to demonstrate an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions was also considered PD.
Per protocol, PFS in the pembro mono arm was compared to the control arm as a pre-specified secondary analysis of the ITT population. The percentage of participants with PFS (PFS rate) at 6 months is reported here out of all participants in the pembro mono arm and control arm. Per protocol, the percentage of participants with PFS at 6 months was compared separately between all participants of the pembro combo arm and control arm and is presented earlier in the record.</description>

          <title>Pembro Mono vs Control: Percentage of Participants With PFS at 6 Months Per RECIST 1.1 by BICR Among All Participants</title>
          <description>PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first documented PD per RECIST 1.1 based on BICR, or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Per RECIST 1.1, PD was defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum had to demonstrate an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions was also considered PD.
Per protocol, PFS in the pembro mono arm was compared to the control arm as a pre-specified secondary analysis of the ITT population. The percentage of participants with PFS (PFS rate) at 6 months is reported here out of all participants in the pembro mono arm and control arm. Per protocol, the percentage of participants with PFS at 6 months was compared separately between all participants of the pembro combo arm and control arm and is presented earlier in the record.</description>

The appearance of one or more new lesions was also considered PD.
Per protocol, PFS in the pembro mono arm was compared to the control arm as a pre-specified secondary analysis of the ITT population. The percentage of participants with PFS (PFS rate) at 12 months is reported here out of all participants with PD-L1 biomarker positive expression defined by IHC as CPS ≥1 in the pembro mono arm and control arm. Per protocol, the percentage of participants with PFS at 12 months was compared separately between CPS ≥1 participants of the pembro combo arm and control arm and is presented earlier in the record.</description>

          <title>Pembro Mono vs Control: ORR Per RECIST 1.1 by BICR in Participants With PD-L1 CPS ≥20</title>
          <description>ORR was defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population who have a CR (disappearance of all target lesions) or a PR (≥30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per RECIST 1.1. based upon BICR. Per protocol, ORR in the pembro mono arm was compared to the control arm as a pre-specified secondary analysis of the ITT population. The percentage of participants who experienced CR or PR is reported here as the ORR for all participants with PD-L1 biomarker positive expression defined by IHC as CPS ≥20 in the pembro mono arm and control arm. Per protocol, ORR was compared separately between CPS ≥20 participants of the pembro combo arm and control arm and is presented earlier in the record.</description>
          <population>All participants in the ITT population randomized to either the pembro mono arm or control arm during active enrollment with CPS ≥20 were analyzed. Per protocol, pembro combo arm was compared to control arm separately and not included in this analysis.</population>

        <title>Pembro Mono vs Control: Change From Baseline to Week 15 in the EORTC QLQ-C30 Global Health Status/Quality of Life (Items 29 and 30) Combined Score</title>
        <description>The EORTC-QLQ-C30 is a 30-item questionnaire developed to assess the quality of life of cancer patients. Participant responses to the GHS question &quot;How would you rate your overall health during the past week?&quot; (Item 29) and the QoL question &quot;How would you rate your overall quality of life during the past week?&quot; (Item 30) were scored on a 7-point scale (1=Very Poor to 7=Excellent). Using linear transformation, raw scores were standardized so that scores ranged from 0 to 100, with a higher score indicating a better overall outcome. Per protocol, change from baseline to Week 15 in the GHS/QoL combined score was compared between all participants of the pembro mono arm and the control arm as a pre-specified secondary analysis. As specified by the protocol, change from baseline to Week 15 in the GHS/QoL combined score was compared separately between all participants of the pembro combo arm and control arm and is presented earlier in the record.</description>

        <description>EORTC QLQ-H&amp;N35 is a 35-item questionnaire developed to assess QoL of head and neck cancer participants and consists of 7 multi-item scales that assess pain, swallowing, senses, speech, social eating, social contact and sexuality. Participant responses to the Pain scale (Items 31-34) were scored on a 4-point scale (1=Not at all to 4=Very much). Raw scores were standardized by linear transformation so that scores ranged from 0 to 100, with a higher score indicating more problems. TTD in EORTC QLQ-H&amp;N35 Pain Score defined as the time from baseline to the first onset of a ≥10 point decrease from baseline, with confirmation. Per protocol, TTD in EORTC QLQ-H&amp;N35 Pain Score was compared between all participants of pembro mono arm and control arm as a pre-specified secondary analysis.

          <title>Pembro Mono vs Control: TTD in the EORTC QLQ- H&amp;N35 Pain Score</title>
          <description>EORTC QLQ-H&amp;N35 is a 35-item questionnaire developed to assess QoL of head and neck cancer participants and consists of 7 multi-item scales that assess pain, swallowing, senses, speech, social eating, social contact and sexuality. Participant responses to the Pain scale (Items 31-34) were scored on a 4-point scale (1=Not at all to 4=Very much). Raw scores were standardized by linear transformation so that scores ranged from 0 to 100, with a higher score indicating more problems. TTD in EORTC QLQ-H&amp;N35 Pain Score defined as the time from baseline to the first onset of a ≥10 point decrease from baseline, with confirmation. Per protocol, TTD in EORTC QLQ-H&amp;N35 Pain Score was compared between all participants of pembro mono arm and control arm as a pre-specified secondary analysis. Also per protocol, TTD in EORTC QLQ-H&amp;N35 Pain Score was compared separately between all participants of pembro combo arm and control arm and is presented earlier in the record.</description>

        <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which did not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.
