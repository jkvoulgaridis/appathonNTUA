      This study is to collect human activity and electrocardiogram (ECG) data from heart failure
      (HF) patients to aid in the development of a novel chronotropic incompetence (CI) algorithm
      designed to diagnose CI in patients with HF.

      The Investigation of the Chronotropic Incompetence Diagnostic Algorithm in Heart Failure
      Patients (CI Algorithm Study) is an acute data collection study using market released
      actigraphy devices (wGT3X-BT) and holter devices (DR 180) to measure study subjects' daily
      activities and surface ECG data simultaneously. The data will be analyzed to develop an
      algorithm to diagnose CI in patients with HF.
