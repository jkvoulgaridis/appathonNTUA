  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to evaluate whether an innovative collaborative connected health
      (CCH) model increases access to specialists and improves patient outcomes. CCH offers
      multiple modalities for patients and primary care providers (PCPs) to access dermatologists
      online directly and asynchronously to maximize effectiveness in a real-world setting. CCH
      also fosters team care and patient engagement through active sharing of management plans and
      multidirectional, informed communication among patients, PCPs, and dermatologists. The
      specific aims of the proposal are to (1) determine whether the CCH model results in
      equivalent improvements in psoriasis disease severity compared to in-person care, (2)
      determine whether the CCH model results in equivalent improvements in quality of life and
      mental health compared to in-person care, and (3) assess whether the CCH model provides
      better access to care than in-person care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to conduct a 12-month, pragmatic, randomized controlled trial to
      evaluate the impact of a collaborative connected health model for psoriasis management
      compared to inperson care. The pragmatic trial will compare psoriasis severity,
      quality-of-life, mental health, and access-to-care between the two models. We will enroll 300
      psoriasis patients from Colorado and California. In addition to recruiting patients from the
      general population, we will place a specific emphasis on recruiting psoriasis patients living
      in rural and underserved communities. We will also recruit from the full disease spectrum of
      mild, moderate, and severe psoriasis patients. We will use an intention-to-treat approach to
      analyze outcomes and perform longitudinal data analysis using repeated measures approach to
      identify potential differences in the trend over time between the two arms. To evaluate the
      utility of CCH for increasing access from patients' and clinicians' perspective, the study
      team will conduct key informant interviews and use qualitative analytical techniques with
      investigator triangulation and member checking to enhance the validity of the conclusions.

    <measure>Improvement in Self-Administered Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (SA-PASI)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants are asked to complete self-administered Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (SA-PASI). SA-PASI combines the assessment of lesion severity (erythema, induration, and scale) and the affected areas into a single score between 0 (no disease) to 72 (maximal disease). The primary outcome of the study was the mean percent improvement in SA-PASI averaged over three, six, nine, and 12 months. The percent improvement in SA-PASI was defined as the difference in SA-PASI scores between the baseline and each of the follow-up visits divided by the SA-PASI score from the baseline visit.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Improvement in Quality of Life as Measured by Dermatology-Specific, Quality of Life Instruments</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life will be assessed using dermatology-specific, quality of life instruments, Skindex-16 and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). Scores for these assessments will be compared between patients randomized to the CCH model and in-person care.
Skindex-16 is a validated and reliable instrument that comprehensively captures the effects of skin disease on health-related quality of life. It discriminates among patients with different effects and is responsive to clinical changes over time. Skindex-16 scores range from 0 (no effect) to 100 (effect experienced all the time), and the responses are aggregated in symptoms, emotions, and functioning subscales.
The Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) is another validated dermatology-specific quality-of-life instrument that has been used in many psoriasis trials. DLQI scores range from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating more severe impact on quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Access to Care: Distance Traveled</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Access to care is an overall term to capture the transportation to care factors including total distance traveled to see a provider (round-trip driving distance from patient's home to provider's office multiplied by the number of in-person visits during the study period).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Depression Severity</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be assessed for depression severity using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ), a validated, self-administered diagnostic instrument for common mental disorders. The PHQ-9 score can range from 0 to 27 with 0 = &quot;No&quot; depression and 27 = &quot;Severe&quot; depression.
The PHQ is a validated, self-administered version of the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders (PRIME-MD) diagnostic instrument for common mental disorders. The PHQ-9 is the depression module, which scores each of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV) depression criteria as &quot;0&quot; (not at all) to &quot;3&quot; (nearly every day). A PHQ-9 score of 10 or greater has 89% sensitivity and 88% specificity for major depression. PHQ-9 scores of 5, 10, 15, and 20 represented mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression, respectively. PHQ-9 is a validated tool for diagnosis of depression and monitoring response to interventions.</description>

    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Body surface area (BSA) involvement and patient global assessment (PtGA) will be compared between the patients randomized to the CCH model and the in-person care.
The BSA assessment is a well-established, validated measure used by psoriasis patients to report percent body surface affected by psoriasis in numerous prior studies. BSA ranges from 0% (no involvement) to 100% (complete body surface affected). The PtGA is a validated instrument that measures the overall psoriasis severity from the patients' perspective.40 PtGA is an ordinal six-point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 5 (severe).</description>

        <title>Improvement in Self-Administered Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (SA-PASI)</title>
        <description>Participants are asked to complete self-administered Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (SA-PASI). SA-PASI combines the assessment of lesion severity (erythema, induration, and scale) and the affected areas into a single score between 0 (no disease) to 72 (maximal disease). The primary outcome of the study was the mean percent improvement in SA-PASI averaged over three, six, nine, and 12 months. The percent improvement in SA-PASI was defined as the difference in SA-PASI scores between the baseline and each of the follow-up visits divided by the SA-PASI score from the baseline visit.</description>

In this pragmatic trial, the PCPs could access the dermatologists online asynchronously via consultation or requesting a dermatologist to assume care of a patient’s psoriasis.
Patients randomized to the online group had the option of accessing dermatologists online asynchronously. During an online visit, the patient would upload clinical images and history and transmit the information to the dermatologist. Using the telehealth platform, the dermatologist would review the transmitted information, make treatment recommendations, prescribe medications, and provide educational materials</description>

        <title>Improvement in Quality of Life as Measured by Dermatology-Specific, Quality of Life Instruments</title>
        <description>Quality of life will be assessed using dermatology-specific, quality of life instruments, Skindex-16 and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). Scores for these assessments will be compared between patients randomized to the CCH model and in-person care.
Skindex-16 is a validated and reliable instrument that comprehensively captures the effects of skin disease on health-related quality of life. It discriminates among patients with different effects and is responsive to clinical changes over time. Skindex-16 scores range from 0 (no effect) to 100 (effect experienced all the time), and the responses are aggregated in symptoms, emotions, and functioning subscales.
The Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) is another validated dermatology-specific quality-of-life instrument that has been used in many psoriasis trials. DLQI scores range from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating more severe impact on quality of life.</description>

The PHQ is a validated, self-administered version of the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders (PRIME-MD) diagnostic instrument for common mental disorders. The PHQ-9 is the depression module, which scores each of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV) depression criteria as &quot;0&quot; (not at all) to &quot;3&quot; (nearly every day). A PHQ-9 score of 10 or greater has 89% sensitivity and 88% specificity for major depression. PHQ-9 scores of 5, 10, 15, and 20 represented mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression, respectively. PHQ-9 is a validated tool for diagnosis of depression and monitoring response to interventions.</description>

The BSA assessment is a well-established, validated measure used by psoriasis patients to report percent body surface affected by psoriasis in numerous prior studies. BSA ranges from 0% (no involvement) to 100% (complete body surface affected). The PtGA is a validated instrument that measures the overall psoriasis severity from the patients' perspective.40 PtGA is an ordinal six-point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 5 (severe).</description>
