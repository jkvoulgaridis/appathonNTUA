  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-dose, randomized, placebo-controlled, 3-way crossover study of 2 dosage
      strengths of lemborexant (5 mg and 10 mg) in participants with insomnia disorder.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will have 2 phases: Prerandomization and Randomization. The Prerandomization Phase
      will consist of 2 periods that taken together, will last up to a maximum of 21 days: a
      Screening Period and a Baseline Period. The Randomization Phase will comprise 4 treatment
      periods (Treatment 1, Treatment 2, Treatment 3, Treatment 4) with intervening washout periods
      between treatment periods (Washout 1, Washout 2, Washout 3). A single dose of study drug will
      be administered in a randomized, 3-way double-blind crossover manner at Treatment Periods
      1-3; flurazepam 30 mg will be administered in an open-label manner at Treatment Period 4.

    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 2 of each of three treatment periods that were separated by approximately 2 weeks (for a total of up to 4 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>SOL is defined as the length of time that it takes to accomplish the transition from full wakefulness to sleep. The multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) is a widely used method for objectively quantifying excessive, pathological, or pharmacologically induced residual sleepiness by measuring the number of minutes that it takes a participant to fall asleep. The MSLT was modified to include four Sleep Latency Tests (SLTs), with the first starting at 45 minutes after morning wake time, and the subsequent three occurring at 30-minute intervals for a total of 4 SLT's per M-MSLT. Each SLT was scored to determine the latency in minutes (with precision to 0.5 minute) from lights off to sleep onset; trials during which sleep onset did not occur were assigned a latency of 20 minutes. The four SLTs for each participant were averaged to obtain the mean SOL.</description>

             gastrointestinal, renal, psychiatric or neurological disease, or chronic pain) that in

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in the Average Sleep Onset Latency (SOL) From Modified-Multiple Sleep Latency Test (M-MSLT) for Each Treatment in Treatment Periods 1 to 3</title>
        <description>SOL is defined as the length of time that it takes to accomplish the transition from full wakefulness to sleep. The multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) is a widely used method for objectively quantifying excessive, pathological, or pharmacologically induced residual sleepiness by measuring the number of minutes that it takes a participant to fall asleep. The MSLT was modified to include four Sleep Latency Tests (SLTs), with the first starting at 45 minutes after morning wake time, and the subsequent three occurring at 30-minute intervals for a total of 4 SLT's per M-MSLT. Each SLT was scored to determine the latency in minutes (with precision to 0.5 minute) from lights off to sleep onset; trials during which sleep onset did not occur were assigned a latency of 20 minutes. The four SLTs for each participant were averaged to obtain the mean SOL.</description>

The multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) is a widely used method for objectively quantifying excessive, pathological, or pharmacologically induced residual sleepiness by measuring the number of minutes that it takes a participant to fall asleep. The MSLT was modified to include four Sleep Latency Tests (SLTs), with the first starting at 45 minutes after morning wake time, and the subsequent three occurring at 30-minute intervals for a total of 4 SLT's per M-MSLT. Each SLT was scored to determine the latency in minutes (with precision to 0.5 minute) from lights off to sleep onset; trials during which sleep onset did not occur were assigned a latency of 20 minutes. The four SLTs for each participant were averaged to obtain the mean SOL.</description>

The MSLT was modified to include four SLTs, with the first starting at 45 minutes after morning wake time, and the subsequent three occurring at 30-minute intervals for a total of 4 SLT's per M-MSLT. Each SLT was scored to determine the latency in minutes (with precision to 0.5 minute) from lights off to sleep onset; trials during which sleep onset did not occur were assigned a latency of 20 minutes. The four SLTs for each participant were averaged to obtain the mean SOL.</description>

          <description>SOL is defined as the length of time that it takes to accomplish the transition from full wakefulness to sleep. The MSLT is a widely used method for objectively quantifying excessive, pathological, or pharmacologically induced residual sleepiness by measuring the number of minutes that it takes a participant to fall asleep. The MSLT was modified to include four SLTs, with the first starting at 45 minutes after morning wake time, and the subsequent three occurring at 30-minute intervals for a total of 4 SLT's per M-MSLT.

        <title>Relationship Between PK Concentrations of Lemborexant and Sleepiness as Measured by M-MSLT</title>
        <description>Pearson correlation was used to calculate the relationship between PK concentration of lemborexant and sleepiness. The M-MSLT is a widely used method for objectively quantifying excessive, pathological, or pharmacologically induced residual sleepiness by measuring the number of minutes that it takes a participant to fall asleep. The MSLT was modified to include four SLTs, with the first starting at 45 minutes after morning wake time, and the subsequent three occurring at 30-minute intervals for a total of 4 SLT's per M-MSLT. Each SLT was scored to determine the latency in minutes (with precision to 0.5 minute) from lights off to sleep onset; trials during which sleep onset did not occur were assigned a latency of 20 minutes.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline up to Day 44 (Week 6)</time_frame>
        <population>The PK analysis set was the group of participants who received at least one dose of E2006 and had at least one quantifiable postdose drug concentration. Here, overall number of participants analyzed signifies participants who were evaluable for this outcome measure.</population>
