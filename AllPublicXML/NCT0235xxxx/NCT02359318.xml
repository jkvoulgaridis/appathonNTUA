  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Demineralisation and white-spot caries often occures during MB treatment. While resin
      infiltration has been proved to stop progression of enamel demineralisation, there is still a
      paucity of information in the literature concerning the best time point of infiltration:
      During or following MB treatment. Infiltration during treatment requires debonding respective
      brackets prior to infiltration, with subsequent re-bonding. In terms of preventing enamel
      damages by progression of demineralisation and enamel damages by de-bonding, it is unclear
      whether it was better to infiltrate enamel immediately, or to better postpone until
      completion of MB treatment.

      This study thus aimes to evaluate if resin infiltration can prevent enamel damage due to
      bracket de-bonding.

      Background: Orthodontic bracket debonding is known to cause side-effects such as enamel
      cracks or fractures. There is a lack of information on potential benefits or side-effects of
      removing brackets from infiltrated enamel, in terms of enamel damages, in vivo.

      Purpose: To assess enamel damages following debonding in demineralised teeth with or without
      prior infiltration (Icon, DMG, Hamburg, Germany), compared to those following bracket removal
      from sound enamel, in order to provide guidelines for the right time point of infiltration of
      post-orthodontic lesions (during or following orthodontic treatment).

      Design: Single-center, randomized, single blinded, split-mouth controlled clinical trial
      Subjects: 30 subjects with fixed multi-bracket (MB) appliances treated at the orthodontic
      clinic of Dr. Roberto Vogel, Temuco, Chile: It is planned to include 20 consecutive patients
      with extensive decalcifications, and 10 patients without decalcifications. Random allocation
      of demineralized dental arch quadrants to the different treatment groups (debond with or
      without prior infiltration, and sound teeth).

      Investigated tooth groups: Upper and lower canines, and upper and lower incisors.

      Methods: Bracket bonding procedure (Transbond XT 3M, Unitek) is identical for all patients
      and also for the re-attachement of brackets. Teeth allocated to the infiltration group will
      receive bracket removal, infiltration and rebonding of new brackets 4 weeks prior to final
      debonding. De-bonding procedures are identical for all patients.

      Silicone replicas are made directly following bracket removal (prior to adhesive removal).
      Replica analysis is performed using a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM780) at the Department of
      Cell Biology, University of Concepción, Chile.

    <description>Patients with brackets and white spots are included in this group. After removal of the old brackets the quadrants are randomized to this intervention arm and the &quot;no infiltration and de-bonding&quot; arm. The teeth that are included in this intervention arm are treated by resin infiltration using Icon (DMG, Germany) according to the manufacturers´ instruction. This is followed by bonding of new brackets (Gemini metal brackets, 3M Unitek). These new brackets are finally de-bonded 4 weeks after the treatment, with silicon impressions taken before adhesive removal.
Bonding and debonding of brackets is performed by one clinician (Roberto Vogel) using the same bonding and de-bonding techniques and materials for all patients.</description>
