      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of irreversible
      electroporation for unresectable Hepatic carcinoma in poor liver function, also Progress Free
      Survival (PFS) and Over Survival (OS) will be recorded.

    <textblock>
      Hepatic carcinoma is the fifth most common cancer worldwide and a large proportion of
      patients are unsuitable for tumor resection because of factors such as poor hepatic
      reserve(cirrhosis) which directly lead a poor liver function. Direct ablative treatments
      include radiofrequency ablation, microwave (MW) ablation and cryotherapy and irreversible
      electroporation had been used successful as a therapeutic choice for unresectable patients.
      At the same time，Irreversible electroporation(IRE)，which was applied with a novel ablation
      technology, can induce tissue necross by utilizing short pulses of high-voltage electrical
      energy. The technique also had many advantages, including Short ablation time, preservation
      of vital structures within IRE-ablated zone, avoidance of heat/cold-sink effect, complete
      ablation with well-demarcated margin and real-time monitoring of IRE ablation.
