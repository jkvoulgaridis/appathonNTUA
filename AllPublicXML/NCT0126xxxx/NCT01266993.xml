  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the persistence of the immune response of GSK134612
      vaccine up to 68 months after vaccination in the primary vaccination study (NCT number =
      NCT00674583) of 2 to 10 year old subjects. This study will also evaluate the safety and
      immunogenicity of a booster dose of GSK134612 vaccine subjects who were primed in the primary
      vaccination study with either GSK134612 vaccine or Menjugate®.

      This protocol posting deals with objectives &amp; outcome measures of the persistence and booster
      epochs. The objectives &amp; outcome measures of the primary epoch are presented in a separate
      protocol posting (NCT number = NCT00674583)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects were previously vaccinated at 2 to 10 years of age with GSK134612 or with
      Menjugate®. The persistence phase starts 32 months after the primary vaccination and blood
      samples will be taken at 32, 44, 56 and 68 months after primary vaccination. All subjects
      will receive a booster dose of GSK134612 at 68 months after primary vaccination and a blood
      sample will be taken 1 month after administration of the booster dose.
