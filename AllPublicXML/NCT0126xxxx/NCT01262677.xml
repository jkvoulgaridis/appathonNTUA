  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 30% percent of subjects with partial seizures are refractory to treatment with
      single or combination antiepileptic drugs. The present study will compare the efficacy of two
      different dosages of pregabalin CR dosed once daily as compared to placebo, when used as
      adjunctive therapy in subjects requiring adjunctive therapy for partial onset epilepsy, using
      a randomized, parallel group design.

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 14</time_frame>
    <description>HADS: participant rated questionnaire with 2 subscales. HADS-A assesses state of generalized anxiety (anxious mood, restlessness, anxious thoughts, panic attacks); HADS-D assesses state of lost interest and diminished pleasure response (lowering of hedonic tone). Each subscale comprised of 7 items with range 0 (no presence of anxiety or depression) to 3 (severe feeling of anxiety or depression). Total score 0 to 21 for each subscale; higher score indicates greater severity of anxiety and depression symptoms.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This was a multicenter, multinational study and included four standard phases: an 8-week baseline observation phase, a 2-week dose escalation phase, a 12-week fixed-dose maintenance phase, and a 1-week taper phase.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>An 8-week baseline observation phase began immediately after the screening visit. Througout the observation phase the participants continued their current anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) at the prescribed dosage, eligibility was re-evaluated at Week -4 and Week 0, and the participants recorded all seizures in daily seizure diaries.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>After the 2-week dose escalation phase, the participants received 165 mg of pregabalin once a day during the 12-week double-blind maintenance phase. Afterwards, the study medication was tapered for one week. The tablets were to be taken orally, within 1 hour (hr) after the evening meal. The medication must have been taken intact and not bitten, chewed, cut, or otherwise altered prior to swallowing.</description>

        <description>Seizures were recorded and documented in a daily Seizure Diary by the participants, family member, caregiver, or legal guardian. Simple partial seizures without a visible motor component (ie, lacking visible movements during the seizure) were not counted toward eligibility, or in the primary or secondary efficacy analyses. Natural logarithm of the 28-day seizure rate was reported in this outcome measure.</description>

        <description>Seizures were recorded and documented in a daily Seizure Diary by the participants, family member, caregiver, or legal guardian. Simple partial seizures without a visible motor component (ie, lacking visible movements during the seizure) were not counted toward eligibility, or in the primary or secondary efficacy analyses.

        <description>HADS: participant rated questionnaire with 2 subscales. HADS-A assesses state of generalized anxiety (anxious mood, restlessness, anxious thoughts, panic attacks); HADS-D assesses state of lost interest and diminished pleasure response (lowering of hedonic tone). Each subscale comprised of 7 items with range 0 (no presence of anxiety or depression) to 3 (severe feeling of anxiety or depression). Total score 0 to 21 for each subscale; higher score indicates greater severity of anxiety and depression symptoms.</description>

        <description>Participant-rated 12-item questionnaire to assess key constructs of sleep over the past week. 7 subscales: sleep disturbance, snoring, awakened short of breath or with headache, sleep adequacy, and somnolence (range:0-100); sleep quantity (range:0-24), and optimal sleep (yes: 1, no: 0). 6 and 9 item index measures of sleep disturbance were constructed to provide composite scores. Scores are transformed (actual raw score minus lowest possible score divided by possible raw score range * 100); total score range: 0 to 100; higher score = greater intensity of attribute.</description>

        <description>Participant-rated 12-item questionnaire to assess key constructs of sleep over the past week. 7 subscales: sleep disturbance, snoring, awakened short of breath or with headache, sleep adequacy, and somnolence (range:0-100); sleep quantity (range:0-24), and optimal sleep (yes: 1, no: 0). 6 and 9 item index measures of sleep disturbance were constructed to provide composite scores. Scores are transformed (actual raw score minus lowest possible score divided by possible raw score range * 100); total score range: 0 to 100; higher score = greater intensity of attribute.</description>

Afterwards, the study medication was tapered for one week. The tablets were to be taken orally, within 1 hr after the evening meal. The medication must have been taken intact and not bitten, chewed, cut, or otherwise altered prior to swallowing.</description>

          <description>Participant-rated 12-item questionnaire to assess key constructs of sleep over the past week. 7 subscales: sleep disturbance, snoring, awakened short of breath or with headache, sleep adequacy, and somnolence (range:0-100); sleep quantity (range:0-24), and optimal sleep (yes: 1, no: 0). 6 and 9 item index measures of sleep disturbance were constructed to provide composite scores.

        <description>Laboratory samples in hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis were analyzed by a cental laboratory. Any laboratory value that was identified as clinically significant was reported as an AE. LLN: Lower limit of normal, ULN: Uper limit of normal, RBC: Red Blood Cell, WBC: White Blood Cell, AST: Aspartate Aminotransferase, ALT: Alanine Aminotransferase, BUN: Blood Urea Nitrogen</description>
