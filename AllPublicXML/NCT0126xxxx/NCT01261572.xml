      To find effective doses of ASP3550 on the maintenance of serum testosterone suppression in
      patients with prostate cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ASP3550 is administered periodically to patients with prostate cancer. The primary efficacy
      variable is the effect of ASP3550 on the maintenance of serum testosterone suppression. In
      addition, the safety and pharmacokinetics of ASP3550 will be investigated.
