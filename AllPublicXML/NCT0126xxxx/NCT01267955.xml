  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well vismodegib works in treating patients with
      chondrosarcomas that have spread to other places in the body and usually cannot be cured or
      controlled with treatment. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as vismodegib, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from
      dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the antitumor activity of GDC-0449 (vismodegib) in terms of 6-month clinical
      benefit rate (complete response, partial response, and stable disease, as per the revised
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] criteria 2009).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Best overall response (as per the revised RECIST criteria 2009). II. 1- and 2-year
      progression-free survival. III. 1- and 2-year overall survival. IV. GDC-0449 safety. V.
      Pharmacogenomics analysis of predictive markers of treatment outcome.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive vismodegib orally (PO) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3 months.

    <measure>Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) Based on Centralized Imaging Review as Per RECIST 1.1</measure>
    <time_frame>At 6 months after inclusion</time_frame>
    <description>CBR was defined as the percentage of participants with complete or partial responses (CR, PR) or stable disease (SD) per RECIST 1.1. CR was defined as disappearance of all non-nodal target lesions. PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameter of all target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters. Analysis of response was performed based on radiological centralized review. A 2-stage optimal Simon's design with 37 participants (first stage: 17 participants) was used. If 3 or less non-progressions (CR + PR + SD) at 6 months were observed during stage 1 (out of 17 participants), the trial would stopped early. Otherwise, 20 additional patients would be accrued for stage 2. If 11 or more non-progressions (out of 37 participants) were observed at the end of recruitment, further investigation of this therapy would be warranted.</description>

This is a single-arm phase 2 trial, based on a two-stage Simon’s optimal design. Assuming 20% (H0: null hypothesis) and 40% (H1: alternative hypothesis) six-month CBR, 10% type I error rate and 90% power, 37 eligible and assessable patients were necessary (17 in the first stage and 20 in the second stage). At the second stage/final stage, GDC-0449 would be considered promising if at least eleven patients were progression-free at 6 months.</description>

          <title>ECOG Performance status</title>
          <description>The ECOG scale of performance status developed by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) was used to assess the functional status of a patient in terms of their ability to care for themself, daily activity, and physical ability (walking, working, etc.). A grade 0 corresponds to a patient fully active, grade 1 a patient restricted in activity, grade 2 a patient capable of all selfcare but unable to carry out any work activities, grade 3 capable of only limited selfcare, grade 4 a patient completely disabled, grade 5 patient dead.</description>

        <title>Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) Based on Centralized Imaging Review as Per RECIST 1.1</title>
        <description>CBR was defined as the percentage of participants with complete or partial responses (CR, PR) or stable disease (SD) per RECIST 1.1. CR was defined as disappearance of all non-nodal target lesions. PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameter of all target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters. Analysis of response was performed based on radiological centralized review. A 2-stage optimal Simon's design with 37 participants (first stage: 17 participants) was used. If 3 or less non-progressions (CR + PR + SD) at 6 months were observed during stage 1 (out of 17 participants), the trial would stopped early. Otherwise, 20 additional patients would be accrued for stage 2. If 11 or more non-progressions (out of 37 participants) were observed at the end of recruitment, further investigation of this therapy would be warranted.</description>
