    <textblock>
      This is a non-interventional, prospective, longitudinal cohort study. A total of 150
      pediatric subjects with glaucoma or elevated intraocular pressure, including 75
      latanoprost-treated subjects and 75 non-topical prostaglandin analogue treated subjects, will
      be enrolled from ophthalmic hospital clinics and academic ophthalmic centers. As a
      non-interventional study, the study subjects' continued use of latanoprost and assessments of
      ocular events will be obtained through the routine medical follow-up with treating
      ophthalmologists or other designated members of the medical care team.

    <measure>Conjunctival/Ocular Hyperemia</measure>
    <time_frame>Evaluated at Baseline, 6 months, 12 months, 24 months and 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>Conjunctiva hyperemia was assessed by slit-lamp examination. When slit-lamp examination is not possible due to subject cooperation, a fixation light and 20-diopter lens (for magnification) was used to assess this parameter. Conjunctival hyperemia was assessed and graded by ophthalmologist at baseline and follow-up visits from grades 0-3 and is as follows:
0 = None, Normal: few vessels of palpebral or bulbar conjunctiva easily observed
= Mild, Reddening of the palpebral or bulbar conjunctiva
= Moderate, Bright reddening of the palpebral or bulbar conjunctiva
= Severe, Deep, bright, and diffuse reddening of the palpebral or bulbar conjunctiva</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With a Change in Anterior Segment Biomicroscopy</measure>
    <time_frame>Evaluated at Baseline, 6 months, 12 months, 24 months and 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>Slit-lamp biomicroscopy (mounted or hand-held) without fluorescein and without dilation of the pupil was performed. When slit-lamp examination was not possible, a fixation light and 20-diopter lens (for magnification) was used. At each scheduled visit, deposition of pigment on the corneal endothelial layer or the lens capsule or any abnormalities of the lids, conjunctivae, cornea, anterior chamber, iris, or lens was examined.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Abnormalities in Fundoscopy Posterior Segment at Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Evaluated at Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Fundoscopy was performed after dilation of the pupils (eg, 1 % tropicamide or cyclopentolate and 2 ½ % phenylephrine, or a clinically- appropriate dose according to the clinician's standard care of each particular patient). The examination included an evaluation of the vitreous body, retina (including the macula), and optic nerve head.
The fundoscopy e-CRF was completed only at baseline because the investigators were required to perform slit lamp, direct or indirect ophthalmoscopy at each visit and report any AEs observed which included the vitreous, retina and optic nerve.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>A total of 175 patients were enrolled into the study in 14 countries in Europe and South America: 102 in the latanoprost treatment group and 73 in the non-Prostaglandin (PG) treatment group.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>No significant events prior to group assignment are to be reported. This was a non-interventional, prospective, longitudinal cohort study. Pediatric patients with glaucoma or elevated intra ocular pressure (IOP) were enrolled into 2 groups: Latanoprost-treated patients and non-PG treated patients.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Last Available Observation in Horizontal Corneal Diameter (by Caliper and/or Ruler)</title>
        <description>The horizontal corneal diameter was measured along the horizontal meridians. Diameter was measured using either a series of transparent plates with holes of different diameters in quarter-millimeter increments or with calibrated calipers compared against a ruler. When using calipers, the corneal diameter measurement was taken from limbus to a similar point 180° away at the opposite limbus. When not examining the children with anesthesia, it was recommended to use a tape measure across the head while measuring horizontal corneal diameter by photographic method.</description>

        <description>Fundoscopy was performed after dilation of the pupils (eg, 1 % tropicamide or cyclopentolate and 2 ½ % phenylephrine, or a clinically- appropriate dose according to the clinician's standard care of each particular patient). The examination included an evaluation of the vitreous body, retina (including the macula), and optic nerve head.
The fundoscopy e-CRF was completed only at baseline because the investigators were required to perform slit lamp, direct or indirect ophthalmoscopy at each visit and report any AEs observed which included the vitreous, retina and optic nerve.</description>
