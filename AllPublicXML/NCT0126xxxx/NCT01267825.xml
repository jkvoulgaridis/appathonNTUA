    <textblock>
      Herniated disc sometimes cause back pain radiating down to a leg. This pain can be so severe
      that it is functionally disabling. The purpose of this randomized clinical trial is to
      determine if corticosteroid medication, delivered directly to the area near the herniated
      disc, can improve the pain and functional disability associated with a herniated disc.

    <measure>Change in Functional Impairment as Measured by the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and one week after emergency department discharge</time_frame>
    <description>The Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) is a 24 item instrument that evaluates the impact of low back pain on one's daily life. It is most sensitive for patients with mild to moderate disability due to acute, sub-acute or chronic low back pain. Each question can be answered as either a &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;. The score ranges from 0 to 24 where a higher score reflects greater impairment and, therefore, worsening in the quality of life. The change in RMDQ is obtained by subtracting the RMDQ score at one week after discharge from the baseline score. The calculated mean and associated confidence interval values have been verified by staff statisticians.</description>
