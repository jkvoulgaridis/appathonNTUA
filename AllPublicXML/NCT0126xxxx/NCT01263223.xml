    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of LY2216684 on heart rate and blood
      pressure in research participants with MDD who are being treated with an SSRI (selective
      serotonin reuptake inhibitors). Information about any side effects that may occur will also
      be collected. The duration of participation in this study is approximately 24 days not
      including the screening visit. This study requires 1 clinic confinement of 17 days/16 nights
      and 1 Follow-up Outpatient Visit. A screening visit is required within 30 days prior to the
      start of the study. In both periods 1 and 2, the study involves 4 single daily doses of 18 mg
      LY2216684 or placebo taken as 2 tablets by mouth. In period 3, the study involves four single
      daily doses of 36 mg LY2216684 or placebo taken as 4 tablets by mouth.

    <measure>Maximum and Mean Change From Baseline in Ambulatory Heart Rate on Day 1</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through the 24-hour interval on Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Heart rate was determined during ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). Mean pre-dose ABPM values from Day 1 in Period 1 were used as baseline. Maximum and mean changes in ABPM heart rate were determined from a 24-hour continuous ABPM monitoring for Day 1 (0 to 24 hours). Least Squares (LS) mean changes from baseline were calculated with a mixed effects model including sequence, period, study day, treatment groups, and interaction between treatment groups and study day as fixed effects, and subject as random effect.</description>

        <description>Heart rate was determined during ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). Mean pre-dose ABPM values from Day 1 in Period 1 were used as baseline. Maximum and mean changes in ABPM heart rate were determined from a 24-hour continuous ABPM monitoring for Day 1 (0 to 24 hours). Least Squares (LS) mean changes from baseline were calculated with a mixed effects model including sequence, period, study day, treatment groups, and interaction between treatment groups and study day as fixed effects, and subject as random effect.</description>

Observations with 18-mg LY2216684 included Periods 1 and 2. Observations with Placebo included Periods 1, 2, and 3. Therefore, some participants contributed 2 Placebo observations to the overall data.</population>

        <title>Maximum and Mean Change From Baseline in Ambulatory Systolic and Diastolic Blood Pressure During Treatment With 18-mg LY2216684 or Placebo on Day 1</title>
        <description>Blood pressure (BP) was determined with ABPM. Mean pre-dose ABPM values from Day 1 in Period 1 were used as baseline. Changes in ABPM BP were determined from a 24-hour continuous ABPM monitoring for Day 1. LS mean changes from baseline were calculated with a mixed effects model including sequence, period, study day, treatment groups, and interaction between treatment groups and study day as fixed effects, and subject as random effect.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline through the 24-hour interval on Day 1</time_frame>
        <population>All participants with a baseline observation and at least 1 post-baseline observation on Day 1 were included in the analyses. Observations with 18-mg LY2216684 included Periods 1 and 2. Observations with Placebo included Periods 1, 2, and 3. Therefore, some participants contributed 2 Placebo observations to the overall data.</population>

        <title>Maximum and Mean Change From Baseline in ABPM Heart Rate During Treatment With 36-mg LY2216684 or Placebo on Day 4</title>
        <description>Heart rate was determined with ABPM. Mean pre-dose ABPM values from Day 1 in Period 1 were used as baseline. Changes in ABPM heart rate were determined from a 24-hour continuous ABPM monitoring for Day 4. LS mean changes from baseline were calculated with a mixed effects model including sequence, period, study day, treatment groups, and interaction between treatment groups and study day as fixed effects, and subject as random effect.</description>
