  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Activated monocytes play a key role in the pathogenesis of HIV-associated neurocognitive
      disorders (HAND). Individuals with HAND have expanded populations of activated monocytes.
      These monocytes are thought to emigrate into the CNS, where they produce neurotoxic
      proinflammatory factors, and also carry virus into the CNS. Statins are cholesterol lowering
      drugs with pleiotropic immunomodulatory / anti-inflammatory properties that are currently
      being explored for immunomodulation of T cell activation in several diseases, in addition to
      their established role to treat hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis. The investigators in
      vitro data suggests that these drugs can downregulate monocyte activation patterns seen in
      HIV infection. No in vivo studies have yet been carried out to assess the effects of statins
      on the pro-inflammatory monocyte population in chronic HIV disease. This will be a pilot
      study of whether statin treatment will reduce the inflammatory monocyte phenotype and
      downregulate the inflammatory cytokines that have been linked to neuropathogenesis in HIV
      infection. If so, they may have potential as adjunctive therapy in HIV-associated
      neurological disease. The investigators propose to:

        -  Determine the effect of Atorvastatin on peripheral blood monocyte populations in a
           12-week pilot study in chronically HIV-infected people on HAART therapy.

        -  Determine the relationship between changes in monocyte phenotype following Atorvastatin
           treatment, and soluble markers of activation/inflammation linked to neuropathogenesis,
           as well as activation status of T cells.
