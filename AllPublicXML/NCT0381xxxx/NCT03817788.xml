For polyethylene glycol group (group P): the day before colonoscopy, 750 mL (1 box) of polyethylene glycol solution should be drunk 2 hours after dinner; the other 1500 ml (2 boxes) of polyethylene glycol solution should be taken 4-6 hours before the examination. After oral laxatives were finished, 20 ml dimethicone would be taken orally as defoamer. All the enteroscopy should by performed by the same juniar clinician, and related indicators were recorded.</description>
