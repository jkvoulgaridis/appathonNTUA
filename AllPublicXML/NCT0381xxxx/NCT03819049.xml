  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of 3
      different doses of ExPEC10V and to select the optimal dose for further clinical development
      (Cohort 1). Cohort 2 is aimed to expand the dataset supporting the short- and long-term
      safety and immunogenicity of the optimal dose of ExPEC10V, selected from the primary analysis
      results of Cohort 1. Cohort 2 will include participants in stable health with a history of
      urinary tract infection (UTI) in the past 5 years and will be included in the study to
      support the plan for late stage development of ExPEC10V.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ExPEC10V (JNJ-69968054) is a 10-valent vaccine candidate in development for prevention of
      invasive extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli (ExPEC) disease (IED) in adults 60 years
      of age and older. ExPEC10V consists of O-antigen polysaccharides (PSs) of the ExPEC serotypes
      O1A, O2, O4, O6A, O8, O15, O16, O18A, O25B and O75 separately bioconjugated to the carrier
      protein, a genetically detoxified form of exotoxin A (EPA) derived from Pseudomonas
      aeruginosa. Since, mechanism of action of conjugate vaccines in prevention of invasive
      disease is not expected to be affected by antibiotic resistance mechanisms, ExPEC10V vaccine
      may provide protection against IED caused by drug resistant and susceptible ExPEC serotypes.
      The study consists of two cohorts. Cohort 1 is comprised of three periods: a screening period
      (28 days), an observer-blind follow-up period (181 days) with vaccination on Day 1, and an
      open-label long term follow up (LTFU) period (from Day 182 until 3 years [Day 1096]
      post-vaccination). Cohort 2 is also comprised of three periods: a screening period (28 days),
      a double-blind follow-up period (181 days) with vaccination on Day 1, and a double-blind LTFU
      period (from Day 182 until 3 years [Day 1096] post-vaccination). The end of Cohort 1 and
      Cohort 2 is considered as the Year 3 visit (Day 1096) for the last participant. Key
      immunogenicity assessments will include the assessment of ExPEC10V and ExPEC4V
      serotype-specific total immunoglobulin G antibody levels elicited by the vaccine and ExPEC10V
      and ExPEC4V serotype-specific functional antibodies. Key safety assessments include solicited
      local and systemic AEs, unsolicited AEs, SAEs, physical examinations, vital sign
      measurements, and, for Cohort 1 only, clinical laboratory tests. The total duration of the
      study is up to 4.5 years.
