  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our goal is to provide data that will give surgeons and hospitals clear recommendations on
      the use of NPWT for Cesarean section, abdominal hysterectomy and colon surgeries in patients
      with diabetes and/or obesity. We also want to understand the patient experience with the
      dressing so that we can provide information that will enable clinicians to remove barriers to
      NPWT use. Additionally, we are seeking to use automated electronic medical record decision
      support to identify patients that will benefit most from the NPWT.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Specific Aim 1: Evaluate the effect of single-use NPWT on SSI rates after C-section,
      abdominal hysterectomy, and colon procedures in at risk patients.

      To address this aim, we will conduct multicenter, stepped-wedge, quasi-experimental trial
      evaluating use of the PrevenaTM with 125 mm Hg negative pressure for 7 days among obese (BMI
      &gt;30) and/or diabetic patients undergoing the procedures of interest. This is essentially a
      phase IV clinical trial as this dressing has FDA approval for the indicated use.

      Specific Aim 2: Investigate the patients' experience of using the NPWT. To achieve this aim,
      we will survey a sub-set of patients to assess their knowledge of post-operative care, to
      identify complications associated with NPWT use, and to learn how patients evaluated the
      device's ease of use, ease of removal, and comfort.

      Specific Aim 3: Assess whether real-time decision support through machine-learning modeling
      can help surgeons identify patients at high risk of SSI who could benefit from NWPT or other
      post-surgical preventive measures. To address this aim, we will evaluate whether boosted tree
      modeling techniques can be used &quot;at the bedside&quot; via electronic medical record data feeds to
      tailor post-operative care and preventive care for specific patients.
