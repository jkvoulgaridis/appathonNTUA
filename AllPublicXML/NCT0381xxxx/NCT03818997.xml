    <textblock>
      In this study, non-operable esophagogastric adenocarcinoma cancer patients or non-operable
      biliary cancer patients whose cancer progressed/spread/got worse after first line treatment
      will be treated with or without immunotherapy and chemotherapy. This study will take place in
      several countries across Europe. One hundred twenty-three (123) patients will be invited to
      participate in this study

      Biliary tract cancer (BTC), is a form of cancer that start in your bile ducts, a series of
      tubes that runs from the liver to the small intestines. It is not know yet the exact cause of
      BTC. For patients who have advanced or metastatic BTC (where surgery is not possible),
      chemotherapy is the first option for treatment. Chemotherapy with cisplatin and gemcitabine
      (CisGem) is the current standard of care.

      Esophagogastric cancer (EGC) is cancer that occurs in the esophagus, a long hollow tube that
      runs from your throat to your stomach. The accumulating abnormal cells form a tumor in the
      esophagus that can grow to invade nearby structures and spread to other parts of the body.
      It's thought that chronic irritation of your esophagus may contribute to the changes that
      cause esophageal cancer.

      The purpose of this study is to look at the risks and benefits of combining DKN-01 and
      atezolizumab (humanized monoclonal antibody) with or without paclitaxel (chemotherapy).
      Immune therapy boosts the body's natural defenses to fight cancer. It uses specific products
      made either by participants' body or in a laboratory to improve, target or restore immune
      system function and control or stop cancer. Atezolizumab is such an &quot;immunotherapy&quot; drug.
      DKN-01 is another new type of drug (humanized monoclonal antibody) in development as
      anticancer agent. Paclitaxel is a commonly-used chemotherapy drug of the class of taxanes
      used to treat a number of cancer types, it stimulates the cell to die or to stop the cell
      from dividing into two new cells.The idea behind combining these drugs is linked to targeting
      the immune system to attack the tumor. Combining immune and chemotherapy has already
      demonstrated clinical activity in relapsed (return of the disease)/refractory (not responding
      to treatment) esophagogastric cancer patients.

                    -  Treatment with systemic immunostimulatory agents (including but not limited
                       to IFN-a, IL-2) for any reason within 6 weeks or five half-lives of the
                       drug, whichever is shorter, prior to enrollment.

                    -  Prior allogeneic stem cell or solid organ transplant.

          -  Subjects with a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (≥
             10 mg daily prednisone or equivalent) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14
             days of randomization/enrollment

          -  Prior treatment with an anti-DKK1 therapy

          -  Administration of a live, attenuated vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of
             study medication or anticipation that such a live attenuated vaccine will be required
             during the study. Any live, attenuated vaccine (e.g. FluMist®) is prohibited while the
             patient is receiving atezolizumab and for a period of 5 months after discontinuation
             of atezolizumab. Inactivated influenza vaccines are allowed only during flu season.

          -  History of osteonecrosis of the hip or evidence of structural bone abnormalities in
             the proximal femur on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan that is symptomatic and
             clinically significant. Degenerative changes of the hip joint are not excluded.

          -  All non hematological toxicities attributed to prior anti-cancer therapy other than
             hearing loss, alopecia and fatigue must have resolved to Grade 1 (NCI CTCAE version 5)
             or baseline before administration of study drug.

          -  History of hypersensitivity to the investigational medicinal product or to any drug
             with similar chemical structure or to any excipient present in the pharmaceutical form
             of the investigational medicinal products.

          -  History of severe allergic, anaphylactic, or other hypersensitivity reactions to
             chimeric or humanized antibodies or fusion protein; known hypersensitivity to Chinese
             hamster ovary cell products or to any component of the atezolizumab formulation

          -  Any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition potentially
             hampering compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule; those conditions
             should be discussed with the patient before registration in the trial.

          -  Uncontrolled tumor-related pain.

          -  Uncontrolled or symptomatic hypercalcemia (ionized calcium 1.5 mmol/L, calcium 12
             mg/dL or corrected serum calcium ULN)

          -  Significant cardiovascular disease (such as New York Heart Association Class II or
             greater cardiac disease, myocardial infarction, or cerebrovascular accident), unstable
             arrhythmia, or unstable angina within 3 months prior to initiation of study treatment.

        Specific to BTC:

          -  Ampullary or gallbladder carcinoma

          -  Patients with liver failure Child-Pugh B or C

        Specific to EGC:
