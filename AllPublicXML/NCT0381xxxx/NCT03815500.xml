      Can improvements in patient dismissal education materials reduce incidence of wound
      non-healing and infection.

      The investigators seek to address the specific educational needs of patients and caregivers
      with low-literacy, dyslexia and related learning disabilities in the context of properly
      performing wound care for patients with surgical wounds. Specific aims include both improving
      care by decreasing wound complications and improving patient satisfaction by using techniques
      designed for this population. Objectives include utilizing surveys to determine the incidence
      of dyslexia among the patients' and caregivers' within the general surgery service as well as
      the perception of our current educational offerings, to design a new dismissal package with
      enhanced educational offerings, to re-measure this effect on the patient experience with
      survey data, and to compare wound infection rates before and after implementing the new
      curriculum. Dyslexia and associated learning disabilities are common and likely impact the
      health literacy among this population due to the ubiquitous literacy-based documentation of
      hospital course and dismissal instructions. Adults with dyslexia may be reluctant to disclose
      any inability to understand written instructions. There is currently no mechanism within the
      dismissal system to specifically identify and address the unique needs of this population.
      The impact on clinical outcomes of proper wound packing is substantial, and if performed
      incorrectly can lead to slow wound healing and infections that often require readmission,
      multiple courses of antibiotics, and reoperation. In severe cases, improper wound care can
      lead to severe infection, sepsis, and death. By enhancing the educational offerings of proper
      wound care to this population, the investigators hope to reduce these complications.

    <description>Nursing surveys answering the question, &quot;Have you been trained to teach wound care to patients with dyslexia or learning disabilities?&quot; Were answered &quot;No,&quot; by 43/46 (93%) respondents. We seek to have a 90% rate of affirmative (&quot;Yes&quot;) answers to this survey after implementation of our curriculum.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient satisfaction with wound education</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Survey of patients' wound education experiences should indicate that they are being offered curriculum suitable for learners with low literacy, dyslexia and associated learning disorders. We will utilize a scale of &quot;Definitely satisfied, somewhat satisfied, somewhat dissatisfied, definitely dissatisfied&quot; as our measure.</description>

    <measure>shorter time to wound healing</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>After implementation of new curriculum, it is anticipated that wound complication rates and time to wound healing would decrease. We will calculate the &quot;time&quot; based on the date of wound creation to their final clinic appointment indicated the wound is satisfactorily healed with &quot;days&quot; as our unit of measure.</description>
