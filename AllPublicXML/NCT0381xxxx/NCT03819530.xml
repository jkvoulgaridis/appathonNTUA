  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The first 1,000 days of life are critical periods for brain development. Proper nutrition
      lays the foundation for optimal growth, health, and neurodevelopment across the lifespan.
      Poor nutrition in this vulnerable period has irreversible consequences, including stunting,
      susceptibility to sickness, reduced school performance and productivity, and impaired
      intellectual and social development. UNICEF reported in 2018 that among the low cost flat
      residents in urban areas of the Klang Valley, 15% of children under 5 years old were stunted,
      22% underweight, and 23% either overweight or obese.

      Will a micronutrient supplementation program improve the growth and iron status of children
      aged 6 months to 5 years staying in Lembah Subang? Children will be randomized into treatment
      and control groups. Treatment groups will receive dietary micronutrient supplementation
      packets. Measurements of height and weight and iron status will be taken at baseline and 6
      months later.
