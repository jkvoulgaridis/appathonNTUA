  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Specific musculo-tendinous adaptations in children with cerebral palsy (CP) have an influence
      on muscle strength and consequently on functional behavior and participation. Evidence of
      strength training programs has been shown on level of body function but transfer to levels of
      activity and participation is still limited. Lack of transfer is related to lack of
      specificity of the training and poor overall quality of the interventions (intensity,
      duration, frequency and/or type).

      The use of functional strength exercises to assess and train strength of the lower limbs in
      children with CP is well implemented in the most functional children with CP (GMFCS-level I).
      To assess isometric strength the hand held dynamometer (HHD) can be used in clinical settings
      but reliability of this tool is questionable.

      The aim of this study is to adapt existing functional strength tests for less functional
      children with CP (focussing on GMFCS level II and III) and to investigate the correlation
      with isometric strength measurements and other functional parameters.
