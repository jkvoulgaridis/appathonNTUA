  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background, current situation, and motivation

      According to current estimates, 100,000 people in Austria suffer from various types of
      dementia. According to forecasts, this number of people will rise to approximately 230,000 by
      2050 due to the demographic development and the increase of the prevalence rate. Data from
      the service statistics show that 85% of dementia patients still live in the community in
      their homes and informal caregivers, such as relatives, support them. In total, more than
      300,000 people care for their relatives in Austria in addition to professional support.
      However, not only the person affected from dementia suffers from the disease, but also, and
      often at a higher rate, the informal caregivers. Vice versa, the quality of life of those
      suffering from dementia is significantly influenced by the caregivers' competences and their
      strategies for resilience.

      Study aim and hypothesis

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the usability, acceptance, and effect of an app
      consisting of three modules that provide multidimensional support for informal caregivers of
      a person with dementia.

    <description>The intervention (DEA) group will receive the newly developed app. DEA will consist of three simultaneous modules that provide multidimensional support for informal caregivers aiming to reduce the caregiver burden:
Information module
The information module consists of general information on the disease and the care of people suffering from dementia.
Activity module
The activity module suggests individualized activities and physical fitness exercises by a self-learning algorithm, which supports the caregiver to deliver more targeted and easier care.
Communication module
If two or more persons are caring for one person with dementia, the communication module provides a networking possibility.</description>
