  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      investigating the effect of glazing and polishing on the color difference between natural
      teeth and all ceramic crowns made from celtra press (zirconia reinforced lithium silicate
      ceramic).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two groups of patients will be selected according to special inclusion criteria N=5 in each
      group total of 10 patients, one of the two groups will receive a glazed zirconia reinforced
      lithium silicate ''celtra press'' crowns and the other group will receive a polished ones of
      the same material , after crowns delivery color difference (ΔE) between the natural teeth and
      the celtra press crown will be measured by a spectrophotometer device (intra oral) and
      patient satisfaction will be recorded.

    <description>Color match will be measured using &quot;United states pulplic health service &quot; system .
Scale system :
Alpha : Excellent colour match and shade between restoration and adjacent tooth, restoration almost invisible
Bravo : Slightly mismatching between the restoration and the adjacent tooth, which is in the normal range of tooth colour, translucence, and/or shade
Charlie : Obvious mismatch, beyond the normal range
Delta : Gross mismatch/aesthetically displeasing colour, shade, and/or translucence</description>
