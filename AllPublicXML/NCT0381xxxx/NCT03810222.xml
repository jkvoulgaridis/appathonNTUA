  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of death, disability and cognitive
      impairment in young people worldwide. The majority of the traumatic deaths in developed
      countries results directly from lesions in the central nervous system. Furthermore, due to
      the persistence of disabling effects of TBI for many years, personal and public costs of
      supporting survivors have to be taken in consideration.

      Many patients rescued by ICU treatment may have been severely disabled or vegetative because
      of trauma. These data suggest that, despite improvement in medical and surgical treatments,
      other factors related to trauma itself and to patient's condition could have an impact on the
      final outcome.

      Aim of the TBI-PRO project is to collect high quality clinical and epidemiological data and
      to describe the outcome of moderate-to-severe TBI in a local contest (Bergamo area, Italy).

      All patients admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of moderate-to-severe TBI, with or without
      polytrauma, are recruited. Bergamo hospital is the main Trauma Centre (Level I) and the only
      referring neurosurgical center within a population of 1.2 million inhabitants of Bergamo
      area. This hospital is also a Regional Pediatric Trauma Centre.

    <time_frame>12 Months Post-Injury</time_frame>
    <description>The global functional outcome at 12 months is assessed using the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOS-E), obtained through structured interview. The GOS-E is a well-validated, widely employed measure of disability based on information on independence, employability, and social/community participation. The baseline function prior to injury is assessed to ensure that the deficit can be attributed to the event. GOS-E is dichotomized into favorable (a score of 5 to 8, Moderate Disability is defined by a score of 5-6) and unfavorable (a score of 1 to 4, Dead is defined by a score of 1).</description>
