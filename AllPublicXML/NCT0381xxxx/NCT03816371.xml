  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The patient's position is important for ensuring patient comfort and preventing complications
      after thyroidectomy. This study was carried out to determine the effects of different degrees
      of head-of-bed elevation on the respiratory pattern and drainage following thyroidectomy and
      to provide suggestions for evidence-based clinical practice.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thyroidectomy is a safe surgical procedure commonly used for the treatment of benign or
      malignant tumors, multinodular goiter and Graves disease. However, because of the rich
      vascular structure of the thyroid gland, serious complications including hemorrhage, hematoma
      and hematoma-related dyspnea can develop after thyroidectomy. The American Thyroid
      Association also suggested to keep the patient in a head-up at 45°-Fowler's position in the
      post anesthesia care unit following thyroidectomy to prevent hematoma formation on the
      incision site by facilitating venous return from the head and neck. The mentioned guideline
      does not offer any recommendations regarding the position that should be given to the
      patients at surgical clinic after thyroidectomy. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the
      effects of different degrees of head-of-bed elevation on respiratory pattern including
      respiratory rate, peripheral oxygen saturation and dyspnea, and drainage including amount of
      drainage and hematoma formation.

    <intervention_model>Parallel Assignment</intervention_model>
    <intervention_model_description>This study was conducted as a prospective, single-center, parallel, three arm (1:1:1), randomized controlled trial at the Endocrine Surgery Clinic of a university hospital in Turkey.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Single (Participant)</masking>
    <masking_description>Group allocation was concealed using individual sealed opaque envelopes that were numbered in sequential order. As individuals were enrolled in the study, the next envelope in the sequence was extracted and the participant was assigned to the groups accordingly. All the researchers except for the clinical nurse who positioned the patients according to randomization list and patients were blinded from group assignment.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Respiration rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Every hour during four hours</time_frame>
    <description>Number of breaths per minute. It is counted for one minute.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Peripheral oxygen saturation</measure>
    <time_frame>Every hour during four hours</time_frame>
    <description>This oxygen saturation level is used to estimate arterial blood saturation and refers to the amount of oxygenated haemoglobin in the blood. It is measured by an indirect device using non-invasive method.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Amount of drainage</measure>
    <time_frame>Every hour during four hours</time_frame>
    <description>Drainage is the accumulation of blood in the drain suction bottle. The symptoms including red drainage and drainage more than 150 ml per hour in the suction bottle are defined as bleeding.The drain in the suction bottle is recorded hourly.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dyspnea</measure>
    <time_frame>Every hour during four hours</time_frame>
    <description>Shortness of breath (dyspnea) is defined a subjective experience by individuals who complain of unpleasant or uncomfortable respiratory sensations. It is evaluated by patient expression and various instruments.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hematoma formation</measure>
    <time_frame>Every hour during four hours</time_frame>
    <description>Hematoma is localized swelling that is filled with blood caused by a break in the wall of a blood vessel. It is evaluated by monitoring warning signs such as progressive neck swelling, hypoxia, tachycardia, dyspnea and stridor.</description>
