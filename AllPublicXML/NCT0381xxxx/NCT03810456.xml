  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled trial examining the effectiveness of a transdiagnostic
      cognitive behavioral treatment (CBT) in improving Veterans' community reintegration and
      quality of life. Veterans with anxiety-based disorders, including posttraumatic stress,
      panic, social anxiety, and generalized anxiety disorders (with or without co-occurring
      depression) will be randomized to an intensive CBT (iCBT) treatment delivered over one
      weekend, standard CBT (sCBT) delivered over 12 weeks or treatment as usual (TAU). The study
      will also evaluate the potential of the compressed weekend format of iCBT in producing more
      rapid improvement in outcomes and increasing psychotherapy engagement compared with a
      standard psychotherapy format. Qualitative interviews will be conducted with Veterans who
      receive iCBT and their family members to examine how iCBT and environmental factors impacted
      their process of recovery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current project proposes to evaluate a brief but intensive transdiagnostic CBT that
      simultaneously targets multiple anxiety disorders with or without co-occurring depression.
      This will be accomplished by evaluating an innovative treatment delivery method that directly
      addresses barriers associated with standard psychotherapy delivery. The main objectives are
      to (1) determine if an intensive CBT protocol (iCBT) delivered over one weekend can improve
      community reintegration, quality of life, and emotional functioning compared with standard
      CBT (sCBT) and treatment as usual (TAU); (2) examine the rates of psychotherapy engagement in
      iCBT compared with sCBT; and (3) obtain a deeper understanding, through qualitative
      interviews with Veterans and their family members, of how iCBT and environmental factors may
      impact the process of reintegration and quality of life.

      The proposed study is a randomized controlled trial with 3 treatment arms. A transdiagnostic
      group CBT protocol will be compared in a compressed weekend format (iCBT) with a standard
      group delivery format involving 3 months of weekly sessions (sCBT). A treatment as usual
      (TAU) condition will be included to compare outcomes. Veterans with one or more anxiety-based
      disorder(s) (with or without co-occurring depression) will be randomized to one of the three
      treatment arms. Veterans will be asked to attend a total of four assessments during the study
      including a baseline evaluation, 1-month, 3-month, and 6-month follow-ups. Qualitative
      interviews will be conducted with Veterans who completed iCBT and family members.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline Community Reintegration of Injured Service Members (CRIS) at 6 month follow-up</measure>
    <time_frame>6-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The CRIS is a commonly used measure of community reintegration in service members following deployment. Three scales assess the extent of participation, perceived limitations in participation, and satisfaction with community reintegration. Scores on each subscale range from 10 - 70, with higher scores indicating higher degrees of community reintegration.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline Short Form -12 Health Survey (SF-12) at 6 month follow-up</measure>
    <time_frame>6-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-12 measures eight domains related to physical and mental health, health perceptions, and the impact of physical or emotional problems on general functioning via self-report. Raw scores on the SF-12 range from 0-100, with higher scores reflecting higher levels of overall health and well-being.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) at 6 month follow-up</measure>
    <time_frame>6-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The BAI assesses the severity of anxiety symptoms across 21 items, minimizing those that overlap with depression. The BAI assesses cognitive and somatic components of anxiety. The cognitive subscale provides a measure of fearful thoughts and impaired cognitive functioning, whereas the somatic subscale measures the symptoms of physiological arousal. The total score on the BAI ranges from 0 - 63, with higher scores reflecting higher levels of anxiety.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline Beck Depression Inventory - Second Edition (BDI-II) at 6 month follow-up</measure>
    <time_frame>6-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The BDI-II is a well-validated 21-item measure that assesses symptoms of depression. The total score on the BDI-II ranges from 0 - 63, with higher scores reflecting higher levels of depression.</description>
