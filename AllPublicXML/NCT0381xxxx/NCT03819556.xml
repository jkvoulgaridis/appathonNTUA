    <textblock>
      This trial is a two-armed open randomized controlled trial in children aged 5-15 years with
      challenge proven Immunoglobulin E (IgE)-associated milk allergy.The purpose is to determine
      if oral immunotherapy with milk can induce tolerance to milk. The active intervention is
      intake of increasing amounts of fresh milk for six months followed by three years of
      maintenance treatment with milk. The control group continues their elimination (milk free)
      diet. The trial will recruit patients at ten pediatric departments in Sweden, coordinated by
      Umeå University. The primary outcome is milk tolerance (defined as a negative double-blind
      placebo-controlled milk challenge) at trial completion 3.5 years after start of treatment.
      Secondary outcomes include allergic symptoms during treatment documented as certain allergic
      manifestations, changes in immunological and microbial biomarkers, quality of life and
      nutritional status.

  <detailed_description>

      The underlying hypothesis is that exposure to milk in a controlled way can be delivered
      safely and induce tolerance to milk.The aim of this trial is to evaluate a specific protocol
      for oral milk intake to achieve sustainable tolerance.

      Before randomization all patients are tested for milk allergy using a double-blind
      placebo-controlled milk challenge and baseline laboratory analyses (specific IgE). Patients
      with confirmed, challenge-proven milk allergy are randomized to oral immunotherapy (active
      group) or milk-free diet (control group).The active group will receive a stepwise increase in
      oral milk intake. The increased dose will be given in hospital outpatient clinics by
      experienced study staff following a standard protocol. All other doses are given att home
      where the patients have adrenaline ready to use. When the patient has reached a daily intake
      of 100 ml of milk without serious allergic reactions they will be maintained on this dosis
      for three years. At this stage (after finished dose escalation or after six months for the
      control group) the patients will be tested for the second set of laboratory analyses.

      During maintenance, the patients in the active group are encouraged not to avoid milk protein
      and instead eat milk-containing food when it is offered. Patients in the control group
      receive standard care with exclusion of milk from their diet for the whole trial duration.

      After three years of maintenance therapy for the active group, both groups avoid milk for one
      week and then undergo a double-blind placebo-controlled milk challenge and the third set of
      samples for immunological comparison.

      The immunological markers are Immunoglobulins (E, G4, A), microbiota and basophilic
      activation. All patients are also evaluated for quality of life and nutritional status.

    <description>Quality Of Life, reported by questionnaire (FAQLQ-PF) after completion of the intervention (3.5 years) compared to pre-trial baseline level. The scale used is Emotional Impact, Food Related anxiety and Dietary Limitations. Each question of the FAQLQ is answered on a 7-point scale. Total FAQLQ scores and domain scores are calculated by dividing the sum of completed items by the number of completed items. Total FaQLQ and domain scores range from 1 &quot;no impairment&quot; to 7 &quot;maximal impairment&quot;. Higher values are a worse outcome (low health related quality of life). Subscale is Health related quality of life (HRQoL summary score=(Emotional Impact subscale score + Food Related anxiety subscale score+Dietary Limitations subscale score)/3.</description>
