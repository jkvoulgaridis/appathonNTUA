      The study is a multicenter trial conducted to compare the effectiveness of corticosteroid
      control to mesenchymal stem cell preparations from autologous bone marrow concentrate (BMAC),
      adipose derived stem cells in the form of Stromal Vascular Fraction (SVF), and third party
      human mesenchymal stem cells manufactured from umbilical cord tissue (UCT) for the treatment
      of unilateral Knee Osteoarthritis (OA). The study will be conducted in 4 sites in the United
      States, including Emory University. A total of 480 participants will be enrolled in this
      study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary osteoarthritis is a debilitating disease characterized by extensive damage to the
      joints and excruciating pain leading to loss of activity and depression. Despite advances in
      diagnosis and relatively efficient control of nociception, to date, the quest for the
      development of a disease modifying osteoarthritis drug has proven unsuccessful. The potential
      of mesenchymal stem cells to inhibit inflammation while promoting healing makes them amenable
      for the treatment of various ailments ranging from cancer to genetic diseases. In orthopedic
      practice, autologous stem cell injections are performed to alleviate the pain associated with
      osteoarthritis. A serious gap in knowledge remains whether the currently used cellular
      treatments are beneficial in the long term and if one cell therapy outperforms another.

      The most popular form of Autologous Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSC's) therapy has been through
      the use of Autologous Bone Marrow Concentrate (BMAC). The rationale is that when a sample of
      Bone Marrow Aspirate (BMA) is collected and the components that are not beneficial to the
      joint are filtered out (i.e. red blood cells, neutrophils, etc.) the remaining concentrate
      (MSC's, platelets, interleukins, etc) can have a &quot;healing&quot; effect on the environment in which
      it is injected. However it is still unknown as to how effective BMAC is for treating
      orthopedic conditions compared to other MSC procedures and the most important components of
      the BMAC mixture that could aid patients suffering from osteoarthritis.

      Adipose tissue has been found to have a large amount of mesenchymal stem cells versus that in
      bone marrow. These cells are currently being used in a variety of clinical research studies
      within the regenerative medicine field. Through a tissue process which includes washing and
      centrifuging, the cellular components can be extracted as a cell pellet, which is also known
      as Stromal Vascular Fraction (SVF). Adipose derived SVF is obtained via liposuction, or the
      removal of adipose tissue via a suction method.

      Although the use of various stem cell preparations for knee osteoarthritis has become
      increasingly prevalent, well-designed studies with conclusive proof of comparative
      effectiveness and identification of the optimal cell source and &quot;dose&quot; have not been
      performed. This study is the first randomized study comparing three types of cellular
      treatments to corticosteroids. The main objective of the study is to identify a superior
      source of stem cells for the treatment of osteoarthritis and validate its advantages over
      corticosteroid injections as the traditional gold standard treatment.

    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Pain assessment will be done using the VAS-pain scale at baseline and at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and at 12 months using the Visual Analog Pain Scale (VAS-pain). The VAS-pain is self‐completed by the participant. The respondent is asked to place a line perpendicular to the VAS line at the point that represents their pain intensity. Using a ruler, the score is determined by measuring the distance (mm) on the 10‐cm line between the &quot;no pain&quot; anchor and the participant's mark, providing a range of scores from 0-100. Pain will be assessed at rest and active movement of the affected joint. The recommended cut points for VAS are: no pain (0-4 mm), mild pain (5-44 mm), moderate pain (45-74 mm), and severe pain (75-100 mm).</description>

    <measure>Change in Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The KOOS questionnaire is an instrument to assess the participant's opinion about their osteoarthritis and associated problems. It consists of 5 subscales; Pain, other Symptoms, Function in daily living (ADL), Function in sport and recreation (Sport/Rec) and knee related Quality of life (QOL). Standardized answer options are given (5 Likert boxes) and each question is assigned a score from 0 to 4. A normalized score (100 indicating no symptoms and 0 indicating extreme symptoms) is calculated for each subscale. A total lower score indicates more problems. The assessment will be done at baseline and at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and at 12 months.</description>

    <measure>Change in EuroQuality of Life (EQ5D-3L) scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ5D 3L survey measures five dimensions - mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. The participants will be asked to answer questions regarding these measures and to indicate their current experience on a scale from 1 to 3 (1 being &quot;no problem&quot; and 3 being &quot;most extreme problem&quot;). The answers to these question are put together to create a 5 digit composite score.This composite score will be indexed to a lookup table which produces a single summary score from 0 to 100. The respondents self-rate their level of severity for each dimension using three levels. The assessment will be done at baseline and at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and at 12 months.</description>

    <measure>Change in Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS 29) scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS-29 assesses seven health domains: physical function, anxiety, depression, fatigue, sleep disturbance, pain interference, and ability to participate in social roles and activities. Each of the seven domains has four questions which are scored on a five-point Likert scale. The PROMIS-29 scales will be scored using a T-score metric method available at the Assessment Center website (http://assessmentcenter.net). A score of 50 points represents the population average for each scale, and 10 points represent one standard deviation. Higher scores mean more of the specific scale's construct, which may indicate a desirable or an undesirable outcome. The assessment will be done at baseline and at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and at 12 months.</description>
