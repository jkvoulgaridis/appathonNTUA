    <textblock>
      Background: Physical exercise should be an essential component of the therapeutic plan for
      every person diagnosed with cancer. However, most of these patients are inactive and only a
      few of them receive prescription and follow-up for safe and effective exercise plans.

      Objective: in a first experimental phase, we will evaluate actual implementation (reach and
      adherence) and clinical effectiveness (physical fitness, quality of life and symptoms) of the
      BIZI ORAIN (BO) exercise program, for all patients diagnosed with cancer, compared to
      standardized physical activity counseling. In a second, observational phase, we will evaluate
      the association between levels of physical activity actually performed by all the
      participants and their 12 months evolution, in terms of physical fitness, quality of life,
      symptomatology and survival.

      Design: Hybrid study, with a first experimental phase in which patients diagnosed with cancer
      will be randomly assigned to two parallel groups, one that immediately performs the BO
      program for 12 weeks and the other one that performs the same programme three months later
      (delayed treatment). In the second phase, observational, the entire cohort of participants
      will be followed-up for one year. Population: Any person diagnosed with cancer in the
      previous two years (minimum sample size = 1013) free of bone metastases, hematological or
      other exercise contraindications.

      BIZI ORAIN program: based on the &quot;Life Now&quot; program of the Australian Cancer Council, BO is a
      12-week small-group exercise program supervised by specially trained instructors combining
      moderate to high intensity aerobic and strength exercises (three 1 hour sessions a week).

      Outcome measurements: the main outcome variable will be the change in functional capacity at
      three months (400 meters walk test). Secondary variables include mortality, quality of life
      (general SF-36 and cancer specific quality of life -European Organization for Research and
      Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C-30-), symptoms (Cancer-related fatigue - Functional Assessment of
      Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-Fatigue), exposure to physical activity level
      objectively registered with Actigraph wGT3X-BT accelerometer, chronic inflammation
      (C-reactive protein, adiponectin, and pro-inflammatory cytokines Il-1, Il-6 , and TNF-), body
      composition and bone health (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry), measured at 0, 3, 6, and 12
      months.

      Analyses: changes observed in the outcome variables at three months will be compared between
      patients assigned to BO and to the reference group (delayed treatment) using analysis of the
      covariance, adjusted for baseline levels. To analyze the association between over time change
      in physical activity and the outcome variables mixed effects longitudinal models will be used
      for repeated measures throughout the 12 months of follow-up. Cox proportional hazards models
      will be used for the survival analysis. Qualitative analyses will combine a deductive
      approach with an inductive one based on Grounded Theory. In the deductive approach, the
      researchers will identify several thematic categories related to the Consolidated Framework
      for Implementation Research. Conclusions: BO is the first experience in Spain of a
      population-based exercise program that will guarantee, through a scientific evaluation, both
      clinical and implementation results. This will drastically advance the treatment of people
      suffering from cancer helping them to reverse the effects of their disease, the adverse
      effects of the therapies and to improve anti-cancer treatment efficacy, their quality of life
      and survival

    <time_frame>One year follow up. Measures at 0,3,6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The 400 meters walk Test applies to assess functional capacity, as well as a predictor of morbidity and mortality in people with different pathologies. Most of the daily activities that the patients with these pathologies are performed at submaximal exercise intensity, similar to this test is performed. It would be measured at 0, 3,6 and 12 months.</description>

    <description>The HRQL questionnaire is measured blindly with self-administered questionnaires: the Spanish version of the SF-36 and. Questionnaire will be filled out before and after the intervention. SF-36 generates an 8-dimension health profile and two summary scores for the physical and mental components. This questionnaire has been validated in the Spanish population. Measured at 0, 3, 6 and 12 months.</description>

    <description>Cancer specific quality of life is evaluated by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (QLQ-C-30) questionnaire (Aaronson et al., 1993). The QLQ-C-30 questionnaire includes five functional domains (physical, role, cognitive, emotional and social; higher scores represent greater function/quality of life) and three symptom scales (fatigue, pain and nausea; lower scores represent greater quality of life/less symptom severity).Measured at 0, 3, 6 and 12 months</description>

    <description>a 13 items scale that measures the cancer related fatigue. The FACT-G scoring guide identifies those items that must be reversed before being added to obtain subscale totals. Negatively stated items are reversed by subtracting the response from &quot;4&quot;. After reversing proper items, all subscale items are summed to a total, which is the subscale score.The higher score the score, the better the QOL. Measured at 0, 3, 6 and 12 months</description>
