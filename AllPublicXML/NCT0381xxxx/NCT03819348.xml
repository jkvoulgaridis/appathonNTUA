  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Through a multi-center large-sample retrospective study, the epidemiological changes of TSM
      in Guangxi have been reviewed, its incidence trend was understood to attract the attention of
      clinicians; the multiple programs of antifungal therapy for HIV-negative host TSM were
      compared in terms of effect on clinical remission rate, effective rate, recurrence rate,
      mortality and toxic side effects on HIV-negative host TSM; their prognosis and recurrence
      indicators were clarified, and a therapeutic effect evaluation system was established,
      providing a standard treatment and diagnosis scheme for clinical practice; and simultaneously
      the positive rate of G and GM experiments in respect of TSM, Aspergillus and other fungi was
      identified to provide TSM with biological diagnostic indicators. Improve the level of
      understanding and diagnosis and treatment of HIV-negative TSM in the whole area. A
      comprehensive efficacy evaluation system and standard treatment program was established to
      provide a basis for standardized treatment of TSM in HIV-negative hosts. The observational
      indicators included: 2-week all-cause mortality; 24-week all-cause mortality; clinical
      improvement time; level of decrease of fungus in the blood culture medium two weeks before
      treatment; recurrence; appearance of adverse drug reaction at the level 3 and above.

        We studied the clinical characteristics and prognoses of patients with infections due to
        Talaromyces marneffei who were admitted to Guangxi Hospital, This province is located in
        subtropical southern China, where Talaromyces marneffei is endemic.
