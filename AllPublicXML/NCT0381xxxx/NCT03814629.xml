      Research purpose To elucidate the effect mechanism and clinical effective of weifuchun in the
      prevention and treatment of chronic atrophic gastritis and precancerous lesions of gastric
      cancer. From genes related to cell differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, tumor invasion
      and metastasis, genes related to immune inflammation and immune escape and other possible
      aspects to elucidate the effective and mechanism of weifuchun's treatment on chronic atrophic
      gastritis, reversing precancerous lesions of gastric cancer.

      Clinical research abstract Title of Research Study：Randomized clinical trial: Weifuchun
      Treatment and mechanism on Precancerous Lesions of Gastric Cancer.

      Main Responsibility Person: Mingyu Sun research center：Shuguang Hospital Affiliated to
      Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Trial Objective：Observe the clinical
      efficacy and mechanism of Weifuchun in the treatment of chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG) and
      precancerous lesions of gastric cancer (PLGC) Therapeutic Schedule：Select 60 cases of chronic
      atrophic gastritis with intestinal metaplasia or dysplasia from and 60 cases of chronic
      atrophic gastritis without intestinal metaplasia or dysplasia at the Shuguang Hospital
      Affiliated to Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine. The treatment group was
      given Weifuchun tablets, 4 tablets each time, 3 times a day, and 1 hour after meals. The
      control group was given vitamin tablets (0.2 g), 4 tablets each time, 3 times a day, and 1
      hour after a meal. The course of chronic atrophic gastritis with intestinal metaplasia or
      dysplasia group treatment is 24 weeks, the course of chronic atrophic gastritis without
      intestinal metaplasia or dysplasia is 12 weeks. The all patients'clinical symptoms,
      histopathology, gastroscopy, and physical and chemical examinations were compared between the
      two groups before and after treatment.

    <description>The all patients' histopathology will be evaluated two times, the first time is when the patients' are included into the clinical trials, the second time is after 24 weeks treatment in each group, patients' histopathology should be evaluated for comparison between two groups,at the same time patients' histopathology should be evaluated for comparison in each group.We use Total score of gastric mucosa pathology to assess the therapeutic effect,the patients' were included into the clinical trials and after 24 weeks treatment we through the Pathological classification of chronic atrophic gastritis work out Total score of gastric mucosa pathology.
As follows:
There are five pathology grade:Chronic inflammation,Active,Atrophy,intestinal metaplasia,dysplasia.
Score 0 is normal;1 is mild; 2 is moderate;3 is severe;cumulative highest score is 15, cumulative lowest score is 0.The higher summed score, the more severe the pathological changes.</description>

    <description>The all patients' gastroscopy gastric mucosa manifestations evaluation will be evaluated two times, the first time is when the patients' are included into the clinical trials, the second time is after 24 weeks treatment in each group, patients' gastroscopy gastric mucosa manifestations should be evaluated for comparison between two groups, at the same time patients' gastroscopy should be evaluated for comparison in each group.
We use Gastric mucosa classification under gastroscope of chronic atrophic gastritis to assess the therapeutic effect,work out gastroscopy gastric mucosa manifestations integral.
There are four Gastric mucosa classification under gastroscope of chronic atrophic gastritis: erythema,erosion,Intramucosal hemorrhage,bile regurgitation.Score 0 is normal;1 is mild; 2 is moderate;3 is severe;cumulative highest score is 12, cumulative lowest score is 0.The higher summed score, the more severe the pathological changes.</description>

    <description>The all patients Clinical symptom assessment score when the patients' were included into the clinical trials and after 24 weeks treatment in each group. We use Clinical Symptom checklist to assess the therapeutic effect,work out Clinical Symptom integral. Clinical symptom mainly includes stomachache, acid reflux, burping, easy to hungry. Score 0 is frequency never;1 is occasionally; 2 is sometimes;3 is often; 4 is always. Summed highest score is 16, summed lowest score is 0.The higher summed score, the more severe the Clinical symptom.</description>
