        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Males or females between the ages of 55 and 85 years with a clinical diagnosis of
             early stage AD, defined according to the following criteria assessed during Screening
             and at Baseline :

               1. Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) score of 0.5 or 1, with Memory Box score of 0.5 or
                  greater

               2. MMSE score of 20 or greater

               3. RBANS DMI score ≤ 85 Note: PET imaging for amyloid is not required for diagnosis,
                  which will be made on clinical grounds.

          2. Currently receiving a stable (at least 2 months) dose regimen of donepezil or another
             cholinesterase inhibitor for treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Doses of these drugs
             may not be changed during the trial.

             Note: Memantine is not permitted during the trial and must be discontinued at least 3
             weeks prior to Baseline.

          3. Modified Hachinski Ischemia score &lt; 4.

          4. Body mass index (BMI) &lt; 38 kg/m2, inclusive, and body weight of &gt;48 kg (105 pounds) at
             screening.

          5. Female subjects must be at least two years post-menopausal (subjected reported
             menopausal status), surgically sterile (bilateral tubal ligation, hysterectomy, or

             willing to either (1) utilize hormonal contraception plus one barrier method or (2)
             use two barrier methods of contraception (e.g. diaphragm and spermicide) from initial
             screening until one month after taking the final dose. An intrauterine device (IUD) is
             considered a barrier method of contraception in this study. Male subjects must be
             willing to inform female partners of their participation in the study and must agree
             to use adequate contraceptive methods (vasectomy performed at least 6 months prior to
             first study drug administration, or use at least one barrier method of birth control).

          6. Able to understand and comply with the study procedures, voluntarily agree to
             participate in this study, and provide written informed consent prior to start of any
             study-specific procedures.

          7. All subjects must have a caregiver who is willing and able to ensure compliance with
             study medications, visits, and study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any medical or neurological condition (other than early stage AD) that might be a
             contributing cause to the subject's cognitive impairment.

          2. History of stroke or multiple (&gt;3 discreet episodes) Transient Ischemic Attacks
             (TIAs), severe head trauma with cognitive sequelae, uncontrolled seizures, or
             unexplained prolonged loss of consciousness (&gt; 1 minute) during the past year.

          3. Clinically significant major psychiatric illness during the past 6 months.

          4. History of unstable angina, myocardial infarction, chronic heart failure, or
             clinically significant conduction abnormalities during the past year.

          5. Clinically significant liver or renal disease.

          6. Clinically significant abnormality, in the Investigator's judgment, in hematology,
             chemistry, or urinalysis.

          7. Positive serology results for hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg) or hepatitis C virus
             (HCV).

          8. Abnormal liver function test at the Screening Visit (aspartate aminotransferase or
             alanine aminotransferase &gt;2

             × the upper limit of normal [ULN], or total bilirubin &gt;1.7 × ULN, based on appropriate
             age and gender normal values). Subjects may be re-screened once.

          9. Marked hypotension (systolic blood pressure [BP] ˂90 mmHg or diastolic BP ˂50 mmHg) or
             hypertension (systolic BP ˃160 mmHg or diastolic BP ˃100 mmHg) based on sitting
             values. O ut-of-range results may be repeated once at Screening, and eligibility must
             be confirmed at Baseline.

         10. Marked bradycardia (heart rate ˂45 beats per minute [bpm]) or tachycardia (heart rate
             ˃115 bpm) based on supine ECG values. Out-of-range results may be repeated once at
             Screening, and eligibility must be confirmed at Baseline.

         11. Clinically important conduction abnormalities on ECG, or evidence or history of long
             QT syndrome based on supine ECG values obtained at Screening. Out-of-range results may

             inhibitors), including memantine, psychotropic drugs other than SSRIs (which must have
             been stable for 2 months and remain stable throughout the study), sedative
             antihistamines or other centrally active medications with potential cognitive effects
             (e.g., CNS-penetrant beta blockers).

         15. Unable to discontinue moderate to strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4, CYP2D6, or
             other cytochromes at least 14 days prior to the first dose of study drug. A complete
             listing of such inhibitors or inducers may be found in
             http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/main-table (Other prescription or
             non-prescription drugs such as antihypertensive or cholesterol lowering agents are
             allowed, if, in the Investigator's judgement, they would not interfere with the study
             medication or the cognitive testing.)

         16. A suicidal ideation intensity score of 3 or higher per screening Columbia Suicide
             Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS) assessment on Day 1 (Baseline) and/or any suicidal

             and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition: DSM-5), or regular (daily)
             consumption of alcohol exceeding two bottles of beer, or the equivalent amount of
             other forms of alcohol (1 serving = 12 oz beer, 5.0 oz wine, or 1.5 oz distilled
             spirits).

         18. Inability or unwillingness to comply with the protocol, including performing the
             cognitive function tests, or likely inability to complete the study.

         19. Participation in other clinical studies involving investigational drug within the
             previous 30 days prior to the Screening Visit.

         20. Donation of blood within 4 weeks, or blood products within 2 weeks, prior to first
             study drug administration.

         21. History of clinically significant drug allergy that includes symptoms such as
