    <textblock>
      Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery is a procedure where surgeons use blood vessels
      from elsewhere in the body to go around blockages or narrowings in the heart arteries. Before
      the surgery, the surgeon needs to choose which vessel will be used for the bypass, including
      potentially the radial artery in the wrist. Smartphones have been shown in a previous study
      to be a better way to assess the arteries in the hand than the traditional physical
      examination, as it is less subjective than simply watching the flushing of the hand. In this
      study, the investigators will assess the utility of a smartphone application in determining
      whether there is enough blood flow in the hand prior to using the radial artery for CABG
      surgery.

      Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery is a procedure where surgeons use blood vessels
      from elsewhere in the body to go around blockages or narrowings in the heart arteries. Before
      the surgery, the surgeon needs to choose which vessel will be used for the bypass, including
      potentially the radial artery in the wrist. Before using this artery, it is important to
      ensure that there is enough blood flow to the hand to prevent complications. The best way to
      do this involves the use of ultrasound, but this takes a long time and its availability can
      be limited. Therefore, the assessment is usually done at the bedside by examining the hand,
      which relies on the doctor watching the flushing of the hand during compression and release
      of the artery. Currently, smartphones with cameras are able to assess blood flow by passing
      light through the skin and observing differences in brightness. This has been shown in a
      previous study to be a better way to assess the arteries in the hand than the traditional
      examination, as it is less subjective than simply watching the flushing of the hand. In this
      study, the investigators will assess the utility of a smartphone application in determining
      whether there is enough blood flow in the hand prior to using the radial artery for CABG
      surgery.

    <description>The Modified Allen's Test (MAT) will be performed in a well-lit room on the participant's hand. This technique will involve compression of both the radial and ulnar arteries by the investigator to assess patency of the contralateral artery. The participant will then be asked to clench and open their hand several times. The participant will then be asked to maintain their hand in an open position. The investigator will then release the compression over the ulnar artery and observe for palmar blush. The length of time to achieve maximal palmar blush will be recorded. This technique will then be repeated by maintaining compression over the ulnar artery and releasing of the compression over the radial artery.</description>

Briefly, the iPhone camera will be placed over the participant's index finger and patency assessed before and immediately following isolated contralateral artery compression for a maximum of two minutes.</description>
