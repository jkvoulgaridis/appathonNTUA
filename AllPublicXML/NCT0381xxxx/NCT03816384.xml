  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI) are the most common nosocomial
      infections in critically ill patients and are responsible for high morbidity rates, increased
      hospital stays and associated costs.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether active drain line clearance by the Accuryn
      Monitoring System reduces the incidence of CAUTI in hospitalized patients requiring
      catheters.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most common healthcare associated infection (HAI)
      acquired in hospitals and is estimated to account for approximately 13% of hospital
      infections in the United States, of which 75% are associated with indwelling urinary
      catheters. It is estimated that between 12-16% adult inpatients will receive an indwelling
      urinary catheter during their hospital stay. The rate of catheter-associated UTI (CAUTI) are
      highest in burn ICUs, followed by inpatient medical wards and neurosurgical ICUs.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether active drain line clearance by the Accuryn
      Monitoring System reduces the incidence of bacteriuria and/or CAUTI in patients requiring
      catheters for more than 72 hours. This study will also evaluate the efficacy in reducing
      bacteriuria of the Accuryn silver fabricated silicone catheters.
