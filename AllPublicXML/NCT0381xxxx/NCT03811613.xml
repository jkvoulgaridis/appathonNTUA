  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to assess the effects of transcranial photobiomodulation in patients with
      Parkinson's disease (PD).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thirty-five patients with idiopathic PD were randomly assigned to a photobiomodulation (n=17,
      [mean±SD] 72±7 years) or sham group (n=18, 70±8 years) during 9 weeks (2 sessions/week). The
      primary endpoint was the motor portion of the Movement Disorders Society-United PD Rating
      Scale. Secondary endpoints were the Scales for Outcomes in PD, static posturography, walking
      ability (ten-meter walk test [TMWT]) and functional mobility (timed up and go [TUG] test).

    <description>The motor portion (part III) Movement Disorders Society-Unified PD Rating Scale. It assesses the motor signs of Parkinson´s disease (minimum and maximum score is 0 and 76 points respectively -the higher score, the higher movement disorder and vice versa-).</description>

    <description>The Spanish-validated version of the Short Parkinson's Evaluation Scale (SPES)/Scales for Outcomes in PD (SCOPA). It measures the Parkinson´s disease patients motor function (minimum and maximum score is 0 and 63 points respectively -the higher score, the worse motor function and vice versa-).</description>

    <description>17 Parkinson´s disease patients were randomly assigned to the photobiomodulation group (experimental group).
Intervention: Photobiomodulation was administered using red light-emitting diodes (LEDs) with a 670-nm wavelength in six 1-minute blocks alternating the LEDs between the right and left temples, with a 30-second rest between blocks.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Sham Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>18 Parkinson´s disease patients were randomly assigned to the sham group.
Intervention: Procedures for the sham group were identical as the photobiomodulation one, except that patients received photobiomodulation during only 5 seconds followed by 55 seconds with no treatment (equalling 1/12th of the energy used for the intervention group).</description>
