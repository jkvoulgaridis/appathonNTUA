  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center study at Washington University (WASH U), University of Southern
      California (USC), and Huntington Medical Research Institute (HMRI).The overall goal of both
      the AA program and the PPG program is to advance current knowledge on the vascular
      contributions to dementia particularly in individuals with the major genetic risk factor for
      late-onset AD, i.e., apolipoprotein E-ε4 (APOE4) gene that develop early vascular dysfunction
      and significant cerebrovascular pathology compared to non-carriers, and establish whether the
      neurovasculature plays a key role in cognitive decline, and therefore is a key new
      therapeutic target to treat dementia in APOE4 carriers.

          -  MRI contraindications (e.g. electronic medical devices, severe claustrophobia,
             inability to lie still for long periods) that make it unsafe to participate in an MRI
             scan, using standard screening processes implemented by Washington University and

    <ipd_description>We will share the data with other researchers. They may be doing research in areas similar to this research or in other unrelated areas. These researchers may be at Washington University, at other research centers and institutions, or industry sponsors of research. We may also share the research data with large data repositories (a repository is a database of information) for broad sharing with the research community. The participant&quot;s individual research data is placed in one of these repositories only qualified researchers, who have received prior approval from individuals that monitor the use of the data, will be able to look at this information.</ipd_description>
