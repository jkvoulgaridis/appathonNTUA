      For this project, the CVS Pharmacy Health Foundation has identified after-school, school, and
      youth programs nationwide with whom to partner. For this project, the play2PREVENT Lab will
      provide these programs access to the tobacco use reduction/prevention game that the lab has
      created (smokeSCREEN). Program and school staff will enroll participants between the ages of
      10-16 to play smokeSCREEN during their after school, school, and youth program. Before and
      after gameplay, participants will answer assessment questions related to their attitudes,
      beliefs, knowledge, intentions, and behaviors around smoking and tobacco product use. The
      data will be transmitted electronically via the LimeSurvey data collection platform to the
      Lab, for further analysis. None of the Lab staff will have contact with participants or
      after-school/school/youth program coordinators or staff.

    <description>Participants completed a pre-survey through a secured, data collection website (LimeSurvey Data Collection Software), after they have played the videogame intervention. Fourteen questions were designed from the National Youth Tobacco Survey (2014)13 that focused on beliefs about cigarettes, e-cigarettes, and flavored tobacco were used for the survey. For beliefs, questions had 4-5 choices ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree or definitely yes to definitely not, or 5 responses ranging from unlikely to very likely.</description>

Questions assessing the number of friends/peers who use tobacco products will range from 0 to 4 (including an &quot;I don't know&quot; option). Questions, such as &quot;How would your best friends act toward you if you smoked cigarettes,&quot; have response options ranging from very unfriendly to very friendly (4 choices).</description>

    <intervention_name>smokeSCREEN web-based game</intervention_name>
    <description>smokeSCREEN tobacco use reduction/prevention web-based game. The game has 1.5-2 hours of unique game play and focuses on combustible cigarettes, e-cigarettes, and flavored tobacco products. Guided by the social cognitive theory and the theory of planned behavior, smokeSCREEN addresses a range of challenges that teens often face involving peer pressure and the use of tobacco products. Participants are provided access to the smokeSCREEN game through a private, password-protected website link and instructed to complete the game.</description>
