  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to develop a coordinated program (Dyad Plus) that would help
      to facilitate self-monitoring, positive communication, joint problem solving, and social
      support to increase physical activity, healthy eating, and weight loss. Participants of the
      Brenner FIT (Families In Training) pediatric weight management program and their
      parent/guardian will co-enroll in weight loss programs. Parents/guardians will receive the
      components of By Design Essentials.

      Participation in this study will involve participation in six, one-hour sessions in addition
      to those required by your weight loss program. These sessions will work to facilitate an
      increase in self-monitoring, positive communication, problem solving, and social support to
      increase healthy physical activity and eating behaviors to increase the effectiveness of the
      weight loss programs. Joint goal setting and tracking will be enabled by commercially
      available devices and apps. Each caregiver and child will receive an activity monitor,
      activity app, and a food app (digital food diary) that allows self-monitoring of consumption
      and &quot;social accountability,&quot; which will allow caregivers and the Brenner FIT team to monitor
      and encourage. Furthermore, two home visits will be conducted to evaluation the home food and
      activity environments to inform tailored feedback to families.

      Brenner FIT is a family-based pediatric weight management clinic for youth 2-18 years old
      referred by a physician for overweight or obesity.11-14 By Design is an adult (&gt;18yrs) weight
      loss clinic that includes tailored dietary and physical activity behavioral counseling. The
      preliminary data suggest that most adolescent youth who enroll in Brenner FIT have at least
      one adult caregiver who is eligible and would benefit from enrollment in By Design
      Essentials.

    <description>Brenner FIT pediatric weight management program enrollment. an interdisciplinary, family-based pediatric weight management clinic based upon the Familial Approach to Treatment of Childhood Obesity. Patients are referred by a physician for obesity or overweight with a weight-related comorbidity. Treatment teams are comprised of a pediatrician, counselor, dietitian, and physical activity specialist, with others (e.g., social workers, physical therapists) as needed. The entire family is encouraged to attend all aspects of the treatment program, although only one attending caregiver is required.</description>

    <description>Weight loss program for adults/caregivers of those enrolled in Brenner FIT. Participants in the By Design condition (adult caregivers) will be prescribed the Essentials lifestyle intervention which includes tailored dietary and physical activity goals designed to achieve 1-2 lbs./week of weight loss, provided by a multidisciplinary team of medical providers, dietitians, behaviorists, and exercise specialists. A daily calorie restriction of 500 kcal/day is prescribed based on estimates of total energy expenditure (TEE) obtained from a measured resting metabolic rate (RMR) prior to enrollment.</description>

    <description>This component adds four additional strategies: dyad group sessions, one-on-one parent/child communication sessions, joint goal setting/tracking, and home environment assessment. This innovative approach will seek to employ components of motivation and communication theories to increase self-monitoring, positive communication, problem solving, and social support to increase healthy physical activity and eating behaviors to increase the effectiveness of the weight loss programs beyond gains observed in matched controls.
