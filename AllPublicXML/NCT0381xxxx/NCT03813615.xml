  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find the safest level of aerobic training for people about to
      undergo surgery for their cancer, and to learn what effects, if any, aerobic exercise has on
      these patients and the outcomes of their cancers. This part of the study (Phase 0) will
      evaluate the feasibility and quality of at-home exercise and assessment procedures and find
      out whether study participants are willing to practice continuous lifestyle monitoring using
      apps and electronic devices.

    <intervention_model_description>This protocol is a single-center, open-label, phase 0 / 1 a/b study of preoperative aerobic training in patients with untreated solid tumors. This study design allows for the enrollment of patients with various types of cancer. This study will target three cohorts of patients with prespecified solid malignancies.</intervention_model_description>

All aerobic training treatment will be implemented and may be monitored using TeleEx. Participants may also perform up to two aerobic training sessions per week in an unsupervised home-based setting. Patients will be provided with Appendix J - Unsupervised Home-Based Exercise Recording Form and Appendix K - Unsupervised Home-Based Exercise Instructions to record their sessions. General physical activity as well as exercise performed outside of the structured treatment sessions will be evaluated via continuous monitoring using MSK approved telemedicine / wireless technology.</description>
