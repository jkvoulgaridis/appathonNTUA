      This study will be an open label, long term extension study in subjects with atherosclerotic
      cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), ASCVD-risk equivalents (eg, diabetes and familial
      hypercholesterolemia), or heterozygous or homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH or
      HoFH) and elevated low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) despite maximum tolerated dose
      of LDL-C lowering therapies who have completed any of the following inclisiran Phase III
      lipid lowering studies: MDCO-PCS-17-03 (ORION-9), MDCO-PCS-17-04 (ORION-10), MDCO-PCS-17-08
      (ORION-11) or MDCO-PCS-17-02 (ORION-5).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Completion of a previously qualifying Phase III lipid-lowering ORION feeder study
             [MDCO-PCS-17-03 (ORION-9), MDCO-PCS-17-04 (ORION-10), MDCO-PCS-17-08 (ORION-11) or
             MDCO-PCS-17-02 (ORION-5)] meaning the subject received the last dose of study drug and
             completed the final study visit per applicable protocol.

          2. On current lipid-lowering therapies (such as a statin and/or ezetimibe) from previous
             study with no planned medication or dose change during study participation.

          3. Willing and able to give informed consent before initiation of any study-related
             procedures and willing to comply with all required study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any uncontrolled or serious disease, or any medical or surgical condition, that may
             either interfere with participation in the clinical study, and/or put the subject at
             significant risk [according to investigator's (or delegate's) judgment] if he/she
             participates in the clinical study.

          2. An underlying known disease, or surgical, physical, or medical condition that, in the
             opinion of the investigator (or delegate) might interfere with interpretation of the
             clinical study results.

          3. Severe concomitant noncardiovascular disease that carries the risk of reducing life
             expectancy to less than 3 years,

          4. Active liver disease defined as any known current infectious, neoplastic, or metabolic
             pathology of the liver or unexplained alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate
             aminotransferase (AST), elevation &gt;3x the upper limit of normal (ULN), or total
             bilirubin (TBIL) elevation &gt;2x ULN at the last recorded visit in the feeder study
             prior to study entry visit.

          5. Females who are pregnant or nursing, or who are of childbearing potential and
             unwilling to use at least one method of acceptable effective contraception (eg, oral
             contraceptives, barrier methods, approved contraceptive implant, long-term injectable
             contraception, intrauterine device) for the entire duration of the study. Exemptions
             from this criterion:

               1. Women &gt;2 years postmenopausal (defined as 1 year or longer since last menstrual
                  period) and more than 55 years of age.

               2. Postmenopausal women (as defined above) and less than 55 years of age with a
                  negative pregnancy test within 24 hours of randomization.

               3. Women who are surgically sterilized at least 3 months prior to enrollment.

          6. Planned use of other investigational medicinal products other than inclisiran or
             devices during the course of the study.

          7. Any condition that according to the investigator could interfere with the conduct of
             the study, such as but not limited to:

               1. Subjects who are unable to communicate or to cooperate with the investigator

               2. Unable to understand the protocol requirements, instructions and study-related
                  restrictions, the nature, scope, and possible consequences of the study
                  (including subjects whose cooperation is doubtful due to drug abuse or alcohol
                  dependency)

               3. Unlikely to comply with the protocol requirements, instructions, and
                  study-related restrictions (eg, uncooperative attitude, inability to return for
                  follow-up visits, and improbability of completing the study)

               4. Have any medical or surgical condition, which in the opinion of the investigator
                  would put the subject at increased risk from participating in the study

               5. Persons directly involved in the conduct of the study.
