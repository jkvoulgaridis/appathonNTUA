    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical trial is to study the safety and feasibility of anti- Mesothelin
      Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-Cell (MESO CAR-T cells) therapy for Refractory-Relapsed Ovarian
      Cancer
    </textblock>

      Primary Objectives:

      1. To determine the safety and feasibility of anti- MESO CAR-T cells therapy for
      Refractory-Relapsed Ovarian Cancer

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To access the efficacy of anti- MESO CAR-T cells in patients with ovarian cancer.

        2. To determine in vivo dynamics and persistency of anti- MESO CAR-T cells

        3. To assess the quality of life in patients with ovarian cancer after treatment with anti-
           MESO CAR-T cells.

    <measure>EORTC Quality-of-Life Questionnaire Core 15 Palliative Care (QLQ-C15-PAL) of patients after administration</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year post infusion</time_frame>
    <description>This QLQ-C15-PAL score consists of 15 questions; two multi-item functional scales (physical and emotional functioning), two multi-item symptom scales (fatigue and pain) together with five single-item symptom scales (nausea/vomiting, dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation) and one final question referring to overall QOL. The physical functioning scale is based on three questions regarding walking, activities of daily living and time spent in bed or in a chair. The emotional functioning scale is based on two questions that ask about feeling tense or depressed. Patients rated each question on a Likert scale from 1 (not at all) to 4 (very much), with the exception of overall QOL, which was rated from 1 (very poor) to 7 (excellent)</description>
