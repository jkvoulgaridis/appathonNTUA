      The purpose of the present study is to test in a preliminary manner an innovative strategy
      for treating depression among adolescents (alongside existing therapy) using community
      volunteerism. In addition, this study will test a potential mechanism by which volunteering
      might decrease depressive symptoms: increasing psychosocial assets, specifically decreasing
      self-orientation and increasing an orientation toward others. This will be measured through
      self-report as well as using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). This study will be
      the first study to explore how neural response patterns are potentially altered by intense
      experiences with volunteerism among depressed adolescents.

    <measure>Depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Beck Depression Inventory to measure depressive symptoms. Each item is rated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 to 3. The minimum total score is 0 and the maximum total score is 63. Higher scores denote worse outcome</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Strength of Connectivity in DMN (Default Mode Network)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Default Mode Network Connectivity will be measured using fMRI at rest and while processing emotional pictures before and after volunteering intervention. The strength of connectivity within the DMN will be calculated by averaging attributes for each node in the DMN.</description>

    <measure>Hope scale (Abler et al., 2017)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Hope scale (Abler et al., 2017) will be measured on a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Items will be averaged; higher scores denote better outcome (more hope).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Beck Hopelessness Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Beck Hopelessness Inventory will be used (scored from 1-20; higher score denotes worse outcome).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>NIH toolbox measure from 1 (never) to 5 (very often); scores will be averaged and high score indicates more self-efficacy.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Orientation Toward Others</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>5 point scale from 1=strongly disagree to 5=strongly agree. Scores will be averaged; higher score denotes more orientation toward others.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Empathy</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>IRI (Interpersonal Reactivity Index) subscale to measure empathy on a 5 point scale from 1- strongly disagree to 5 -strongly agree. Scores will be averaged; higher score denotes more empathy.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Experience in Volunteering</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Measured through the Inventory of Service Experience (Taylor &amp; Pancer, 2007) on a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Scores will be averaged for subscales of the measure. Higher score denotes better outcomes (more positive experiences with volunteering).</description>
