    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to determine the safety profile of the study drug after it is
      given by mouth to healthy participants. Blood tests will be performed to check how much
      LY3372689 gets into the bloodstream and how long the body takes to get rid of it. Each
      enrolled participant will receive up to 3 doses of LY3372689 or placebo. The study will last
      about 12 weeks, including screening.
