  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness of a novel program—Family
      Partners for Health Action (FAM-ACT) - to individual patient-focused diabetes self-management
      education and care management(I-DSMES/CM).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      FAM-ACT uses three innovative approaches to enhance the impact of family support on diabetes
      management:

        1. Provide Support Person with core behavioral strategies, hands-on training, and tools
           directed at specific roles in supporting diabetes management (e.g. how to support action
           planning and medication adherence).

        2. Teach Support Person how to deliver support in ways that will empower patients and not
           sabotage support efforts (e.g. empathetic and autonomy-supportive communication).

        3. Teach Support Person ways to boost patient engagement in healthcare (e.g. how to support
           healthcare visit preparation and participatory communication with providers).

      CHWs will deliver FAM-ACT through Support Person-focused group DSMES sessions plus Support
      Person-focused care management sessions to Patient-Support Person dyads at an urban federally
      qualified health center. 268 patients with type 2 diabetes and either poor glycemic or blood
      pressure control will be randomized together with a member or friend (known as a Support
      Person) to receive either FAM-ACT or more traditional CHW-led patient-focused DSMES/CM over
      12 months.

The participants and staff delivering the interventions will not be blinded, but the data analyst will be.
This trial aims to compare the effect of the FAM-ACT intervention on patients' diabetes-related health behaviors and outcomes compared to patient-focused DSMES and care management.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) Risk Engine derives the risk of a coronary event in the next 5 years. The engine software creates a risk percentage based on the patient's age, gender, ethnicity, smoking status, presence or absence of atrial fibrillation and levels of HbA1c, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol. A higher percentage indicates a greater risk of having a CHD or fatal CHD in the next 5 years.</description>
