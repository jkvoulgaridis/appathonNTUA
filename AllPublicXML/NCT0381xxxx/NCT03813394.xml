  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, randomized, phase Ib/II open-label study of pembrolizumab (pembro or
      MK-3475) with or without bevacizumab in patients with recurrent non-curable or metastatic
      nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of 2 treatment arms. In Treatment Arm A, patients will be treated with
      intravenous pembrolizumab alone, 21-day cycle. For Treatment Arm B, patients will receive
      intravenous pembrolizumab preceded by an infusion of bevacizumab (Day 1 of 21-day cycle).
      Each treatment cycle is 3 weeks. Up to 48 patients will be enrolled in this study in 2
      stages. The first stage will consist of 30 patients and the remaining 18 patients will be
      added if interim data looks promising.

      Eligible patients will be randomized 1:1 into either Treatment Arm A or Arm B. Treatment will
      continue until tumor progression, intolerance to treatment, or up to 2 years (32 doses of
      pembrolizumab/bevacizumab). For patients who have progressed on pembrolizumab alone, cross
      over to Arm B is allowed, with repeat biopsy of the lesions before and 1 week after starting
      bevacizumab. Patients who discontinue from the trial will not be replaced.

      The study will collect serial samples of tumor tissue and blood to determine the PD
      biomarkers of immune activation, in the tumor and systemically, following treatment. This is
      expected to provide preliminary evidence for immune stimulation using both pembrolizumab and
      bevacizumab in NPC. The tumor biopsies will also present an opportunity to determine the
      molecular details of tissue and tumor response to anti-angiogenic therapy.

             consent for the trial.

          2. Participants who are at least 21 years of age on the day of signing informed consent
             with histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of non-keratinizing
             nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) that has recurred at loco regional and/or distant sites
             will be enrolled in this study.

          3. Have measurable disease based on RECIST 1.1. Lesions situated in a previously
             irradiated area are considered measurable if progression has been demonstrated in such
             lesions.

          4. Have locally or centrally determined EBV-positive NPC by EBV-encoded small RNA in situ
             hybridization (EBER in situ hybridization [ISH]) assay. If EBV-positive status has
             been previously determined by EBER ISH assay, then no re-testing is required. Note: If
             EBV status by EBER ISH assay has not been previously determined, tumor tissue from
             archival tissue may be submitted for EBV determination.

          5. Received one or more lines of chemotherapy, which must include prior treatment with a
             platinum agent and must not be amenable to potentially curative radiotherapy or

          6. Have provided archival tumor tissue sample of newly obtained core or excisional biopsy
             of a tumor lesion not previously irradiated. Formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE)
             tissue blocks are preferred to slides. Newly obtained biopsies are preferred to
             archived tissue. Note: If submitting unstained cut slides, newly cut slides should be
             submitted to the testing laboratory within 14 days from the date slides are cut.

          7. Willingness to donate blood and tissue for mandatory translational research studies.

          8. Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1

          9. Have an adequate organ function.Specimens must be collected within 10 days prior to
             the start of study treatment.

        Participants are excluded from the study if any of the following criteria apply:

          1. Has received prior systemic anti-cancer therapy including investigational agents
             within 4 weeks prior to randomization. Note: Participants must have recovered from all
             AEs to previous therapies to ≤ Grade 1 or baseline. Participants with ≤ Grade 2
             neuropathy may be eligible. Note: If participants received major surgery, they must
             have recovered adequately from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention
             prior to starting study treatment.

          2. Is currently participating in or has participated in a study of an investigational
             agent or has used an investigational device within 4 weeks prior to first dose of

          7. Has hypersensitivity to bevacizumab or any of its components.

          8. Has received prior radiotherapy within 2 weeks of start of study treatment.
             Participants must have recovered from all radiation-related toxicities, not require
             corticosteroids, and not have had radiation pneumonitis. A 1-week washout is permitted
             for palliative radiation (≤ 2 weeks of radiotherapy) to non-CNS disease.

          9. Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or has required active treatment
             within the past 3 years. Note: Participants with basal cell carcinoma of the skin,
             squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, transitional cell carcinoma of urothelial cancer,
             or carcinoma in situ (e.g. breast or cervical carcinoma in situ) that have undergone
             potentially curative therapy are not excluded.

         10. Has known brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases, whether treated or untreated.
             NOTE: Primary nasopharyngeal cancers that directly invade the skull base and extend
             into the infratemporal fossa (e) are not regarded as brain metastases and are not
             excluded.

         11. Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years
             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive
             drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g. thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc) is not considered a
             form of systemic treatment.

         12. Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or has current
             pneumonitis.

         14. Has uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

         15. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator

         16. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

         17. Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the screening visit through 120 days

         18. A WOCBP who has a positive urine pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to
             randomization/allocation (see Appendix 3). If the urine test is positive or cannot be
             confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required. Note: In the event
             that 72 hours have elapsed between the screening pregnancy test and the first dose of
             study treatment, another pregnancy test (urine or serum) must be performed and must be
             negative in order for subject to start receiving study medication.
