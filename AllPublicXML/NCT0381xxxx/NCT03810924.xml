    <textblock>
      Long-term aim is the definition of a setup of mobile sensors and their integration in a
      mobile infrastructure that allows the prediction of stress related alcohol intake in an
      ambulatory setting. Here, we aim to identify stress- and alcohol cue-related physiological
      markers in a lab experiment to assess interactions between acute psychological vs. physical
      stress exposure and alcohol cue-exposure regarding their effects on measures relevant for the
      development and maintenance of Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD). Further, we aim to identify neural
      correlates in brain circuits of motivational, cognitive, and affective processing. In
      addition to applying established stress-related markers, we will integrate innovative
      sensor-based measures.

      In patients with Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) stress exposure is known to affect craving,
      cue-reactivity and relapse risk. Here, we aim to identify stress- and alcohol cue-related
      physiological markers in a lab experiment to assess interactions between acute psychological
      vs. physical stress exposure and alcohol cue-exposure regarding their effects on (1) alcohol
      craving and related markers (attentional bias to alcohol-cues, implicit association task,
      neural cue-reactivity), (2) their predictive capacity for future alcohol intake, (3) the
      identification their neural correlates in brain circuits of motivational, cognitive, and
      affective processing. In addition to applying established stress-related markers (cortisol in
      saliva, heart-rate variability, systolic blood pressure and electrodermal activity), (4) we
      will integrate portable sensors (wearables) to allow a future integration in ambulatory
      assessments and to test innovative measures currently under investigation (e.g. voice stress
      analysis) to identify whether these additional parameters increase the predictive
      significance. Our long-term aim is the definition of a setup of mobile sensors and their
      integration in a mobile infrastructure that allows the prediction of stress related alcohol
      intake in an ambulatory setting.
