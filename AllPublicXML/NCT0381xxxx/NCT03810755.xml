  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical objectives: estimate the common effect of the EfiKroniK physical exercise program
      for people with a set of Chronic diseases (solid cancers, hematological, schizophrenia and
      COPD), expressed in terms of functional capacity, quality of life and others results,
      regarding the standardized intervention of healthy habits `Prescribe Healthy Living 'PVS.

      Implementation objectives: describe the adherence, continuity, adequacy and usefulness of
      EfiKroniK perceived by patients and professionals, with the purpose of designing
      implementation strategies, which will be evaluated in future trials.

      Design: clinical trial and implementation, pragmatic and randomized to two groups stratified
      by pathology, followed for 12 m.

      Participants: 370 patients diagnosed with solid cancers, hematological cancers, schizophrenia
      and COPD, in the most advanced stages.

      Scope: Hospital de Cruces, Basque Country University, Primary Care Research Unit of Bizkaia.

      Intervention: personalized exercise program for patients, supervised during 3 months by
      nursing in primary and autonomous care afterwards, with support from community resources.

      Reference group: PVS program, of proven effectiveness for the promotion of physical activity,
      diet and smoking cessation.

      Measurements: main measure of results: functional capacity at 3 months (6-minute test and
      submaximal running / running tests at foot to determine the speed of lactate thresholds) and
      quality of life at 6 and 12 months (SF-36 and specific questionnaires by pathology).
      Secondary variable results: physical and psychic symptomatology, biological markers, physical
      form and survival.

      Analysis: The common effect of the exercise will be estimated by comparing both groups by
      intention to treat, by means of analysis of the covariance of mixed effects for the changes
      observed at 3, 6 and 12 months adjusted for the baseline and possible confounders.

      Previously, a possible interaction effect between the pathology group and the effect of the
      intervention will be ruled out. The cost-effectiveness and cost-utility reasons.

    <time_frame>One year follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The Test of the 6-minute applies to assess functional capacity, as well as a predictor of morbidity and mortality in people with different pathologies. Most of the daily activities that the patients with these pathologies are performed at submaximal exercise intensity, similar to this test is performed. In addition, as a method of controlling the intensity. Measurements: baseline, at the end of the exercise program, at 6 and 12 months</description>
