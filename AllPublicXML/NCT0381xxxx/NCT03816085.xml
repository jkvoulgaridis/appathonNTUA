  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In daily life, stiletto heeled shoes which are popularly preferred by women have different
      heel heights. This study aims to investigate the effects of these differences on balance,
      muscular endurance and functional skills. Heel heights were chosen as 4 and 10 cm. Other
      features of shoes (stiletto type/colour etc.) will be same. The tests will be randomly done
      barefoot, 10 cm, and 4cm shoes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The evaluations will include Functional Forward Reach Test for dynamic balance and Single Leg
      Standing for static balance, heel raising and squat-up test for muscular endurance of plantar
      flexor and quadriceps muscles, ascending stairs for functional skills.

      Measuring distance will be used for Functional reach test and timing will be used for single
      leg standing test. Timing and repetition number will be used for muscular endurance tests.
      Timing will be used to climb up 10 stairs with and without heel contact.

    <measure>Single Leg Standing</measure>
