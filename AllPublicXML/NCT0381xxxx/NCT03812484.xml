    <textblock>
      This study entails an evaluation of the New Jersey State Parole Board Swift, Certain, and
      Fair (SCF) Supervision Program. The purpose of the evaluation is to test whether subjects
      assigned to SCF Supervision perform better than those assigned to parole-as-usual (PAU).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Swift, Certain, and Fair (SCF) Supervision Program - Including Project HOPE Program
      provides funding to states, units of local government, territories, and federally recognized
      Indian tribes (as determined by the Secretary of the Interior) in an effort to enhance public
      safety, foster collaboration, and to improve the outcomes of individuals under the
      supervision of community corrections. The goals of this program are to develop and enhance
      SCF initiatives and implement the SCF model with fidelity, resulting in reduced recidivism
      and better outcomes for program participants. SCF approaches are intended to: (a) improve
      supervision strategies that reduce recidivism; (b) promote and increase collaboration among
      agencies and officials who work in community corrections and related fields to enhance swift
      and certain sanctions; (c) enhance the offenders' perception that the supervision decisions
      are fair, consistently applied, and consequences are transparent; and (d) improve the
      outcomes of individuals participating in these initiatives. The grantee will use awarded
      grant funds to support programming that provides services to up to 75 opioid involved
      parolees with services to divert them from a return to prison and manage underlying
      addictions with a combination of behavioral therapy and medication assisted treatments. The
      program combines sanctions with targeted reentry and treatment services.
