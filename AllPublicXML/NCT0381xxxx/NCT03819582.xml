  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Artificial lenses, otherwise known as intraocular lenses (IOLs), are used to replace the
      natural crystalline lens within the eye during cataract or refractive lens surgery. Monofocal
      IOLs are the traditional IOL type used during cataract surgery. These monofocal IOLs provide
      excellent distance vision, however spectacles are required for reading and intermediate
      distance tasks. Monofocal Intraocular lenses are the mainstay of cataract surgery, but with
      advancing technologies and a wider selection of lenses available, demand for improved
      outcomes, improved lens design and ease of surgical implantation have increased. The purpose
      of this study is to assess the visual performance of the EyeCee One monofocal intraocular
      lens. In addition an assessment of the ease of insertion by the surgeon will be quantified.

      Artificial lenses, otherwise known as intraocular lenses (IOLs), are used to replace the
      natural crystalline lens within the eye during cataract or refractive lens surgery. Monofocal
      IOLs are the traditional IOL type used during cataract surgery. These monofocal IOLs provide
      excellent distance vision, however spectacles are required for reading and intermediate
      distance tasks. There are many different designs of monofocal IOLs, all with their own unique
      optical properties, however there is little evidence to support which optical design provides
      the best visual outcome. This research project allows us to assess the visual outcomes of a
      specific monofocal IOL. It also allows us to assess the ease of use of the lens to the
      surgeon.

      Each subject will be evaluated at two visits following IOL implantation; visit 1 (1 month
      post implantation), Visit 2 (3 months post implantation).

      At both post-operative visits the patient will undergo:

      Refraction Uncorrected and best corrected distance and near visual acuity measurement Optical
      biometry to assess ELP Slit lamp biomicroscopy to assess for post-operative complications

      At the time of surgery, the ophthalmic surgeon will complete a questionnaire, detailing lens
      insertion time and ease of use.
