  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to deliver an evidence-based smoking cessation intervention comprising the
      provision of brief cessation advice to smokers attending emergency departments and active
      referral to existing smoking cessation services. The objectives are as follows:

        1. To promote this evidence-based project to emergency departments in various hospitals
           under the Hospital Authority

        2. To construct a network with non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to provide smoking
           cessation services

        3. To train healthcare professionals to use the AWARD model to deliver brief cessation
           advice to smokers

        4. To deliver brief cessation advice via healthcare professionals and actively refer
           smokers to existing smoking cessation services.

  <detailed_description>

      Smoking exerts harmful effects on nearly every organ of the body and is considered
      responsible for 7 million deaths worldwide every year.1 Despite a decrease in the prevalence
      of daily cigarette smoking from 23.3% in 1982 to 10.0% in 2017, 615,000 daily smokers2 remain
      in Hong Kong, where 400,000 hospitalisations per year are attributable to smoking.3 These
      statistics cannot be overlooked or undervalued.

      The provision of medical attention to smokers in physical discomfort who visit accident and
      emergency departments (AEDs) could be an excellent teachable model, as it provides an
      invaluable opportunity to encourage smoking cessation. Smokers who consult physicians in an
      emergency setting are more likely to adopt better health-related behaviours. According to the
      Hospital Authority,4 approximately 2 million people visit AEDs in Hong Kong each year; of
      them, 68% are triaged as semi-urgent (level 4) or non-urgent (level 5). The average waiting
      time for a medical consultation varies among AEDs but generally exceeds 30 min for triage
      level 4 and 1-2 h for level 5. These wait times represent a golden opportunity in which
      healthcare professionals could advise smokers to quit and provide information about available
      smoking cessation programmes.4 However, cigarette smoking is addictive, and cessation is a
      difficult process associated with a high rate of relapse, particularly among smokers with a
      high level of nicotine dependency.5 According to the latest Hong Kong Thematic Household
      Survey, 31.2% of participating cigarette smokers had tried but failed to quit smoking.2
      Therefore, an innovative intervention is needed and should be evaluated with the intent to
      enhance its effectiveness and potential for implementation in clinical settings. Based on the
      health needs of the community, we propose that such a smoking cessation strategy should
      combine different components, such as the administration of brief advice by healthcare
      professionals and the provision of referrals and follow-up boosters by community smoking
      cessation services, to achieve a larger intervention effect.

      Most existing cessation programmes, including stage-matched interventions6 and motivational
      interviews,7 generally require implementation periods exceeding 30 minutes. Previous reviews
      have indicated that a comprehensive intervention might more effectively promote smoking
      cessation, compared to brief advice.8-10 However, the provision of a comprehensive smoking
      cessation intervention is not feasible in the busy clinical settings of Hong Kong. Indeed,
      healthcare professionals most commonly cite a lack of time as the reason for their inability
      to help patients with smoking cessation; specifically, these professionals are very busy and
      cannot spare even a few extra minutes.11 Other barriers to assistance include a lack of
      training and experience, lack of confidence in the effectiveness of the interventions and
      deficiencies in or a lack of incentives, support or requirements from hospital management
      regarding the implementation of these programmes. Moreover, our previous smoking cessation
      projects in an outpatient clinical setting revealed that many patients were too impatient to
      participate in a long intervention, while others expressed a reluctance to participate
      because of concerns that they might miss or experience delays in their medical consultations
      or other medical procedures.11-13 Nevertheless, although a brief intervention is more
      feasible in a clinical setting, it may be too brief and inadequate to have a significant
      effect on smokers.12,13 Moreover, the effectiveness of some brief interventions for smokers
      which focus mainly on providing self-help materials is undermined by a failure to offer or
      arrange any follow-up.9 Evidence indicates that smoking cessation services, including
      telephone quitlines, are an effective means of supporting smoking cessation efforts.14
      However, these services are generally poorly utilised, with a usage rate of 23.2% among
      smokers in Hong Kong.2 Therefore, the combination of brief cessation advice plus referrals
      for smokers to utilise existing smoking cessation services in Hong Kong may comprise an
      alternative strategy that could enhance the effects of intervention, particularly for
      patients requiring additional counselling.

      Interventions will include:

        1. Use of brief smoking cessation interventions by healthcare professionals

        2. Self-determination intervention for smoking cessation (i.e., immediate or progressive
           cessation with the ultimate goal of completion over an acceptable period)

        3. Active referral

      Service targets

      Phase I: To promote our project to the emergency departments of hospitals under the Hospital
      Authority.

      Phrase II: To recruit healthcare professionals from participating emergency departments to
      attend a half-day training workshop.

      Phrase III: To provide brief smoking cessation advices by healthcare professionals to smokers
      who attend emergency departments and actively refer them to existing smoking cessation
      services

    <description>The trained healthcare professionals will be encouraged to deliver brief smoking cessation advice based on the AWARD model to smokers who attend emergency departments and are triaged as semi-urgent or non-urgent. The trained healthcare professionals will ask the smokers their smoking history, then deliver the warning message to the smokers. If the smokers refuse to quit immediately, the trained healthcare professionals will advise them to reduce the number of cigarettes smoked per day, with the goal of complete cessation within 6 months. The healthcare professionals will then actively refer smokers to the chosen service provider within 1 week of recruitment. Smokers will receive proactive telephone calls from the service providers, receive a leaflet about the health-related hazards of smoking and benefits of quitting, and a pocket-sized information card containing brief information about the existing smoking cessation services in Hong Kong.</description>
