  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elbasvir/grazoprevir (ZepatierÂ®) is a once-daily tablet for the treatment of chronic
      hepatitis C virus (HCV) GT1a, 1b or 4 infection containing the NS5A inhibitor elbasvir (ELB)
      50 mg and the NS3/4A protease inhibitor grazoprevir (GZR) 100 mg.

      For patients with swallowing difficulties, administration of whole tablets can be
      problematic. In addition, HCV patients that are hospitalized (at intensive care units) due to
      severe illness (co-infections/ liver failure) might not be able to swallow medication.
      Therefore it is useful to know whether it is possible to administer ELB/GZR through a
      different route, like a feeding tube.

      In daily practice, information about the safety and efficacy of crushed tablets is lacking
      which might result in noncompliance, interruption or discontinuation of expensive HCV
      therapy. However, it is not recommended to interrupt treatment because there is no evidence
      about the efficacy of the therapy after discontinuation (and restarting).

      Currently, patients and healthcare professionals are crushing tablets without information
      about efficacy and safety. Depending on the biopharmaceutical characteristics of a drug
      formulation, crushing tablets can lead to altered pharmacokinetics of drugs.

      It is important to know whether pharmacokinetic parameters are influenced by crushing of
      tablets; both a decrease and an increase in exposure may occur. A decrease of the plasma
      concentrations of ELB and/or GZR potentially reduces the therapeutic effect of the drugs.
      Higher doses or switching to other HCV-drugs might be needed. In contrast, in case a higher
      Cmax and/or AUC occurs there might be an increased risk of toxicity.

      As a result, crushing the drug is a contra-indication based on the available data. Therefore
      this study will be conducted to investigate whether a crushed ELB/GZR tablet is bioequivalent
      to ELB/GZR as a whole tablet.
