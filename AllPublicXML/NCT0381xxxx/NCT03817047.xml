    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effect of 120 minutes extra of physical education (PE) or physical
      activity (PA) on adolescents' physical health, mental health, academic performance and
      learning environment. This is a cluster-randomized controlled trial with three arms, where
      the participants in two of the groups will have different models of increased PE/PA during
      the school week, whereas the participants in the third arm is the control group including
      current practice.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a school-based, three-arm cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) recruiting
      adolescents from secondary schools in Norway. Adolescents (aged 14-15 years) were the unit of
      analysis, and schools (clusters) were randomly assigned to one of three conditions:

        1. the physical active learning group (PAL-group), where the schools each week include one
           additional physical education (PE) lesson, 30 minutes of physical active learning, and
           30 minutes of physical activity (intervention condition);

        2. the don't worry - be happy group (DWBH-group), where the schools include one new
           activity class (60 minutes: Be Happy class) and one additional PE-class (60 minutes:
           Don't Worry class) per week (intervention condition);or

        3. current practice (control condition). An identical set of outcome measures are taken
           from all participants at baseline, and approximately 12 months after the baseline
           measures, when the participants were at the end of year 9

    <description>Assessed with the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). This is a short screening instrument consisting of 25 items equally divided across five scales measuring emotional symptoms, conduct problems, hyperactivity-inattention, peer problems, and prosocial behavior.
Each statement is answered as &quot;Not true&quot;, &quot;Somewhat true&quot; and &quot;Certainly true&quot;. Some questions have reversed form, which is reversed in the scoring of the instrument. Replies were scored from 0 to 2, and the subscales are summed to a score ranging from 0-10 for each subscale. Added together, the first four scores generate a total difficulties score, ranging from 0 to 40. Higher scores indicate more problems.</description>

    <measure>Adolescents' subjective health and well-being</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured baseline and after 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Adolescent's subjective health and well-being is assessed using the Kidscreen-27 questionnaire.

The questions are answered on a 5-point likert scale. Scores can be created for each of the five dimensions. The methodology given in the developers manual will be used to obtain the T-scores; mean (±SD) scores of 50 ± 10 define normality for children and adolescents aged 8-18 years across Europe. Higher scores indicate a better health-related quality of life.</description>
