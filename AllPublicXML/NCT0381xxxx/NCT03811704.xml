  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of a novel real-time
      navigation way for laparoscope liver resection, which was fused images comprising 3D imaging
      and indocyanine green Fluorescence imaging (fusion IGFI).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During liver resection, surgeons cannot completely view the intraparenchymal structure.
      Although a fluorescent imaging technique using indocyanine green has recently been developed
      for hepatobiliary surgery, limitations in its application for real-time navigation persist. A
      nove augmented reality surgery navigation system (ARSNS) can be combined with indocyanine
      green Fluorescence imaging to guide the surgery real-time.
