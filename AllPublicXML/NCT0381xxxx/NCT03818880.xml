      Diurnal variations in the thickness of the choroid have been reported in the literature, and,
      more recently, the role of the choroid has been studied with respect to its role in myopia
      (near-sightedness) progression.

      Diurnal variations in the thickness of the choroid have been reported in the literature ,
      and, more recently, the role of the choroid has been studied with respect to its role in
      myopia (near-sightedness) progression. SightGlass Vision, Inc is conducting a multi-site,
      randomized, controlled, interventional study to confirm the efficacy and safety of spectacle
      lenses designed to inhibit the progression of myopia by reducing image contrast in peripheral
      vision. CORE is participating as a clinical site in this three year study which aims to
      compare changes in ocular length and cycloplegic auto-refraction in children randomised to
      wear one of either two test or one control spectacle lens designs; the CPRO-1802-001
      (Cypress_SG) study. The sponsor is interested in conducting choroidal thickness measurements
      only at CORE's site by inviting those participants who have already been found eligible for
      the CPRO-1802-001 study to participate in this parallel study.
