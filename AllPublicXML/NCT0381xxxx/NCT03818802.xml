  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers are trying to determine if the vitamin B3 derivative Nicotinamide Riboside (NR)
      has any effects in bone, skeletal muscle, and metabolic functions and structure in aging.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary Objective: To assess the effect of &quot;NAD boosting&quot; through NR intake in skeletal
      muscle and bone metabolism function, and biochemical evidence of improvement of DNA damage
      repair in healthy elderly female patients with and without exercise.

      Secondary Objective: To assess the effect of NR in metabolic functions of glucose and lipid
      profile as well as to determine the safety of long term administration of NR in healthy
      elderly female patients with and without exercise.

    <intervention_model_description>The investigators will enroll 48 subjects (24 placebo vs. 24 NR) considering a dropout rate of 20%. Patients will be screened at outpatient clinic visit by the research team before the enrollment. For those subjects interested and qualified it will be offered participation in this trial. Once consent has been obtained baseline values will be established and subjects will begin treatment and followed for 4.5 months. After 4.5 months, a structured exercise regimen will be implemented in addition to the NR/placebo treatment and the patients will be followed for 6 weeks more, completing 6 months.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Double (Participant, Investigator)</masking>
    <masking_description>This protocol will employ a blinded design so that the participant, study personnel, and investigators will not know subject group assignment status. The unblinding would be done by contacting the research pharmacy. While the safety of the subject always comes first, it is still important to seriously consider if unmasking/unblinding the study therapy is necessary to ensure a subject's safety. The unmasking/unblinding will happen only when there is a serious adverse event; in this case this event will be logged in the specific Case Report Form for Serious Adverse Event (SAE) that is part of this protocol. However, in cases where unmasking/unblinding was not associated with an SAE, such actions will be reported in a same timeline requirements for reporting of SAEs.</masking_description>

    <description>The 6-minute walk test (6MWT) quantifies the distance a person can walk in six minutes and will be used to document the mobility/functional status of a patient. Originally developed to evaluate the physical capacity of patients with cardiopulmonary diseases, the test has been used to assess treatment effects, physical function status, and to predict morbidity and mortality in several patient populations including frail older adults.</description>

    <description>An 18-gauge cannula will be inserted in a retrograde fashion into a dorsal hand vein of the non-dominant arm. The hand will be placed in a heated box (55Â°C) to enable sampling of arterialized venous blood. Blood will be drawn at 0 (baseline), 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes for the measurement of glucose, insulin, and C-peptide concentrations. After the baseline blood draw, subjects will ingest 75 g of glucose over a period of 5 minutes.</description>
