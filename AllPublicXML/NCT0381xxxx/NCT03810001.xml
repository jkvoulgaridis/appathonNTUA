  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most fertilization failures after ICSI are caused by failure of oocyte activation defects.
      But, to date, there is no effective method to overcome this obstacle. To investigate the
      effect of mechanical stimulation on fertilization failures, investigators plan to recruit
      women undergoing ICSI treatment cycles. The retrieved sibling oocytes from the patients were
      randomly divided into two groups. The control group conducted the standard ICSI procedure,
      while the experimental group conducted the modified ICSI procedure.Consequently, the
      fertilization rate, 2PN (two pronuclei) rate, 1PN rate, oocyte degradation rate,and
      exploitable embryos on D3 were recorded to evaluate ICSI cycle outcomes.

      Normal fertilization is the critical for the success of ICSI. To investigate the effect of
      mechanical stimulation on fertilization, investigators plan to recruit women undergoing ICSI
      treatment cycles. Exclusion criteria: Patients older than 40 years, the maturation oocytes
      less than 6. The retrieved sibling oocytes from the patient were randomly divided into two
      groups. The control group conducted the standard ICSI procedure, while the experimental group
      conducted the modified ICSI procedure. The modified ICSI procedure involved a
      micromanipulation mechanical stimulation between insertion of the microinjection needle into
      the oocyte and expulsion of the spermatozoon from the needle to the ooplasm, without
      additional reagents treatment. Consequently, the fertilization rate, 2PN rate, 1PN rate,
      oocyte degradation rate, and exploitable embryos on D3 were recorded. The investigators aim
      to evaluate whether the mechanical stimulation can be used to improve the normal
      fertilization and embryo quality in ICSI cycles.
