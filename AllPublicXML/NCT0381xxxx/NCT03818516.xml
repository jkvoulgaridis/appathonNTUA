  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective, placebo controlled, randomized study to evaluate the impact of an
      anti-inflammatory challenge (Infliximab Treatment) on reward circuitry, motivational
      deficits, and negative symptoms in a subset of Schizophrenia patients with high inflammation
      (C-reactive protein (CRP)&gt;3 mg/L).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is a severe mental illness that affects 1% of the population, but accounts for
      over $60 billion in costs to the national healthcare system. Negative symptoms of
      schizophrenia, including motivational deficits, are some of the most debilitating aspects of
      the disorder, being both difficult to treat and representing one of the most significant
      barriers to functional recovery.One pathophysiologic pathway that may contribute to these
      alterations in reward circuitry in schizophrenia is inflammation.

      Previous work has demonstrated that inflammatory stimuli decrease neural activity in the
      ventral striatum and decrease connectivity in reward-relevant neural circuitry. Previous
      findings show that some patients with schizophrenia reliably exhibit elevated concentrations
      of inflammatory markers and that inflammatory cytokines may be related to negative symptoms
      including decreased motivation. Based on these findings the study wants to determine the
      impact of inflammation on reward circuitry in patients with schizophrenia using both
      task-based and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging and also the impact of
      inflammation on objective and clinical measures of motivation and negative symptoms. The
      study also wants to evaluate the effect of an anti-inflammatory challenge on reward
      circuitry, motivational deficits, and negative symptoms in a subset of patients with high
      inflammation. This study aims to inform future studies of novel therapeutic strategies to
      treat negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia.

Then a composite variable across all of the 3 types of abuse are created. Using this composite, participants will be divided into 2 groups with respect to the numbers of types of abuse that fall into the moderate to severe range: (1) those with no type of abuse in the moderate to severe range, and (2) those with at least 1 type of abuse in the moderate to severe range.</description>

    <measure>Mean change in reward motivation assessed by the Effort-Expenditure for Rewards Task (EEfRT) Score among the participants in Treatment Arm compared to participants in Placebo Arm</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, post-infusion visit (Up to 10 days Post Infusion)</time_frame>
    <description>EEfRT- is a multi-trial game in which participants are given an opportunity on each trial to choose between two different task difficulty levels in order to obtain monetary rewards.For all trials, participants make repeated manual button presses within a short period of time. Each button press raises the level of a virtual ''bar'' viewed onscreen by the participant. Participants are eligible to win the money allotted for each trial if they raise the bar to the ''top'' within the prescribed time period. Each trial presents subjects with a choice between 'high effort' and 'low effort' task that require different amounts of speeded button pressing. Reward magnitudes for the high effort task vary between amounts, while reward magnitudes for the low effort task remain constant. Trials also vary in terms of 3 levels of probability of winning the amount associated with the choice selected. The first 50 trials are used for analysis.</description>

    <measure>Mean change in neural response to anticipating and receiving monetary rewards assessed by Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) Task among the participants in Treatment Arm compared to participants in Placebo Arm</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, post-infusion visit (Up to 10 days Post Infusion)</time_frame>
    <description>Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) Task: Assessment of reward anticipation will be achieved using the MID task.Briefly, during this task participants have the opportunity to win or lose money by making a rapid button press in response to a target visual stimulus. The primary epoch of interest is the &quot;anticipatory delay&quot; - a period of ~2000ms that occurs after participants have been informed how much money they can win or lose on a given trial, but prior to the presentation of the target. This epoch has repeatedly been associated with robust ventral striatal activity. Participants will complete 2 functional runs of between 50 and 200 trials each (the number of trials will be decided at the discretion of the PI), with evenly distributed reward magnitudes.</description>

    <measure>Mean change in neural response to reward motivation assessed by fMRI-adapted version of the EEfRT among the participants in Treatment Arm compared to participants in Placebo Arm</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, post-infusion visit (Up to 10 days Post Infusion)</time_frame>
    <description>fMRI-adapted version of the EEfRT task: Assessment of effort based decision making will be made using the EEfRT task.During each trial, subjects are presented with a choice between two levels of task difficulty, a High Effort option and a Low Effort option. Unlike in the behavioral version of the task, subjects will not be required to make button presses during the scan. The reward magnitude for a No Effort option remains constant, while the reward magnitude for the High Effort option varies. Additionally, the amount of effort required for the High Effort option will vary between 20%, 50%, 80% and 100% of the subject's maximum effort (set for each individual prior to scan).</description>
