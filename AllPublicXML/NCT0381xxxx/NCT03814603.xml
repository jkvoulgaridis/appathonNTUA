  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      African-Americans (AAs) have an increased prevalence of both Alzheimer's disease (AD) and
      vascular risk factors for AD such as diabetes and hypertension when compared to whites.
      However, in a recent community based study of non-demented elderly, black race was associated
      with higher amyloid burden after adjusting for vascular risk factors, suggesting the presence
      of additional physiological differences on AD-risk by race in the early stages of the
      disease. The purpose of this study is to test whether poor slow wave sleep (SWS) quantity
      (SWS duration) and quality (slow wave activity, SWA) is one of these physiological factors.
      To test these hypotheses, the investigators will perform community outreach in churches and
      community-based organizations in Brooklyn and other NYC boroughs with which we have created
      substantial ties in recent years. In consultation with community stakeholders, the
      investigators will recruit 150 cognitively normal AA elderly (age 60-75) and 60 age, sex,
      BMI, income and education matched non-Hispanic whites from the same geographical areas.
      Investigators will first perform a medical and cognitive evaluation (Visit 1). Participants
      will then undergo 2 nights of home sleep monitoring using an unattended device to exclude
      OSA, followed by 7 days of actigraphy with a sleep log to record sleep duration. Both devices
      will be returned by mail. Subjects with reported total sleep time (TST) between 5 and 10
      hours and absence of moderate to severe OSA will be invited to perform a 2-night nocturnal
      polysomnography (NPSG) (Nights 1-2) and a PiB-PET MR scan (Visit 2).

    <ipd_description>Subjects will have the option to allow their leftover blood and DNA samples to be banked indefinitely for future research related to studies on early diagnosis of Alzheimer's, disease and/or mechanism of neurodegeneration. After the study is completed, the de-identified, archived data will be transmitted to and stored at the CBH Biorepository, under the supervision of Dr. Osorio, for use by other researchers including those outside of the study. Permission to transmit data to the CBH Biorepository will be included in the ICF. During the conduct of the study, an individual participant can choose to withdraw consent to have biological specimens stored for future research. However, withdrawal of consent with regard to biosample storage will not be possible after the study is completed. When the study is completed, access to study data and/or samples will be provided through the CBH Biorepository.</ipd_description>
