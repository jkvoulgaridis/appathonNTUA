    <textblock>
      Multicenter observational study to determine the long-term tolerability and analgesic
      effectiveness of oral tapentadol in patients suffering from severe pain syndromes, refractory
      to other strong opioids.
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tapentadol, a centrally acting analgesic. It is indicated in Europe &quot;for the relief of
      moderate to severe acute pain in adults, which can be adequately managed only with opioid
      analgesics&quot; (IR formulation/oral solution) and &quot;for the management of severe chronic pain in
      adults, which can be adequately managed only with opioid analgesics&quot; (SR formulation).
      Tapentadol is reimbursed in Belgium since May 1, 2018. The reimbursement was obtained through
      an article 81 procedure (Chapter IV) which means that the reimbursement is currently
      restricted to the time frame of the contract and that during that period certain questions
      and uncertainties regarding the use of tapentadol in a Belgian setting need to be answered.
      In order to answer the questions raised by the Belgian Healthcare authorities, this study
      will be performed evaluating the application of oral tapentadol in routine clinical practice
      in Belgium. The study is conceived as a nation-wide multicentre prospective
      non-interventional trial. The primary endpoint and secondary endpoints of this study are
      guided by the questions that need to be answered during the course of the contract
      reimbursement, as established by the Belgian health authorities.
