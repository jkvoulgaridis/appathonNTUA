  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anlotinib is a multi-target receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor. It can inhibit the
      angiogenesis related kinase, such as Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor (VEGFR),
      Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor(FGFR), Platelet-Derived Growth Factor Receptor(PDGFR), and
      tumor cell proliferation related kinase c-Kit kinase. Anlotinib is an efficient second line
      therapeutic agent in treatment for metastatic soft tissue sarcoma which has been approved in
      clinical trials (ALTER-0203).Therefore , this study evaluates the safety and efficacy of
      anlotinib plus epirubicin and ifosfamide treat the metastatic or advanced soft tissue sarcoma
      .

      This study is planned to be carried out in Liaoning, Jilin and Harbin provinces regional
      multi-center. 47 cases are preliminarily expected to be included. The study started in
      January 2019 and ended in December 2019. It is expected that the trial will end in December
      2020. This study is a phase 2 study evaluating the safety and efficacy anlotinib and plus
      epirubicin and ifosfamide treat the metastatic or advanced soft tissue sarcoma .

      All those participants need to sign informed consent forms for data collection and use for
      research purpose before inclusion .Those participants who were not treated with
      anthracyclines or other tyrosinase inhibitors or angiostatins within the first 6 months
      should be enrolled.

      47 subjects with metastatic or advanced soft tissue sarcoma will receive epirubicin at
      30mg/m2/day（day1-2 IV）, ifosfamide at 1.8g/m2/day (day1-5 IV) anlotinib at a dose of 12 mg
      once daily (day8-21 PO). After 6 treatment cycles,those participants will receive anlotinib
      at a dose of 12 mg once daily (day8-21 PO) in 21-day cycles until disease progression
      (defined by RECIST version 1.1) ot unacceptable toxicity.
