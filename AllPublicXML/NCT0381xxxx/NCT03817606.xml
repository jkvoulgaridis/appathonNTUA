  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare outcomes of patients with degenerative disc disease
      undergo lumbar spinal fusion with Stryker's TritaniumÂ® Posterior Lumbar Cage or the UniLIF
      PEEK implant.

      This study protocol intends to examine the difference in efficacy between the Tritanium
      Posterior Lumbar Cage and the UniLIF PEEK implant with respect to how long it takes to
      achieve fusion of the spine. Study participants will undergo a transforaminal lumbar
      interbody fusion (TLIF) surgery and return for CT and x-ray follow-up to measure the degree
      to which fusion has been achieved. Survey methodology to assess perceived pain, level of
      disability, and quality of life will also be used to measure the differences between groups
      on these components.

    <time_frame>Baseline; 6 weeks; 3 months; 6 months; and 12 months post operation</time_frame>
    <description>Change in Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) score. The ODI assesses disability related to lower back pain using a Likert 0 to 5 scale. There are 10 sections to the assessment, and the scores are represented as a percentage ranging from 0 (no disability) to 100 (completely disabled).</description>

    <description>Change in perception of quality of life, as measured by Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36 PCS). The SF-36 PCS is a 36-item patient reported health questionnaire to measure perceived quality of life across 8 domains. Higher scores indicate higher quality of life, and lower scores indicate lower quality of life. Scores range from 5 (poor physical function) to 80 (excellent clinical function).</description>

    <measure>Change in Quality of Life: EQ-5d</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; 6 weeks; 3 months; 6 months; and 12 months post operation</time_frame>
    <description>Change in perception of quality of life, as measured by the EuroQol-5d (EQ-5d). The EuroQol-5d is a five question broad quality of life measure that can be combined into a single index and represents current health. A score of 0.0 is the worst imaginable health while a score of 1.0 would be the best imaginable health.</description>
