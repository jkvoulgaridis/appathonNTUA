  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with stroke have demonstrated abnormal muscle tone and postural control ability
      which affect their ambulation, activity of daily living and confident. Nowadays, utilizing
      repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and robotic machines to assist walking
      training for stroke patients has been applied to clinic widely. While less studies have
      compared intervention efficacy for stroke patients between rTMS and robotic training. This
      study aimed to compare effect of rTMS and robotic training for lower-extremity function and
      gait in stroke patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will include subjects occurring stroke within 3 months. All groups will receive
      traditional rehabilitation. The subjects will be allocated randomly in three groups which are
      traditional rehabilitation (Group A), robotic training (Group B), and rTMS (Group C)
      respectively, with 35 people per group. The group B will be intervened 5 times per week and
      the group C will receive 10 times rTMS intervention during 4 weeks. At post-intervention and
      eighth weeks after intervention, basic examination will be executed including basic
      information, history, Mini-mental State examination, Short -Form 36, Modified Ashworth Scale,
      Fugl-Meyer assessment, static and dynamic motion examination, ultrasound assessment and
      examination of cardiorespiratory. Two-way mixed ANOVA will be used to analyze the differences
      of three groups and times.
