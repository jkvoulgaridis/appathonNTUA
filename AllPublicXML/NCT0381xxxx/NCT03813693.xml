  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the use of towels impregnated with 2% chlorhexidine gluconate in the traditional
      preoperative bath with 2% chlorhexidine gluconate in preventing the occurrence of surgical
      site infection among patients undergoing potentially contaminated elective surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot randomized controlled clinical trial, composed of patients submitted to
      potentially contaminated elective surgeries, randomly assigned to an intervention group,
      consisting of those who used towels impregnated with pre-operative CHG 2% and control group,
      composed of by the pre-operative bath with 2% conventional / liquid CHG. Both used the
      products the night before and the morning of surgery and received verbal and written
      guidance.

    <intervention_model_description>The intervention group (GI) received two packs, each containing six towels impregnated with 2% chlorhexidine gluconate and an instruction manual on how to use them.
Two bottles of chlorhexidine gluconate 2% liquid (100 ml) were given to the control group (CG), the patients were instructed to perform the bath using one vial the night before surgery and the other on the morning of surgery.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>In order to investigate the potential cases of SSI, the researcher personally followed the patients in the preoperative period, in the POI and at the time of hospital discharge, using a data collection instrument. In order to evaluate the occurrence of SSI after hospital discharge, the researcher used the following strategies: a review of the chart associated with patient follow-up during outpatient return when possible, which would occur on average on the 35th postoperative day; telephone contact from the 30th day until the 40th postoperative day (PO), using a post-discharge surveillance instrument. Continuous and discrete quantitative variables were evaluated using the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test.
Qualitative (categorical) variables were evaluated using the Pearson XÂ² test. The Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test was used for qualitative (categorical) variables, whose distribution was different from normal.</description>

2) Time of application: use six TICHGs the night before surgery and the six remaining on the morning of surgery.
3) After the hygiene of each member, discard the TICHG. After use of TICHG, allow the product to dry on the skin. Do not use bath towels to dry yourself and wear clean clothes.</description>
