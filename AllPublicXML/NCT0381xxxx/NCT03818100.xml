  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Four in 10 women diagnosed with breast cancer undergo mastectomy with or without breast
      reconstruction and less than half are satisfied with how they look unclothed. Breast
      conservation (removing the area with the lump only) can offer less extensive surgery and
      improved breast appearance, which can therefore increase well-being.

      Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) closely shapes the radiation beam to the cancer and
      is currently given after breast surgery. A new combination of IMRT followed by hormone
      treatment given before surgery, may increase the possibility of breast conservation.

    <description>Successful completion of IMRT is defined as:
Treatment received was either 48 Gy/15# or 40 Gy/15# with sequential boost
Treatment received was 'other', but the reason for different schedule was not due to toxicity related from the radiotherapy
Radiotherapy treatment was not delayed by 5 days or more
Radiotherapy treatment was delayed by 5 days or more, but the reason was not due to toxicity related from the radiotherapy
Successful completion of endocrine treatment is defined as:
Patient received at least 80% of endocrine treatment received
Patient did not receive 80% of endocrine treatment, but the reason was not due to toxicity or toxicity related from radiotherapy or endocrine
Successful surgery is defined as:
Planned date of surgery is not delayed
Planned date of surgery is delayed, but the reason was not due to toxicity or toxicity related to radiotherapy or endocrine treatment.</description>

    <measure>Volume of residual tumour and response to treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>There will be a central review (2 readers) of all primary surgery histopathology reports for the secondary endpoint of pathological complete response (pCR). The histopathology slides from the surgical resection will be requested for central assessment of residual disease for all cases where there has not been a pCR. The variables that will be recorded include residual invasive tumour size in two dimensions, residual invasive tumour cellularity, number of lymph node metastases and size of the largest metastasis. A representative tumour tissue block will be selected and requested from the laboratory. Sections from the block will be taken for staining with ER and Ki67 to allow calculation of the histological assessment of residual tumour burden, and cores taken as per the protocol.</description>

    <measure>Exploratory research will be carried out to identify possible molecular and radiological biomarkers of response</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months post last patient recruited</time_frame>
    <description>Exploratory investigation of potential biomarkers include:
ctDNA,
PBMCs,
Tumour molecular profiles,
Immunohistochemical/immunofluorescence markers of:
Immune response (TILs) Tumour proliferation (Ki67, Geminin) DNA damage response and cell cycle checkpoint activation (including 53BP1, RAD51, ATM1, BRCA1, p53, p21 and p-chk-1) Tumour microenvironment (hypoxia)
- Multiplexed single cell proteomics of both cellular suspensions (including whole blood) and intact tissues, to investigate the immune response and other novel markers
Since the identification of new biomarkers correlating with disease activity and the efficacy or safety of treatment is rapidly evolving, the definitive list of biomarkers remains to be determined. However they will be detailed in an appropriate analysis plan prior to undertaking any sample analysis.</description>
