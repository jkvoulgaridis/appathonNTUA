      This study evaluates the diagnostic accuracy of USPIO enhanced MRI for the detection of lymph
      node metastases in head‐and‐neck squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) using histopathology as a gold
      standard.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The presence of lymph node metastases has a large impact on prognosis and treatment in
      head‐and neck cancer patients and necessitates treatment intensification. Determining lymph
      node status, however, is a challenge because up to 20% of patients with a pre‐operative
      clinically negative neck will have occult metastases in the neck dissection specimen. One
      promising technique is USPIO-enhanced MRI, an MR‐imaging technique in which ultrasmall
      superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) particles are intravenously infused as a contrast agent
      in patients 24‐36 hours before the MRI examination and has proven to be of value in detecting
      lymph node metastases in various types of cancer. The investigators want to validate this
      technique in a cohort of head and neck cancer patients who undergo neck dissection surgery.
      Histopathology wills serve as the gold standard and the correlation will be made on a
      (neck)level-to-level and node-to-node basis. Since the investigators have no experience in
      reading USPIO-enhanced MR images of the neck with 3-dimensional iron-sensitive MR sequences,
      this study starts with an explorative part and will be followed by the pilot study. The
      explorative component aims at obtaining knowledge regarding visual features of
      (non-)metastatic cervical lymph nodes on USPIO-enhanced MR images. The purpose is that the
      observers work through a learning curve. The information obtained will be used to develop a
      scoring system for the radiologic assessment of cervical lymph nodes in the subsequent part
      of our study.

      If USPIO-enhanced MRI is successful, this may obviate the need for a sentinel node procedure
      for example. Furthermore, it could guide treatment such as the performance of more selective
      neck dissections and de-escalation of the radiation dose to healthy tissues in order to
      decrease morbidity but maintaining high cure rates.
