    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label, multi-center, phase III trial to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of SHR-1210 plus capecitabine and oxaliplatin sequenced by apatinib with or without
      SHR-1210 versus capecitabine and oxaliplatin as first-line therapy in patients with locally
      advanced or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma.
