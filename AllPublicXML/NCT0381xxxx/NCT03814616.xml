  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label, three-arm, out-patient study in asymptomatic individuals
      with P. falciparum monoinfection confirmed at baseline, who are &gt;5 years of age and &gt;20kg
      body weight. A total of 300 participants will be randomised into the study; 100 participants
      in each of three treatment arms.

      Patients who fulfil the entry criteria (all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria)
      will be recruited and randomized to receive Pyramax orally for three days, two days or one
      day in a randomization ratio of 1:1:1.

      All participants will be followed until Day 63 (counted from day 0) and blood samples will be
      taken on Days 0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42 and 63 for malaria diagnostics, parasite
      density and qPCR. In addition, blood samples reverse-transcriptase (RT)-PCR will be taken on
      Days 0, 1, 2, 3, 7 and 14.

      Participants will be administered local SOC treatment if they meet any of the
      protocol-specific criteria of treatment failure: Early treatment failure, Late clinical
      failure, or Late parasitological failure up to and including Day 63, or if the participant
      withdraws at any time before Day 63, and is parasite positive.

             product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and,
             in the judgment of the investigator, would make the participant inappropriate for
             entry into this study. Examples would include but not limited to:

               1. Immunological disorders (including known seropositive HIV antibody),

                  generalised anxiety, psychosis, schizophrenia or other major psychiatric
                  disorders) and major medical disorders related to cardiovascular, respiratory
                  (including active tuberculosis), renal, gastrointestinal, endocrine, infectious,
                  malignancy, neurological (including auditory) and history of convulsions or other
                  abnormality (including recent head trauma),

               3. Clinical signs or symptoms of hepatic injury (such as nausea, abdominal pain
                  associated with jaundice) or known severe liver disease (i.e. decompensated
                  cirrhosis, Child-Pugh stage 3 or 4)
