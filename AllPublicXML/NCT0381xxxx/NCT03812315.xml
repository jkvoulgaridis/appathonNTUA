  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Propolis is a natural product collected by bees to seal holes and repair structures in their
      hives. Recently it has attracted much attention as useful substance applied in medicine and
      cosmetics thanks to its antimicrobial properties. Contemporary dentistry is an inseparable
      part of medicine and therefore attempts were made to use propolis in dentistry, as well.

      Purpose of the study: to investigate the effect of propolis administered in chewing gum as
      compared to that incorporated in mouthwash on plaque accumulation, microbial population and
      patient acceptance.

      The study is a two parallel arms randomized controlled clinical trial where 60 high caries
      risk children of 6-8 years will be selected from outpatient clinic of Pediatric Dentistry and
      Dental Public Health Department, Faculty of Dentistry, Alexandria University, after securing
      the necessary consents. The children will be divided randomly into two equal groups (30
      children each).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Plaque Accumulation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>All children will be examined clinically using the Plaque Control record (O' Leary, Darke and Naylor).
The child will be asked to chew a disclosing tablet and let it mix with saliva for 30 seconds and spit it out.
Each tooth is divided into 4 surfaces; the plaque accumulations on all surfaces will be scored.
The number of positively scored units is divided by the total number of tooth surfaces evaluated, and the result is multiplied by 100 to express the index as a percentage.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Microbiological Sampling of Dental Plaque</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>On the day of sampling, each child will refrain from tooth brushing in the morning, eating or drinking (except water) at least two hours before sampling time. The plaque will be collected using sterilized toothpicks. Two plaque samples will be collected from each child. Anteriorly, this will be gathered from the buccal and palatal surface of the upper incisors and canines. While posteriorly, the plaque sample will be collected from the upper and lower molars. Finally, each plaque sample will be inoculated in separate vials; each vial contains 1 ml sterile brain heart infusion broth and will be sent to the lab. After 14 days, another plaque sample will be collected as previously mentioned.</description>

    <measure>Assessment of Patient's Acceptance</measure>
    <time_frame>After 2 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Using Visual Analogue Scale (VAS).Each patient will receive the scale form and instructed to place a vertical mark according his or her personal rating of the preparation received during the treatment period on a horizontal line scaled from 0 to 10 where 0 presented for unacceptable and 10 for acceptable.</description>
