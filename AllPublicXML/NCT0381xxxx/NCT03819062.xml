  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to study if low level laser therapy will do more good than
      harm for patients with severe chronic refractory constipation. It is a proof of concept study
      without a placebo arm.

      Patients will be offered the therapy if High-Resolution Colonic Manometry has shown that
      coordination between colon motility and recto-anal activity is abnormal and that autonomic
      nervous system assessment suggests a dysfunction of communication between the spinal cord
      autonomic nerves and the colon-rectum-anus. The therapy consists of a 3 week treatment with a
      total of 8 sessions of low level laser therapy. Effects will be assessed using symptom and
      quality of life questionnaires and physiological assessments of colon and pelvic floor
      function, at 4 weeks and 12 weeks.

    <measure>Change in symptoms using the questionnaire PAC-SYM</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PAC-SYM questionnaire is a 12-item questionnaire that evaluates the severity of symptoms of constipation in 3 domains (stool, rectal, and abdominal symptoms) on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (absent) to 4 (very severe). Each domain score is the mean of the non-missing items for that domain. The total score is the mean of all non-missing items (ie, symptoms). The range of the domain or total score is 0 (response is 'absent' for each item) to 4 (response is 'very severe' for each item). A negative change from baseline indicates improvement, a positive change indicates worsening of symptoms. The minimum important difference indicating clinically significant improvement is minus 0.6 (Saito &amp; Camilleri, 2018)</description>

    <measure>Change in quality of life assessed by questionnaire PAC-QOL</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PAC-QOL scale is a 28-item self-report instrument designed to evaluate the burden of constipation on patients' everyday functioning and well-being. Each item is rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely). The instrument can be used to generate an overall score, but is also reported to assess 4 specific constipation-related domains including: 1) Worries and concerns (11 items), 2) Physical discomfort (4 items), 3) Psychosocial discomfort (8 items), and 4) Satisfaction (5 items). Each domain score is the mean of the non-missing items for that domain. The total score is the mean of all non-missing items. The range of the domain or total score is 0 (response is 'not at all' for each item) to 4 (response is 'extremely' for each item). A negative change from baseline indicates improvement, a positive change indicates worsening of symptoms. The minimum difference indicating clinically significant improvement is -0.5 (Marquis et al., 2005)</description>
