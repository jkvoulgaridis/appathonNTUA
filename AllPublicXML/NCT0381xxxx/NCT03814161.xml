  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our study aims to compare 4 clinical frailty scores, namely Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS),
      Edmonton Frail Scale (EFS), FRAIL 5-item scale (FRAIL) and SARC-F Sarcopenia Score (SARC-F),
      which can potentially be adopted for daily practice in the busy ED. It is timely as we
      projected that we will be seeing more elderly patients attending the ED for various medical
      and surgical conditions. Their attendance at the ED would be a good opportunity to screen for
      frailty among them, and to intervene to prevent adverse outcomes such as ED re-attendance or
      subsequent hospitalisation that might lead to poor functional outcomes and higher dependence
      on step-down care facilities.
