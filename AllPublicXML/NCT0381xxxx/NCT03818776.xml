  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to treat participants with the combination of durvalumab (the
      study drug) and proton beam therapy. Proton beam therapy is a type of radiotherapy (RT) with
      a unique characteristic where the proton stops at a specific depth according to its energy.
      This may be advantageous in treating lung cancer because it allows for a sufficient tumor
      dose that may improve local control and survival while sparing normal organs at risk, such as
      the heart, lung, and spinal cord.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All study participants will receive the same study intervention, which will consist of proton
      based external beam radiation therapy with concurrent Durvalumab starting one week before RT.
      Radiation will be delivered using cardiac sparing accelerated fractionated proton radiation.
      Radiation will have two dose escalation schemes followed by an expansion cohort for a total
      of approximately 24 participants enrolled at University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center.

      The objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety and feasibility of combination of
      durvalumab with two different schemes for accelerated fractionation proton radiation in
      participants who are unable to tolerate concurrent chemoradiation therapy. This will also
      include the evaluation of adverse events resulting from these treatment schemes.
