  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this retrospective observational study will be to investigate the between
      the Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) and Sleep Bruxism (SB), in individuals diagnosed
      through polysomnography (PSG).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The SB and OSAS are sleep disorders with great importance for dentistry. The OSAS is
      characterized by partial or total obstruction of the upper airways. SB is defined as a
      repetitive activity of the mandibular musculature characterized by the tightening or grinding
      of the teeth and/or by the retrusion or propulsion of the mandible. This study retrospective
      observational will be evaluation to investigate the association between OSAS and SB. Data
      from PSG and medical records (n=640) will be collected from January 2012 to July 2018 at
      &quot;Instituto do Sono de Pelotas (ISP)&quot;.
