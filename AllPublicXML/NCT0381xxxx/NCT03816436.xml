    <measure>Subjective shoulder value (SSV)</measure>
    <time_frame>one assessment at least 24 months after clavicular surgery by plate and iliac crest bone grafting</time_frame>

    <measure>Simple shoulder test (SST)</measure>
    <time_frame>one assessment at least 24 months after clavicular surgery by plate and iliac crest bone grafting</time_frame>
    <description>12 items questionnaire to assess restrictions in activities of daily living (ADL) related to impaired shoulder function; response in dichotomous manner (yes/no)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life (QoL)</measure>
    <time_frame>one assessment at least 24 months after clavicular surgery by plate and iliac crest bone grafting</time_frame>
    <description>assessed by Quality of Life EuroQoL 5D-5L Instrument (EQ-5D-5L); the descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. This decision results in a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state.</description>
