  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to confirm the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of zolbetuximab
      in combination with Nab-P + GEM, determine overall survival and assess the safety and
      tolerability of the combination treatment.

      This study will also evaluate other anti-tumor effects, tumor markers and pharmacokinetics
      (PK) of zolbetuximab, Nab-P and GEM.
