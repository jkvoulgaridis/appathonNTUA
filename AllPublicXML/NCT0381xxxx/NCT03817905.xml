  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to determine whether a patient navigator can help improve follow up care
      after a stool test shows the presence of blood or other abnormal markers.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants who recently had a stool test that had abnormal results will be asked to
      participate in this study in order to determine whether the use of a navigator can increase
      the use of colonoscopy, which is the recommended follow up to an abnormal stool test. A
      navigator is an individual trained to help patients access necessary health care services and
      understand the test results and next steps. Participants will be asked to meet the navigator
      at their colonoscopy appointment and discuss any problems that are experienced in getting the
      colonoscopy done. This will take about 10 minutes to complete. Participants will tell him or
      her in their own words how the experience was and whether they faced any barriers to
      scheduling and colonoscopy completion. Study personnel will also look at participants'
      electronic medical record to see what testing participants had done that prompted the need
      for colonoscopy.The study will include about 30 people.

    <description>Intervention will utilize staff at the Seidman Cancer Center who are trained in patient navigation and have experience in navigating patients for breast cancer screening as well as sickle cell disease. The staff will undergo training for this study by study principal investigators which will include the target participant population, necessary steps in the navigation process and data that will be collected. In addition, they will receive brief training in supportive, listening technique. They will also be furnished with a telephone script for the initial participant contact.</description>
