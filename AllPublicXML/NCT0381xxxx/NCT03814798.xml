    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, randomized, open-label, 2-period cross-over study (16
      weeks per treatment period) to evaluate flexible dosing and daily push dosing of IGSC 20% in
      treatment-experienced subjects with PI. An additional, separate cohort of treatment-naïve,
      non-randomized subjects who will not be part of the crossover are included and will receive a
      loading dose of 5 consecutive daily doses of IGSC 20% followed by weekly infusions of IGSC
      20% starting Week 1 (Day 8) through Week 32 (end of Treatment Phase).

      For treatment-experienced subjects, the study consists of a Screening Visit, Baseline Visit,
      16-week Treatment Period 1, 16-week Treatment Period 2, and Final Visit/Early Termination
      Visit. For treatment-naïve subjects, the study consists of a Screening Visit, a Baseline
      Visit, a 32-week Treatment Phase, and Final Visit/Early Termination Visit.

      Approximately 54 treatment-experienced subjects and approximately 6 treatment-naïve subjects
      will be enrolled at study centers in the United States (US) and European Union (EU).

      This is a prospective, multi-center, randomized, open-label, 2-period cross-over study (16
      weeks per treatment period) to evaluate flexible dosing and daily push dosing of IGSC 20% in
      treatment-experienced subjects with PI. There is an additional, separate cohort of
      treatment-naïve, non-randomized subjects with PI who will not be part of the crossover.

      Treatment-experienced subjects entering the study will maintain the same IgG dose (mg/kg)
      received prestudy that will be normalized to the study-assigned dose-time interval (ie, there
      will be 1:1 correspondence regardless of prestudy route of administration [intravenous [IV]
      or SC]). Treatment-experienced subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio into 1 of 3
      parallel cohorts consisting of 18 subjects each as follows:

      Cohort 1 (daily push compared with every 2 weeks [biweekly] pump) will evaluate syringe daily
      push dosing versus every 2 weeks [biweekly] ambulatory pump administration. Subjects will be
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 sequences, either beginning with syringe daily push
      dosing for 16 weeks and then crossing over to ambulatory pump administration every 2 weeks
      for 16 weeks or the reverse sequence.

      Cohort 2 (daily push compared with once weekly pump) will evaluate syringe daily push dosing
      versus once weekly ambulatory pump administration. Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio
      to 1 of 2 sequences, either beginning with syringe daily push dosing for 16 weeks and then
      crossing over to ambulatory pump administration once every week for 16 weeks or the reverse
      sequence.

      Cohort 3 (daily push compared with 2 times/week pump) will evaluate syringe daily push dosing
      versus 2 times/week ambulatory pump administration. Ambulatory pump dosing will take place on
      preselected days (eg, Monday and Thursday) not less than 3 days apart. The dosing days should
      remain constant for the duration of the study. Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to
      1 of 2 sequences, either beginning with syringe daily push dosing for 16 weeks and then
      crossing over to ambulatory pump administration 2 times/week for 16 weeks or the reverse
      sequence.

      The treatment-naïve cohort will receive a loading dose of 5 consecutive daily doses of IGSC
      20% 150 mg/kg/day (Week 0, Days 1-5) followed by weekly infusions of 150 mg/kg starting Week
      1 (Day 8) through Week 32 (end of Treatment Phase).

             and maintaining stable dosing for a period of at least 3 months prior to screening a
             second time.

          -  Has signed an informed consent. Note: The subject must sign the informed consent form
             (ICF) if at least 18 years old; for children of younger age, the subject's parent or
             legal guardian must sign the ICF and if appropriate/applicable, the subject must sign
             a Child Assent form approved by the IRB/EC per the institution's requirements

        For treatment-naïve subjects:

          -  Has documented and confirmed diagnosis of PI with features of hypogammaglobulinemia
             requiring IgG replacement therapy including but not limited to the following
             humoral-based immunodeficiency syndromes (eg, X-linked agammaglobulinemia, common
             variable immunodeficiency), and combined immunodeficiency syndromes without
             lymphocytopenia (eg, hyper immunoglobulin M immunodeficiency syndrome).

          -  Does not have an SBI nor requires hospitalization for infection of any etiology (eg,
             viral, fungal, parasitic) during screening or at baseline.

          -  Has signed an informed consent. Note: The subject must sign the informed consent form
             (ICF) if at least 18 years old; for children of younger age, the subject's parent or
             legal guardian must sign the ICF and if appropriate/applicable, the subject must sign
             a Child Assent form approved by the IRB/EC per the institution's requirements

        Exclusion Criteria:

        For all subjects:

          -  Has clinical evidence of any significant acute or chronic disease that, in the opinion
             of the investigator, may interfere with successful completion of the trial or place
             the subject at undue medical risk.

          -  Has had a known serious adverse reaction to immunoglobulin or any anaphylactic
             reaction to blood or any blood-derived product

          -  Has a history of blistering skin disease, clinically significant thrombocytopenia,
             bleeding disorder, diffuse rash, recurrent skin infections, or other disorders where
             SC therapy would be contraindicated during the study.

          -  Has known isolated IgG subclass deficiency; isolated specific antibody deficiency
             (SAD) or selective IgG deficiency; or transient hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy.
             Note: Subjects are not to be enrolled if their primary PI diagnosis does not entail an
             actual quantitative deficit in total IgG. For example, SAD is defined as an impaired
             specific IgG response to pneumococcal vaccine with normal serum concentrations of IgG,
             IgM, and IgA. Isolated IgG subclass deficiency is defined as an abnormally low level
             of 1 or more IgG subclass in subjects with normal levels of total IgG and IgM.

          -  Has known selective IgA deficiency (with or without antibodies to IgA) (Note:
             exclusion is for the specific diagnostic entity. It does not exclude other forms of
             humoral primary immunodeficiency which have decreased IgA in addition to decreased IgG
             requiring IgG replacement).

             injectable or implanted hormonal methods of contraception, placement of an
             intrauterine device or intrauterine system, condom or occlusive cap with spermicidal
             foam/gel/film/cream/suppository, male sterilization, or true abstinence) throughout
             the study. Note: True abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual
             lifestyle of the subject. (Periodic abstinence [eg, calendar, ovulation,
             symptothermal, post-ovulation methods], declaration of abstinence for the duration of
             a trial, and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.)

          -  Has significant proteinuria (≥3+ or known urinary protein loss &gt;1 g/24 hours or
             nephrotic syndrome), has acute renal failure, is on dialysis, and/or has severe renal
             impairment on Screening laboratory testing (blood urea nitrogen or creatinine more
             than 2.5 times the upper limit of normal [ULN]).

          -  Has screening values of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase
             (ALT) levels exceeding more than 2.5 times the ULN for the expected normal range for

             venous thrombosis.

          -  Is currently receiving anti-coagulation therapy which would make SC administration
             inadvisable (vitamin K antagonists, nonvitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants [eg,
             dabigatran etexilate targeting Factor IIa, rivaroxaban, edoxaban, and apixaban
             targeting Factor Xa], and parenteral anticoagulants [eg, fondaparinux]).

          -  Currently has a known hyperviscosity syndrome.
