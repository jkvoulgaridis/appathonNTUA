  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine clinically significant difference in results obtained from cataract surgery
      using IA. One eye will receive aphakic measurements only and the fellow eye will receive
      aphakic and then pseudophakic measurements when implanting a toric IOL.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To determine if there is a clinically significant difference in the results obtained for the
      toric IOL implantation when using IA to measure the aphakic eye only and when using IA to
      measure the aphakic eye and then the pseudophakic eye, with toric IOL implantation.

Vector analysis of the effects of any toric IOL realignment suggested by pseudophakic IA (i.e. was it likely to improve or worsen residual refractive astigmatism and/or UCVA)</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  willing and able to understand and sign an informed consent

          -  willing and able to attend all study visits

          -  presenting for uncomplicated bilateral cataract surgery and have an interest in a
             toric iol

          -  have good ocular health, with no pathology that compromises visual acuity (outside of
             residual refractive error)

          -  have visually significant cataracts

          -  have regular corneal astigmatism of 1.0D to 5.0D in both eyes with a difference
             between eyes of 1.0D or less

          -  have potential post operative acuity of 20/25 or better

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  corneal pathology

          -  amblyopia

          -  prior corneal refractive surgery or other refractive surgery

          -  previous anterior or posterior chamber surgery that the investigator feels may
             compromise visual outcomes

          -  Diabetic retinopathy if the investigator feels this will compromise visual outcomes

          -  macular degeneration

          -  history of retinal detachment

          -  irregular astigmatism or keratoconus

          -  strabismus

             implantation

          -  subjects who have an acute or chronic disease or illness that would confound the
             results of this investigation
