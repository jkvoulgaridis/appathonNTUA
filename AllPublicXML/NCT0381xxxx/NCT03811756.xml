  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Placebo controlled double-blind multi-dose comparative study of the effects of coenzyme Q10
      and collagen formulation with improved water-solubility in healthy adults.

      One group (test group) will receive investigational product - test syrup (daily dose 10 mL:
      fish collagen: 4000 mg, water soluble CoQ10 (Q10Vital®): 50 mg, vitamin C: 80 mg, vitamin A:
      920 μg, biotin: 150 μg) and the other (placebo group) placebo syrup without those active
      ingredients. Participants will test continuous administration of placebo or investigational
      product for 12 weeks in order to demonstrate and assess multiple-dose effects on skin
      condition and signs of skin aging.
