      This observational, retrospective, single-arm, multi-centre cohort study will use real-world
      data (RWD) to develop real-world evidence (RWE) of the safety and clinical effectiveness of
      the Pipeline™ Flex Embolization Device with Shield Technology™ in Australian patients that
      have received a flow diversion device to treat an intracranial aneurysm (IA). The medical
      records from 500 procedures completed at Gold Coast University Hospital in Queensland (QLD),
      Prince of Wales Hospital in New South Wales (NSW), and Sir Charles Gardiner Hospital in
      Western Australia (WA), will be analysed.

      The study will report the risk and likelihood of stroke (ischaemic and haemorrhagic), delayed
      neurological adverse events and incomplete aneurysm occlusion within sub-groups of the
      patient cohort and determine the predictive or confounding factors that influence clinical
      outcomes under pragmatic or 'real-world' conditions.

      Methodology summary: Single-arm, longitudinal, retrospective, multi-centre cohort study. A
      collaboration of Australian Interventional Neuroradiologists will create a data bank of
      existing clinical and angiographic data extracted from medical records review. The data
      collection variables are pre-specified using grading scales and clinical assessment with the
      greatest reliability or significant to to accurately represent patient cohorts receiving
      treatment within all indications of use. The study will establish a minimum dataset to
      collect patient socio-demographics, aneurysm characteristics, device characteristics, and
      clinical outcomes for up to 500 procedures completed using Pipeline™ Flex Embolization Device
      with Shield Technology™. A framework for data ab The prevalence, severity and outcomes of
      neurological adverse events of interest and bleeding events will be reported . Independent
      physician assessments of complete aneurysm occlusion from completed computed tomography scans
      (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans and Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA)
      procedures will be determined according to the Raymond Roy Occlusion Classification (MRRC),
      O'Kelly Marotta scale (OKM) for aneurysm occlusion using flow diverting devices and the
      Consensus grading scale for endovascular aneurysm occlusion up to 12 months post procedure.
      Assessments of wall apposition and in-stent stenosis (ISS) will also be completed.

      Quality Assurance plan includes - Framework data abstraction - manual of procedures, data
      dictionary, data abstraction manual, desired inter-rater reliability +0.80; intrarater
      reliability, intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) 0.75 - 0.9;

      Medical imaging review assessed by assess aneurysm occlusion by an independent interventional
      neuroradiologist or a local physician operator that did not complete the primary procedure.
      Physician level of agreement - interrater reliability to be reported;

      Independent physician review of all post-op strokes (ischaemic, haemorrhagic) cases to
      determine aetiology/mechanism;

      Study personnel training; Site visits; remote data monitoring, data audits.

      Statistical analysis plan include descriptive statistics and regression models to report
      prevalence, mortality, time-to-event analyses and estimations of risk; Counts of medical
      records with insufficient data for analysis or where the patient is identified as 'lost
      follow-up', this will be reported.

    <description>Neurointerventional procedures to treat intracranial (cerebral) aneurysms are minimally-invasive procedures performed by Interventional Neuroradiologists. The physician accesses the arterial system through a blood vessel in the groin followed by the insertion of a catheter. Pipeline™ Flex Embolization Device(s) with Shield Technology™,a flow diversion device, is implanted under high-magnification subtraction fluoroscopy, requiring the use of ancillary devices, such as micro-catheters and guidewires to complete the procedure under general anaesthetic. Procedural heparinisation and preloading with dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) using acetyl-salicylic acid and P2Y12 inhibitors such as clopidogrel or prasugrel are required.</description>

    <ipd_time_frame>To align with national recommendations for data sharing, the SCOPE-AUS metadata (description of the data) shall be published in a metadata record through Research Data Australia Registry, an entity of the Australian National Data Service. The goal is to ensure that data that is unique to the discipline of Interventional Neuroradiology is available for reuse in future research purposes.
The SCOPE-AUS metadata will be available at 12 months following primary publication until 48 months.</ipd_time_frame>
    <ipd_access_criteria>Access shall be conditional; re-users must be genuine researchers whose proposed use of the data has been approved by an Ethics committee. Re-users are required to cite the SCOPE-AUS dataset in any scholarly outputs. This proposed strategy will uphold Australian privacy laws. The Sponsor/Coordinating Principal Investigator/SCOPE-AUS research team will ultimately retain oversight of all future uses of the data.</ipd_access_criteria>
