      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the response of toripalimab (JS001), a PD1 antibody,
      in participants with POLE or POLD-mutated and non microsatellite instability (non-MSI-H)
      advanced solid cancers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy including antibodies targeting PD-1/PD-L1 or CTLA-4
      has greatly advanced the cancer treatments. Recent studies have identified several predictive
      markers for ICI which includes microsatellite instability (MSI), PD-L1 expression and tumor
      mutation burden (TMB). DNA polymerase epsilon (POLE) and delta (POLD) are in charge of DNA
      replication as well as proofreading during DNA replication. Their germline or somatic
      mutations can lead to DNA repair deficiencies and carcinogenesis. The investigators has found
      that the POLE or POLD mutation causes an increased TMB in cancer patients and may lead to a
      better survival to ICI. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of
      toripalimab , a PD1 antibody, in participants with POLE or POLD-mutated and non
      microsatellite instability high (non-MSI-H) advanced solid cancers. This is a Phase II, open
      label, single arm study. Participants enrolled in this study received toripalimab 240mg,
      every 3 weeks until disease progress or intolerable toxicity. Primary endpoints is ORR and
      secondary endpoints are OS, PFS and safety.
