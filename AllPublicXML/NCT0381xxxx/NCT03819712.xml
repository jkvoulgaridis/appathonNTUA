  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Urinary tract infections affect more than 130 million people worldwide each year. Almost 50%
      of women will have at least one urinary tract infection during their lifetime, usually
      cystitis. Half of them will have recurrent cystitis. Antibiotics are the first-line treatment
      for cystitis, but their effectiveness is decreasing due to the rapid spread of
      multi-resistant uro-pathogenic bacteria. The objective of this study is to identify blood
      biomarkers associated with a high risk of recurrent cystitis. Immune system cells, and more
      specifically innate immunity cells, play a key role in controlling urinary tract infections.
      In addition, clinical studies have shown that there is a high inter-individual variability in
      the ability of innate immune cells to respond to different stimuli. We therefore hypothesized
      that there was an association between the risk of recurrent cystitis and a deficiency of
      certain immune cell types in producing certain pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α,
      in response to one or more bacterial stimuli, particularly flagellin.
