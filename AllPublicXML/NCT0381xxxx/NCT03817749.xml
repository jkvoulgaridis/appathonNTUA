  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-prandial hyperglycemic excursions induce a cascade of deleterious effects on the body,
      including increased inflammation, production of reactive oxygen species, and impaired
      cardiovascular function. Ingestion of an exogenous oral ketone supplement blunts
      hyperglycemia in response to an oral glucose tolerance test. Accordingly, it is hypothesized
      that exogenous ketone supplement ingestion prior to a meal could be an effective strategy for
      blunting postprandial hyperglycemia. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate
      the effect of short-term (14-days) pre-meal exogenous ketone supplementation on glucose
      control, cardiovascular function, inflammation, and oxidative stress in individuals at an
      elevated risk of type 2 diabetes.
