  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A defect in the hatching stage is considered an important cause of implantation failure.
      Therefore, assisted hatching (AH), which involves artificial disruption of the zona
      pellucida, has been proposed as a method for improving the capacity of the embryo to implant.
      But the advantage of using laser to facilitate the hatching process of embryos in ART
      practice is debatable, and an optimum strategy for performing LAH remains elusive. Therefore,
      the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of laser-assisted hatching(LAH) on clinical
      outcomes. Patients were randomly divided into control and LAH groups. The zona pellucida was
      thinned or drilled with a diode laser. Relevant parameters are recorded to evaluate the
      validity of LAH in ART.

      Hatching is a very important process for successful implantation involving the breaking of
      the embryo out of the zona pellucida at the blastocyst stage. Inadequate hatching of the
      blastocyst might lead to implantation failure in ART. Currently, a variety of AH techniques
      have been used including zona thinning and the opening or complete removal of the zona by
      laser. But the advantage of using laser to facilitate the hatching process of embryos in ART
      practice is debatable, and an optimum strategy for performing LAH remains elusive. Therefore,
      the investigator aim to discuss the effectiveness of LAH in ART.

      In this study, patients were randomly divided into control and LAH groups. A quarter of zona
      pellucida of the cleavage-stage embryo was thinned to 6.6 μm. All operation was performed in
      the empty region without contact to the blastomere in order to minimize the blastomere
      damage. The ZP of blastocyst was drilled with laser, the ZP opening 20% of its initial
      length. The operation was performed in the opposite region of ICM in order to minimize the
      damage. In the control group, embryos were transplanted without LAH. The rate of clinical
      pregnancy, live-birth, miscarriage, multiple gestation were evaluated. This research intends
      to discuss whether LAH can improve the clinical outcomes in ART, and further choice the
      appropriate LAH action site.
