  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare the use of FDG PET/CT to Ga-68 HA-DOTATATE (abbreviated
      DOTATATE) PET/CT in patients with active giant cell arteritis (GCA) started on prednisone to
      understand if DOTATATE can identify more areas of active blood vessel inflammation than FDG.

    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to prospectively evaluate the potential use of 68-Ga HA-DOTATATE
      PET/CT for detecting medium-large vessel inflammation in a small number of GCA patients with
      active disease, as compared to FDG PET/CT, and to understand if DOTATATE uptake correlates
      with disease activity. Fifteen patients with active GCA (either newly-diagnosed or recently
      relapsed disease) who are receiving glucocorticoids will be enrolled. Participants will
      undergo baseline FDG PET/CT and baseline DOTATATE PET/CT scan. Tracer uptake will be
      described in 8 major vascular territories. DOTATATE PET/CT will be repeated again in 6
      months, and tracer uptake will be correlated to clinical disease activity, and medication
      use.

    <intervention_model_description>68-Ga HA-DOTATATE PET/CT will be performed in all participants as part of study protocol. Participants will receive an intravenous infusion of 3MBq/kg of 68Ga HA-DOTATATE (to max 200 MBq), followed by CT and PET imaging 60 minutes later. Tracer uptake in each vascular territory will be interpreted qualitatively and quantitatively.</intervention_model_description>
