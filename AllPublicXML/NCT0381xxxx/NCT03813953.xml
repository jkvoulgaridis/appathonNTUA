  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The LIVER (Local Infiltration Versus Epidural after Liver Resection) and LIVER 2 (Local
      Infiltration Versus Epidural after Liver Resection 2) studies were randomised controlled
      trials that compared epidural analgesia with local anaesthetic wound infiltration as
      post-operative analgesia in patients undergoing open liver resection.

      The overall findings of this trial were of similar rates of morbidity and pain control
      post-operatively but a reduced recovery time for the wound catheter group. As a result, wound
      catheter local anesthetic infiltration has become increasingly utilized in this unit and
      within other units throughout the country and worldwide.

      Epidural use has been associated with improved long term outcomes following abdominal cancer
      surgery. This study is therefore a long term follow up study of the LIVER and LIVER 2 trials
      to assess survival between the two groups.

      The LIVER and LIVER 2 studies were randomised controlled trials that compared epidural
      analgesia with local anaesthetic wound infiltration as post-operative analgesia in patients
      undergoing open liver resection.

      The overall findings of this trial were of similar rates of morbidity and pain control
      post-operatively but a reduced recovery time for the wound catheter group. As a result, wound
      catheter local anesthetic infiltration has become increasingly utilized in this unit and
      within other units throughout the country and worldwide.

      There has been some evidence however, that epidural analgesia post-operatively can have a
      positive impact on long term survival in patients undergoing abdominal surgery for cancer.
      The reasons for this are not well established but it is proposed that the protective effect
      against the immunosuppression following major surgery that epidural has can aid in the cancer
      prevention process. There remains no randomised controlled trials looking at this subject in
      open liver surgery.

      The aim of this study is to assess the overall and disease free survival of the patients who
      participated in the LIVER and LIVER 2 trials.

      The primary outcome is 5 year overall survival. Data will be observed from electronic (or non
      electronic) patient records, information and statistics department data and general practice
      records as required.

      Overall survival at 1 and 3 years Disease free survival at 1, 3 and 5 years (Data will be
      observed from Lothian hepatobiliary multi-disciplinary team meeting data and follow up CT/MRI
      scan dates)

      Median overall and disease free survival Survival according to individual pathology
      subgroups.

      Participants will be identified from study records of the LIVER and LIVER 2 trials. This will
      be performed by the two study investigators.
