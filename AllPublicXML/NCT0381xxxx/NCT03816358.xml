      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of anetumab ravtansine when given
      together with nivolumab, ipilimumab and gemcitabine hydrochloride in treating patients with
      mesothelin positive pancreatic cancer that has spread to other places in the body (advanced).
      Anetumab ravtansine is a monoclonal antibody, called anetumab ravtansine, linked to a
      chemotherapy drug called DM4. Anetumab attaches to mesothelin positive cancer cells in a
      targeted way and delivers DM4 to kill them. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as
      nivolumab and ipilimumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may
      interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Gemcitabine hydrochloride may
      stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving
      anetumab ravtansine together with nivolumab, ipilimumab, and gemcitabine hydrochloride may
      work better in treating patients with pancreatic cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of anetumab ravtansine with the following
      combinations in patients with mesothelin positive pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the preliminary anti-tumor activity of anetumab ravtansine (anetumab) in
      combination with nivolumab, nivolumab and ipilimumab, nivolumab and gemcitabine hydrochloride
      (gemcitabine) as measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1
      overall response rate (ORR).

      II. To characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) profile of anetumab (apparent diffusion
      coefficient [ADC]), total antibody (ADC and cleaved free antibody), DM4 and DM4-Me (S-Methyl
      metabolite of DM4).

      III. To evaluate the tumor microenvironment and immune changes in tumor and peripheral blood
      over the course of treatment to identify predictors of response or resistance to treatment.

      IV. To measure the progressive disease (PD) effects of this combination including molecular
      and immune biomarkers in tumor biopsies and peripheral blood.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize mesothelin, PD-L1, CD3, CD4, CD8 expressions at baseline and after
      treatment in mesothelin positive pancreatic cancer patients.

      II. To evaluate level of soluble mesothelin and megakaryocyte potentiation factor (MPF) over
      the course of treatment and to correlate these biomarkers with clinical outcome.

      III. To perform whole exome sequencing (WES) +/- ribonucleic acid sequencing (RNAseq) in the
      tumor biopsy specimens and correlation genomic (e.g. mutational burden) and transcriptomic
      biomarkers with clinical outcome.

      IV. To evaluate mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) function, Fc-gamma receptors (FcgammaRs)
      and hormone and chemokine mediators as methods to evaluate factors affecting the PK and PD of
      these agents.

      V. To evaluate anti-drug antibody (ADA) titres changes pre and post treatment and correlate
      them with PK, toxicity and responses.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of anetumab ravtansine. Patients are assigned to 1
      of 3 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive anetumab ravtansine intravenously (IV) over 1 hour and nivolumab IV
      over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8 of cycle 1 and on day 1 of subsequent cycles. Treatment
      repeats every 21 or 28 days (cycle 1) for up to 17 cycles in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive anetumab ravtansine IV over 1 hour and nivolumab IV over 30 minutes
      on days 1 and 8 of cycle 1 and on day 1 of subsequent cycles. Patients also receive
      ipilimumab IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8 of cycle 1 and on day 1 of cycles 2-4.
      Treatment repeats every 21 or 28 days (cycle 1) for up to 17 cycles in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM III: Patients receive anetumab ravtansine IV over 1 hour on day 1 and nivolumab IV over
      30 minutes on day 8 of cycle 1 and on day 1 of subsequent cycles. Patients also receive
      gemcitabine hydrochloride over 30-40 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 or
      28 days (cycle 1) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at days 30-37 and then every 8
      weeks for up to 100 days.

    <description>The analysis on proposed biomarkers is exploratory and hypothesis generating in nature. The key biomarker is CD8. CD8 after anetumab will be compared with CD8 after immunotherapy. Paired T-test will be carried out to identify changes in each biomarker between time points and mixed model will be used to study the trend in biomarkers over time when multiple measurements are available. The association between baseline biomarkers or change in biomarkers and clinical outcome progression-free survival, toxicity and overall response will also be analyzed by Cox model or logistic model where appropriate. The results may be adjusted using Pocock method for multiplicity.</description>

               -  Male patients with a female partner of childbearing potential must use a condom
                  and ensure that an additional form of contraception is also used during treatment
                  plus 7 months post-treatment completion.

                    -  Note: a woman is considered WOCBP, i.e. fertile, following menarche and

          -  Patients with corneal epitheliopathy and at the discretion of the ophthalmologist any
             other eye disorder

               -  Note: Low grades of superficial punctate keratitis, within the range seen in the
                  normal population, should not lead to the exclusion of the patient

          -  Active or prior documented inflammatory bowel disease (i.e. ulcerative colitis)

          -  Active or prior documented autoimmune disease within the past 2 years

             evaluation of study treatment or interpretation of patient safety or study results

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because of the potential for teratogenic
             or abortifacient effects; because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother, breastfeeding should
             be discontinued for at least 6 months after last dose of study drugs; these potential
             risks may also apply to other agents used in this study; should a patient become
