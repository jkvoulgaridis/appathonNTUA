  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To highlight the importance of protein quality rather than the total protein content of a
      meal, the investigators will demonstrate that unlike high quality proteins, a single meal
      containing 30 g of an incomplete protein source does not stimulate skeletal muscle protein
      synthesis. Secondly, the investigators will directly challenge a prevalent, but untested,
      assertion that has the potential to negatively impact health. The goal is to demonstrate that
      complementary plant-proteins (i.e., two or more incomplete protein sources) must be consumed
      at the same meal to stimulate protein synthesis.

  <detailed_description>

      The investigators will test the following hypotheses in middle-aged men and women (45-60)
      years old using a randomized, cross over design. All study objectives will be met
      concurrently:

        1. Meals containing 30 g of high quality, predominantly beef-protein (PRO-A) will stimulate
           acute (i.e., single meal response) and 24 h skeletal muscle protein synthesis
           [confirmatory hypothesis]

        2. Meals containing 30 g of complementary plant-based proteins (PRO-B: complete essential
           amino acid profile at each meal) will stimulate acute and 24 h skeletal muscle protein
           synthesis, but to a lesser extent than beef-protein.

        3. A single meal containing 30 g of an incomplete plant-based protein source (PRO-C:
           lacking one essential amino acid) will fail to acutely stimulate skeletal muscle protein
           synthesis

        4. Meals containing 30 g of plant-based protein that are incomplete at each separate meal,
           but complementary over a 24 h period, will fail to stimulate 24 h skeletal muscle
           protein synthesis.

        5. Beef-and plant-based meals will have a similar effect on satiety and 24 h blood glucose
           [descriptive]

      If these hypotheses are correct, the investigators will demonstrate that meals containing a
      moderate amount of high quality protein, such as beef, are an efficient and effective way to
      augment a largely plant based diet and stimulate skeletal muscle protein synthesis - a
      prerequisite for outcomes related to physical function, performance, successful aging and
      metabolic health.
