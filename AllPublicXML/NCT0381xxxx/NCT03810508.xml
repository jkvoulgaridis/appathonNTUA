  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Charcot-Marie-Tooth 4J (CMT4J) is a rare inherited peripheral neuropathy often characterized
      by rapidly progressive, asymmetrical upper and lower extremity weakness, muscle atrophy
      leading to loss of ambulation, respiratory compromise and premature death with no available
      treatment.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the clinical characteristics and natural clinical
      progression of symptoms in individuals with CMT4J. This natural history study is important to
      better understand disease course to be able to determine clinically meaningful outcome
      measures for use in future clinical trials.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) diseases are the most common inherited motor and sensory
      neuropathies, composed of a group of pathologically and genetically distinct subtypes ranging
      from slowly to rapidly progressive disease.

      CMT4J is a rare subtype of CMT caused by mutations in the FIG4 gene. Pediatric-onset disease
      can often be characterized by rapid progression of muscle weakness and atrophy, culminating
      in loss of ambulation and respiratory compromise and premature death. Adult-onset CMT4J can
      present with a more variable disease course.

      No prospective natural history study for CMT4J has been reported. This study aims to
      prospectively investigate the natural history of CMT4J, and concurrently to identify
      potential outcome measures that could be used in future clinical trials. No investigational
      product will be provided in the study.

          -  Participants must have a diagnosis of CMT4J based on clinical presentation and genetic
             testing (known or suspected pathogenic mutation in FIG4 gene).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects unable to travel to a study site will not be enrolled in the prospective
             natural history study collecting standardized clinical data; however, with subject
             consent, they will be enrolled in the Remote Cohort. Subjects in the Remote Cohort may
             submit medical records and have the clinical data recorded in the natural history
             database over time. Subjects enrolled in the Remote Cohort or their caregivers may
             also complete subject/caregiver-reported questionnaires at regular intervals if they
             choose.
