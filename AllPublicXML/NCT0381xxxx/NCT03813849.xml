      Women indicated for surgical evacuation of missed abortion up to 12 weeks were included.
      Standard surgical evacuation of uterus by suction followed by sharp curettage under general
      anaesthesia were done for all cases. When the operator judged the procedure as complete,
      transvaginal sonography was done by dedicated sonographer using portable ultrasound machine
