             release of personal health information. A signed informed consent must be obtained
             before screening procedures are performed.

        NOTE: HIPAA authorization may be either included in the informed consent or obtained
        separately.

             PSA determinations obtained at least 1 week apart). The 50% rise in PSA is across the
             3 determinations, and these determinations do not need to be sequential.

          -  PSA doubling time of &lt;/= 9 months as calculated according to the Memorial Sloan
             Kettering Cancer Center nomogram

             However, subjects with pelvic and/or retroperitoneal nodes &lt; 2cm in the short axis
             will be permitted on study, as they are considered not to have definitive metastases.
             (Note: Metastatic disease on investigational imaging, Prostate Specific Membrane
             Antigen-targeted (PSMA) PET, PET-choline, or other novel PET tracers who do not have
             evidence of metastatic disease using conventional imaging (CT/MRI, bone scan) are

             BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, CHEK2, FANCA, RAD51C, RAD51D, PALB2, BRIP1, BARD1, or CDK12.
             Mutations may be truncating, splice site mutations, missense or homozygous deletions.
             Mutation status is determined by a local laboratory with the result documented in the
             subject's medical record, previously obtained genomic testing from a CLIA-certified
             lab, or via archival or fresh tissue.

             period prior to starting olaparib is 5 weeks for enzalutamide or phenobarbital and 3
             weeks for other agents.

          -  More than 2 cycles of intermittent hormones for the treatment of biochemical
             recurrence, with a cycle defined as a period of consistent ADT (generally 3-12 months)
             followed by intentional cessation of ADT without re-initiation of ADT until the PSA
             rises. Prior ADT in the treatment of localized prostate cancer or with salvage
             radiation therapy is allowed. Prior use of abiraterone acetate with prednisone,
             enzalutamide, apalutamide, or other androgen receptor/androgen biosynthesis inhibitors
             are allowed if used in the localized or biochemically recurrent disease state provided

          -  No medical conditions such as uncontrolled hypertension, uncontrolled diabetes
             mellitus, cardiac disease that would, in the opinion of the investigator, make this
             protocol unreasonably hazardous.

          -  Subjects considered a poor medical risk due to a serious, uncontrolled medical
             disorder or non-malignant systemic disease. Examples include, but are not limited to,

             treatment start, uncontrolled major seizure disorder, unstable spinal cord
             compression, superior vena cava syndrome, extensive interstitial bilateral lung
             disease on High Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) scan or any psychiatric disorder
             that prohibits obtaining informed consent.

          -  No active infection including tuberculosis (TB) (clinical evaluation that includes
             clinical history, physical examination and radiographic findings, and TB testing in
             line with local practice), hepatitis B (known positive HBV surface antigen (HBsAg)
             result), hepatitis C, or active infection with human immunodeficiency virus (positive
             HIV 1/2 antibodies). Subjects with a past or resolved HBV infection (defined as
             presence of hepatitis B core antibody [anti-HBc] and absence of HBsAg) are eligible.
             Subjects positive for hepatitis C (HCV) antibody are eligible only if polymerase chain
             reaction is negative for HCV RNA

          -  No autoimmune disease: subjects with a history of inflammatory bowel disease,
             including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's Disease, are excluded from this study, as are
             subjects with a history of symptomatic disease (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, systemic
             progressive sclerosis [scleroderma], systemic lupus erythematosus, autoimmune
             vasculitis *e.g., Sarcoidosis syndrome or Wegener's granulomatosis with
             polyangiitis+); motor neuropathy considered of autoimmune origin (e.g., Guillain-Barre
             syndrome and myasthenia gravis); Graves' disease. Exceptions include history of
             eczema, vitiligo, alopecia, hypothyroidism (e.g., following Hashimoto syndrome) , and
             any chronic skin condition that does not require systemic therapy; subjects without
             active disease in the last 5 years prior to treatment start may be included but only
             after consultation with the treating physician. Exceptions may be made on a case by
             case basis upon discussion with the Sponsor Principal Investigator.

          -  No history of active primary immunodeficiency

          -  No major surgery within 4 weeks of treatment start. Subjects must have recovered from
             any significant effects of any major surgery but investigators may discuss with the
             Sponsor Principal Investigator in the case of any exceptions.

          -  No blood transfusion within 28 days of treatment start.

          -  Resting ECG with QTc &gt; 470 msec on 2 or more time points within a 24 hour period or

             &gt;/= 2) caused by previous anticancer therapy, excluding alopecia, vitiligo, and the
             laboratory values described in the inclusion criteria. Subjects with Grade &gt;/= 2
             neuropathy will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis after consultation with the
             Sponsor Principal Investigator. Subjects with irreversible toxicity not reasonably
             expected to be exacerbated by treatment with study drugs may be included only after
             consultation with the Sponsor Principal Investigator

          -  No subjects who are HIV-positive on combination antiretroviral therapy because of the
             potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with olaparib. In addition, these subjects
             are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow suppressive
             therapy.

          -  No subjects with baseline moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B
             and C).

             medication.

          -  No other condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude
             participation in this trial.
