      RATIONALE:

      In asthmatic subjects, smoking can lead to several changes in disease characterictics. in
      smokers of more than 20 pack-years, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) can be
      associated with asthma, also called asthma-COPD overlap syndrome (ACOS). Increasing data
      support the concept that ACOS is a clinical entity. However, this should be further studied
      in order to better target therapy.

      AIM:

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the comparative features of ACOS

      METHODS:

      This will be a descriptive study comparing the features of the ACOS with the features of
      asthmatic subjects with an incomplete reversibility of airway obstruction (IRAO).The study
      will be done over 1 or 2 visits (within a week interval), according to subjects'
      availability. The visit will include completion of different questionnaires (asthma control
      asthma quality of life, medical history, exacerbations, etc.), a thoracic examination,
      allergy skin-prick tests, spirometry and bronchodilator response, lung volumes and compliance
      measurements, exhaled nitric oxide measurement, blood sampling and a sputum induction.

It is a 7-point scale questionnaire (where 1 is greatest impairment and 7 is least impairment) containing 15 uqestions divided into 4 domains : symptoms (5 items), activity limitation (4 items), emotional function (3 items), and exposure to environmental stimuli (3 items). during the last 2 weeks. The overall score is the mean of all the responses. Each domain score is calculated from the mean of the items that relate to it.</description>
