  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is determine the safety, efficacy and tolerability of a novel drug
      APH-1501 as a pharmacotherapy for Opioid Dependence. The investigators will evaluate the
      safety of escalating doses APH-1501.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2a Exploratory Pilot study assessing the efficacy, immunogenicity and
      pharmacology of APH-1501, Cannabidiol (CBD), a unique, bioactive component of marijuana, in
      reducing early attrition and improving outcome in opioid-dependent individual in adults
      diagnosed with an opioid addiction, ages 21-55 years of age. Subjects will be randomized into
      4 groups receiving APH-1501 or placebo over a 30 day period that includes a regimen of
      reformulated 400, 600 or 800 mg/m2 APH 1501 or placebo. This trial will target
      opioid-dependent patients who have completed detoxification and are in a treatment facility.
      During the trial period, participants will be given APH-1501 twice a day for 30 days. Given
      prior evidence based research on CBD there should be minimum to no side effects to taking APH
      1501. The overarching research question for the study is the efficacy of APH 1501,
      pharmaceutical-grade CBD (&gt;98.5% and &lt; 0.3% Î”9-THC) for clinical use in the treatment of
      opioid addiction.

      This is an intervention model design with three treatment groups, parallel assignment. This
      study is designed for sufficient time in between dose escalations to allow for interim
      analysis of safety and tolerability data to be considered for the safest approach to assess
      the effects of the compound as a therapeutic agent. Randomization will be stratified by the
      Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM)_V diagnosis taking into account any co-morbid
      features or dual diagnosis.

The SAFTEE is a questionnaire that rates the current severity of a wide range of somatic, behavioral and affective symptoms in general and specific inquiry formats. It is designed to report adverse health events. Contains ~ 25 detailed questions that systematically address 29 body systems. Responses are rated on five levels of severity.</description>
