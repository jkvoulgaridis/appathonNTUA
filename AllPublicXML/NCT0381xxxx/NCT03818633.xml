  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgery is the primary treatment for gynecologic malignancies. The surgical approach provides
      opportunities for removal of the affected organs and complete assessment of extent of cancer
      spread. However, the procedures are often associated with significant morbidity. This is
      especially true with open laparotomy, the most frequently employed approach in developing
      countries. Delayed functional recovery influenced by pain and immobilization are important
      contributing factors for increased morbidity. Elastic abdominal binder, a wide elastic belt
      that is wore around the patient's abdomen to support surgical incision after surgery, has
      been employed by clinicians for pain relief, wound complications prevention, improved
      pulmonary function, and stabilization. Benefits of the abdominal binder use in this patient
      population have not been properly examined.

      The aim of this study is to examine the effect of postoperative elastic abdominal binder use
      on recovery by comparing pain scores and mobility function (through the 6-minute walk test
      [6MWT]) in postoperative gynecologic cancer patients who use versus do not use the elastic
      abdominal binder to support incisional site.

    <description>The EuroQol Group's ED-5D-5L questionnaire is employed. The health dimensions assessed include mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. For each dimension, the participants are asked to indicate their health state related to that dimension as no problems (score '1'), slight problems (score '2'), moderate problems (score '3'), severe problems (score '4'), and extreme problems (score '5'). For this study, a score of 1-2 is considered &quot;normal&quot; while a scores of 3-5 is regarded as &quot;problem&quot;. In addition, the participants are asked to rate their overall health status according to a visual analog scale EQ VAS with '0' corresponding to &quot;the worst health imaginable&quot; and '100' indicating &quot;the best health imaginable&quot;.</description>

    <description>Each woman in the intervention group is fitted with an elastic abdominal binder at the time of procedure completion just before leaving the operating room. The binder is placed snuggly tight (keeping in mind patient's comfort) on top of the hospital gown with the incision positioned at the middle part of the binder. The patients are encouraged to wear binders at all time. However, periods of break from wearing the binder are allowed at their convenience.</description>
