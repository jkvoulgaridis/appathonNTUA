  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SHR-1210 is a humanized monoclonal antibody against Programmed death 1(PD-1). Apatinib is a
      small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) selectively inhibits Vascular Endothelial
      Growth Factor Receptor 2 (VEGFR-2). Patients with metastatic, persistent, or recurrent
      cervical cancer who failed to first-line chemotherapy +/- bevacizumab will received SHR-1210
      200mg (3mg/kg for underweight patients) iv every 2 weeks and apatinib 250mg orally once
      daily. The efficacy and safety will be observed.
