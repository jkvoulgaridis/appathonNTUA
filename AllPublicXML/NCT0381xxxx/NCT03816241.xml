  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As part of a larger study, participants are told to read 1 out of 4 anecdotes depicting an
      organ donation scenario where they are required to make a decision on behalf of their mother
      who has just suffered an accident. The participants are then surveyed on their attitudes
      towards organ donation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As part of a larger study, participants are given 1 out of 4 possible vignettes which depicts
      an organ donation scenario involving their mother. The possible vignettes consist of a
      Control condition, a Framing condition, a Normative condition and a condition that includes
      all the nudges. Participants are then given surveys to gauge their views and attitudes
      towards organ donation as a whole, their trust towards medical institutions and the doctors,
      their perceived manipulation from the doctor and their views on the altruistic nature of
      organ donation.
