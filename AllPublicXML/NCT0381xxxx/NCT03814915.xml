    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of the IMI DIRECT (Innovative Medicines Initiative Diabetes Research on
      Patient Stratification) Consortium is the identification of biomarkers that aid therapeutic
      targeting in prediabetes (Study 1) or early onset type 2 diabetes (Study 2).

      There are two multicentre prospective cohort studies within the glycaemic deterioration work
      package of IMI DIRECT (WP2). These two cohorts are designed to address the area of glycaemic
      deterioration by amassing data and biomaterials that will be used to discover novel
      biomarkers for glycaemic deterioration in people at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes
      (Study 1) and in those who have recently been diagnosed with the disease (Study 2).

    <description>The primary objective of Study 1 is to collect biosamples and information that might yield novel, predictive biomarkers for glycaemic deterioration in non-diabetic high-risk participants.
Participants in Study 1 were recruited from existing prospective cohort studies in or around each of the following European cities: Malmö, Sweden (Malmö Diet and Cancer Study); Amsterdam, The Netherlands (Hoorn Study); Copenhagen, Denmark (Inter99); and Kuopio, Finland (METSIM). A clinically practicable screening tool (DIRECT-DETECT) was used to identify at-risk participants from existing cohort studies, who were then recruited into this new prospective cohort study (Study 1).</description>

    <description>The primary objective of Study 2 is to collect biosamples and information that might yield novel, predictive biomarkers for glycaemic deterioration in people who have recently been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Participants in Study 2 of DIRECT are recruited from or nearby each of the following European cities: Malmö, Sweden; Amsterdam, the Netherlands; Copenhagen, Denmark; Exeter, UK; Newcastle, UK; Dundee, UK. Potential participants are recruited through targeted searches of existing databases and research registers combined with person-to-person contact at educational clinics and through routine retinal screening programmes.</description>
