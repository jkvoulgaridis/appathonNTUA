  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, pilot trial to test the safety and efficacy of transplantation of
      livers from Hepatitis C seropositive non-viremic (HCV Ab+/NAT-) and HCV seropositive viremic
      (HCV Ab+/NAT+) donors to HCV seronegative recipients on the liver transplant waitlist.
      Treatment and prophylaxis will be administered, using a transmission-triggered approach for
      the first scenario (HCV Ab+/NAT- donors, arm 1) and a prophylaxis approach for the later
      scenario (HCV Ab+/NAT+ donors, arm 2).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single center, pilot, open-label study of transplantation of livers of
      HCVAb+ donors to HCVAb- recipients with subsequent therapy with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir
      (Epclusa®). Recipients of a liver from HCVAb+/NAT- donors will be in arm 1 (the
      transmission-triggered arm) of the study. In this arm, the study will monitor transmission of
      HCV by measuring HCV RNA in liver transplant recipients. If HCV RNA is detected, indicating
      transmission of HCV, recipients will be treated with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir (Epclusa®) for 12
      weeks. Virological response will be assessed at 4 weeks, end of treatment and 12 weeks after
      completion of therapy.

      Recipients of a liver from HCVAb+/NAT+ donors will be in arm 2 (the prophylaxis arm) of the
      study. In this arm, patients will be started on a 12-week course of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir
      (Epclusa®) immediately post-operatively and will undergo close monitoring of HCV RNA for
      evidence of transmission.

      To be eligible for the study, subjects need to be listed for liver transplantation, be not
      infected with HCV, HBV or HIV, and sign informed consent.
