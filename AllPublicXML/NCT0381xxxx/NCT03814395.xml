  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PKUBC-T is a prospective cohort study carried out in Tongzhou district of Beijing, China.
      The primary aim of this study is to investigate the short-term and long-term effects of
      pre-pregnant and prenatal exposure on maternal and child health. Data are collected regarding
      environmental, nutritional and lifestyle exposures as well as short-term and long-term health
      outcomes of mothers and their children from birth to 6 years old. Biological samples
      including blood and tissue samples are also collected from mothers and their children.

    <textblock>
      Maternal and child health is of great concern globally. Early life phase of a fetus and
      infant is a critical period for the development of health and disease in the whole life.
      Exposure of negative environmental, nutritional and lifestyle factors in pregnant women
      during this period can have adverse effects on fetal and infant. In addition, for mothers,
      complications during pregnancy could also have a negative effect on long-term health of
      mothers, such as diabetes, hypertension. Thus, the Peking University Birth Cohort in Tongzhou
      is primarily aimed to investigate the short-term and long-term effects of pre-pregnant and
      prenatal exposure on maternal and child health. Data are collected regarding environmental,
      nutritional and lifestyle exposures as well as short-term and long-term health outcomes of
      mothers and their children from birth to 6 years old. Biological samples including blood and
      tissue samples are also collected from mothers and their children.

    <measure>Early Child development 1</measure>
    <time_frame>Age at 6 weeks and 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by Ages&amp;Stages Questionnaires (ASQ).There are 6 questions in each of 5 domains of development: communication, gross motor, fine motor, problem-solving skills, and adaptive skills. Each question is given a 10 (yes), 5 (sometimes), or 0 (not yet) score according to the parents' answers. The sum scores (range from 0 to 300) and scores for each domain (range from 0 to 60) are calculated. Chinese norms are available for each domain, and any domain screened &lt;2 SDs below the mean is considered a positive screening. A higher ASQ score means better development.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Early Child development 2</measure>
    <time_frame>Age at 8-12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by Denver Developmental Screening Test (DDST). DDST comprises 125 test items grouped into four domains of child development: 25 personal-social (PS), 29 fine motor (FM), 39 language (LA) and 32 gross motor (GM). These test items are administered using a bell, glass bottle, set of 10 blocks, rattle, pencil, tennis ball, yarn, raisins, cup, white doll, white paper, and baby bottle. A child's raw score on each test item is marked as tested pass, failure, refusal, or no opportunity. The result of the test is labeled as &quot;normal,&quot; &quot;suspect&quot; or &quot;abnormal&quot;. Normal development means that there is no delay or at the maximum one warning. Abnormal development means that there is one or more than one delay situation. Suspicious development means that it is a situation involving one delay, one delay and one warning or two or more than two warnings. The number of children with normal, suspect or abnormal development is calculated.</description>
