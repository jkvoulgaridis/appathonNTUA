      This is an open-label, parallel-group, nonrandomized, multi-centre, phase-IV, single dose
      trial in 8 HIV-seronegative subjects with severe hepatic impairment and 8 matched controls to
      assess the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of 50mg of dolutegravir in subjects with severe
      hepatic impairment.

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, parallel-group, nonrandomized, multi-centre, phase-IV, single dose
      trial. The primary aim of this study is to assess the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of
      50mg of dolutegravir in HIV-seronegative subjects with severe hepatic impairment (n=8) and
      compare these with a single dose of 50mg of dolutegravir in matched controls (n=8). In both
      groups a pharmacokinetic (PK) curve will be recorded for determination of dolutegravir (and
      dolutegravir-glucuronide).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is at least 18 and not older than 90 years at screening.

          2. Subject is able and willing to sign the Informed Consent Form prior to screening
             evaluations.

          3. Child-Pugh score 10 or greater (Appendix A). Expected to be in clinical stable
             condition for at least 4 weeks as assessed by the subject's own hepatologist. This
             assessment takes into account the following aspects: MELD score, fibroscan results (if
             available), life expectancy, recent history of decompensation events and the rate of
             progression of hepatic insufficiency.

        For healthy volunteers

          1. Subject is at least 18 and not older than 90 years at screening.

          2. Subject is able and willing to sign the Informed Consent Form prior to screening
             evaluations.

          3. Subject is in good age-appropriate health condition as established by medical history,
             physical examination, electrocardiography, results of biochemistry, haematology and
             urinalysis testing within 4 weeks prior to Day 1. Results of biochemistry, haematology
             and urinalysis testing should be within the laboratory's reference ranges. If
             laboratory results are not within the reference ranges, the subject is included on
             condition that the Investigator judges that the deviations are not clinically
             relevant. This should be clearly recorded.

          4. Subject has a normal blood pressure and pulse rate, according to the Investigator's
             judgement.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Inability to understand the nature and extent of the study and the procedures
             required.

          2. Gilbert's syndrome or other underlying disease (other than hepatic impairment) that
             causes alterations in the Child-Pugh class components (bilirubin, albumin,
             prothrombin, encephalopathy and ascites).

          3. Therapy with strong inducers or inhibitors of UGT1A1 or drugs that are
             contra-indicated with concomitant use of dolutegravir (see appendix B). (NB. there are
             restrictions for intake of magnesium/aluminium-containing antacids, iron and calcium
             supplements, multivitamins and other cation-containing supplements (see appendix B and
             section 5.2)).

          4. Positive HIV test.

          5. Participation in a drug study within 60 days prior to Day 1.

        For healthy volunteers

          1. Documented history of sensitivity/idiosyncrasy to medicinal products or excipients.

          2. Positive HIV test.

          3. Positive hepatitis B or C test.

          4. Pregnant female (as confirmed by an hCG test performed less than 4 weeks before Day 1)
             or breast-feeding female. Female subjects of childbearing potential without adequate
             contraception.

          5. Therapy with strong inducers or inhibitors of UGT1A1 or drugs that are
             contra-indicated with concomitant use of dolutegravir (see appendix B). (NB. there are
             restrictions for intake of magnesium/aluminium-containing antacids, iron and calcium
             supplements, multivitamins and other cation-containing supplements (see appendix B and
             section 5.2)).

          6. Relevant history or presence of pulmonary disorders (especially COPD), cardiovascular
             disorders, neurological disorders (especially seizures and migraine), psychiatric
             disorders, gastro-intestinal disorders, renal and hepatic disorders, hormonal
             disorders (especially diabetes mellitus), coagulation disorders.

          7. Relevant history or current condition that might interfere with drug absorption,
             distribution, metabolism or excretion.

          8. History of or current abuse of drugs, alcohol or solvents.

          9. Inability to understand the nature and extent of the study and the procedures
             required.

         10. Participation in a drug study within 60 days prior to Day 1.

         11. Donation of blood within 60 days prior to Day 1.

         12. Febrile illness within 3 days before Day 1

         13. UGT1A1 polymorphism (at least one *28, *37 or *6 allele) -
