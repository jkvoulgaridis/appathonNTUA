  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression is difficult to identify, prevent and treat in adolescents because of complex and
      stigmatized multiform symptoms and pathways of care.

      In children the existence of a parental depression is a significant and recognized risk
      factor for the development of a depression. It is regularly reported that 30% of adolescents
      of depressed parents have depression themselves. General Practitioners (GP) have significant
      access to the depression of adults, potentially parents of teenagers. In fact, 20% of
      patients in the regular active file of one GP have depression. The primary health care system
      could provide indirect but voluminous and unprecedented access to the identification of
      adolescent depression at an early stage from the encounter of depressed parents.

      The difficulties of articulation between primary care (PC) and mental health devices are
      demonstrated. They disrupt the care pathways of adolescents detected in PC, prevention, and
      may even disturb early detection of depression. An organized joint between the PC and a
      specialized mental health service for adolescents (&quot;Maison Des Adolescents&quot; MDA) could
      promote the process of screening and preventing depression of adolescents of depressed
      parents encountered in PC.

      In addition, if the effects of parental depression on adolescents are established, they
      remain complex and interactive. They vary by age and sex of the child but also the sex of the
      parent. A concomitant study of adolescent and parent depression will provide data to analyze
      the prevalence of depressed parent adolescent depression and to define risk or protection
      factors.

      AdoDesP study is a cluster randomised trial (randomisation of the GPs) which compare a group
      of adolescent with PC articulated with mental health service (MDA) and an other group without
      articulation (routine cares).

      A third group of depressed adolescents will be constituted to analyse parental depression of
      depressed adolescents.

    <description>The depression intensity will be evaluated by Adolescent Depression Rating Scale (ADRS) at Day 0 and Month 12. The investigators will compare its evolution between group 1 (PC articulated with MDA) and 2 (Routine cares).
Adolescent depression rating scale (ADRS) assesses depression in adolescents in 10 items. The items measure insomnia, anxiety, sadness and fatigability. If ADRS score is less than 4 : low risk of depression, between 4 and 8 : moderate risk of depression and more than 8 : significant risk of depression.</description>

    <description>The quality of live will be evaluated by Pediatric Quality of Life InventoryTM (PedsQL) scale at Day 0, Months 6 and 12 and the investigators will compare its evolution between group 1 and 2. 3 scores will be calculated : psychosocial health summary score (average score of 15 items), physical health summary score (average score of 8 items) and the total score (average score of all items). Scores are between 0 and 100% and the higher scores indicate better Health-Related Quality of Life.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 0</time_frame>
    <description>With group 1 and 2, the investigators will calculate de prevalence of adolescent depression when a parent is depressed. Adolescent depression will be assessed by Adolescent Depression Rating Scale (ADRS). This scale is composed of 8 true (1)/false(0) questions. The score is the sum of all item. An adolescent is consider depressed when his score is higher than 4.</description>

    <description>With group 3, the investigators will calculate de prevalence of parental depression when a adolescent is depressed. Parental depression will be assessed by Hopkins Symptom Checklist (HSCL25). This scale is composed of 25 questions with 4 answers (1-4). The score is the average score of the 25 items. The parent is considered depressed when the score is higher or equal to 1.75.</description>

    <description>With the 3 groups, the investigators will isolate risk and protection factors for adolescent of depressed parents and for parents of depressed adolescents. Sociodemographics informations will be used and protective or risk factors may be highlighted from the study of some of the medico-psychological and social characteristics of families.</description>
