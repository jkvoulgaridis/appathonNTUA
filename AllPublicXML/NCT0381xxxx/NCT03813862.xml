  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Greater advances are needed in two separate but related areas in healthcare: 1) the Clinical
      Decision Support Systems that complement the EHR use in support of routine patient care,
      population management and disease management; and 2) the use of the point‐of‐care
      observational data from the provider‐patient encounter that support realworld medical
      research and healthcare quality measure assessment. Real‐world evaluations of treatments of
      chronic diseases in the context of comorbid conditions and special populations (minorities,
      women, mentally ill, and those with addiction) are limited. The purpose of the OPERA database
      is to help address this unmet need in clinical research.

      Objectives of OPERA

        1. To research numerous chronic diseases (HIV, HCV, HBV currently and IBD and RA in the
           near future, with others as identified for further consideration) utilizing the OPERA®
           longitudinal database that consists of de‐identified EHR data from numerous clinical
           practices in a variety of settings (e.g. solo practitioners, small groups, and
           hospitals). Research will be ongoing and yield numerous individual analyses and reports
           that are authored by epidemiologists, practicing physicians, pharmaco‐economists, and
           other researchers and will target scientific conferences and peer‐reviewed medical
           journals for dissemination.

        2. To use epidemiological, statistical, and data analysis methods and related research
           findings to deliver a sophisticated healthcare analytics reporting solution (CHORUS™) to
           clinicians.†

        3. To enhance patient population management as well as disease management capabilities of
           the practicing physician.

        4. To provide anonymous, nation‐wide benchmarking of quality measures and key performance
           indicators (KPI) for medical clinics.

        5. To enhance patient engagement with their physicians to deliver better health outcomes.

        6. To evaluate whether engagement in care by patients with their physicians results in
           better outcomes for patients with chronic illness.
