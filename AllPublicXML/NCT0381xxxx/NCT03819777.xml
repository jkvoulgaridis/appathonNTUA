  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim: to investigate the role of inflammation and auto-immunity in pulmonary arterial
      hypertension by using the profile of volatile organic compounds.

      Hypothesis: first, the investigators hypothesize that at time of diagnosis the VOC profiles
      will discriminate patients with PAH-CTD and idiopathic PAH (IPAH) from patients with systemic
      sclerosis or systemic lupus erythematosus (CTD) without PAH, supporting the contention that
      there is a overlapping inflammatory and auto-immune pathway in PAH. During follow-up, the
      investigators will measure the VOC profiles of patients in all three groups who will be
      treated according standard clinical care. The hypothesis is that VOC profiles are affected by
      therapy.

    <measure>Determining unique inflammatory VOC profiles in exhaled air in three groups of patients: IPAH, PAH-CTD and CTD without PAH.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 measurements in 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Exhaled air samples will be analyzed on inflammatory VOC profiles in the diagnostic phase of the study. Three measurements over a period of two weeks will be done. Statistically analysis will report one average VOC profile of the three measurements.
Procedure: the patient is asked to exhale via a sterile mask into the ReCIVA breath sampler (Owlstone Medical, Cambridge, UK) in which mixed total exhaled air is immediately trapped and stored onto stainless-steel two-bed sorption tubes, filled with carbograph 1TD/Carbopack X (Markes International, Wales, UK). The tubes will be analyzed with GC-TOF-MS for the presence of VOCs after which multivariate statistical analysis will be used to select those VOCs unique for the various patient groups.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Correlation between unique inflammatory VOCs to well-established biomarkers of immune activation and inflammation in PAH-CTD and idiopathic PAH.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 measurement at baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The correlation analysis by means of bivariate (Spearman correlation) and multivariate analysis (canonical correlation analysis) will be performed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change (Δ, delta) from baseline in selective inflammatory VOC profiles after 3, 6 and 12 months in all patients treated with PAH and/or immunsuppressive medication.</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes (Δ, delta) between baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Wilcoxon signed-rank test will be utilized to see if the individual, selective inflammatory VOCs after treatment significantly differ with the baseline measurements.</description>
