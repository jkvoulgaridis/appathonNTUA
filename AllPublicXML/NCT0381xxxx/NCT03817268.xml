  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common and lethal malignancies in Asia. For early
      (stage T1) GC, it has been found by analyzing surgical specimens that ~5% of cancers have
      lymph node metastasis. For patients with stage T2-3N0M0 GCs, there is a considerable
      probability of micro-metastasis. While the US National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN),
      the Japanese Gastric Cancer Association (JGCA), and the European Society for Medical Oncology
      (ESMO) guidelines recommend adjuvant therapy for most patients with resected &gt;T1N0 GCs, the
      recommendations vary regarding postsurgical treatment for patients with stage T1N+M0 or
      T2-3N0M0 disease. The JGCA guidelines do not recommend postsurgical chemotherapy for this
      patient population, while the ESMO support the adjuvant treatment. The NCCN has not offered a
      definitive recommendation on this issue. Through careful literature search, there is not yet
      randomized report on whether postsurgical chemotherapy benefits survival for patients with
      resected T1N+M0 or T2-3N0M0 GC. The first-line chemotherapy regimen for GC is fluorouracil
      plus platinum. Among fluorouracil, platinum is especially favored due to its less frequent
      and less severe adverse effects. This large multicenter phase III randomized controlled trial
      is led by Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui
      Medical University, and carried out in multiple Chinese centers, aiming to compare the safety
      and efficacy of capecitabine monotherapy versus no therapy in the adjuvant setting for
      patients with stage T1N+M0 or T2-3N0M0 GC undergoing R0 Resection.

    <description>Capecitabine is administered within 6 weeks after resection and after adequate recovery. To reduce the side effects and improve patient compliance, the administered dose is half of the recommendation: 625 mg/m2, bis in die (BID) (1250 mg/m2 per day). A 2-week therapy is followed by a 1-week pause, and a cycle includes 3 weeks. A total of 8 cycles is planned for each patient.</description>
