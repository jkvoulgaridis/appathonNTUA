    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that Super-Responders (SRe; defined as psoriasis
      participants who receive on-label guselkumab treatment until week 20 and respond with a
      Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score (PASI) = 0 at weeks 20 and 28) maintain control of
      disease until week 68 with prolonged treatment intervals of 16 weeks (guselkumab 100 mg every
      16 weeks).

    <measure>Group (2a and 2b): Percentage of Participants Who Achieve an Absolute Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) Score Less Than (&lt;) 3 at Week 68</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 68</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants who will achieve an absolute PASI Score &lt; 3 at Week 68 will be reported. In the PASI system, the body is divided into 4 regions: the head, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities. Each of these areas is assessed separately for the percentage (%) of the area involved, which translates to a numeric score that ranges from 0 (indicates no involvement) to 6 (90%-100% involvement), and for erythema, induration, and scaling, which are each rated on a scale of 0 to 4. The PASI produces a numeric score that could range from 0 (no psoriasis) to 72. A higher score indicates more severe disease.</description>

PASI is a system used for assessing and grading the severity of psoriatic lesions and their response to therapy. In PASI system, body is divided into 4 regions: head, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities.

The PASI produces a numeric score that could range from 0 (no psoriasis) to 72. A higher score indicates more severe disease. PASI 75/90/100 responders are defined as participants with &gt;= 75%, &gt;= 90%, 100% improvement in PASI respectively from baseline at week 28.</description>

    <measure>Group (1, 2a, 2b, and 2c): Change from Baseline (Week 0) in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0), Week 28 and Week 68</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline (Week 0) in DLQI score at weeks 28 and 68 will be reported. The DLQI is a dermatology-specific quality of life (QoL) instrument designed to assess the impact of the disease on a participant's QoL. It is a 10-item questionnaire that, in addition to evaluating overall QoL, can be used to assess six different aspects that may affect QoL: 1) symptoms and feelings, 2) daily activities, 3) leisure, 4) work or school performance, 5) personal relationships, and 6) treatment. DLQI is calculated by summing the score of all questions in questionnaire to measure the impact of psoriasis on the quality of life of a participant. Each question is scored from 0 to 3, giving a possible score range from 0 (no impact of skin disease on QoL) to 30 (maximum impact on QoL).</description>

    <description>Change from baseline in NAPPA-QOL at Weeks 28, 68, and 116 will be reported. The NAPPA is an instrument for assessing clinical and patient-reported outcomes in nail psoriasis. NAPPA-QOL is a 20-item nail-specific QoL questionnaire covering past week. Signs, stigma and everyday life are rated on a 5-point scale, ranges from 0 (no suffering) to 4 (high suffering). A global score is computed by averaging all items. A decrease in NAPPA QoL score indicates improvement.</description>

    <description>Change from baseline in NAPPA-PBI at Weeks 28, 68, and 116 will be reported. The NAPPA is an instrument for assessing clinical and patient-reported outcomes in nail psoriasis. NAPPA-PBI is a 24-item questionnaire to assess participant-defined needs before and participant-rated benefits after treatment. The answers are given on a scale from 0 to 4, and a global score is calculated as follows: Each benefit item is multiplied with the respective importance item, and the product is divided by the sum of all importance items. The results are summed up over all items. The resulting global score ranges from 0 (no benefit) to 4 (highest possible benefit).</description>

    <description>Change from baseline (Week 0) in the signs and symptoms aggregate scores of the PSSD at Weeks 28, 68 and 116 will be reported. The PSSD is a questionnaire designed to measure the severity of psoriasis symptoms and signs for the assessment of treatment benefit. The PSSD is a participant self-administered outcomes instrument that includes 11 items covering symptoms (itch, pain, stinging, burning and skin tightness) and participant observable signs (skin dryness, cracking, scaling, shedding or flaking, redness and bleeding) using 0 to 10 numerical rating scales for severity. Two sub scores each ranging from 0 to 100 will be derived: the psoriasis symptom score and the psoriasis sign score. A higher score indicates more severe disease. A change of &gt;= 40 points in PSSD symptom score or sign score, and a &gt;= 3-point change in individual PSSD item scale scores will be defined as clinically meaningful change (response). In this study, the 7-day-version of the PSSD will be used.</description>

    <measure>Group 1, 2a, 2b and 2c: Relationship Between Trough Serum Concentration and Efficacy or Serum Biomarker Level</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 80</time_frame>
    <description>The potential association between trough serum guselkumab concentration and efficacy or serum biomarker level will be analyzed by immunoassays. For the analyses the trough serum guselkumab concentration will be set into relation with the efficacy (e.g. PASI response) or with serum biomarker (e.g. serum IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-22) concentration. Guselkumab and all biomarker concentrations will be measured in the unit of picogram/milliliter (pg/mL). In the PASI system, the body is divided into 4 regions: the head, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities. Each of these areas is assessed separately for the percentage of the area involved, which translates to a numeric score that ranges from 0 (indicates no involvement) to 6 (90%-100% involvement), and for erythema, induration, and scaling, which are each rated on a scale of 0 to 4. The PASI produces a numeric score that could range from 0 (no psoriasis) to 72. A higher score indicates more severe disease.</description>

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant administered a medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product. An AE does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment.
