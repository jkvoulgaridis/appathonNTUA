      This single-arm, Phase II clinical trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      nab-paclitaxel plus S-1 in locally advanced pancreatic cancer who were borderline resectable
      or unresectable . Nab-paclitaxel was administered at 125mg/m2 intravenously on day 1 and 8,
      S-1 （80, 100, or 120 mg/d according to body-surface area on days 1 through 14 of a 21-day
      cycle for 4-6 cycles.

      During the study, if the subject's weight change was ≤10% from baseline, the dose was
      calculated based on the measured value at baseline. If the change was &gt;10%, the body surface
      area of the subject should be recalculated and the dose administered should be adjusted. .

      Study treatment period Borderline resectable: According to the results of imaging
      examination, MDT discussed to determine the surgical resectability and timing of surgery. The
      chemotherapy time was 4-6 cycles.

      Unresectable: Chemotherapy for up to 6 cycles. According to the results of imaging
      examination, MDT determined the resectability of the operation. It was decided by the
      investigator and the patient to continue chemotherapy (S-1 maintenance), surgery or
      radiotherapy.
