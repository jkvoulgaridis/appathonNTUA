  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Backgroung:Regional anesthesia in breast surgery is of paramount importance to reduce pain in
      perioperative period.

      PECS II block is an interfascial block that has been used widely as regional anesthesia
      technique in breast surgery.

      ESP block is a novel interfascial block proposed in 2016 by Forero. Several reports used this
      technique in breast surgery to provide analgesia but to date no studies comparing these
      technique exists.

      Our hypotesis is that this two technique are equally able to provide analgesia in breast
      surgery.

      Study type: RCT, single blind.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a single-centre, prospective; double blinded randomised interventional clinical trial.
Patients will be randomly allocated to group &quot;PECS&quot; or &quot;ESP&quot; using a closed envelope technique.
Group &quot;PECS&quot; will receive PECS II block as described by Blanco using 30 ml Levobupivacaine 0.25% Group &quot;ESP&quot; will receive ESP block as described by forero using 30 ml Levobupivacaine 0.25% at T5 level.
Blocks will be executed after general anesthesia induction. All partecipants will receive Fentanyl 2 mcg/kg and Propofol 2 mg/kg for induction. Anesthesia will be mantained with Propofol to obtain a BIS level between 40-50. Patients will receive Fentanyl 33 mcg whenever blood pressure and/or hear rate raise more than 20% from baseline after surgical stimulation. At the end of the surgery patients will receive acetominophen 1 g. postoperative therapy: acetominophen 1g/8hr and ketoprofen 100 mg/12hr.
Patients will receive 2 mg Morphine whenever a NRS &gt; 3.</intervention_model_description>
