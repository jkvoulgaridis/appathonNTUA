  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to examine blood levels of ASTX727, a fixed-dose combination tablet
      containing the combination of cedazuridine (100 mg) and decitabine (35 mg), when given under
      fed versus fasted conditions to participants with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), including
      refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia
      (CMML), or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This study will also assess the safety of ASTX727.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b, multicenter, open-label, randomized, two-sequence, crossover study of
      ASTX727 in participants with MDS, including refractory anemia with excess blasts in
      transformation or CMML, and AML. Participants will continue to be enrolled until evaluable
      data is collected from 12 participants. It is expected that approximately 18 participants
      will be enrolled in total.

      This study will be conducted in 28-day cycles. All participants will take part in Cycle 1 and
      may continue into Cycles ≥2 at the investigator's discretion. Participants will receive one
      tablet of ASTX727 containing 100 mg cedazuridine and 35 mg decitabine once daily for 5 days
      in 28-day cycles starting from Cycle 1 Day 1.

      Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive high-calorie, high-fat breakfast
      meal pre-dose on either Day 2 or Day 4 of Cycle 1. Blood will be drawn at specified time
      points in Cycle 1 on Days 2 through 5 to assess the effect of food on the PK of cedazuridine
      and decitabine.

      After completion of the first treatment cycle, participants may continue to receive treatment
      with ASTX727 at the investigator's discretion for subsequent cycles (Days 1 through 5 of
      28-day cycles), until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, investigator decision to
      discontinue treatment, or the participant decides to discontinue treatment or withdraw from
      the study. In Cycles ≥2, participants will fast for 2 hours before and 2 hours after taking
      the ASTX727 tablet on all dosing days.
