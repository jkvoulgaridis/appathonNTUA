  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of respiratory polygraphy (RP) in children for the diagnosis of obstructive sleep
      apnea hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) can be challenging: device acceptance, sensors displacement.
      The automatic analysis of respiratory events has never been evaluated in a pediatric
      population. The primary objective of this study was to determine the feasibility of pediatric
      RP in an ENT department routine practice. The second objective was to evaluate the
      reliability of the automatic signal analysis in children.

      Retrospective single center study of 50 children (32 boys and 18 girls, mean age 5.5 Â± 2.3
      years) who benefited from an overnight RP in an ENT hospitalization department between
      January and August 2016 for OSAS suspicion. Manual detection of respiratory events was
      performed by the same ENT specialist, and compared to the automatic analysis.
