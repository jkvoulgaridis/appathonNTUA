  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, reactogenicity and immune responses of two
      doses of the investigational RSV vaccines (with different formulations), when administered
      intramuscularly (IM) according to a 0, 2 month schedule, in older adults aged 60 to 80 years.

      As the investigational vaccines have not yet been tested in humans before, the study will
      first assess the safety, reactogenicity and immune responses in young adults aged 18 to 40
      years. The study will thus be conducted in 2 parts (Part A and Part B).

    <description>Assessed solicited local symptoms include pain, redness and swelling, at the injection site. Any pain = pain neither interfering with nor preventing normal every day activities. Any redness/swelling = redness/swelling higher than (&gt;) 20 millimeters (mm), but lower than and equal to (≤) 50 mm surface diameter.</description>

          -  Written informed consent obtained from the subject prior to performing any study
             specific procedure.

        For Part A:

        • A male or female between, and including, 18 and 40 years of age at the time of the first
        vaccination.

        For Part B:

          -  A male or female between, and including, 60 and 80 years of age at the time of the
             first vaccination.

          -  Subjects with residence status allowing free mixing with general community or in an
             assisted-living facility that provides minimal assistance, such that the subject is
             primarily responsible for self-care and activities of daily living.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        For all subjects:

          -  Use of any investigational or non-registered product other than the study vaccine
             during the period starting 30 days before the first dose of study vaccine, or planned
             use during the study period.

          -  Any medical condition that in the judgment of the investigator would make IM injection
             unsafe.

          -  Chronic administration of immunosuppressants or other immune-modifying drugs during
             the period starting 6 months prior to the first vaccine dose. For corticosteroids,
             this will mean prednisone (≥ 20 mg/day, or equivalent). Inhaled and topical steroids
             are allowed.

          -  Administration of long-acting immune-modifying drugs or planned administration at any
             time during the study period.

          -  Planned administration/administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol
             in the period starting 30 days before the first dose and ending 30 days after the last
             dose of study vaccine administration, with the exception of inactivated and subunit
             influenza vaccines which can be administered up to 14 days before or from 30 days
             after each study vaccination.

          -  Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study
             period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a
             non-investigational vaccine/product.

          -  Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on
             medical history and physical examination.

          -  History of any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component
             of the vaccine.

          -  Hypersensitivity to latex.

          -  Serious or unstable chronic illness. Patients with chronic stable conditions with or
             without specific treatment, such as diabetes, hypertension or cardiac disease, are
             allowed to participate in this study.

          -  Any other condition (e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or severe respiratory
             condition) that, in the opinion of the investigator, might interfere with the
             evaluations required by the study.

          -  History of any neurological disorders or seizures.

          -  Acute disease and/or fever at the time of enrolment.

          -  Hepatomegaly, right upper quadrant abdominal pain or tenderness.

          -  Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products during the period starting

          -  History of chronic alcohol consumption and/or drug abuse as deemed by the investigator
             to render the potential subject unable/unlikely to provide accurate safety reports.

          -  Significant underlying illness that in the opinion of the investigator would be
             expected to prevent completion of the study.

          -  At screening: Hematology parameters (complete blood cell count [red blood cells, white
             blood cells], white blood cells differential count [lymphocytes, neutrophils and
             eosinophils], platelets count or hemoglobin level) and/or biochemistry parameters
             (creatinine, blood urea nitrogen or liver enzymes [alanine aminotransferase or
             aspartate aminotransferase]) outside the normal laboratory ranges, unless the
             laboratory abnormalities are considered not clinically significant by the
             investigator.

        For Part A:

          -  Pregnant or lactating female.

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential, except if the subject:

               -  has practiced adequate contraception for 30 days prior to vaccination, and

               -  has a negative pregnancy test on the day of vaccination, and

               -  has agreed to continue adequate contraception during the entire treatment period
                  and for 2 months after completion of the vaccination series.

        For Part B:

          -  Known previous administration of a vaccine containing MPL, QS-21 and/or MF59 (e.g. GSK
             Biologicals' vaccine against human papillomavirus infection marketed as Cervarix, GSK
             Biologicals' Herpes Zoster vaccine marketed as Shingrix, an adjuvanted recombinant
             varicella zoster virus envelope gE subunit vaccine [HZ/su], or MF59 adjuvanted
             influenza vaccines [e.g. Fluad]).

          -  Planned administration of GSK Biologicals' Herpes Zoster vaccine marketed as Shingrix
             or an adjuvanted recombinant varicella zoster virus envelope gE subunit vaccine
