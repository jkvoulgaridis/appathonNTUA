  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Taxane neuropathy is a common and long-term side effect of long-term morbidity in patients
      surviving cancer. No preventive or symptomatic treatment has been shown to be effective. Its
      pathophysiology is poorly known and probably multifactorial. A possible mechanism would be
      mediated by the activation of the SK3 calcium channel: a retrospective study carried out at
      the University Hospital of Tours (Carina RUA) found a significant association between the
      number of CAG triplets in the KCNN3 gene coding for the SK3 channel and the appearance of a
      taxane neuropathy.

      Patients hospitalized in medical oncology day hospital at the University Hospital of Tours or
      CHC oncology day hospital, for their chemotherapy with taxanes (paclitaxel or docetaxel) for
      breast or prostate cancer, will be offered the study.

      The mode of administration of chemotherapy and the usual follow-up will not be modified by
      the protocol The determination of the SK3 status will be made from an additional tube
      collected during a collection as part of the treatment at the first arrival in a day hospital
      (no more blood tests). Blood sample of 7mL. Shipments and analyzes of samples in Tours in the
      pharmacogenetics laboratory under the responsibility of Dr. BARIN-LE GUELLEC.

      This study is non-invasive, without impact on the therapeutic management. The result of the
      polymorphism of SK3 will not be indicated in the record, so as not to influence the follow-up
      of the treatment and to allow an evaluation of the occurrence of peripheral neuropathy in
      blindness of the number of repetitions of the CAG triplet of the KCNN3 gene.
