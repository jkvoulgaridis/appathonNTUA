  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Persistent pain and chronic fatigue are very common complaints in rheumatoid arthritis (RA)
      patients, whatever the anti-inflammatory treatment response. Interestingly, pain remaining
      despite good clinical response was associated with high disability and low inflammation at
      baseline, suggesting a mechanism of pain independent of inflammation in these patients. Such
      patients, with discordantly high patient-reported DAS28 components, fatigue and mood
      disturbance might represent a subgroup of RA patients who have specific clinical needs, not
      resolved by classical conventional or biologic DMARDs. In this way, neuropathic pain and pain
      sensitization have been demonstrated in 20 to 30% of RA patients, neuropathic pain scores
      being associated with worsen disease activity scores. Thus, pain sensitization may contribute
      to amplification of pain in active RA, and should be responsible for persisting pain and
      fatigue even after inflammation has resolved.

      Pain sensitization is associated with neuroplastic changes in sensory pathways at peripheral
      and central levels. Interestingly, major mediators responsible for this neuroplasticity
      operate via a JAK/STAT signaling pathway, which is specifically targeted by new RA
      treatments. New drug targeting JAK/STAT signalling pathway have been recently designed for RA
      treatment, based on the implication of this pathway on the signaling of various cytokines
      implicated in the pathophysiology of RA, such as IL-6, IL-12, IL-23 and IFNs. Two
      Jak-inhibitors have been put on the market: Tofacitinib and Baricitinib. In randomized
      clinical trials, Tofacitinib have shown a remarkable efficacy on pain and other patient
      reported outcomes, suggesting a specific effect or jak-inhibitors on pain control. Recent
      data suggest that Jak-inhibitors could have a direct effect on sensory neurons.
