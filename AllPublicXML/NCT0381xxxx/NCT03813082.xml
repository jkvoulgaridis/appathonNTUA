  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A sleep deprivation protocol combined with state-of-the-art, simultaneous positron emission
      tomography and magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging will be employed to investigate the
      effects of sleep deprivation and aging on hypothesized molecular markers of sleep need.

    <description>Young study participants will complete four nights in the sleep laboratory, whereas they will stay awake during one night. PET brain imaging will be conducted at the same circadian time on three consecutive afternoons (prior, during and after prolonged wakefulness). Additionally, validated tests of vigilance and cognitive performance will be administered and the brain waves will be recorded in wakefulness and sleep.</description>
