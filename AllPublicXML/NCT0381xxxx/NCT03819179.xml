      To evaluate whether personal care products shift the skin microbiome bacteria and diversity
      after a week of daily use.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Studies have shown that microbiome is important in skin conditions such as eczema, rosacea,
      acne, and many other skin conditions. Personal care products are widely used on a daily basis
      but it is not know how these personal care products shift the skin's microbiome. The
      diversity of the skin microbiome is important in the maintenance of skin equilibrium as a
      loss of diversity predisposes to development of skin disease.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate multiple over the counter products that are used on the
      face daily to assess how they alter skin microbiome and diversity of microflora on skin after
      a week of daily treatment.

      A second aim of the study is to assess how baseline diversity of microbiome are different
      based on self-graded skin types.

    <description>Cotton swabs will be used to collect sample skin microbiome bacteria from the cheeks and forehead at baseline and 1 week after daily use of the intervention product. These samples will be analysed and the relative components of the microbiome will be a primary outcome.The collected measurement data will be based on a number of operational taxonomic unit (OTU).</description>

    <description>Types are based on the Fitzpatrick Skin Type Questionnaire, which assesses various items on Genetic Disposition, Reaction to Sun Exposure, and Tanning Habits on a score from 0-4. Skin type I corresponds to a total score of 0-7. Skin type II corresponds to a total score of 8-16. Skin type III corresponds to a total score of 17-25. Skin type IV corresponds to a total score of 25-30. Skin type V-VI correspond to a total score of over 30.</description>
