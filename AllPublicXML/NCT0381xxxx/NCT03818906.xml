  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to evaluate the effect of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) on the
      reduction of swelling and postoperative pain in lower molar extraction procedures. This is a
      clinical study approved by the Research Ethics Committee, which will be performed in 40
      patients between 20 and 60 years. Patients included in the study should have at least one
      lower molar (first or second molar) with indication of exodontia. Participants will follow
      the exclusion criteria: pregnant or breastfeeding women; patients with obesity (Body Mass
      Index - BMI); make use of any activity smokers and ex smoker to 6 months; diabetics;
      immunosuppressed; in osteoporosis; making use of antimicrobials in the last 3 months; making
      use of medications that interfere with bone remodeling; with cysts or tumors in place.
      Surgical procedures that exceeded the clinical time of 30 minutes and / or required opening
      of the flap or osteotomy were excluded from the study. After the sample calculation, forty
      patients will be involved in this project, where forty molars (first and second molars) will
      be extracted in the mandible, which will be randomly divided into 4 groups. The control group
      (C.G), will contain 10 patients, where 10 molars will be extracted in a conventional way,
      without any additional treatment to be done. Test group 1 (T.G1) will contain 10 patients
      where 10 molars will be extracted and immediately after extraction, the fresh sockets will
      receive in their inner portion a local application of aPDT. The test group 2 (T.G2) will
      present 10 patients, where 10 molars will be extracted that immediately after the exodontia,
      the fresh socket will receive local application of infrared in the outer vestibular portion.
      Finally, Test Group 3 (T.G3), will be composed of 10 patients, where 10 molars will be
      extracted, joining the approaches of the previous groups (aPDT + infrared). Pain intensity
      will be assessed through a visual analogue scale and swelling assessed by measuring a
      perimeter between the tragus, the base of the jaw and the commissure of the lips. The data
      will be collected in four moments: before the surgery, 72 hours, 7 days and 30 days
      postoperatively.
