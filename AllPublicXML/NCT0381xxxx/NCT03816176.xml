      Screening and enrollment are temporarily on hold due to COVID-19.

      Treatment will begin on Day 1 and then participants will be followed for 60 days post-last
      dose for safety. Treatment will be administered until the participant has a successful
      outcome or for a maximum duration of 84 days (IA) or 180 days (IM), whichever occurs first.

      Participants will receive a loading regimen of isavuconazonium sulfate (via intravenous or
      oral administration at the investigator's discretion), which consists of a dose every 8 hours
      (± 2 hours) on Days 1 and 2 (for a total of 6 doses), followed by once daily maintenance
      dosing for up to 84 days (IA) or 180 days (IM) of dosing. The first maintenance dose should
      start 12 to 24 hours after the administration of the last loading dose. Subsequent
      maintenance doses will be administered once daily (24 hours ± 2 hours from the previous
      maintenance dose). The oral formulation can only be given to subjects 6 years to &lt; 18 years
      of age and with a body weight of at least 12 kg. Subjects who are discharged from the
      hospital with oral capsules for at-home administration must return weekly for study drug
      accountability and to receive new oral dosing supplies. Subjects who begin oral
      administration are to complete the oral dosing acceptability assessment after ingesting their
      first oral dose.

An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.</description>

               -  Note: Prior use of prophylactic antifungal therapy is acceptable. In case of
                  breakthrough IA while on prophylactic mould-active azole class drugs, additional
                  documentation will be required to be submitted to the sponsor medical monitor or
                  designee to approve subject enrollment

          -  Subject has known history of allergy, hypersensitivity or any serious reaction to any
             of the azole class antifungals, or any components of the study drug formulation

          -  Subject is unlikely to survive 30 days

          -  Subject has received investigational drug, with the exception of oncology drug trials,
             or trials with investigational drugs treating graft versus host disease, within 28
             days or five half-lives, whichever is longer, prior to screening
