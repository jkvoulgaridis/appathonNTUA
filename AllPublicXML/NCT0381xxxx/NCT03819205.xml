  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral palsy (CP) is defined as a non-progressive lesion of the immature brain. Children
      with CP may present with a variety of motor impairments.

      The impaired upper limb function of children with cerebral palsy (CP) limits and restricts
      participation in activities of daily living.

      Kinesio Taping (KT) is commonly used in sport injuries, in neurology and oncology patients
      following the surgical protocols, and for pediatric rehabilitation to reduce pain, facilitate
      or inhibit muscle activity, prevent injuries, reposition joints, aid the lymphatic system,
      support postural alignment, and improve proprioception. Kinesiotaping is a treatment that has
      not been studied much and can be applied in cerebral palsy. The tapes were grouped as elastic
      and rigid. In fact, there has been a few studies that investigates the effect of upper
      extremity elastic kinesiotaping. High methodological studies about its efficacy in this
      population are rare.

      34 Children with cerebral palsy aged between 6-18 applied to Dokuz Eylül Üniversity Medical
      School Hospital Physical Medicine ve Rehabilitation Department will be included the study.
      Patients have diagnosed as CP with the subgroup of diplegic, hemiplegic, tetraplegic and
      mixt. The upper extremity side will be chosen as the affected side for the hemiplegic CP's
      and for diplegic, tetraplegic CP's the side of upper extremity which children have been used
      to but have obstacles in daily life. The chosen upper extremity side will be taped with the
      functional correction technique on the dorsum of the hand and forearm by clinician. Patients
      will be taped at least 2-3 hours a day every day and they will be also recomended dealing
      with the grasping and releasing activities in daily living at about 2-3 hours a day. In a way
      that every patient has to be the control of themselves, 1 week before kinesiotaping,
      immediately after kinesiotaping and 1 week after the period of kinesiotaping patients will be
      evaluated with box and block test, nine hole peg test, modified house clasification score and
      the active/passive wrist dorsiflexion range of motion. The investigator will also note the
      gross motor function clasification system level, dominant hand side and affected side, for
      chosen upper extremity side's zancolli clasification, modified aschwort scale of wrist and
      hand fingers, manual ability clasification system level for every patient.
