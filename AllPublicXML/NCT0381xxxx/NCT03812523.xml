        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has a diagnosis of invasive colorectal cancer, locally advanced or advanced,
             requiring oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy for treatment.

          -  Subject has agreed to receive treatment at Cancer Treatment Centers of America,
             Southeastern Regional Medical Center.

          -  Subject is Male or Female

          -  Subject is 18 years of age or older.

          -  Subject is a patient who reports neurotoxicity symptom grade 2 or more according CTCAE
             criteria to his or her medical oncologist following one or more cycles of
             oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy treatment.

          -  Subject is a patient who is capable and accepting of completing study questionnaires
             at each data collection point.

          -  Subject has adequate English fluency for completion of data collection. The surveys
             were designed and validated in English and are not currently available in other
             languages. Translation of questionnaires into other languages would require
             reestablishing the reliability and validity of these measures. Therefore, participants

             duration of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who have previously been exposed to neurotoxic agents including pyridoxine
             (&gt;100 mg/day), colchicine, allopurinol, or phenytoin;

          -  Subjects with pre-existing comorbidities, such as: diabetes, uremia, significant
             peripheral vascular disease, HIV, or progressive or degenerative neurologic disorders
             (e.g., multiple sclerosis, B12 deficiency); cardiovascular valve disease, history of
             cardiovascular event,

          -  Subjects with a history of lumbosacral laminectomy or radiculopathy;

          -  Subjects who have been prescribed and taken gabapentin, pregabalin, or duloxetine
             currently or within the last 1 months)

          -  Subjects who have established or suspected family history of inherited neuropathy.

          -  Subjects unable to swallow indicated medication

          -  Subjects in general with a medical condition, laboratory finding, or physical exam
             finding that precludes participation

          -  Subject weight of â‰¥350 lbs.

          -  Subjects who currently use disallowed concomitant medications

          -  Subjects with any form of cardiac implants

          -  Subjects with known allergic reactions to components of the study product(s)

          -  Subjects receiving treatment with another investigational drug or other intervention

          -  Subjects with a history of or current tobacco or illegal substance use

             (dementia/delirium, retardation, active psychosis) that in the judgment of the
             investigators would preclude providing informed consent and study participation.
