  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pelvic ring fractures in the geriatric population are a rising problem for surgeons in
      industrialized countries. Many of these low-energy fractures are treated nonoperatively;
      however, pain is a significant factor in recovery of these patients and often inhibits their
      ability to mobilize. Most of these fractures are lateral compression type 1 injuries which
      are defined as an impaction to the sacrum with varying amounts of anterior/pubic root/rami
      fractures. Many of these patients in the geriatric population suffer from osteoporosis and
      the injuries are often sustained from a low-energy mechanism like a fall. The tenet of
      treatment for all osteoporotic fractures is early mobilization. It is well known that
      extended periods of bed rest will lead to pneumonia, decubitus ulceration, deep venous
      thrombosis, and, in the case of the pelvis, not prevent subsequent deformity. Calcitonin is a
      polypeptide containing 32 amino acids, and it plays a role in the regulation of bone
      metabolism as a hormone that prevents bone resorption. Intranasal salmon calcitonin (ISC) has
      been demonstrated to decrease pain and improve the level of activity in patients with acute
      vertebral osteoporotic compression fractures when administered within the first 5 days of
      onset of pain/injury. It has also demonstrated an immediate post analgesic effect in
      osteoporotic distal radius fractures treated nonoperatively. The antihyperalgesic action of
      calcitonin appears to be mediated by serotonin receptors. The purpose of this study is to
      evaluate the analgesic effect of ISC on geriatric patients with pelvic ring injuries who are
      treated nonoperatively.
