  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether aerobic exercise improves the
      participant's ability to recover function in the arm and leg affected by the participant's
      stroke. The investigators are also calculating the cost effectiveness of the rehabilitation
      interventions.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aims of the study are to determine the clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of
      combining aerobic exercise training with upper extremity motor task practice to improve motor
      recovery following stroke. It is hypothesized that the neurophysiologic impact of aerobic
      exercise may augment motor recovery associated with motor task practice. To test this
      hypothesize, 60 individuals with chronic stroke will be recruited to participate in this
      randomized clinical trial. Following screening and informed consent, all participants will
      undergo an exercise stress test to determine response to maximal exertion. Following the
      stress test, baseline clinical assessments will be obtained to quantify upper extremity
      function, gait, endurance, and self-reported quality of life. Additionally, variables to
      determine degree of disability will be obtained. Individuals will be randomized to one of two
      interventions: 45 min of forced-rate aerobic exercise paired with 45 min of upper limb
      repetitive task practice or two back-to-back 45-minute sessions of upper limb repetitive task
      practice. The interventions will occur 3 times per week for 8 weeks. Outcomes assessing motor
      function and disability will be repeated at mid-treatment, end of treatment, and at 4 weeks,
      6-months and 12-months following end of treatment.

    <measure>Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS-29)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>A self-reported questionnaire evaluating physical, mental, and social health. T-scores are reported separately for Anxiety, Depression, Fatigue, Sleep Disturbance, Ability to Participate in Social Roles and Activities, Physical Function, and Pain Interference.
A score of 40 is one standard deviation lower than the mean of the reference population.
A score of 60 is one standard deviation higher than the mean of the reference population.
For PROMIS measures, higher scores equals more of the concept being measured (e.g., more Fatigue, more Physical Function). Thus a score of 60 is one standard deviation above the average referenced population. This could be a desirable or undesirable outcome, depending upon the concept being measured.</description>
