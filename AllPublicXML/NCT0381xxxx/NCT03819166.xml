  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Application of deep touch pressure (DTP) has been suggested to provide positive effects on
      anxiety modulation. However, empirical and theoretical evidence linked to the clinical
      effects of DTP is relatively rare in the behavioral and physiological aspects. The aim of
      this intervention trial study designs to investigate the effect of DTP in dental treatment by
      quantitative analysis of behavioral assessments and physiological measurements, including the
      electrodermal activity and heart rate variability, were conducted to understand the
      modulation of the autonomic nervous system (ANS), the orchestration of sympathetic (SNS) and
      parasympathetic (PsNS) nervous systems.

      The subjects were recruited through word-of-mouth and by posted sign-up from the Department
      of Dentistry, National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH), Taiwan. Informed consent was
      obtained prior to participation. The study protocol was approved by the Human Research Ethics
      Committee of NTUH. Before the testing, the experimental protocol was explained to the
      subjects. The subjects with normal overnight sleep quality were recruited to prevent the
      influences in both physiological and physical fatigue. All potential subjects receive
      independent examinations by an occupational therapist and a dentist to determine the
      eligibility for inclusion as well as were blind to the study hypotheses. Both electrodermal
      activity (EDA) and heart rate variability (HRV) were recorded continually through the entire
      testing procedures. Since the EDA and HRV are sensitive indicators for autonomic nervous
      system modulation, a standardization procedure that ensures the integrity of data is
      accessed. The power of the testing is preset at 0.80, and the significant level is 0.05. The
      quasi-experimental design of clinical trial for repeated measures will be used.
