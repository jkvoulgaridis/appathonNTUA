      The ForConti Contix Fecal Incontinence Management System (FIMS) is indicated for the
      management of accidental bowel leakage due to bowel incontinence. The ForConti Contix FIMS is
      designed to seal and help prevent the involuntary leakage of stool, liquids and gases from
      the rectum. ForConti Contix FIMS is for an individual with fecal incontinence that has
      impaired quality of life, is responsive and mentally capable to participate in their own
      treatment.

      This study is designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the ForConti Contix FIMS
      for its intended use utilizing a baseline period of 2 weeks followed by an on-device period
      of using the device for 4 weeks and completed with a followup period of 2 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatments for bowel incontinence depend on the cause and severity of the condition. Often
      more than one modality is used to treat the condition, beginning with conservative options
      such as adult diapers and pads, medication, biofeedback and anal plugs/balloons and moving on
      to invasive procedures (i.e. nerve stimulators, restorative surgery, colostomy) where
      conservative treatment isn't effective.

      The main reason for potential pain and discomfort with the current available anal plugs is
      the plug location within the anus below the dentate line. This part of the anus, which is
      highly sensitive, may cause discomfort and pain to some users. The advantage of the ForConti
      Contix Fecal Incontinence Management System (FIMS) is that it is designed to be located in an
      inner section of the rectum, above the dentate line, and therefore less sensitive and less
      likely to cause discomfort or pain to the user.

      This study is a prospective, non-randomized, single-arm, self-controlled clinical
      investigation designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the ForConti Contix FIMS.
      Total duration of the study for each patient will be 8 weeks, including follow-up.

      This multi center study will be conducted on 10-20 patients (per site) suffering from
      accidental bowel leakage due to bowel incontinence and who meet all of the inclusion criteria
      and none of the exclusion criteria.

      The ForConti Contix FIMS includes 2 main parts: the inserted part and the insertion system.
      The inserted part includes a balloon and a pulling string, and the insertion system includes
      the applicator and the inflation kit. The balloon is a soft flexible biocompatible,
      component. It is designed to be located in the rectum by an applicator and to be filled with
      a pre-determined amount of air to gain its final shape.
