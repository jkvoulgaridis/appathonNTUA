  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study involves patients who are already planning to have deep brain stimulation (DBS)
      surgery to treat the symptoms of severe Parkinson's Disease (PD). The study has two goals:

        1. to evaluate the effectiveness of implanting DBS electrodes in the two most common
           locations for DBS (subthalamic nucleus (STN), and globus pallidus interna (GPi)),
           instead of just one electrode, on each side of the brain; and

        2. to develop an adaptive DBS system using brain signals measured from these two
           electrodes.

      The purpose of this study is a small, first in man, clinical feasibility trial for patients
      with severe Parkinson's Disease (PD), who are already clinically eligible for deep brain
      stimulation (DBS) with two goals:

        1. to compare efficacy from two common sites of DBS (subthalamic nucleus (STN), and globus
           pallidus interna (GPi)) through the implantation of dual DBS electrodes on each side of
           the brain; and

        2. to develop a closed loop DBS system using evoked and spontaneous potentials derived from
           these two electrodes.

      The study will involve bilateral dual DBS electrode placement in clinically standard
      locations (ie, STN and GPi) unilaterally or (more often) bilaterally, the placement of the
      RC+S Medtronic research implantable pulse generator (IPG), and a commitment to return for
      both extensive postoperative programming and testing to define clinical efficacy and separate
      research days to develop the closed loop approach. In addition, patients will undergo
      intraoperative research using temporary percutaneous extensions to the DBS electrode(s) and
      DBS lead cannula after implantation to confirm the electrode location and to identify what
      the signals will look like during later chronic recordings through the research IPG.

      The research RC+S IPG includes both ordinary DBS stimulation as well as a recording system
      that simultaneously measures the DBS local evoked potential (DLEP) and/or local field
      potential (LFP) responses from either the same or a second DBS electrode.

The UPDRS is a scale to measure the degree of a patient's disability due to Parkinson's Disease. The scores from four subscales (1. Mentation, Behavior and Mood, 2. Activities of Daily Living, 3. Motor Examination, and 4. Complications of Therapy) are summed to determine the total UPDRS score. Total scores range from 0 (no disability) to 199 (total disability).</description>

    <description>The PDQ-39 is a 39-item self-reporting questionnaire to assess the impact of Parkinson's Disease on quality of life. The PDQ-39 is divided into 8 dimensions (1. Mobility, 2. Activities of Daily Life, 3. Emotional Well-being, 4. Stigma, 5. Social Support, 6. Cognition, 7. Communication, and 8. Bodily Discomfort). The total score is the sum of the dimension total scores divided by 8. Scores range from 0 (better quality of life) to 100 (worse quality of life).</description>
