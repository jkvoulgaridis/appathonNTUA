  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Iron deficiency and anemia are clearly associated with the onset of allergy and allergic
      diseases, whereas an improved iron status seems to prevent the onset of allergy in humans.
      Iron-deficiency can be absolute or functional. Functional iron-deficiency occurs during
      immune activation and may be reflective for the hyperactive state of atopic subjects.

      The investigators plan a prophylactic dietary intervention study in atopic/allergic and
      non-allergic individuals that transport chelated iron to immune cells. Over the course of six
      months, oral supplementation of placebo or whey protein-bound chelated iron will be given and
      1) clinical reactivity 2) iron status and 3) changes in the microflora due to the treatment
      will be assessed.

    <textblock>
      There is no state-of-the-art prophylactic treatment for atopy. Once allergy develops,
      allergens should be avoided, and specific allergen immunotherapy applied. The initial cause
      of the onset of allergy, namely the immune hyperactive state of the atopic subjects, is not
      addressed at all. The investigators hypothesize that atopy is defined by a mild functional
      iron deficiency and that improving the iron status of immune cells will decrease the
      reactivity of these cells.

      In this prophylactic dietary intervention study oral supplementation of placebo or chelated
      and whey protein-bound iron will be given over the course of six months to allergic and
      non-allergic women. Changes in 1) the clinical reactivity 2) the iron status and 3) the
      microflora will be assessed. The study will be the first systematic approach in humans to
      assess the contribution of iron deficiency to allergy and will be pivotal in supporting the
      implementation of prophylactic and therapeutic recommendations.
