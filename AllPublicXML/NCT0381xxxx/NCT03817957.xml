    <textblock>
      Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) in postoperative patients with confirmed preoperative iron
      deficiency (ID) in a population with planned major surgery who need fast replenishment of
      iron as judged by the treating physician will be treated with i.v. iron using
      Polyglucoferron, Ferric Carboxymaltose or oral iron
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, patients with confirmed and documented preoperative non-anaemic iron
      deficiency (diagnosis up to 28 days before surgery in routine pre-surgery monitoring) who
      develop anaemia within 12 to 72 hours after start of surgery (with additional confirmation at
      Baseline) and for whom fast replenishment of iron stores is necessary, will be included and
      substituted within 24h after Screening Visit/V1. Peri- or postoperative anaemia will be
      assessed as soon as possible but earliest 12 h after surgery. For short term safety analysis
      iron in urine will be measured in the first urine after the end of i.v. administration in the
      first 35 patients who are eligible for analysis in each i.v. treatment group. Only those
      patients are eligible for whom haematuria and/or proteinuria are excluded using dip stick
      test. The Ferric Carboxymaltose treatment arm will be closed if a sufficient number of
      patients is included for safety analysis.The study will then be continued for assessment of
      co-primary efficacy endpoint: The effectiveness of postoperative i.v. iron substitution with
      Polyglucoferron compared to conventional oral iron substitution with Ferrous sulfate
      (treatment 28 - 35 days) to normalize Hb-values or to increase Hb-values by at least 1.5 g/dl
      until visit 4 will be evaluated as well as patient related outcomes, such as the decreased
      need for allogenic blood transfusions. In addition, the well-being of the patient will be
      assumed to improve after treatment using the SF36 questionnaire.

It contains eight sections: vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning, mental health. The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.</description>
