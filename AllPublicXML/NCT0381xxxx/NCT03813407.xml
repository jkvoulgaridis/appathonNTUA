  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate has been shown to be effective and safe in adults for the
      treatment of hyperkalaemia, and therefore it is expected to be beneficial in children. This
      study will evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate
      for the treatment of hyperkalaemia in children &lt;18 years of age.

      Primary Objective:28-day maintenance phase (MP) primary objective:

      To compare the effect of SZC vs placebo on maintaining normokalaemia during the MP.

      Correction phase (CP) primary objective:

      To evaluate SZC dose levels on achieving normokalaemia during the CP.

      Overall design:

      Approximately 100 subjects will be enrolled at approximately 40 sites in locations including
      but not limited to Europe and North America for this study.

      This study will enrol males and females aged birth to &lt;18 years with hyperkalaemia, except
      neonates with a gestational age less than 30 weeks or a birth weight less than 1500 g.

      All subjects are eligible for open-label treatment with SZC during the Correction Phase, and
      subjects aged 2 to &lt;18 years who are eligible to participate in the Maintenance Phase will be
      randomised in a 1:1 ratio to double-blinded treatment with SZC or matching placebo
      comparator. Subjects aged &lt;2 years who require continuing treatment will participate in an
      open-label Maintenance Phase. Only subjects aged 2 to &lt;18 years may continue to the optional
      open-label Long-Term Maintenance Phase.

      Treatment will be stratified by the following age cohorts during the study:

        -  12 to &lt;18 years of age

        -  6 to &lt;12 years of age

        -  2 to &lt;6 years of age

        -  0 to &lt;2 years of age, except neonates with a gestational age less than 30 weeks or a
           birth weight less than 1500 g. During the dose escalation period in the CP, treatment
           will first be initiated in the oldest age cohort (12 to &lt;18 years). The age cohort 6 to
           &lt;12 years will start as soon as study drug is available. Dosing may then be started
           sequentially in the younger age cohorts, depending on the safety and efficacy data
           during the CP in the older cohorts.

      Data Monitoring Committee:

      An independent Data Monitoring Committee will be utilised for this study to evaluate emerging
      afety data during the dose escalation part of the study

      Overall design:

      Approximately 100 subjects will be enroled at approximately 40 sites in locations including
      but not limited to Europe and North America for this study.

      This study will enrol males and females aged birth to &lt;18 years with hyperkalaemia, except
      neonates with a gestational age less than 30 weeks or a birth weight less than 1500 g.

      All subjects are eligible for open-label treatment with SZC during the Correction Phase (CP),
      and subjects aged 2 to &lt;18 years who are eligible to participate in the Maintenance Phase
      (MP) will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to double-blinded treatment with SZC or matching
      placebo comparator.

      Subjects aged &lt;2 years who require continuing treatment will participate in an open-label MP.
      Subjects aged 2 to &lt;18 years of age will be evaluated for participation in the Long Term
      Maintenance Phase (LTMP) at the end of the MP (Visit 8a). The Investigator will unblind the
      treatment (maintain single-blind at site) and obtain S-K at a local laboratory. Participation
      in the 22-week open-label, LTMP will be decided as described below:

      Not eligible for the LTMP:

      - If the subject is 2 to &lt;18 years of age, normokalaemic (potassium ≥3.5 mmol/L and ≤5.0
      mmol/L), and has received placebo according to unblinding performed by Investigator. The
      remaining Visit 8a procedures will be performed and the subject should be discontinued from
      the study (perform MP/LTMP EOS procedures).

      Eligible for the LTMP:

        -  If the subject is 2 to &lt;18 years of age, normokalaemic (potassium ≥3.5 mmol/L to ≤5
           mmol/L), has received active study drug according to unblinding performed by the
           Investigator, and participation in the LTMP is deemed appropriate by the Investigator,
           Visit 8a procedures will be discontinued and procedures for Visit 8b (LTMP) will be
           performed.

        -  If the subject is 2 to &lt;18 years of age, hyperkalaemic (potassium ≥5.0 mmol/L), has
           received active or placebo study drug according to unblinding performed by Investigator,
           and participation in the LTMP is deemed appropriate by the Investigator, Visit 8a
           procedures will be discontinued and procedures for Visit 8b (LTMP) will be performed.

      All subjects in the LTMP will need to return for follow-up visits to obtain an S-K (local)
      check 3 days and 7 days after first dose of LTMP study drug. If hypokalaemia is observed, it
      will be treated appropriately and the subject will be withdrawn from the LTMP.

      Treatment will be stratified by the following age cohorts during the study:

        -  12 to &lt;18 years of age

        -  6 to &lt;12 years of age

        -  2 to &lt;6 years of age

        -  0 to &lt;2 years of age, except neonates with a gestational age less than 30 weeks or a
           birth weight less than 1500 g.

      During the dose escalation period in the CP, treatment will first be initiated in the oldest
      age cohort (12 to &lt;18 years). The age cohort 6 to &lt;12 years will start as soon as study drug
      is available. Dosing may then be started sequentially in the younger age cohorts, depending
      on the safety and efficacy data during the CP in the older cohorts.

      Study period:

      Estimated date of first subject enroled Q3 2018 Estimated date of last subject completed Q1
      2021

      Number of subjects:

      The study will enrol approximately 100 subjects into the CP in order to achieve randomisation
      of at least 90 subjects into the MP. Of the 100 subjects enroled, ≥5 subjects should be in
      the birth to &lt;2 years cohort. Additionally, the 90 (or greater) subjects randomised into the
      MP should include ≥30 subjects in the 12 to &lt;18 years cohort, ≥30 subjects in the 6 to &lt;12
      years cohort, and ≥10 subjects in the 2 to &lt;6 years cohort. At least 45 randomised subjects
      should have a baseline potassium level (using the mean of the two consecutive i-STAT-K
      measurements at Screening) of &gt;5.5 mmol/L by i-STAT (i-STAT-K). A minimum number of 75
      subjects must continue study drug throughout the MP (≥25 subjects in the 12 to &lt;18 years
      cohort, ≥25 subjects in the 6 to &lt;12 years cohort, and ≥8 subjects in the 2 to &lt;6 years
      cohort). Hence, randomisation will continue until it can be predicted that 75 subjects
      fulfilling the specific age cohort requirements will complete the MP without premature
      discontinuation of study drug.

      Based on data from adult study SZC-004, the proportion of responders (subject with maintained
      normokalaemia, defined as i-STAT-K 3.5 to 5.0 mmol/L inclusive, throughout the MP) can be
      assumed to be 37% and 12% in the SZC and placebo treatment groups, respectively. Forty-five
      subjects per group will then provide 79% power using a chi-square test at 5% significance
      level.

      Treatments and treatment duration:

      Treatment will include 3 phases: the CP, MP, and LTMP. Subjects from 2 to &lt;18 years requiring
      chronic treatment for hyperkalaemia are eligible to participate in all phases of the study if
      entry criteria are met.

      Subjects &lt;2 years of age requiring acute or chronic treatment for hyperkalaemia will be
      included in the first 2 phases, as specified:

      An open-label CP during which SZC is administered orally 3 times daily (TID) prior to
      breakfast, lunch, and dinner for 1 to 3 days to achieve normokalaemia (i-STAT-K level ≥3.5
      mmol/L and ≤5.0 mmol/L in subjects 2 to &lt;18 years, and ≥3.5 mmol/L and ≤6.0 mmol/L in
      subjects from birth to &lt;2 years) in subjects from birth to &lt;18 years.

      A 28-day MP during which SZC or placebo is administered in randomised, double-blind manner
      orally once daily (QD) to maintain normokalaemia in subjects from 2 to &lt;18 years. Subjects
      aged &lt;2 years will continue treatment in the MP with open-label QD oral SZC active treatment
      if medically indicated by the treating physician. Dose titration will be allowed in this
      phase for subjects aged &lt;2 years in the case of hypokalaemia. At the end of the MP (Visit
      8a), the Investigator will unblind the treatment.

      • An open-label LTMP during which SZC is administered QD for up to 22 weeks for subjects aged
      2 to &lt;18 years who either maintain normokalaemia on active drug during the MP or are
      hyperkalaemic on active drug or placebo during the MP. Continuation into this phase is
      optional, and will be determined by the Investigator based on the subject's need for
      long-term treatment. Dose titration for individual subjects will be allowed in this phase
      after dose level (DL) data are evaluated by the iDMC.

      Dose levels are derived from doses of SZC previously used in the adult population, by
      adjusting for paediatric body weight.

      Data Monitoring Committee:

      An independent Data Monitoring Committee will be utilised for this study to evaluate emerging
      safety data during the dose escalation part of the study.

      Statistical methods All efficacy analyses will be based on the intent-to-treat (ITT)
      principle using the Full analysis set, i.e., subjects that stop taking treatment, are
      randomised but receive no treatment, or receive rescue medication are still included in the
      analysis.

      Safety analyses will similarly be primarily based on the ITT principle of including data
      after premature discontinuation of study drug using the Safety analysis set. If the
      proportion of treated subjects who discontinue study drug prematurely is larger than 15%, a
      subset of the safety summaries as defined in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be
      produced using an on-treatment approach also. In general, CP data will be presented by dose.
      MP data will be presented by treatment, denoted by SZC or placebo.

      In the LTMP, the open-label SZC dose can be titrated. Summaries by dose will however be done
      based on the dose the subject was initially on when starting the LTMP (which should be the
      same dose at which the subject started the study, according to study design).

      Categorical variables will be summarised using frequency and percentages, where the
      denominator for calculation is the underlying analysis set population unless otherwise
      stated.

      Continuous variables will be summarised with descriptive statistics of number of available
      observations, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum, and quartiles where more
      appropriate.

      In instances where central laboratory K data is missing in the CP, the i-STAT-K value will be
      used instead, adding the average difference between the central laboratory K and i-STAT-K in
      those subjects with both values available at the relevant time point.

      All point estimates will be presented together with 95% confidence intervals as measures of
      precision. No interim analyses are planned for this study.

             informed assent from the subject (as appropriate) as described in Appendix A 3.

          2. Female or male from birth to &lt;18 years of age.

          3. Subjects requiring long-term treatment of hyperkalaemia (chronic hyperkalaemia) in the
             age cohort ≥2 years, and subjects requiring either short- or long-term treatment for
             hyperkalaemia (acute and chronic hyperkalaemia) in the age cohort &lt;2 years.

          4. Subjects must meet 1 of the following criteria for hyperkalaemia:

               1. For subjects ≥2 years of age, mean i-STAT-K level &gt;5.0 mmol/L at Screening. Two
                  consecutive i-STAT-K values, measured 60 (±15) minutes apart, both

                  ≥5.0 mmol/L and measured within 1 day before the first dose of SZC on CP Study
                  Day 1.

               2. For subjects &lt;2 years of age, i-STAT-K level &gt;6.0 mmol/L at Screening, measured
                  within 1 day before the first dose of SZC on CP Study Day 1.

        Using digital ECG, QT interval corrected by Bazett's method (QTcB) must meet the
        age-appropriate parameters at Screening:

          1. For subjects aged 0 to ≤3 days after birth: &lt;450 ms

          2. For subjects aged &gt;3 days to &lt;12 years: &lt;440 ms

          3. For subjects ≥12 to &lt;18 years: &lt;450 ms (male), &lt;460 ms (female) All QTcB values
             outside the reference values specified in the protocol should be manually re-measured
             and re-calculated, and if there is a difference in measurement between the automatic
             and manual ECG, the manual measurement should always be considered correct.

             6. Ability to have repeated blood draws or effective venous catheterization. 7.
             Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 1 day
             prior to the first dose of SZC on CP Study Day 1 and sexually active females of
             childbearing potential must be using 2 forms of medically acceptable contraception
             with at least 1 being a barrier method

               4. Subjects with hyperkalaemia due to soft-tissue damage from crush injury or burns.

               5. Subjects with hyperkalaemia due to a secondary cause, such as dehydration,
                  excessive use of potassium supplements, or drug use (eg, beta-adrenergic
                  antagonists) and that would be more appropriately treated with other
