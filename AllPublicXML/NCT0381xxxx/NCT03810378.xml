  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare two metabolically distinct diets, WFKD vs Med-Plus,
      in order to examine the potential benefits, and unintended consequences, of going beyond a
      focus on maximally avoiding added sugars and refined grains, to also avoiding legumes,
      fruits, and whole grains.

      The proposed randomized clinical trial will investigate differential population-specific
      effects of two low-carbohydrate (low-carb) diet patterns, addressing a gap in the evidence
      base in this area that will lead to 1) improved treatment strategies for common adverse
      clinical conditions, 2) improved health for these individuals, and 3) long-term decreases in
      health care costs. This impactful research will advance the field of personalized and
      precision medicine.

We will be using number of observed sequence variants (&quot;species&quot;) determined by standard 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing (V3-V5 region followed by DADA2 to define error-corrected sequence variants) as our primary metric of alpha diversity. Higher alpha diversity is better. The units are the # of sequence variants.</description>

    <description>Participants will follow a Mediterranean-type diet (Med-Plus) for 12 weeks. This diet will maximize the intake of vegetables, legumes, fruits and nuts, whole intact grains/cereals and fish; and minimize the intake of meat, poultry, and dairy. It will exclude added sugars and refined grains.</description>

    <description>Participants will follow a Well-Formulated Ketogenic Diet (WFKD) for 12 weeks. This diet will maximize the intake of non-processed beef, pork, and poultry (preferably organic/grass-fed), fish, heavy cream, low-lactose, high-fat cheeses, animal fats, oils (avocado, coconut, or other nut oils), non-starchy (above ground) vegetables and limited amounts of some fruits (berries). It will exclude legumes, grains, sugars, starchy (below ground) vegetables, most fruits, and polyunsaturated oils (soy, sunflower, peanut, cottonseed, canola, etc.). It will aim for an intake of 20 g of carbohydrates/day at start, with the goal to have no more than 50 grams/day to maintain ketosis.</description>
