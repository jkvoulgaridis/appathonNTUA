  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although previous studies have linked fried potato consumption with the incidence of
      mortality in the US population, the association between potato consumption and mortality in
      the Chinese population remains unknown.

      This study investigated the association of potato, fried potato, unfried potato, and sweet
      potato consumption with the incidence of mortality in the China Health and Nutrition Survey
      (CHNS).We analyzed the CHNS data and the participants (n = 14,116) over 20 years old were
      followed for up to 22 years. The participants were initially free of cancer, myocardial
      infarction, apoplexy, and pregnancy. Potato consumption was assessed using validated
      semi-quantitative food questionnaires (FFQ) in interviews. In each wave of interviews, the
      participants' situations such as alive, dead, or dying was listed and the death months were
      recorded. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were estimated using Cox
      proportional hazard models with adjustment of potential confounders.In the CHNS cohort, total
      potato, fried potato, unfried potato, and sweet potato consumption were all strongly
      associated with a reduction in all-cause mortality in both Chinese women and men.

    <description>All-cause mortality was the primary outcome of interest in this study. In the CHNS, mortality status was confirmed by reported information in each round of the survey. For each participant, the household register updated the information if they were alive and still present, dying, or dead, and the month of death was recorded. Years of follow-up were calculated from baseline until death or censoring on December 31, 2011, depending on which came first.</description>

        Of the 14,116 participants, 6,493 male and 7,623 female were enrolled, ranging from 20 to
        93 years old. People who consumed the potatoes, sweet potatoes, stir-fried potatoes, and
        non stir-fried potatoes accounted for 57.52%, 14.6%,51.53%, and 54.82%, respectively.
