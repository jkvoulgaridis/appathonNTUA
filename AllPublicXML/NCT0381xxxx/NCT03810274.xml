  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Comparing the accuracy and speed of 3DV+TPS software with imported TPS and domestic TPS to
      outline the contours of crisis organs, it is proved that 3DV+TPS has superiority compared
      with domestic TPS, and it has non-inferiority compared with imported TPS, indicating that the
      software can improve contour sketching accuracy. And speed, reduce the burden on doctors,
      improve medical efficiency.

      Comparing the accuracy and speed difference between 3DV+TPS software and imported TPS and
      domestic TPS to outline the contours of crisis organs, the selected organs are: bilateral
      eyeballs, bilateral crystals, bilateral optic nerves, bilateral parotid glands, oral cavity,
      spinal cord, brainstem, The brain has a total of 12 organs; verify that 3DV+TPS is superior
      to domestic TPS, and has non-inferiority compared with imported TPS, Ming software can
      improve the accuracy and speed of contour sketching, reduce the burden on doctors, and
      improve medical efficiency.

        A total of 7 different grade hospital radiotherapy centers have received radiotherapy for
        patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma Case information, based on inclusion and exclusion
        criteria, a total of 300 cases were screened. Among them, Xinqiao Hospital collected 180
        cases, He collected 20 cases in 20 hospitals, totaling 200 cases.
