      This phase I clinical study was designed to evaluate the safety of Recombinant Human
      Papillomavirus Vaccine (6,11,16,18,31,33,45,52,58 Type)(E.Coli)(hereafter called HPV
      vaccine), manufactured by Xiamen Innovax Biotech CO., LTD., in healthy adults aged 18-45
      years old.

    <textblock>
      The study would have 2 stages. In the first stage, around 12 healthy adults aged 18-45 (male
      vs female,around 1:1)would receive 135μg/0.5ml of the HPV vaccine, the participants would be
      actively followed up for 7 days, if no vaccine related serious adverse events(SAE) occurred
      and the vaccine is well tolerated, another group of 12 healthy adults aged 18-45 (male vs
      female,around 1:1)would be enrolled and would receive 270μg/0.5ml of the HPV vaccine. The
      vaccine would be administered intramuscularly at day 0, month 1 and month 6. All the
      participants would be actively monitored for adverse reactions/events for 1 month after each
      injection. SAE during the trial were followed up. And blood, liver and kidney function
      changes will be monitored before and 2 days after the first and third vaccination. Serum
      samples from all the subjects would be collected on day 0 and month 7 to test immunogenicity
      as exploratory analysis.
