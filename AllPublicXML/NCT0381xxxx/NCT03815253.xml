  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, a 8-week, single blinded, randomized controlled clinical trial will be
      conducted to examine the efficacy and safety of body acupuncture in the treatment of central
      obesity in Hong Kong.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot single-blind, randomized, sham-controlled trial. 168 central obesity patients
      will be randomly assigned to acupuncture group or control group. The duration of the
      treatment will be 8 weeks with 2 session per week and the follow-up period will be 2 weeks.

    <masking_description>Subjects of both groups will be randomly assigned to receive either electro-acupuncture or control (sham) treatment. For randomization, simple, complete non-sequential random numbers will be generated in advance by a computer program in a block of four, and kept by the principal investigator. After a patient's eligibility is confirmed, a randomization number which corresponds to the group allocation will be provided to the acupuncturist by the PI. This arrangement will ensure that the clinical assessor and participants are blinded to the allocation.</masking_description>

    <time_frame>0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8, 15,18, 21, 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events of acupuncture treatment will be assessed using the Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale (TESS) and would be evaluated during the whole procedure, as well as laboratory tests (whole blood counts, renal and liver functions) if needed. All clinical adverse events will be recorded in terms of intensity (mild, moderate, or severe), duration, outcome and relationship to the study.</description>

    <time_frame>0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8, 15,18, 21, 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>waist-to-hip ratio is the dimensionless ratio of the circumference of the waist to that of the hips. This is calculated as waist measurement divided by hip measurement ( W ÷ H ).</description>

    <measure>Changes in Body Mass Index</measure>
    <time_frame>0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8, 15,18, 21, 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Body Mass Index is a simple calculation using a person's height and weight. The formula is BMI = kg/m2 where kg is a person's weight in kilograms and m2 is their height in metres squared.</description>

    <time_frame>0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8, 15,18, 21, 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The body fat percentage (BFP) of a human or other living being is the total mass of fat divided by total body mass, multiplied by 100. Body fat percentage will be measured by Omron Karada Scan HBF-701.</description>

    <description>Body electro-acupuncture will be conducted for 2 sessions per week over 8 consecutive weeks.
Body electro-acupuncture will choose eight acupoints as Tianshu(ST-25), Daheng(SP-15), Daimai(GB-26), Qihai(CV-6), Zhongwan(CV-12), Zusanli (ST-36), Fenlong(ST-40), Sanyinjiao(SP-6).Disposable acupuncture needles (verum acupuncture needles asia-med Special No. 16 with 0.30 x 0.30mm matching the Streitberger sham-needles) will be inserted at a depth of 10-25 mm into the points.
We will also deliver electrical stimulation with dense-disperse waves with 50Hz at 10 volts through electrical acupuncture stimulation instrument (ES-160 6-Channel Programmable Electro-acupuncture) to the abdominal points. The bodily needles will be retained for 30 minutes.</description>

    <description>As to the participants allocated to control group, Streitberger's non-invasive acupuncture needles (Gauge 8 x 1.2&quot; / 0.30 x 30 mm) will be applied to act as sham control at the same acupoints with same stimulation modality. However, the needles will be only adhered to the skin instead of insertion. The validity and credibility of this model has been well demonstrated.</description>
