      Exclusion criteria:

        -  Patitient for combined surgery ( myocardial revascularization by sternotomy plus valve

        -  Patient in who will be technically impossible the application of the blockade

      Trial treatment:

      Intervention: These patients will receive the protocol multimodal analgesia patients receive
      on the Colombian Cardiovascular Foundation with Lidocaine 0.5mcg/k. Dexamethasone 8mcg,
      Fentanyl Bolus: 7mcg/k . infusion of Fentanyl 4 mcg/k/h start after induction , go down to 2
      Mcg/k/h during extracorporeal circulation , after extracorporeal circulation the infusion
      will be suspended of Fentanyl.In this Arm the patient will give a bilateral serratus
      intercostal plane block, will be performed echo-guided puncture in the line anterior axillar
      with fifth costal arch, whit 21 ml of anesthetic mass, 20 ml of Levobupivacaine 0.375 and 1
      ml (2mg) of dexamethasone. and the postoperative analgesia will be 500mg of acetaminophen
      oral and Analgesia, patient controlled with Fentanyl 20mcg/bolus

      Control:

      These patients will receive the protocol multimodal analgesia patients receive on the
