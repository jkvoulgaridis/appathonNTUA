  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BresoTEC has designed and developed a standalone wearable device (the patch), that can record
      tracheal sounds with a microphone attached just above the suprasternal notch of the subject.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The patch also has a 3-dimensional accelerometer to record body position. Furthermore, the
      patch records oxygen saturation using an FDA cleared pulse oximeter, Nonin 3150 WristOx2®
      with Bluetooth Low Energy. We have developed advanced signal processing algorithms to detect
      apneas and hypopneas. Many of these techniques for analyzing breathing sounds and detecting
      apneas and hypopneas have been published in peer-reviewed journals.

      The goal of this study is to validate the patch against polysomnography (PSG) for use as an
      aid in the diagnosis of sleep apnea for adult patients. Our primary objective is to assess
      whether the estimated apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) calculated by the patch agrees with the
      results of an in-laboratory PSG.

    <masking_description>The outcome assessor performing the automatic analysis of the patch data will be blinded to the PSG scores performed by the Sleep Lab Technicians.
The principal investigator responsible for the completion and closing of the study according to the protocol will be blinded to the patch AHI automatic analysis.
Similarly, the Sleep Lab Technicians scoring the PSG will be blinded to the patch automatic analysis.
By the end of recruiting the target sample size, the data will be un-blinded and statistical analysis will be performed.</masking_description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Inclusion criteria are men and women 18 years and above, who are referred to either
             the University Health Network (UHN), Toronto Rehabilitation Institute (TRI) or Toronto
             General Hospital sleep laboratories for overnight PSG because of a suspicion of a
             sleep disorder. It is intended for the general outpatient population.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exclusion criteria are patients with suspected complicated co-morbidities including
             in-hospital patients and those who self-report diagnosis of heart failure, recent
             stroke, neuromuscular disorders, renal failure, obesity hypoventilation, COPD, or
             other severe lung diseases.
