  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An intervention study with longitudinal follow-up of patients with coronary artery disease
      undergoing early cardiac rehabilitation is designed.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the study is to investigate patient-reported outcomes, their relation
      to clinical characteristics of the patients and the potential to predict health outcomes and
      adverse events in coronary artery disease patients participating in an early cardiac
      rehabilitation programme.

    <description>The EuroQol 5-dimensions-5 level questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) is an 5 item self-report-questionnaire assessing self-reported health. The respondent rates each item on a 5-point scale ranging from 1(indicating no problem) to 5 (indicating extreme problems). This decision results in a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state.</description>

    <description>The VAS scale from the EQ-5D-5L assess global health. The scale goes from 0 to 100 were lower score indicates worse health.</description>

    <measure>Change in post traumatic growth</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after the 5 week intervention, and at 9, 31, 57 and 109 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Posttraumatic Growth Inventory-Short Form (PTGI-SF) is a 10 item scale measuring post traumatic growth. The respondent rates each item on a 6-point scale ranging from 0 (I did not experience this change as a result of my crisis) to 5 (I experienced this change to a very great degree as a result of my crisis). The scale is scored by adding all the responses.Individual factors are scored by adding responses to items on each factor. Factors are indicated by the Roman numerals after each item.</description>

    <description>The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) is a fourteen item scale where seven of the items relate to anxiety and seven relate to depression. The respondent rates each item on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (absence) to 3 (extreme presence). The total score is 42 (21 per subscale).</description>

    <measure>Change in physical and mental dimensions of health</measure>

    <description>The Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) include 12 items with 3 to 5 response levels. It generates two health indices: mental health and physical health. The score range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the highest level of health</description>

    <measure>Change in health status following myocardial infarction</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after the 5 week intervention, and at 9, 31, 57 and 109 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Myocardial Infarction Dimensional Assessment Scale (MIDAS) is a PRO measure developed and validated to specifically measure the health status of individuals who have suffered a myocardial infarction. It consist of 7 domains, and is a 35 item scale where respondents rate each item on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (never) to 5 (always). The function of the MIDAS is to indicate the extent of ill health in each of the seven domains assessed, therefore each dimension is scored separately using a simple scoring methodology.</description>

    <description>This is an early cardiac rehabilitation programme starting 1-2 weeks after hospital discharge (Phase 2A rehabilitation). The programme provided by a multidisciplinary team includes individual counseling, educational sessions and discussion in groups, and exercise training sessions three days a week for five weeks.
For additional analysis there will be a comparison group that did not receive the intervention for practical reasons.</description>
