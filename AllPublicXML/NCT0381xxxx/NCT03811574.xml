    <textblock>
      This study will look at the change in participants' body weight from the start to the end of
      the study. This is to compare the effect on body weight in people taking semaglutide (a new
      medicine) and people taking &quot;dummy&quot; medicine. In addition to taking the medicine,
      participants will have talks with study staff about healthy food choices, how to be more
      physically active and what participants can do to lose weight. Participants will either get
      semaglutide or &quot;dummy&quot; medicine - which treatment participants get is decided by chance.
      Participants are three times as likely to get semaglutide as &quot;dummy&quot; medicine. Participants
      will need to take 1 injection once a week. The study medicine is injected with a thin needle
      in a skinfold in the stomach, thigh or upper arm. The study will last for about one and a
      half years. Participants will have 14 clinic visits and 11 phone calls with the study doctor.
