          5. Female subjects of child-bearing potential, must have a negative Urine Pregnancy Test
             (UPT) on Treatment Day prior to any applications of the study products

          6. Screening Day Baseline microbial counts are at least 3.11 CFU/cm2 bilaterally from the
             skin of the abdomen, and 5.00 log10 CFU/cm2 bilaterally from the skin of the groin
             (not applicable for Neutralization study)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Exposure of test sites to antimicrobial agents, medicated soaps, medicated shampoos,
             or medicated lotions, use of biocide-treated pools or hot tubs, use of tanning beds,
             or sunbathing during the 14-day washout conditioning period and during the test period
             (7-day for Neutralization study)

          2. Exposure of the test sites to strong detergents, solvents, or other irritants during
             the 14-day washout conditioning period and during the test period (7-day for
             Neutralization study)

          3. Wear fabric softener, bug repellent or UV-treated clothing during the 14-day washout
             conditioning period and during the test period (7-day for Neutralization study)

          4. Receive an irritation score of 1 (any redness, swelling, rash, or dryness present at
             any treatment area) for any individual skin condition prior to the Screening Day
             baseline or Treatment Day baseline sample collection or Neutralization study

          5. Use of systemic or topical antibiotic medications, steroid medications (other than for
             hormonal contraception or post-menopausal reasons), or any other product known to
             affect the normal microbial flora of the skin during the 14-day washout conditioning
             period and during the test period (7-day for Neutralization study)

          6. Known allergies or sensitivities to vinyl, latex (rubber), alcohols, metals, inks, or
             tape adhesives, or to common antibacterial agents found in soaps, lotions, or
             ointments, particularly isopropyl alcohol or chlorhexidine gluconate

          7. A medical diagnosis of a physical condition, such as a current or recent severe
             illness, asthma, diabetes, hepatitis, an organ transplant, mitral valve prolapses,
             congenital heart disease, internal prostheses, or any immunocompromised conditions
             such as AIDS (or HIV positive)

          8. Pregnancy, plans to become pregnant within the washout and test periods of the study,
             or nursing a child

          9. Any tattoos or scars within 2&quot; (5.08 cm) of the test sites

         10. Dermatoses, cuts, lesions, active skin rashes, or breaks or other skin disorders
             within 6&quot; on or around the test sites

         11. A currently active skin disease or inflammatory skin condition (for example, contact
             dermatitis) anywhere on the body that, in the opinion of the Consulting Physician or
             PI, would compromise subject safety or study integrity

         12. Showering, bathing, or swimming within the 72-hour period prior to sampling for
             baseline screening, Treatment Day, and throughout the test period (not applicable for
             Neutralization study)

         13. Participation in another clinical study in the past 30 days or current participation
             in another clinical study at time of signing informed consent

         14. Any medical condition or use of any medications that, in the opinion of the PI, should
