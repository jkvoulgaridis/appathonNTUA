    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to assess acute toxicity in patients receiving flank irradiation using
      proton therapy for renal tumors.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with renal tumors including Wilms and clear cell sarcoma of the kidney (CCSK) are
      treated with multimodality therapy which may include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation.
      While long-term disease control is excellent, these patients remain at risk for early and
      late toxicities partially from radiation. There have been no significant changes to
      traditional photon radiation fields, which encompass the post-operative bed, anterior
      abdomen, and vertebral body. Proton beam radiation using pencil beam scanning, which is
      characterized by Bragg peak dose deposition and high conformality of dose to target regions,
      is ideally suited to treat the retroperitoneum. This pilot study evaluates pencil beam
      scanning proton therapy (PBS-PT) to:

        -  result in low acute gastrointestinal toxicity in patients receiving radiation therapy
           for renal tumors as measured by laboratory evaluations, clinician-assessed, and patient
           reported health related quality of life outcomes

        -  decrease the duration of radiation therapy

        -  compare doses to organs at risk (OARs) using PBS-PT as compared to traditional photon
           fields

    <description>Acute toxicity in patients receiving flank irradiation using proton therapy for renal tumors. Acute toxicity is defined as any non-hematologic toxicity that occurs within 90 days following the start of proton therapy. NCI Common toxicity criteria (CTC Version 4.0) grades will be employed. Individual category content listings are available to investigators at http://ctep.cancer.gov, with attention to the following System Organ Classes and CTCAE Adverse Events: General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions, Hepatobiliary Disorders, Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders, Gastrointestinal Disorders, Renal and Urinary Disorders, Injury, poisoning, or procedural complications, Metabolism and nutrition disorders, and Benign, Malignant, and Unspecified Neoplasms.</description>
