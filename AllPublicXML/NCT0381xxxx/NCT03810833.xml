  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate background fluorescence of participants of different ages,
      gender, and skin color. In addition, 48-hour tolerability of the sensor and adhesive will be
      evaluated.

      The MediBeacon Transdermal GFR Measurement System investigational is intended to measure the
      Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in patients with normal or impaired renal function by
      noninvasively monitoring fluorescent light emission from an exogenous tracer agent (MB-102)
      over time. The device utilized in this study is the Brilliance device. Approximately 1 male
      and 1 female from each age cohort (18-50 years; 51+ years) and clustered Fitzpatrick Skin
      Scale groups (I-II [Light, pale white; white, fair]; III-IV [Medium, white to olive; olive,
      moderate brown]; and V-VI [Brown, dark brown; black, very dark brown to black]) will be
      recruited, for a total of 12 participants. Participants will have Brilliance device sensors
      placed on two locations on their skin, which will remain for 48 hours. The sensor location
      will be prepared through shaving and cleaning (as applicable), placed on the skin via
      standard single-use adhesive pads, and baseline measurements collected. Participants may
      undergo activities of daily living while measurements are being collected. Light pressure and
      other minor perturbations may be applied to the sensors to evaluate the effect on background
      fluorescence. Adverse events associated with sensor placement (such as skin irritations) will
      be recorded.
