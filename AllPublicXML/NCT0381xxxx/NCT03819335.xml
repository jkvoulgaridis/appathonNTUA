  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is based on the contribution that an app can offer for improving knowledge and
      self-management of people with type 1 diabetes.

      The main objective of this study is to assess mySugr app as a tool for empowering people with
      type 1 diabetes.

      The study population are type 1 diabetes people, aged more than 18 years old and with more
      than one year from diagnosis. They will be randomised to standard care or use of mySugr app
      and will be followed-up during 48 weeks.

      Control group will attend 5 face-to-face visits (baseline, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months) with the
      possibility of telephone contact and hospital assistance if necessary. Intervention group
      will attend 3 face-to-face visits (baseline, 6 and 12 months) and 2 telematic visits (at 3
      and 9 months) and will also have the possibility of telephone contact and hospital assistance
      if necessary.

    <description>mySugr is a mobile medical app for diabetes management. It has been developed by Roche Diabetes Care and it has two versions, free and Pro. It allows to carry out the diary of diabetes, including the collection and analysis of data on glycaemia, food, physical activity or insulin dose. In addition, it is compatible with continuous glucose measurement systems. It has the possibility to add functionalities such as estimation of HbA1c levels, more detailed data analysis or integration with Google Fit type motion sensors, as well as a bolus calculator, reminders for measuring blood glucose or photo gallery in the Pro version, which is the one that will be provided to the patients for the study.</description>
