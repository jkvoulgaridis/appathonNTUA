  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to create a patient registry in order to assess treatment
      patterns, physician reported clinical outcomes and patient-reported health-related quality of
      life among patients diagnosed with Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) who newly initiated a novel
      therapy in the past 3 months and treatment is ongoing at the time of enrollment.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Newer targeted therapies (monotherapy or in combination with other agents) have been recently
      approved in the United States for the treatment of adult patients with mantle cell lymphoma
      (MCL) who have received at least 1 prior therapy. The approval of these newer therapies will
      have an impact on the treatment patterns, toxicity patterns, and outcomes in the MCL
      population. A prospective, observational study will help to better understand the evolving
      real-world treatment outcomes (including treatment patterns, reasons for discontinuation/dose
      reduction, treatment interruption or treatment switches), physician-reported clinical
      outcomes, and patient-reported symptoms and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among
      patients diagnosed with MCL who newly initiated a novel therapy in the past 3 months, and
      treatment is ongoing at the time of enrollment

    <description>Descriptive statistics for each validated PRO will include continuous measures (mean, median, SD, IQR, minimum, and maximum) or achievement of a particular threshold (frequency and proportion), if applicable. This study will collect patient perceptions of HRQoL based on PRO measures in patients with MCL by collecting the EQ-5D-5L on a quarterly basis. This questionnaire is comprised of 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression) and 1 visual analog scale used to assess a patient's self-rated health. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. A unique health state is defined by combining 1 level from each of the 5 dimensions. Each health state is referred to in terms of a 5-digit code.</description>
