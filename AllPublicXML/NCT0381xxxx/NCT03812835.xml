          2. Patients (men and women) &gt;18 years old.

          3. Patients who have received at least one dose of apixaban for treatment of deep vein
             thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE); prevention of recurrent DVT and PE

             -

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients meeting any of the following criteria will not be included in the study:

          2. Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.

          3. Active clinically significant bleeding.

          4. Hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and clinically relevant bleeding risk,
             based on hepatic function tests.

          5. Lesion or condition if considered a significant risk factor for major bleeding. This
             may include current or recent gastrointestinal ulceration, presence of malignant
             neoplasms at high risk of bleeding, recent brain or spinal injury, recent brain,

          6. Concomitant treatment with any other anticoagulant agent e.g. unfractionated heparin
             (UFH), low molecular weight heparins (enoxaparin, dalteparin, etc.), heparin
             derivatives (fondaparinux, etc.), and oral anticoagulants (warfarin, acenocoumarin,
             rivaroxaban, dabigatran, etc.) except under specific circumstances of switching
             anticoagulant therapy.
