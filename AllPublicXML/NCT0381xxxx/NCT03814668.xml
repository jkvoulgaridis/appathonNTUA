      Study objectives:

      Primary:

      Difference in breath hydrogen concentration (BHC, ppm) in lactase and probiotic groups
      compared to placebo, measured by the incremental area under curve (iAUC) analysis

      Non-inferiority in breath hydrogen concentration (BHC, ppm) of probiotic group compared to
      lactase group, measured by the incremental area under curve (iAUC) analysis

      Secondary:

      Breath test

        -  Breath hydrogen peak value (ppm) in lactase and probiotic groups compared to placebo

        -  Cumulative breath hydrogen (ppm) in lactase and probiotic groups compared to placebo

      Acute gastrointestinal symptoms (severity or presence/absence to be defined on a Likert
      scale) in lactase and probiotic groups compared to placebo

        -  Abdominal pain

        -  Flatulence

        -  Bloating

        -  Nausea and vomiting

        -  Bowel movements and diarrhea (if present, stool consistency to be defined on Bristol
           stool scale and number of bowel movements to be recorded)

      Ancillary:

        -  Baseline fasting BHC (ppm)

        -  Breath methane CH4 (ppm)

        -  Breath carbon dioxide CO2 (ppm)

        -  Probiotic identification in feces before each lactose challenge by molecular methods

        -  Gene test to determine lactase deficiency status at screening (following SNP variants to
           be screened: 13910*C (Europe, Central Asia, commonly used) -22018*G (Europe), -13915*T
           (Saudi-Arabia, Africa), -14010*G (Africa), -13907*C (Africa))
