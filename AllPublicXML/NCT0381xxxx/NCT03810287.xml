    <description>Domperidone will be prescribed at an initial dose of 10 mg up to 4 times a day (prior to each meal and at bedtime). It is possible that the dose of domperidone may be increased to 20 mg if symptoms are not adequately controlled on the initial dose. This will be determined by the physician at follow up visits. Maximum dose that will be prescribed is 30 mg four times daily. The study will continue until the medication is FDA approved. The study will look for a 50% reduction of symptoms.</description>
