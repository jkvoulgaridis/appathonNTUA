  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In immediate loading of implants of completely edentulous patients, the most common
      post-surgical complication following the surgery noted in the dental literature is fracture
      of the provisional restoration with rates ranging from 4.17% to 41%. Most of these fractures
      occur because polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) materials are inadequate and have low rigidity
      to withstand extended periods of heavy occlusal use.

      Fractures of full arch provisional restorations during healing are concerning, because they
      eliminate cross-arch stabilization and disrupt stress distribution patterns which might
      jeopardize implant osseointegration affecting the survival rates for implants. Therefore, it
      is important to look for another material that has higher rigidity than PMMA and can
      withstand masticatory forces for extended periods without fractures or load concentration on
      the implants during the osseointegration period.
