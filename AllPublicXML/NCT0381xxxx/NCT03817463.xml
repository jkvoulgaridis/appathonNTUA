        This will be a non-interventional, multi-country cohort study using existing data and
        including adults (≥18 years) with a diagnosis of T2DM. All data will be obtained from
        electronically recorded longitudinal secondary data sources, separately in each included
        country. In each country, patients initiating treatment with empagliflozin or any other
        SGLT-2 inhibitor will be compared with PS-matched patients initiating treatment with any
        DPP-4inhibitor.
