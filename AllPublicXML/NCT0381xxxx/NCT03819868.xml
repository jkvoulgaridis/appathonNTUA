  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The sealing of fossae and fissures is an effective procedure in preventing occlusal caries
      lesions. However, there are gaps regarding its efficacy in the treatment of initial enamel
      lesions. In addition, there are no studies in the literature that have compared the longevity
      of sealings performed with the different sealants available in the market. Thus, the
      objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of fossae and fissures sealings performed
      with a low-cost resinous sealant in occlusal lesions in enamel in permanent and deciduous
      molars. This is a multicenter clinical study of non-inferiority, randomized, controlled,
      double blind (patient and operator) with 60 deciduous molars and 340 permanent molars of
      children 4 and 9 years of age. The sample unit will be the tooth, which will be randomized
      into two groups using a distributed randomization list in mixed envelopes that will be open
      only at the time of the procedure. The teeth allocated in the test group will be treated with
      the sealant preventâ; Those allocated in the control group will employ the Fluroshieldâ
      sealant. In both groups the procedure will follow the manufacturer's standards. The efficacy
      of the sealant will be evaluated by means of clinical and radiographic control at 6, 12 and
      18 months after the procedure. Secondary outcomes, such as retention, cost, acceptability and
      quality of life, will also be evaluated.

    <time_frame>Every 6 months up to 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Caries progression will be evaluated radiographically by three previously trained evaluators (through theoretical classes and evaluation of 13 clinical photographs) and calibrated. These examiners will not know the chronological order and compare the images two to two first by two evaluators and when there is disagreement between the two, the third examiner shall be called for tie-breaker. The possible progression of the treated caries lesion will be codified as:
Present progression: Increased radiolucidity area of the Lesion
Absent progression: No increase in the area of radiolucidity of the lesion.</description>

    <measure>Cost-effectiveness</measure>

    <description>The costs of each treatment procedure will be calculated and compared with thresholds values for intervention costeffectiveness by region, determined by World Health Organization (http://www.who.int/choice/costs/CER_levels/en/).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Impact on children's quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>The oral health related quality of life will be measured using a validated questionnaire according to the children's age. The &quot;Early Childhood Oral Health Impact Scale&quot; (ECOHIS) (Tesch et al., 2008) will be applied with 4-5 years old children. The &quot;Child Perceptions Questionnaire&quot; (CPQ) will be used for 6-9 years old children (Martins et al., 2009).
They will be applied immediately before the procedure and on 18 months follow-up and we will measure the difference between answers at baseline and the end of treatment (18months)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Children self-reported discomfort</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The discomfort of each treatment will be evaluated using the facial scale of Wong-Baker (Wong, Baker, 1988). The patient will be asked to choose the face that is more similar to how he/she felt during the treatment. The answer should be given solely by the child, which means no parental or professional interferences. Each face corresponds to a number, within a numeric scale from 0 to 5, with 0 no discomfort and 5 the greatest discomfort. At the end, the averages of each score will be compared between the experimental groups.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sealant retention</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 6 months up to 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>The elements submitted to the treatment will be codified in accordance with Hesse et al. (2012):
Full retention: When the restorer material was Intact when subjected to clinical examination;
Partial loss: When there was a loss of a part of the restorer material previously applied;
Total Loss: When the restorer material has been lost in its entirety.</description>
