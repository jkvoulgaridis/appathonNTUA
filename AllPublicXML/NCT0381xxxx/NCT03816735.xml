      twice, at baseline and after 1 month. The intravaginal hyaluronic acid suppository therapy
      will be applied daily during the first 10 days and then every third day until the three
      months follow-up.

      At baseline and three months follow-up the following questionnaires will be filled out (VAS,
      (PGI-I, PGI-S, Female Sexual health questionnaire (EORTC), Baessler questionnaire, EORTC
      quality of life questionnaire, ZUF-8).

    <description>A validated self-administered pelvic floor questionnaire (Baessler) will be used to assess urogentinal symptoms. Questions regarding bladder (15), bowel (12), and sexual function (10), and pelvic organ prolapse symptoms (five) are grouped according to the physiological functions of the pelvic floor: bladder function, bowel function, prolapse symptoms, and sexual function domains. Quality of life measures and bothersomeness ratings were integrated into the four domains. Frequency, severity, and bothersomeness of pelvic floor symptoms are assessed using a four-point scoring system for most items in the questionnaire, apart from defecation frequency, bowel consistency, sufficient lubrication, and the reason for sexual abstinence. The lower the score the less pelvic floor symptoms the patients have.</description>

    <description>The fractional microablative laser with 2940 nm wavelength has a high degree of absorption in water and selectively stimulates the synthesis of sub-mucosal collagen. The erbium-doped yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Er:YAG) laser has been successfully used in the field of plastic skin rejuvenation and reconstruction. The procedure is based on photothermic treatment of connective tissue: It has been established in animal and human studies that it affects collagen remodeling resulting in tightening of the supportive tissue.</description>
