      This is a first-in-human, Phase 1, open-label, multicenter, dose escalation study designed to
      determine the safety and tolerability of TRQ15-01 in patients with relapsed/refractory or
      locally advanced solid tumors or lymphomas. The study will include 2 dosing periods: a Dose
      Escalation Phase followed by an Expansion Phase.
