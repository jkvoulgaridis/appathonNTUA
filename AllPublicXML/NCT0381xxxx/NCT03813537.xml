  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized clinical trial among colorectal surgery patients that will compare
      the efficacy of two different discharge protocols - current standard of care follow-up at two
      weeks post-op versus a 3-day phone call intervention. The overall aim of the study is to
      identify areas of improvement for discharging and following patients within 30 days of
      colorectal surgery.

    <textblock>
      This study will be a prospective clinical trial, in which colorectal surgery patients will be
      randomly assigned to a control or experimental group. Patients will be consented and
      randomized prior to discharge.The control group will be discharged with standard of care
      follow-up instructions described by The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center (OSUWMC),
      and scheduled to come in for a standard follow-up clinic visit within 2-3 weeks. The
      experimental group will also be scheduled for a 2-3 week post-op follow-up appointment, but
      will also receive a phone call 3-days post procedure. During this phone call, the patient
      will be asked questions using a study-specific questionnaire that is based on the most
      frequent indications for readmission after colorectal surgery. Based on the responses,
      patients will be advised to maintain the scheduled 2-3 week post-op appointment, visit the
      clinic within 48 hours, or go to the Emergency Department immediately. To determine if
      patients had visited an ED or been readmitted to a hospital within 30 days of colorectal
      surgery, both the standard of care and intervention groups will receive a phone call 30-days
      post-discharge. At this time we will also conduct the Hospital Consumer Assessment of
      Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey to measure patient satisfaction.
