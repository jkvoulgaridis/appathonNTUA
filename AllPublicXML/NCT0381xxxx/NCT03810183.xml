  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory, randomized, subject- and investigator-blind, placebo-controlled,
      parallel group, proof-of-mechanism study in approximately 50 COPD patients with eosinophilia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of a screening period during which the subject's phenotype and eligibility
      for the study will be assessed. All subjects will undergo induction of their sputum to
      examine the baseline sputum cell counts. Subjects will be required to demonstrate both blood
      and sputum eosinophilia to be eligible for participation in the study. Eligible subjects will
      be randomized 3:2 to active (QAW039 orally daily) vs. placebo arms.

      Subjects will continue their standard of care COPD and other medications during the entire
      course of the study.

      Subjects will receive multiple doses of fevipiprant for six weeks, with safety,
      efficacy/pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic assessments performed.

      Sputum induction will be repeated at the end of the treatment period and at the end of the
      study.

    <masking_description>This is a subject and investigator-blinded study. Subjects, investigators and all site staff will remain blinded to study treatment throughout the study.
Unblinding a single subject at site for safety reasons (if necessary for subject management) will occur via an emergency system in place at the site.
The identity of the treatments will be concealed by the use of study drugs that are all identical in packaging, labeling, schedule of administration, appearance, and odor.
The sponsor may be unblinded to the study treatment at any time, especially in case of a safety concern.</masking_description>

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Acceptable and reproducible spirometry with post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC &lt; 0.7 and
             post-bronchodilator FEV1≥ 30 and ≤ 80% of predicted at the screening and baseline
             visits (GOLD stage II or III COPD).

          2. Patients with a physician-diagnosed history of COPD for at least 1 year prior to
             screening visit, and a documented history of at least one COPD exacerbation within the
             year prior to screening visit and on a stable therapy regimen for COPD for at least 4
             weeks prior to screening visit with inhaled glucocorticoid + one or more long acting
             bronchodilator.

          3. Current or ex-smokers who have a smoking history of at least 10 pack-years (10
             pack-years are defined as 20 cigarettes a day for 10 years, or 10 cigarettes a day for
             20 years, or equivalent).

          4. Circulating eosinophils ≥ 300 cells/µL blood AND sputum eosinophils ≥ 3% of total cell
