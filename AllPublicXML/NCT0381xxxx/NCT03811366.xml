      Patients with acute onset Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease (VKHD) was prospectively included in
      this study. They were systematically followed with clinical, posterior segment imaging exams
      and full-field electroretinogram during a minimum 24-month of follow-up. All patients were
      treated with 3-day methylprednisolone pulse therapy followed by 1mg/day oral prednisone with
      a slow tapper during a median of 13 months. Non-steroidal immunosuppressive therapy (IMT) was
      introduced in cases of refractory disease or in cases of prednisone intolerance. Outcome
      measured by full-field electroretinogram was analyzed and patient was grouped as
      electroretinogram stable or electroretinogram worsening. Clinical data was analyzed in these
      two electroretinogram-based groups.

      Consecutive patients with acute onset VKHD were included and followed for a minimum 24-month
      as Part I of an ongoing prospective long-term study on VKHD. The main purpose was to
      understand the course of clinical and subclinical choroidal inflammation in patients
      receiving early and high-dose corticosteroid followed by high-dose oral prednisone and a very
      slow tapper. All patients were followed with clinical and posterior segment imaging (PSI)
      exams, i.e. fundus picture, fluorescein angiography, indocyanine green angiography and
      enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography, at inclusion, 1st month, and thereof
      every three months. Full-field electroretinogram was performed at inclusion, 1st month, and
      thereof every six months. Flare was defined as appearance or increase/worsening of
      inflammatory signs after the initial six-month from disease onset during the predefined
      treatment protocol. Inflammatory signs were cells in anterior chamber, macular edema;
      subclinical inflammatory signs were mainly those observed by PSI exams. Scotopic full-field
      electroretinogram results between 12 and 24 month were the main outcome. Clinical data was
      analyzed in the full-field electroretinogram-based groups.
