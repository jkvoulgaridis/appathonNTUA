      INTRODUCTION: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is recognized as the leading cause of chronic liver
      disease worldwide. However, the screening rate and treatment rate of HCV-infected patients in
      China is low, which increases the burden of patients and the infection risk of their family
      members. WeChat, an instant messaging software, is used in a very high proportion in China.
      Health promotion based on WeChat public platform is a very convenient and effective way of
      health education. Therefore, this study plans to apply WeChat to conduct health intervention
      for HCV-infected patients. The objective is to explore the effect of We-media-based health
      promotion method on the detection rate and treatment rate of HCV-infected and their family
      members.

      METHOD: Recruitment will be conduct in 10 hospitals in Jilin, Beijing, Henan and Anhui
      provinces. The subjects should be patients new diagnosed with hepatitis C at the hospital and
      aged 18 to 69. After signing the consent form, eligible participants were selected through
      the inclusion and exclusion criteria. 1000 participants will be recruited for the trial.
      After completing an baseline reseach by a online questionnaire, patients will be randomly
      assigned to receive a targeted short article on HCV weekly or a general health article with
      no mention of HCV. The intervention will last three months and a follow-up will be conduct at
      three month after the last intervention.

      OUTCOMES: The primary outcome is antiviral therapy. The secondary outcomes are cognition and
      attitude towards hepatitis C, factors influencing antiviral therapy, time to first treatment
      and the compliance of treatment.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of antiviral therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months after the first intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The rate of antiviral therapy is equal to the number of subjects received antiviral therapy divide by the number of all subjects.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to first treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months after the first intervention</time_frame>
    <description>This is the interval time between the first intervention and first treatment. We want to know from this outcome how long it takes the subject to receive the health intervention before starting treatment. Thus, we can analyze the relationship between intervention time and treatment behavior.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cognition and attitude towards hepatitis C</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months after the first intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators designed a standardized questionnaire that asked questions about subjects' knowledge and attitudes toward hepatitis C. The scores of the questionnaire were used to evaluate the cognition and attitude of the subjects.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Factors influencing antiviral therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months after the first intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators designed a ranking question of factors that interfered with the subjects' treatment in the questionnaire. These factors include: (1) My condition is not serious; (2) I am worried about the side effects of treatment; (3) I am afraid of being discriminated against because someone know I have the disease; (4) I have financial difficulties (or the treatment costs are too high); (5) The process of visiting a doctor is complicated. Subjects can also fill in their own ideas in the blank if they have other factors not mentioned in this questionnaire. Investigators will analyze the extent to which each factor affects a patient's treatment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The rate of giving up treatment halfway</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months after the first intervention</time_frame>
    <description>This rate is used to assess compliance with treatment. This rate is equal to the number of subjects who give up treatment halfway divided by the number of subjects who get treatment.</description>
