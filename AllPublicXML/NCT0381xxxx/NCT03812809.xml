      A phase IIb, open-label, single-arm study to assess the safety and efficacy of BPI-7711
      capsule in patients with metastatic or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer with EGFR
      mutation and T790M mutation positive.

    <textblock>
      This is a phase IIb, open-label, single arm study assessing the safety and efficacy of
      BPI-7711 (180 mg, orally, once daily) in China with a confirmed diagnosis of EGFR sensitizing
      mutation positive and T790M mutation+ unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC, who
      have progressed on prior EGFR-TKIs treatment. The primary objective of the study is to assess
      the efficacy of BPI-7711 by assessment of ORR according to RECIST 1.1 by an Independent
      Central Review.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Aged at least 18 years.

          -  Locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC, not amenable to curative surgery or
             radiotherapy.

          -  Radiological documentation of disease progression after the most recent EGFR-TKI
             treatment administered. Radiological documentation of disease progression after the
             most recent treatment, or intolerant to current chemotherapy, or unwilling to accept
             the current treatment.

          -  At least one non-brain measurable lesion, not previously irradiated that can be
             accurately measured at baseline. If only one measurable lesion, the baseline CT should
             be performed before the biopsy or at least 14 days after the biopsy. Prior irradiated
             lesion can only be used as biopsy lesion after significant progression.

          -  Documented EGFR mutation (at any time since the initial diagnosis of NSCLC) known to
             be associated with EGFR TKI sensitivity (including G719X, exon 19 deletion, L858R,
             L861Q).

          -  Patients must have central confirmation of tumor T790M mutation+ status from a biopsy
             sample or a plasma sample taken after confirmation of disease progression on the most
             recent EGFR-TKI treatment. Primary T790M mutation positive patients should provide
             prior written evidence before ICF signature and have not received any EGFR-TKI.

          -  ECOG performance status 0-1 with no deterioration over the previous 2 weeks and a
             minimum life expectancy of 12 weeks.

          -  Females of child-bearing potential using contraception and must have a negative
             pregnancy test.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Confirmed EGFR 20 exon insertion mutation after the initial diagnosis of NSCLC.

          -  Treatment with any 1st or 2nd EGFR-TKI (eg, erlotinib, gefitinib, icotinib, afatinib
             or dacomitinib) within 5x half-life of study entry.

          -  Treatment with any 3rd generation EGFR TKIs target on T790M mutation.

          -  Treatment with any cytotoxic chemotherapy, investigational agents, CYP3A4/CYP2C19
             potent inhibitor/inducer, or other anticancer drugs within 14 days of study entry.

          -  Prior medical history of interstitial lung disease, drug-induced interstitial lung
             disease, radiation pneumonitis which required steroid treatment, or any evidence of
             clinically active interstitial lung disease.

          -  Spinal cord compression or brain metastases unless asymptomatic, stable, and not
             requiring steroids for at least 4 weeks prior to study treatment.

          -  Major surgery within 4 weeks of study entry; radiotherapy treatment to more than 30%
             of the bone marrow or with a wide field of radiation within 4 weeks of study entry.

          -  Refractory nausea and vomiting, chronic gastrointestinal diseases or bowel resection.
