  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic ankle instability is a common condition in the active adult population and
      characterized by the occurrence of repeated giving way and/or recurrent ankle sprains.
      Multiple underlying deficits have been proposed, among which ankle muscle strength deficits,
      proprioception deficits, ( static and dynamic balance disorders, and articular laxity.
      Unfortunately, no consensus exists on which clinical tests should be realized to determine if
      one of these underlying deficits is predominant and as a result could guide the
      rehabilitation process. The study hypothesis is that people with chronic ankle instability
      might be heterogenous and could be divided in different subgroups as a function of underlying
      deficits. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the capacity of different clinical tests to
      differentiate people with chronic ankle instability from healthy people as well as between
      each other.
