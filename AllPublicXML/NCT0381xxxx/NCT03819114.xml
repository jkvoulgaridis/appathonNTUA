    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pharmacokinetic (PK) study is to evaluate if a double dose (3 mg) of
      levonorgestrel (LNG) emergency contraception (EC) overcomes known drug-drug interactions
      (DDIs) with efavirenz (EFV)-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) or rifampicin (RIF)-containing
      tuberculosis (TB) therapy. The safety of double-dose (3.0 mg) LNG EC versus standard-dose
      (1.5 mg) will also be compared.

      This pharmacokinetic (PK) study will evaluate if a double dose (3.0 mg) of levonorgestrel
      (LNG) emergency contraception (EC) overcomes known drug-drug interactions (DDIs) with
      efavirenz (EFV)-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) or rifampicin (RIF)-containing
      tuberculosis (TB) therapy. The safety of double-dose (3.0 mg) LNG EC versus standard-dose
      (1.5 mg) will also be compared.

      Participants will be volunteers who do not currently require EC for contraception. This study
      will enroll women who are 16 years of age or older. Group assignment will be determined by
      infection status (HIV or TB; participants cannot be coinfected), and, for those who are
      living with HIV, by ART regimen at enrollment. Women living with HIV who are taking EFV-based
      ART will be randomized to receive a standard dose LNG EC (Group A) or a double dose of LNG EC
      (Group B). Women taking dolutegravir (DTG)-based ART will be assigned to a standard dose of
      LNG EC (Group C). Women who are HIV-negative and in the continuation phase of active TB
      treatment taking RIF and isoniazid (INH) will be assigned to a double dose of LNG EC (Group
      D).

      At study entry, participants in Groups A and C will receive a standard single dose of LNG EC.
      Participants in Groups B and D will receive a double dose of LNG EC. Intensive PK monitoring
      will be conducted pre-dose, and after the LNG EC dose. Women are expected to be at the
      clinical site while the initial 8 hour PK samples are collected and may return for the 24 and
      48 hour samples.

      All participants will complete self-report questionnaires to assess adherence to TB therapy
      and ART, menstrual history and patterns after LNG EC administration, and to collect adverse
      effects commonly reported with LNG EC (i.e., irregular bleeding patterns). Adherence to ART
      and RIF will be assessed by collecting hair samples and single plasma concentrations at
      entry. All participants will be followed for 4 weeks.

             or HIV enzyme or chemiluminescence immunoassay (E/CIA) test kit at any time prior to
             study entry and confirmed by a licensed Western blot or a second antibody test by a
             method other than the initial rapid HIV and/or E/CIA, or by HIV-1 antigen, plasma
             HIV-1 RNA viral load.

               -  Note: The term &quot;licensed&quot; refers to a US Food and Drug Administration
                  (FDA)-approved kit, which is required for all investigational new drug (IND)
                  studies, or for sites located in countries other than the United States, a kit
                  that has been certified or licensed by an oversight body within that country and
                  validated internally. Non-US sites are encouraged to use US FDA-approved methods
                  for IND studies.

               -  World Health Organization (WHO) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
                  (CDC) guidelines mandate that confirmation of the initial test result must use a
                  test that is different from the one used for the initial assessment. A reactive
                  initial rapid test should be confirmed by either another type of rapid assay or
                  an E/CIA that is based on a different antigen preparation and/or different test
                  principle (e.g., indirect versus competitive), or a Western blot or a plasma

          -  For women who are being treated for TB: HIV-negative at screening, documented within
             the prior 6 months by any licensed rapid HIV test or HIV enzyme or chemiluminescence

             antibody test by a method other than the initial rapid HIV and/or E/CIA, or by HIV-1
             antigen, or plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load.

               -  Note: The term &quot;licensed&quot; refers to a US FDA-approved kit, which is required for
                  all IND studies, or for sites located in countries other than the United States,
                  a kit that has been certified or licensed by an oversight body within that
                  country and validated internally. Non-US sites are encouraged to use US
                  FDA-approved methods for IND studies.

               -  WHO and CDC guidelines mandate that confirmation of the initial test result must
                  use a test that is different from the one used for the initial assessment. A
                  reactive initial rapid test should be confirmed by either another type of rapid
                  assay or an E/CIA that is based on a different antigen preparation and/or
                  different test principle (e.g., indirect versus competitive), or a Western blot
                  or a plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load.

          -  For women who are HIV-negative and being treated for TB: Receiving RIF and INH on a
             once daily dosing (7 days per week) schedule at study entry, after completion of the
             intensive phase of TB treatment.

               -  Note: Inclusion of ethambutol as part of continuation phase of TB therapy is
                  allowed.

          -  Ability and willingness of participant to be contacted remotely for study visits.
