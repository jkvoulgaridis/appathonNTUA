  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators are doing this research study to find out if methylphenidate (MPH) can help
      people with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) or mild dementia likely due to Alzheimer's
      Disease (AD) and related disorders (ADRD).

      The study drug MPH is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat
      Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), but MPH is not approved by the FDA to treat
      Mild Cognitive Impairment or mild dementia related to Alzheimer's Disease. However, other
      studies have been done in which MPH has been given to people with neurodegenerative dementias
      and results have shown some improvement in these people's mood and cognition. Investigators
      would like to see if MPH will help mood and cognition.

      This study will take place completely virtually (with the option to come in for the first
      visit to meet the study team). All study visits will occur over a secure videoconferencing
      platform. All study materials will be shipped directly to the home of each participant.

      Investigators will give participants a supply of study drug. Participants will take the study
      drug by mouth once a day for 16 weeks. It is important for participants to follow our
      instructions about how to take the study drug. Participants can take the drug with or without
      food. Investigators will provide enough study drug for participants to take until the next
      visit.

      Weekly Tasks During the study, certain tasks must be done each week.

      Every Day:

      The following tasks must be done each day throughout the study:

        -  Wear the Fitbit activity tracker

        -  Take study medication

      Six Days per Week:

      The following tasks will be completed six days per week:

        -  Complete Lumosity cognitive games

           o Use Lumosity to rate daily mood and sleep quality

        -  Synchronize Fitbit to study provided iPad tablet

      Once every five days:

      The following activities must be done approximately every five days throughout the trial:

      â€¢ Charge Fitbit during a time

      The study coordinator will periodically log into both the Fitbit dashboard and the Lumosity
      account to check the battery level of the Fitbit, ensure the Fitbit is synching to the Fitbit
      dashboard, and monitor the completion of Lumosity cognitive exercises.
