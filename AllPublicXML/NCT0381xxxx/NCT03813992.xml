             for satisfactory sexual performance at least once')

          3. Subject answers 'yes' to the question regarding the presence of residual EF over the
             past 3 months: 'At home over the past 3 months, have you experienced at least some
             growth of your penis in response to: (1) mechanical stimulation by yourself or your
             partner, or (2) visual stimulation?'

          4. Subject has been involved in a continuous heterosexual relationship for at least 6
             months prior to screening

          5. Documented written informed consent from both subject and his female partner

          6. If the male subject's female partner is of childbearing potential from the time of
             first sexual intercourse attempt during the screening period until the last
             administration of study treatment, then the couple must have been using a medically
             acceptable form of contraception for at least 3 months prior to entering the study,
             and agree to continue such use for at least 1 month after the last study drug
             administration. Subjects who are or wish to become pregnant will not be included in
             the study.

          7. Subject and his female partner are capable of understanding and complying with the

             any study related procedures

          8. Low IIEF-EF scores (≤ 25) during the screening period

        To continue in the open-label extension phase of the study, subjects must meet the

             administration of study treatment, then the couple must have been using a medically
             acceptable form of contraception for at least 3 months prior to entering the study,
             and agree to continue such use for at least 1 month after the last study drug
             administration. Subjects who are or wish to become pregnant will not be included in
             the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any significant or serious cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic, renal,
             gastrointestinal, haematological, endocrinological, metabolic, neurological or
             psychiatric disease which, in the opinion of the PI, renders the subject unfit to take
             part in the study

          2. Subject has any history of an unstable medical or psychiatric condition or using any
             medication that, in the opinion of the PI, is likely to affect the subject's ability
             to complete the study or precludes the subject's participation in the study Certain
             concomitant medications; e.g. other vasodilators, calcium channel blockers,
             angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta blockers, diuretics, anti
             hypertensives, tricyclic anti depressants and major tranquillisers, as well as the
             consumption of alcohol, may potentiate the BP lowering effects of MED2005; therefore,
             the PI must consider this carefully and include subjects at their discretion

          3. Any presence of a symptomatic, active urinary tract infection diagnosed by the PI or
             their delegate at screening or during the study

          4. Any presence of chronic indwelling urethral catheterisation or penile anatomical
             abnormalities (e.g. penile fibrosis) that would significantly impair EF

          5. Any history of operations for Peyronie's disease

          6. Primary hypoactive sexual desire or any history of hypogonadism

          8. Any history of severe/uncontrolled diabetes

          9. Subjects taking two or more anti hypertensives for the treatment of BP

         10. Hypersensitivity to GTN or to any of the excipients, or idiosyncratic reactions to
             other organic nitrates

         11. Concomitant treatment with sildenafil citrate, tadalafil, vardenafil and other PDE 5
             inhibitors

         12. Subjects taking Alpha blockers

         13. Subjects receiving testosterone pellets

         14. Any penile surgery except circumcision

         15. Any treatment with acetyl cysteine within 6 months

         16. Any treatment with dihydroergotamine within 6 months

         17. Postural hypotension, hypotension or uncorrected hypovolaemia, as the use of GTN in
             such states could produce severe hypotension or shock

         18. Increased intracranial pressure (e.g. head trauma or cerebral haemorrhage) or
             inadequate cerebral circulation

         19. Any history of migraine or recurrent headache

         20. Aortic or mitral stenosis

             become pregnant during the course of the study

         25. Confirmed positive results from urine drug screen (amphetamines, benzodiazepines,
             cocaine, cannabinoids, opiates, barbiturates, tricyclic antidepressants and methadone)
             or from the alcohol breath test at screening (for clarification, any positive result
             from the urine drug screen or alcohol breath tests at screening will mean the subject
             will be excluded from the study). In the instance that a subject is using medication
             which may give a positive result, exclusion will be at the PI's discretion

         26. Subject has recent (last 12 months) clinical evidence of alcoholism or drug abuse.

         27. Subject has a positive screen for hepatitis B, consisting of hepatitis B surface
             antigen (HBsAG), hepatitis C antibody, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)

         28. Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory, vital signs or other safety findings
             as determined by medical history, physical examination or other evaluations conducted
             at screening or on admission

         29. Subjects unwilling to cease use of vacuum devices, intracavernosal injections, PDE-5s

         30. Unwillingness of the subject or their partner to agree to make the required attempts
             at sexual intercourse during treatment period

         31. Any history of unresponsiveness to PDE 5 treatment or significant side effects,
             excluding visual disturbances, with PDE 5s

         32. Fewer than four attempts at sexual intercourse during the screening period

         33. Subjects or their partners who are illiterate or are unable to understand the language
             in which the questionnaires are available

         34. Subject has received any investigational product during the 90 days prior to dosing
             for this study

         35. Subject or his partner cannot communicate reliably with the PI

         36. Subjects with severe premature ejaculation (little or no control of ejaculation at the
             time of penetration)

        Subjects are prohibited from participating in the open-label extension phase of the study
        if they meet any of the following exclusion criteria at the follow-up visit of the
        double-blind phase (Visit 6):

          1. Subsequent to recruitment into the double-blind phase of the study, the development of
             any significant or serious cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic, renal,
             gastrointestinal, haematological, endocrinological, metabolic, neurological or
             psychiatric disease which, in the opinion of the PI, renders the subject unfit to
             continue in the open-label extension phase of the study

          2. Subject using any medication that, in the opinion of the PI, is likely to affect the
             subject's ability to complete or participate in the open-label phase of the study.

             NB The concomitant medications listed as exclusion criteria for the study apply to the
             open-label extension phase. Certain concomitant medications; e.g. other vasodilators,
             calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, beta blockers, diuretics, anti
             hypertensives, tricyclic anti depressants and major tranquillisers, as well as the
             consumption of alcohol, may potentiate the BP lowering effects of MED2005; therefore,
             the PI must consider this carefully and include subjects at their discretion

          3. Any presence of a symptomatic, active urinary tract infection diagnosed by the PI or
             their delegate at the start of the open-label extension phase

          4. Subsequent to recruitment into the double-blind phase of the study, the development of
             postural hypotension, hypotension or uncorrected hypovolaemia, increased intracranial
             pressure or inadequate cerebral circulation, any clinically significant vital signs or
             other safety findings as determined by medical history, physical examination or other
             evaluations conducted at Visit 6 prior to recruitment to the open-label phase
