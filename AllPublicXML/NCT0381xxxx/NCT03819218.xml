  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, open-label, single-group, multicentre trial in which the investigational
      product, MC2-01 cream, is investigated in adolescent subjects (age 12 to 16 years, 11 months)
      with clinically diagnosed extensive psoriasis vulgaris.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The MC2-01 cream is designed for optimal patient satisfaction - it quickly absorbs into the
      skin leaving it nicely moisturized allowing patients to move on with daily routines. In this
      trial, subjects who fulfil all inclusion and exclusion criteria are enrolled in the trial and
      will apply one dose of trial medication topically once daily for 8 weeks. The purpose of the
      trial, is to determine the and pharmacokinetic parameters of MC2-01 cream in adolescent
      subjects under maximum use conditions.

    <time_frame>Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Adrenal function will be assessed in a challenge test with an intravenous dose of cosyntropin. Measurement of serum cortisol levels pre- and post- stimulation is an accepted standard method used to evaluate adrenal suppression.
The test consists of an initial blood sampling. Following the blood sample, an intravenous bolus injection of 0.25 mg cosyntropin is given. The serum cortisol concentration 30 min. after will reflect stimulation of the adrenal glands induced by cosyntropin. HPA axis suppression is define as serum cortisol below 18 µg/dL</description>
