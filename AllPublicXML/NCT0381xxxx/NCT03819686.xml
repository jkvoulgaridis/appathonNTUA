  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For most of the patients in the United States with end stage renal disease (ESRD), kidney
      transplantation represents the optimal treatment, and living donor kidney transplantation
      (LDKT) is preferable. Nevertheless, there are pervasive racial disparities in access to LDKT.
      The main outcome of this study is change in the proportion of study participants who have at
      least one living donor inquiry by friends/family over study period.The long-term objective is
      to understand the combined effect of a systems-level intervention (Transplant Referral
      EXchange or T-REX) and a culturally-sensitive individual-level educational intervention
      (web-based Living ACTS: About Choices in Transplantation and Sharing) on racial disparities
      in access to LDKT.

    <textblock>
      For most of the patients in the United States with end stage renal disease (ESRD), kidney
      transplantation represents the optimal treatment. Moreover, living donor kidney
      transplantation (LDKT) offers numerous advantages such as better kidney quality, increased
      short- and long-term graft survival, lower rates of acute rejection, and reduced health care
      cost. Nevertheless, there are pervasive racial disparities in access to LDKT, with white ESRD
      patients four times more likely to receive a LDKT than African American ESRD patients. The
      main outcome of this study is change in the proportion of study participants who have at
      least one living donor inquiry by friends/family over 12 months from baseline.The long-term
      objective is to understand the combined effect of a systems-level intervention that enhances
      communication between dialysis facility and transplant center clinicians (Transplant Referral
      EXchange or T-REX) and a culturally-sensitive individual-level educational intervention
      (web-based Living ACTS: About Choices in Transplantation and Sharing) on racial disparities
      in access to LDKT.

    <description>Data collection form that captures potential recipient ID (i.e. study participant), date of living donor inquiry, and donor inquiry ID, will be securely obtained from each transplant center following a 12 month period from enrollment. Data will be collected electronically for all study participants through a secure, HIPAA-compliant data server (QualityNet). The percent of patients with at least one inquiry from a potential living donor among patients who receive Living ACTS will be compared to those who receive a control website with embedded educational video.</description>

    <description>Usual Care, which involves the provision of standard transplant education procedures at each transplant center, which entail reviewing a packet of information with the pre-transplant coordinator. The packet serves to inform transplant candidates and their families about the option living donor kidney transplantation (LDKT). In addition, participants will be provided an iPad/tablet to watch two 10-minute National Kidney Foundation videos about kidney disease and transplantation in their private room during their regularly scheduled KT evaluation. This video discusses information about transplant, but does not specifically address LDKT and is not culturally-sensitive to African American population.</description>
