  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, single arm study will evaluate the safety of obinutuzumab administered as a
      short duration infusion (SDI; target 90-minute infusion) during cycle 2 and from cycle 2
      onwards in combination with chemotherapy in participants with previously untreated advanced
      follicular lymphoma (FL). The study has two phases: in the first phase, participants will
      receive the first cycle of obinutuzumab-based chemotherapy (G-chemo) induction therapy as
      usual with the first three infusions of obinutuzumab (1000 mg) administered at the regular
      infusion rate on Day 1, 8, and 15 of cycle 1. Phase 2 starts when participants who do not
      experience any Grade ≥ 3 infusion related reactions during the first cycle receive their
      first obintuzumab infusion given at the faster infusion rate in Cycle 2. For Cycle 2, Day 1
      and all other following infusions (including maintenance), obinutuzumab will be administered
      at a faster infusion of 90-minute SDI, as long as the participant does not experience any
      Grade ≥ 3 infusion related reactions. The investigator is free to choose the chemotherapy for
      each participant (bendamustine, CHOP [cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine,
      prednisone/prednisolone/methylprednisolone], or CVP [cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and
      prednisone/prednisolone/methylprednisolone]). The total number of cycles of G-chemo induction
      therapy and the cycles length depends on the chemotherapy chosen for each participant.
