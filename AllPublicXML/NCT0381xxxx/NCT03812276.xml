    <textblock>
      Acqua GM (Grand Morse) Helix implants present an optimized implant design with adapted
      treatment protocol, allowing for treatment of patients with different bone qualities.

      The objective of the study is to prospectively collect clinical data to confirm the long-term
      safety and clinical performance of Acqua GM Helix implants and GM prosthetic abutments in
      daily dental practice setting, by means of success and survival rates of these devices.

      Devices will be used according to standard routine in daily practice, according to all
      indications as specified by the manufacturer in the IFU (instructions for use). patients will
      be followed for 36 months after implant placement.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study protocol was reviewed and approved by an Ethics Committee (CE) in Brazil.

      The sample will be prospectively and consecutively selected and will consist of patients who
      are 18 years of age or older, who are in need of one or more dental implants and who qualify
      for placement of Neodent GM Helix implants. Informed consent in writing will be obtained from
      each patient participating in the study prior to any study related procedure.

      Neodent Acqua GM Helix implants will be placed under local anesthesia and with adequate bone
      bed preparation, as recommended by the manufacturer. Multiple implants may be placed in a
      single subject. Implants will be placed 2mm below the alveolar ridge.

      The selection of the prosthetic component and loading protocol (late or immediate) will be
      conducted according to the need of each subject and to the manufacturer's instructions (IFU).
      Thus, implant immediate loading may be performed (at the discretion of the surgeon) when
      primary stability reach at least 32 N.cm and the patient present physiological occlusion.

      Data concerning the studied variables will be collected by fulfilling the Case Report Form
      (CRF), in the following stages: First visit (Screening); T0 - Implant(s) placement; TL -
      Implant loading; T6, T12, T24 and T36 - 6, 12, 24 and 36 months, respectively, after implant
      placement. A visit window of more or less one month is eligible for each of the planned
      intervals.

      Standardized digital periapical radiographs, computed tomography scans and photographs will
      be obtained in an usual daily practice frequency, as determined by the investigator.

    <description>The Portuguese translation of OHIP-14 [18,19] questionnaire will be used to assess Oral Health Related Quality of Life (OHRQoL), as a measure of patient satisfaction with treatment. Scores will range from 0 (absence of negative impacts on oral health) to 28 (high frequency of negative impacts on oral health).</description>

    <time_frame>Implant placement, 12, 24 and 36 months after implant placement</time_frame>
    <description>The assessment will be performed by means of a questionnaire using a visual analog scale (VAS) in the form of a 10 cm horizontal line, where 0 (left end) indicates minimum satisfaction and 10 (right end) indicates maximum satisfaction. The clinician will be instructed to mark the position considered to best represent their degree of general satisfaction with patient treatment. The score will be measured in centimeters from the left end of the line to the marked point.</description>
