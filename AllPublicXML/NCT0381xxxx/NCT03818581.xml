  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to determine the effect of suvorexant on subjective total sleep time
      (TST) in suboptimally controlled Type 2 diabetics with chronic insomnia in a randomized
      placebo-controlled trial for 3 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes results from a progressive insulin secretory defect on the background of
      insulin resistance and is a growing pandemic and a leading cause of morbidity and mortality.
      Sleep disturbance is one of the underappreciated and important features of Type 2 diabetes,
      and may contribute to the development of the disease. In those with established Type 2
      diabetes, there is emerging evidence from cross-sectional studies that sleep disturbance
      affects glycemic control. Although cross-sectional studies suggest a relationship between
      sleep disturbance and glycemic control in Type 2 diabetes, causality is best investigated by
      interventional studies. Suvorexant has a comparatively benign side effect profile compared to
      many of the hypnotic agents typically prescribed for insomnia. The investigators aim to
      determine the effect of suvorexant on subjective total sleep time (TST), as well as
      subjective wake after sleep onset, Insomnia Severity Index, HbA1c levels and insulin
      sensitivity, inflammatory markers, and other subjective sleep endpoints.
