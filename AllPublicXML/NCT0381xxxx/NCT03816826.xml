  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Muscle strain injuries are common in sports but are often misdiagnosed and maltreated.

      Their significance is often underestimated because most athletes can continue their daily
      activities soon after the injury. Proximal hamstrings strains have attracted greater
      attention because they have a high incidence which is approximately 42%.

      it will be randomized control trial with 60 patients with Acute hamstring Injuries divided
      into 3 groups. One group will be given Laser therapy, 2nd will be given Strain/Counter Strain
      technique and 3rd will be given both the techniques in combination This study will be
      conducted in Rehabilitation setup of Pakistan Hockey Federation Lahore, and Institute of
      Orthopedics and Rehabilitation Center Garden Town Lahore. Non probability Convenience
      Sampling technique will be utilized
