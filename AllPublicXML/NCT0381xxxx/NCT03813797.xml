  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopy by its mini-invasive character has revolutionized abdominal and colorectal
      surgery but certain limitations remains (post-operative pain due to pneumoperitoneum,
      pneumoperitoneum stability, visibility during bleeding, smoke evacuation). The medical device
      for continuous pressure insufflation during laparoscopic procedures Airseal® would allow the
      maintenance of pneumoperitoneum at a lower pressure. The stable low pressure (7mmHg) is
      described in the literature for 15 years as the best way to reduce scapular pain, but until
      the marketing of Airseal, working at 7mmHg was not possible because the space of work was not
      stable. Moreover, this device makes it possible to obtain a better vision because of the
      evacuation of the fumes potentially leading to a reduction in the operating time.

      This research focuses on a medical device that allows the surgeon to perform the surgical
      procedure at a lower pressure than usual.

      The main objective of this study is to compare the duration of hospitalization of patients
      with laparoscopic colectomy at low pressure (5-7 mmHg) versus standard pressure (12-15 mmHg)
      It is a prospective randomized monocentric double blind study

    <masking_description>The study will be carried out:
Blind patient: The patient will not know the group he belongs to, in order to minimize the bias related to the self-evaluation of postoperative pain
Blind for the outpatient evaluator: the surgeon will blindly evaluate the primary endpoint: patient's discharge criteria. This &quot;evaluator&quot; surgeon will be different from the &quot;operator&quot; surgeon The blind will minimize the measurement bias.</masking_description>
