      This research study will collect blood and tumor tissue samples from patients with soft
      tissue sarcoma to look at circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). When tumor cells are
      damaged or die, DNA from the tumor cells are released into the blood stream as the cells
      break down. This is called circulating tumor DNA. Circulating tumor DNA is an important
      biomarker that may be used in cancer detection, prediction of treatment response, and disease
      monitoring.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Researchers are continually looking for ways to understand the biology of cancer such as
      sarcoma, and ways to improve cancer care and patient outcome.

      Research has shown that changes in some genes and/or proteins, called biomarkers, may be
      important indicators for certain cancers and response to treatments. Genes are molecules made
      up of ribonucleic acid (RNA) and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). DNA contain instructions for
      the development and functioning of the cells in the body and are passed down from parent to
      child. RNA is involved with producing proteins in the body. Further research is needed to
      better understand the changes found in cancer cells and what this means for certain
      treatments.

      Circulating tumor DNA is an important biomarker that may be used in cancer detection,
      prediction of treatment response and disease monitoring. When tumor cells are damaged or die,
      DNA from the tumor cells are released into the blood stream as the cells break down. This is
      called circulating tumor DNA. Researchers are looking for better ways to detect circulating
      tumor DNA so that it can be studied.

      The purpose of this study is to determine how feasible it is to detect circulating tumor DNA
      in blood samples of soft tissue sarcoma patients and whether there is a connection between
      circulating tumor DNA and the likelihood of patients' disease coming back after they receive
      treatment. To do this, blood and tumor tissue samples will be collected from participants and
      will undergo DNA testing (reading the contents of their DNA, called sequencing). The results
      of the DNA testing in the blood samples will be compared with the results from DNA testing
      that will also be done on tumor tissue. The results will also be compared with participant's
      response to their treatment, recurrence, and/or long term survival.
