  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial of a low income and low health literacy population of
      pregnant women from a diverse racial and ethnic background to assess the effectiveness of a
      pre-visit educational video on prenatal genetic screening and testing options.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During pregnancy, women are routinely counseled about the risks of their offspring to have a
      chromosomal abnormality or birth defects. Both prenatal screening and diagnostic testing
      options to exclude aneuploidy should be offered to all pregnant women early in their
      pregnancy. A standardized educational video on prenatal screening may enhance a patient's
      understanding and knowledge of testing and support more informed decisions.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate and compare patient knowledge scores on prenatal
      genetic screening before and after a standard prenatal care visit compared to the addition of
      a pre-appointment educational video.

    <intervention_model_description>Primary purpose: assess and compare patient knowledge on prenatal genetic screening before and after a standard prenatal care visit compared to the addition of a pre-appointment educational video.
All participants will complete a 15-item questionnaire on prenatal genetic screening options at baseline and after routine prenatal care visit.
Participants randomized to the control group, will have a routine prenatal care appoinment, while the intervention group will watch a pre-appointment 4.5 minute educational video entitled &quot;How to decide about prenatal genetic testing&quot;.</intervention_model_description>
