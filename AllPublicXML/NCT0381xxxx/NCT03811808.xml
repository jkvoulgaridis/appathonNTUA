    <textblock>
      This is a prospective cohort study to examine the disease burden of multiple system atrophy
      and the impact of multidisciplinary care on quality of life and caregiver burden. Data will
      be collected through valid rating scales completed by patients and caregivers at home or in
      the MSA clinic.

      Study Procedures:

      Participants and caregivers will attend a multidisciplinary MSA clinic one day every four
      months. In addition to the standard of care, they will be asked to complete both online and
      paper questionnaires, including the following:

        -  UMSARS (Unified MSA Rating Scale)

        -  MSA QOL

        -  CES-D

        -  OHQ

        -  Compass-31

        -  BIC

        -  UPDRS

        -  SARA

        -  MDS Scale

        -  CGI

        -  MoCA

      Participants will be part of the study as long as they are a patient of the MSA clinic, and
      will be contacted for follow-up information up to five years.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Multiple System Atrophy-Quality of Life (MSA-QoL)</measure>
    <time_frame>at 5 year evaluation</time_frame>
    <description>The disease burden of MSA and impact of multidisciplinary care on the quality of life of patients as measured by the MSA-Quality of Life (QOL) questionnaire completed every four months by the patients. The scale measures how MSA affects a person's quality of life in day to day activities. The scale ranges from No problem to Extreme Problem. The More Extreme Problem sections selected the more their quality of life is affected by the disease.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Unified Multiple System Atrophy Rating Scale (UMSARS)</measure>
    <time_frame>at 5 year evaluation</time_frame>
    <description>The UMSARS completed every four months by the physician. The scale measures how MSA has progressed from baseline. The higher the score the higher the progression is.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Caregiver Burden Index/ The Zarit Burden Interview</measure>
    <time_frame>at 5 year evaluation</time_frame>
    <description>The disease burden of MSA and impact of multidisciplinary care on caregiver burden as measured by the Burden Index of Caregivers (BIC) questionnaire and The Zarit Burden Interview completed every four months by the caregivers. The higher the higher the score the more burden the caregiver has.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Composite Autonomic Symptom Score (CONPASS 31)</measure>
    <time_frame>at 5 year evaluation</time_frame>
    <description>Compass 31 scale includes 31 questions and it will be used to assess autonomic symptoms that provides clinically relevant scores of autonomic symptom severity based. The higher the score the more autonomic symptoms present</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D)</measure>
    <time_frame>at 5 year evaluation</time_frame>
    <description>The CES-D measures symptoms defined by the American Psychiatric Association' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-V) for a major depressive episode. The higher the scores and indicative for depression present.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>The Orthostatic Hypotension Questionnaire (OHQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>at 5 year evaluation</time_frame>
