    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of RespiLife diagnostic technology for
      detection of respiratory rate and oxygen saturation in human subjects. This includes
      evaluation of Bioresp's RespiLife and its accuracy for measurement of respiratory rate and
      oxygen saturation.
