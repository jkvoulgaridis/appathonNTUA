  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Violence has immediate effects on women's health, which in some cases, is fatal. Physical,
      mental and behavioural health consequences can also persist long after the violence has
      stopped. Violence against women and girls occurs in every country and culture and is rooted
      in social and cultural attitudes and norms that privilege men over women and boys over girls.

      Research consistently finds that the more severe the abuse, the greater its impact on women's
      physical and mental health. In addition, the negative health consequences can persist long
      after abuse has stopped.Present work shares the impact of arsha vidya counselling for women
      who has been victim of violence.
