  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine (i) the magnitude of immediate and sustained effects of a current
      clinical standard interactive computer attention processing training (APT) when combined with
      intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS), a type of repetitive transcranial magnetic
      stimulation and (ii) determine how APT + iTBS changes the neurocognitive system of attention
      in individuals with persistent attention deficits related to mTBI and PTSD.

    <description>real APT+ real iTBS included 30 1-hour treatment sessions will be provided 3/week. Sessions will be conducted for 10 weeks. APT-III is a computer based cognitive training program. iTMS will be applied at 5Hz rate; each burst consists of 3 pulses delivered at 50Hz rate. The bursts are applied for 2s with 8s inter-burst-intervals, for a total of 600 pulses. The total stimulation time per session is approximately 192s (~ 3 minutes). Participants randomized to active iTBS will receive stimulation at the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex at 80% active motor threshold .</description>

    <description>Intermittent Theta Burst Stimulation (iTBS) is a form of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), which uses short magnetic field pulses applied to the scalp to induce currents in the underlying brain. iTBS will be delivered with the Magventure MagProX100 with MagOption stimulator and Magpro Cool Coil B65 A/P. The Magpro Cool Coil B65 A/P can be switched to active or placebo (A/P).</description>
