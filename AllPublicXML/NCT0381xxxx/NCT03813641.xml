  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Raltitrexed is an inhibitor of thymidylate synthase.As a folate antimetabolite drug,
      raltitrexed has been used in treatment of colorectal cancer(CRC) since 1998, and also used in
      malignant mesothelioma.Several phase III studies performed in patients with advanced CRC
      showed that it is as effective as 5-fluorouracil(5-FU) /leucovorin(LV) with regard to
      response rates and survival. The combination of raltitrexed with oxaliplatin shows response
      rates of 41%-54% and median survivals of 14.6-14.8 months, which are comparable to those
      achieved with 5-FU/LV combination with oxaliplatin. This study discussed the efficacy and
      safety of raltitrexed-oxaliplatin(RALOX) combined with bevacizumab or
      capecitabine-oxaliplatin(CAPOX) combined with bevacizumab in first-line treatment of patients
      with advanced colorectal cancer who could not undergo radical surgery. The main endpoint will
      be progression free survival (PFS). The secondary endpoints will be overall survival,
      objective response rate and disease control rate (OS,ORR and DCR).It is expected that
      raltitrexed may be one of options for the treatment of advanced CRC in the first-line
      setting.

      According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the patients will be randomly divided into
      two groups: the experimental group (group A) will be administered with raltitrexed 3mg/m2
      intravenously combined with oxaliplatin and bevacizumab, repeated every 21 days. The control
      group (group B) will be administered with orally capecitabine (1000mg/m2, d 1-14) combined
      with oxaliplatin and bevacizumab, repeated every 21 days. After 8 cycles of treatments, if
      evaluated as complete response(CR),partial response(PR) or stable disease(SD), CRC patients
      will go into maintenance therapy wtih raltitrexed combined with bevacizumab in group A or
      capecitabine combined with bevacizumab in group B respectively, ended in disease
      progression(PD) , symptoms deterioration, unacceptable toxicity, death or withdrawal of
      consent (whichever occurs first). The radiological efficacy will be evaluated every 6 weeks
      (2 treatment cycles) and non-PD (PD criteria referring to RECIST 1.1 criteria) patients will
      continue to be treated until the cancer progression or the patient's intolerable toxicity or
      death. Toxic side effects and quality of life will be assessed at the same time.

      Follow up participants and analyse primary endpoint (PFS) and secondary endpoints (OS,ORR and
      DCR).The causes of confirmed missing data in the trial should be recorded in detail to
      determine the mechanism of missing data and choose the suitable missing data handling
      methods.

    <measure>Progression-free Survival (PFS) Time</measure>
    <time_frame>The follow-up period ranges from the first patient recruited to the last patient within 6 months after admission, up to 2 years.</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time from the date of randomization until the date of objectively determined progressive disease (PD) [according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version (v). 1.1] or death due to any cause, whichever will be first. PD is at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 millimeters (mm). Participants who died without a reported prior progression will be considered to have progressed on the day of their death. Participants who do not progress or be lost to follow-up will be censored at the day of their last radiographic tumor assessment.</description>

    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>The follow-up period ranges from the first patient recruited to the last patient within 6 months after admission,up to 2 years.</time_frame>
    <description>OS is defined as the time in months from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause. For participants not known to have died as of the cut-off date, OS will be censored at the last known date alive.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving an Objective Response (Objective Response Rate)</measure>
    <time_frame>The follow-up period ranges from the first patient recruited to the last patient within 3 months after admission.</time_frame>
    <description>The objective response rate is equal to the proportion of participants achieving a best overall response of partial response or complete response (PR + CR). Response is defined using RECIST, v. 1.1 criteria. CR is defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm and normalization of tumor marker level of non-target lesions; PR is defined as having at least a 30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum diameter.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving a Stable Disease (SD) or a confirmed CR or PR (Disease Control Rate)</measure>
    <time_frame>The follow-up period ranges from the first patient recruited to the last patient within 3 months after admission.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants achieved disease control if they have a best overall response of CR, PR or SD. According to RECIST v1.1, CR is the disappearance of all non-nodal target lesions, with the short axes of any target lymph node reduced to &lt;10 mm, the disappearance of all non-target lesions, and the normalization of tumor marker levels (if tumor markers were initially above the ULN); PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions (including the short axes of any target lymph node), taking as reference the baseline sum diameter. SD is neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify as PR nor sufficient increase to qualify as PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameter since treatment started.</description>
