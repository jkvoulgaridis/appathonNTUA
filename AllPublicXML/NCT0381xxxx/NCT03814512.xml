    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to deliver a 4-week sleep extension intervention to adolescents to
      evaluate feasibility of the protocol and obtain preliminary data on intra-individual changes
      in metabolic parameters induced by sleep extension.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The specific aims of this feasibility study are to 1) examine the feasibility of recruitment
      and retention of adolescents with overweight/obesity, pre-diabetes, and inadequate sleep into
      a sleep extension intervention; 2) assess adherence of a sleep extension intervention to
      increase total sleep time in adolescents with overweight/obesity, pre-diabetes, and
      inadequate sleep; 3) determine estimates of mean and variability of potential intervention
      outcomes including metabolomic, body composition, and substrate oxidation. The investigators
      propose to deliver a 4-week sleep extension intervention to adolescents to evaluate
      feasibility of the protocol and obtain preliminary data on intra-individual changes in
      metabolic parameters induced by sleep extension.

      This proposal is the first step to demonstrate feasibility in delivering the intervention in
      a research setting, measure the effect of the intervention on changing sleep duration, and
      examine changes in obesity-related IR metabolites that would lead to improved IR in an
      adolescent population with pre-diabetes. The long-term goal is to disseminate an effective
      and feasible T2D prevention program that can be sustainably implemented in clinical weight
      management settings.

    <description>Participants will receive a Standard Care Diet and Physical Activity Education Intervention (SC) and an Extended Sleep Intervention (ES). For the SC, participants will have their diet, physical activity, and screen time assessed by study interventionist. Prescribed goals will be determined collaboratively through discussion with participants and parents. For the ES, participants will subsequently be prescribed a sleep schedule that allows them to obtain 1.5 h more time in bed compared to their typical sleep. Prescribed bedtimes and wake times will be determined collaboratively.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. High school students between the age of 13-19 years

          2. BMI &gt;85th percentile for age and sex

          3. Prediabetes defined as a HbA1c 5.7-6.4%

          4. Tanner Stage 4-5 (based on breast development for girls and testicular size for boys)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any medications that affect insulin resistance or sleep (e.g., metformin, stimulants,
             atypical antipsychotics, current use of oral steroids)

          2. Regular use of melatonin or other sleep aids

          3. A prior diagnosis of a sleep disorder (e.g. insomnia, delayed sleep phase syndrome,
             obstructive sleep apnea) or abnormal scores on sleep disorders screening measures

          4. Type 2 diabetes (HbA1c â‰¥ 6.5%)

          5. IQ&lt;70 or severe mental illness that may impact sleep or ability to consent/assent
             (e.g., schizophrenia, psychotic episodes), verified through chart review

          6. Teens not enrolled in a traditional high school academic program (e.g., home school
             students)

          7. Schedules that would preclude participants from adhering to the sleep extension
             protocol (e.g. night shift employment)

          8. Travel across more than two time zones in the 2 weeks prior to the study
