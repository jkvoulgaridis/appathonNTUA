  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to evaluate whether pulse oximetry based noninvasive
      hemoglobin (SpHb) monitoring can reduce the incidence of hemoglobin (Hb) level out of the
      target range in adult patients undergoing major surgery with the potential risk of bleeding.
