          4. Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks

          5. Aged ≥ 18 years of age

          6. Adequate Bone marrow function:

               -  Absolute neutrophils grade 0 or 1 (using CTCAE v5)

             estimated using validated creatinine clearance calculation (e.g. Cockcroft-Gault or
             Wright formula). If calculated GFR is &lt; 50 mL/min then an isotope GFR assessment
             (Cr51-EDTA or 99mTc-DTPA) should be performed. If an isotope GFR test is unavailable
             an estimation from 24 hour urine collection may be used

          8. Adequate liver function:

             Serum bilirubin grade 0 or 1 AST and ALT grade 0 or 1 (up to grade 2 for patients with
             liver metastases)

          9. Willing to use contraception for the duration of trial treatment and for 120 days
             after completion of treatment

         10. Willing to have a new biopsy, if site of disease is accessible and considered safe to
             biopsy by investigator If newly obtained samples cannot be obtained (e.g. inaccessible
             disease or patient safety concern) sites may submit archival tissue only upon
             agreement from the sponsor

         11. Able to give informed consent, indicating that the patient has been informed of and
             understands the experimental nature of the study, possible risks and benefits, trial
             procedures, and alternative options

          1. Patients with undifferentiated nasopharyngeal or sino-nasal cancers

          2. Disease suitable for treatment with curative intent

          3. Prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1 or anti-PD-L2 agent

          4. Any investigational agents within 4 weeks prior to registration

          9. Grade 3 or 4 peripheral neuropathy

         10. Any serious and/or unstable pre-existing medical, psychiatric or other condition that,
             in the treating clinician's judgment, could interfere with patient safety or obtaining
             informed consent

         11. Active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis;
             subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they:

             other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of trial

             consultation with UCL CTC)

         19. Active autoimmune disease that might deteriorate when receiving an immune-stimulatory
             agent. Patients with the following are eligible:

         20. Current use of immunosuppressive medication, except for the following:

        intranasal, inhaled, topical steroids, or local steroid injection (e.g., intra-articular
        injection) Systemic corticosteroids at physiologic doses ≤ 10 mg/day of prednisolone or
        equivalent (after approval by UCL CTC) Steroids as premedication for hypersensitivity
        reactions (e.g., CT scan premedication)

        *Testing for HIV for the POPPY trial is not mandatory, however if this test has been done
