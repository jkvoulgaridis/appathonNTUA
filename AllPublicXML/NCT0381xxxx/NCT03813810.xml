  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of air pollution on the occurrence and
      clinical course of chronic respiratory diseases, and discover new biomarkers from various
      devices such as CT images that can indicate the process and amount of lung damage caused by
      air pollution.

      Accordingly, the investigators have designed an prospective cohort with enrollment of normal
      people and patients with chronic respiratory diseases of three different categories (chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis). Participants will be
      followed up for a period of one year, with evaluation of the clinical course of the
      respiratory disease and exposure to air pollution.

      Normal people (n=90) and patients with chronic respiratory diseases (chronic obstructive
      pulmonary disease, asthma, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, n=90 for each disease) will be
      enrolled at 5 different institutions in South Korea and followed up for one year.
      Inspiratory-expiratory CTs and tests including physical examination and blood/urine tests
      would be performed at the time of enrollment and the time at completion of the follow up
      period for each participant. Participants would be checked for the residency and working
      places, as well as checked for the amount of air pollution exposure using a wearable
      measurement device for 5 days during the study period ( time at enrollment / 3 months / 6
      months / 9 months / time at completion). The device would cause no effect on usual daily life
      or the medical status of the participant. The clinical course such as occurrence of disease,
      acute exacerbation, decline of lung function, imaging status, mortality would be evaluated as
      well as the exposure of air pollution for each individual.
