    <textblock>
      Injuries to the ankle joint account for 20% of the population that is afﬂicted with joint
      injury and the largest percentage of self-reported musculoskeletal injuries (&gt; 10%) are to
      the ankle. Ankle sprain has a large portion in ankle injuries and occurs not only in the
      sporting population but also in the general community. Although the acute symptom would be
      resolve quickly, but many people still report persisting problems, such as pain and
      instability. Chronic ankle instability (CAI) is one of the most common of these residual
      problems.

      Kinesio Tape and White Duck Tape are often applied in patients with CAI, attempt to increase
      the ankle joint stability, and improve motor performance. However, the previous studies had
      controversial result to the effects of kinesio tape and white duck tape. The previous studies
      also showed the insufficient of supporting force and elasticity of kinesio tape and white
      duct tape. The Dynamic Tape was developed by Kendrick in 2009, which refined the
      characteristic of elasticity and supporting force.

      Therefore the purpose of study is to comparison the effects of static and dynamic balance
      performance, weight shifting ability and functional movement between kinesio tape, white duck
      tape and dynamic tape when applied on patients with CAI. With the result may provide an
      optical method to increase the movement performance of patients with CAI.

      The study suspected to recruit 90 volunteers with CAI, and randomly divided to three
      different groups: Kinesio tape group, White duck tape group and Dynamic tape group. We make
      postural stability test and limit postural stability test with Biodex Balance System (SD),
      Y-balance test and single leg hop test to both affected side and sound side foot before
      applying the tape. After applying the tape according to the divided group, we will repeat the
      test above again. We will compare the results of the test between groups and within groups.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. A history of at least one signiﬁcant ankle sprain

               -  The initial sprain must have occurred at least 12 months prior to the study
                  enrolment

               -  Was associated with inﬂammatory symptoms (pain, swelling, etc)

               -  Created at least one interrupted day of desired physical activity

          2. A history of the previously injured ankle joint 'giving way' , and /or recurrent
             sprain and/or 'feelings of instability'.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. A history of previous surgeries to the musculoskeletal structures (ie, bones, joint
             structures and nerves) in either lower extremity.

          2. A history of a fracture in either lower extremity requiring realignment.

          3. Acute injury to the musculoskeletal structures of other joints of the lower extremity
             in the previous 1 months, which impacted joint integrity and function (ie, sprains,
             fractures) resulting in at least 1 interrupted day of desired physical activity.
