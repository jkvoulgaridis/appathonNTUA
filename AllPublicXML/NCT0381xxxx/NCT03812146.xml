  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to develop and test an integrated brief intervention to reduce heavy
      alcohol use and PTSD severity in veterans receiving Veterans Affairs Primary Care. Standard
      brief alcohol interventions have been unsuccessful in reducing heavy drinking in traumatized
      individuals and current integrated treatment for alcohol use disorder and PTSD are too long
      to be delivered in Primary Care. Therefore, this application addresses this gap by developing
      an intervention tailored to the specific needs of heavy drinking veterans who have co-
      occurring PTSD. This study aims to incorporate two evidenced-based interventions: Brief
      Motivational Interviewing (BMI) with Prolonged Exposure for Primary Care (PE-PC). This newly
      developed brief intervention will be piloted in an open trial to gather veteran participant
      feedback and develop clinician training and fidelity procedures.

    <time_frame>Baseline and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This 30-item structured interview assesses DSM-5 symptoms of Posttraumatic stress disorder. It includes assessment of traumatic events and symptom severity ratings are based on symptom frequency and intensity. CAPS-5 total symptom severity score ranges 0-80, with higher scores representing higher severity (worse outcome).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 weeks, 14 weeks, and 20 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Timeline Follow-back instrument is presented as a 30-day calendar and it is used to obtain count estimates of daily drinking.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Post-intervention Treatment Engagement</measure>
    <time_frame>20 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>With HIPAA authorization, information from participants' VA administrative data will be extracted to assess if treatment condition relates to engagement in specialty treatment. Number of mental health or substance use visits attended between enrollment and 20 week follow-up will be extracted for each participant.</description>

    <measure>Change in Depressive Symptom Severity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 weeks, 14 weeks, and 20 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) is a 9-item self-report measure used to assess depressive symptoms at each time point to evaluate change in severity. The PHQ-9 is a standard VA instrument with good psychometric properties. Scores range 0-27 with higher scores representing higher depressive symptom severity (worse outcome).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Quality of Life perceptions</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 weeks, 14 weeks, and 20 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHO QOL) instrument is a 26-item self-report measure used to assess individual's perception of quality of life in quality of life in physical, psychological, social relationships, and environment domains. Domain scores are scaled in a positive direction (i.e. higher scores denote higher quality of life) for each domain - physical (range 7-35); psychological (range 6-30); social relationship (range 3-15); environment (range 8-40).</description>

    <description>PC-TIME consists of meeting with a behavioral health provider for 5, 30-minute sessions that will be delivered over the course of 8 weeks (spaced about 1-2 weeks apart). PC-TIME sessions integrate two effective treatments: motivational enhancement therapy approaches and brief Prolonged Exposure.</description>

    <description>Primary Care - treatment as usual. Participants in PC-TAU will be referred to the PCMHI mental health provider within their primary care team, and will receive whichever care or intervention is typically provided. PCMHI in VA consists of licensed, independent providers (typically psychologists or clinical social workers) providing brief assessment and interventions to veterans and consultation to other members of the PC team.</description>

    <description>PC-TAU consists of Brief Advice intervention from their PC medical provider that is built into the electronic medical record as a mandatory response to a positive screen. In addition, patients who score positive on the AUDIT-C or PC-PTSD are offered a referral to the PCMHI provider within the PC clinic. PCMHI in VA consists of licensed, independent providers (typically psychologists or clinical social workers) providing brief assessment and interventions to veterans and consultation to other members of the PC team. PCMHI sessions are typically focused on assessment, psycho-education, and supportive counseling.</description>
