  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although the mirror therapy is recognized as effective, its practice is difficult, especially
      with hemiplegic patients. It is difficult for them to understand, control the movements and
      carry out a double task with the two upper limbs. The implementation of a Computerized Mirror
      Therapy (CMT) with the Intensive Visual Simulation 3 (IVS3) device makes it possible to limit
      these problems by proposing pre-recorded sessions, not limited to the right or left
      hemi-space, and proposing a work on proximal motricity. Since the functional prognosis of the
      upper hemiplegic limb remains mostly unfavourable, a wide range of interventions should be
      proposed. There is currently a consensus to consider the use of transcranial Direct Current
      Stimulation (tDCS) stimulation in functional recovery after stroke as a method to enhance the
      effectiveness of training techniques. Although all motor therapies can theoretically benefit
      from increased effectiveness by the addition of transcranial Direct Current Stimulation
      (tDCS), Computerized Mirror Therapy (CMT) has a high potential for sensitivity to
      transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) due to the intensity of the motor training of
      the upper limb applied.

      The primary objective of this study is to investigate the feasibility of a program combining
      Computerized Mirror Therapy (CMT) with dual- transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS)
      stimulation by evaluating observance to hemiparetic stroke patients.
