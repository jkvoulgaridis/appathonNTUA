  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Reducing food portion size is a potential strategy to reduce energy intake. However it is
      unclear at what point consumers compensate for reductions in portion size by increasing
      energy intake from other items. This could result in no overall benefit of reducing food
      portion sizes. The investigators tested the hypothesis that reductions to the portion size of
      components of a main meal will only result in significant compensatory eating when the
      reduced portion size is no longer visually perceived as 'normal'. In a crossover experiment,
      participants were served different sized portions during lunch and dinner over 5 days: a
      'large-normal', a 'small-normal', and a 'smaller than normal' portion. Intake from all other
      meal components consumed in the laboratory were measured.
