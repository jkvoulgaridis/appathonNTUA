  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Emergency medicine is notorious for its high rate of burnout and mental health issues. The
      emergency department (ED) is a high paced work environment dealing with life and death
      issues. Employees in the ED work shift times that are not conducive to a natural circadian
      rhythm. All of these factors lead to high rates of burnout and overall dissatisfaction with
      their career choice. These are known downsides of a career in emergency medicine, but little
      effort is put into addressing this issue in everyday EDs.

      Cell phones offer an easy and convenient means to participate in meditation. There are
      multiple evidence-based meditation apps available to cell phone users free of charge.
      Meditation has been shown to decrease burnout, rates of depression, and rates of anxiety. We
      hypothesize that weekly use of a meditation-based cell phone application will improve the
      mental health of emergency department employees as measured on various wellness inventories.
