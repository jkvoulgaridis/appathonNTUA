  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most children diagnosed with craniosynostosis undergo a relatively extensive cranial vault
      remodeling procedure. The decision of performing surgical cranial shape correction for
      patients with craniosynostosis typically rests on a subjective visual assessment of the
      severity of the cranial malformation and the main goal of this procedure is to reduce the
      risk of elevated intracranial pressure and to provide a more normal cranial shape and volume.
      Personalized surgical planning systems to optimize intervention and leverage surgical
      expertise in the reconstruction of the cranial vault do not exist. Thus, the expertise of the
      surgeon is paramount for the success of the surgical correction of craniosynostosis. The goal
      of our project is to evaluate the feasibility and utility of a surgical plan derived from
      software developed at Children's National, iCSPlan.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Presurgical planning will be performed in patients that require an open crania-vault
      reconstruction for craniosynostosis. The participants will come from the outpatient clinics
      of neurosurgery and plastic surgery. The treating physician/study team member will explain
      and give a copy of Institutional review board (IRB) approved study information letter to the
      participant's legally authorized representative (LAR).

      The investigators will acquire a pre-operative CT-scan, per standard of care, to help assess
      the synostosis severity, within 4 weeks before the procedure. A week before the surgery, a
      routine preoperative visit will be done where the participant and/or LAR, if agree to
      participate in the study, will sign the informed consent document(s).

      A presurgical plan will be built and will be recorded in a software, iCSPlan. Although this
      plan will not be integrated in the OR workflow, if needed, it would be visualized on a
      desktop monitor, which will be available to the surgical team. This tool will not influence
      any clinical decision making in the study. Instead, it will work as a rely-on tool in the
      preparation of the surgery, which may or may not be followed by the surgeon.

      Demographic information (sex, age), as well as intraoperative information (Anesthesia length,
      anesthesia medications, length of surgery, blood loss, # of blood units transfused,
      complications), will be recorded for analysis. These variables are generally recorded during
      surgery and add no additional operative time.

      Following the surgery, the specialists will evaluate the feasibility of the use of the
      presurgical plan by completing a questionnaire to report their options on (1): Quality of the
      surgical outcome; (2) the quality of the surgical strategy, and (3) the utility of the
      surgical planning in the treatment. The questions will be answered on a 5-point Likert scale,
      ranging from &quot;not useful/strongly dislike&quot; to &quot;very useful/strongly like&quot;.

      All study team pre-screening materials that contain participants information will be
      maintained on password protected computers. Only authorized study team members will have
      access to the pre-screening materials. Any pre-screening protected health information (PHI)
      that is collected will be destroyed once study enrollment is completed.

    <description>The Investigator will acquire a routine pre-operative CT-scan to help assess the synostosis severity. A week before the surgery a routine preoperative visit will be done. If the potential subject agrees to participate in the study, a presurgical plan will be built, and based on the CT scan, it will (1) quantify shape differences between pathological and healthy cranial shapes; (2) compensates for brain and cranial growth during the months between diagnosis, treatment and recovery; and (3) guides bone-cuts and bone-placement for the simplest and optimal surgical procedure.
Finally this plan will be recorded in a software, iCSPlan, which will be reviewed by the surgeon. If it is accepted, it will be available during the surgery as a rely-on tool which may or may not be followed.</description>
