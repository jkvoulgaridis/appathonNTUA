      The study will evaluate if the supraclavicular fossa ultrasound view can be used to achieve a
      correct catheter tip placement in infraclavicular right subclavian central venous catheter
      placement. This may make routine post-procedural x-ray exams redundant.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Central venous catheterization is one of the most common procedures within intensive care
      medicine. Verification of correct catheter tip placement is a primary aspect of safety and
      quality of central venous catheterization as malposition may lead to life-threatening
      complications such as thrombosis, hemothorax, cardiac tamponade, and arrhythmias.
      Conventional chest x-ray (CXR) is routinely performed after every insertion and is considered
      gold standard to examine catheter tip location and evaluate for complications such as pneumo-
      and hemothorax. However, CXR exposes the patient to ionized radiation, requires a
      considerable amount of time, and is workload-generating for both ICU and radiology staff.

      Weber et al has described the use of the right supraclavicular fossa view for real-time
      ultrasound-guided placement of a central venous catheter (CVC) via the right internal jugular
      vein (IJV) in adults. This approach has subsequently been validated in a clinical study and
      has also been used for supraclavicular subclavian line insertion. The approach requires use
      of a microconvex probe, which couples good image resolution and high scanning depth. The use
      of a microconvex probe for infraclavicular subclavian central venous catheter (CVC) insertion
      has been described previously, but this is the first description of the supraclavicular fossa
      ultrasound view to guide correct catheter tip placement in infraclavicular right subclavian
      CVC placement.

    <description>Following insertion of at least 20 cm of the guidewire into the right subclavian vein, the probe is shifted to the right supraclavicular fossa to scan the right internal jugular vein in order to exclude malposition of the guidewire. The probe is then tilted in a caudal direction to obtain a view of the guidewire within the superior vena cava. Misplaced guidewires will be corrected under real-time ultrasound guidance.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Indication for central venous catheter placement.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Operator unable to visualize the subclavian vein (e.g., in those with subcutaneous
             emphysema of the chest wall),

          -  Subclavian vein catheterization deemed inappropriate by the operator,

          -  Central line/pacemaker/similar device already in place (risk for misinterpretation of
             the ultrasound image)
