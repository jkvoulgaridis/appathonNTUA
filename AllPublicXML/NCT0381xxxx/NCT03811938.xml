  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a disorganised rhythm of the upper chambers of the
      heart. It can lead to severe complications including stroke or heart failure. It can be
      treated with radiofrequency ablation (RFA). This technology works by heating heart muscle
      inside the heart to break the electrical circuits responsible for the abnormal rhythm.

      The energy is delivered into the heart with plastic tubes that have metal electrodes,
      inserted through the groin veins and removed after the procedure. The patient is usually put
      to sleep during the intervention.

      If the AF has been present for more than seven days but for less than one year it is called
      persistent, and it can be difficult to treat successfully with the usual methods.

      Goals. The study will test a new RFA technique to treat patients with persistent AF. This
      involves identifying areas within the left upper chamber that have a lower electrical voltage
      than the surrounding heart muscle and applying RFA to the border zones of these areas.

      Methods. The new technology combined with the usual procedure will be compared to the usual
      procedure alone. All patients will receive ablation according to the new technique and
      results will be compared to a historical control group from the trial institution.

      Follow up. Patients will be followed up for 12 months with clinic visits and heart rhythm
      checks.

      Potential benefit. The new technique will be assessed for success at keeping patients free
      from persistent AF compared to the usual methods.

      The study will be performed at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, at the Hammersmith
      Hospital. Licensed clinical software will be used from St Jude Medical to guide ablation and
      a special research software module will be used to analyse data from the heart following
      ablation. The study will be sponsored by Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust
