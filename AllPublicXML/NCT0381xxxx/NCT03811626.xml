  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Unfavorable outcomes (UO) are seen in 15 to 20% of patients with mild traumatic brain injury
      (mTBI). Early identification of patients at risk for UO is crucial for suitable management to
      be initiated, increasing their chances for a return to a normal life. The investigators
      previously developed a diagnostic tool enabling early identification (8 to 21 days after the
      injury) of patients likely to develop UO. In the present study, the investigators examined
      the value and beneficial effects of early multidimensional management (MM) on prognosis. The
      investigators used a diagnostic tool to classify 221 mTBI patients as UO (97) or FO
      (favorable outcome) (124). Patients whose initial risk factors point to UO are at risk of
      developing post-concussion syndrome (PCS). UO patients were randomized into 2 groups: a group
      that underwent MM (cognitive-behavioral rehabilitation) (34) and a group with no specific
      management (46). At 6 months, these 2 groups were compared and the impact of MM on outcome
      was assessed. Among patients initially classified as FO (101), 95% had FO at 6 months and
      only 5 had PCS as defined by DSM-IV classification. Of the UO patients who received MM, 94%
      had no PCS 6 months after injury, whereas 52% of the UO patients who did not receive MM had
      persistent PCS. The effect of MM on the recovery of patients at 6 months, once adjusted for
      the main confounding factors, was statistically significant (p&lt;0.001). These results show
      that the initiation of MM after early identification of at-risk mTBI patients can
      considerably improves their prognosis.

    <description>Change in quality of life assessed by QOLIBRI (Quality of Life after Brain Injury) Scale - QOLIBRI scale assess health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of individuals after traumatic brain injury. QOLIBRI is a comprehensive questionnaire with 37 items covering six dimensions of HRQoL after TBI. The QOLIBRI scores are reported on a 0-100 scale , where 0=worst possible quality of life and 100=best possible quality of life.</description>
