  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pathophysiology of sepsis is characterized by the sudden onset of vasodilation and
      vascular permeability with capillary leakage. This leakage contributes to the development of
      generalized edema which is not clinically detectable below 4 litres but which becomes visible
      after a few days. The edema accumulates mainly at the subcutaneous level due to the high
      compliance of this tissue. Edema, and therefore hydrosodium overload, testifies to the
      severity of the inflammation. However, it could also be harmful in itself (affecting
      microcirculation and increasing mortality) as suggested by numerous clinical and experimental
      studies.

      The transfer of fluids between vascular and interstitial compartments during sepsis therefore
      has a central role in the pathophysiology of the disease and associated mortality. These
      transfers are mainly controlled at the microvascular level (with constant permeability) by
      the difference between capillary (CP) and interstitial (IP) pressures. In healthy subjects,
      subcutaneous IP is discreetly negative (-1 mmHg) and varies very little. On the other hand, a
      sometimes drastic decrease in IP has been described in various localized and systemic
      inflammatory situations. These pressure variations may be explained by the collagen structure
      of the interstitial tissue and a change in the three-dimensional conformation of these
      macromolecules induced by inflammation mediators. In an animal model of sepsis, a study
      showed significantly lower pressure in a group of animals in endotoxic shock. IP has never
      been measured in humans during sepsis. The objective of this study is to analyze subcutaneous
      IP (SCIP) in patients with septic shock compared with controls in order to evaluate the
      direct role of interstitial tissue in the onset of edema during sepsis.
