  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of Janagliflozin relative to placebo on
      glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) after 24 weeks of treatment, and to assess the efficacy after 52
      weeks of treatment, overall safety and Population pharmacokinetics.

      A multicentre, randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled study(24 weeks
      core period followed by 28 Weeks Extension period), to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      Janagliflozin (25 mg and 50 mg) compared to placebo in patients diagnosed with T2DM who are
      not achieving an adequate response from diet and exercise to control their diabetes.
      Approximately 390 patients with inadequate glycemic control with diet and exercise will
      receive once-daily double-blind treatment with Janagliflozin 25 mg or 50 mg once daily for 52
      weeks, or 24 weeks of double-blind treatment with placebo followed by 28 weeks of
      single-blind treatment with Janagliflozin 25 mg or 50 mg. During the treatment, if a
      patient's glycemic level remains high despite treatment with study drug and reinforcement
      with diet and exercise, the patient will receive treatment with metformin (rescue therapy)
      consistent with local prescribing information. Study drug will be taken orally once daily.
