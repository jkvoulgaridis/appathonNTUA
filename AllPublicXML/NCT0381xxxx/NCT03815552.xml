    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical investigation is to provide pilot clinical data to direct
      pivotal study development for the pediatric indication of the Senseonics Continuous Glucose
      Monitoring System (CGM) measurements when compared with finger stick blood glucose monitoring
      in an outpatient setting. (The investigation will also evaluate safety of the Senseonics CGM
      System usage, get feedback regarding subject and caregiver acceptability of the device and
      the mobile medical application (MMA).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, non-blinded, prospective, single-arm, single-center pilot study,
      enrolling up to 15 pediatric subjects in two cohorts (5 subjects age 6-12 and 10 subjects age
      13-17) with diabetes mellitus for up to 180 days. Study will evaluate the system at home with
      comparison to SMBG with clinic check visits and downloading of stored data every 30 days.
      Subjects will have one Sensor inserted subcutaneous by trained Investigators. The System will
      be set to provide real-time glucose information, including alarms and alerts in the home
      settings. The system is for adjunctive use. All diabetes care decisions will be based on SMBG
      values rather than System CGM results.

    <description>The Eversense Continuous Glucose Monitoring System is a glucose monitoring device intended to continually measure interstitial fluid glucose levels in individuals with diabetes for the operating life of the sensor.The System comprises a sensor and a transmitter. The small sensor will be subcutaneously inserted in the arm.The transmitter reads glucose data from the subcutaneous sensor.</description>
