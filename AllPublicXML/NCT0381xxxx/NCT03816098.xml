  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Swallowing Disturbance Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>At the baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Chinese version of Swallowing Dysphagia Questionnaire consists of 15 questions regarding oral and pharyngeal stage of dysphagia. Subjects are asked to fill out the questionnaire concerning current state and during the past year using a 4-point scale.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Videofluroscopy Swallowing Study (VFSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>At the baseline</time_frame>
    <description>VFSS studies are conducted using 4 different consistencies: thin liquid, nectar-thick liquid, puree, and cookie. Subjects are asked to take 2 trials for each consistency to assess if any oral or pharyngeal dysphagia occurs.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical water test</measure>
    <time_frame>At the baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Each subject takes 3 trials of 3cc-water using a dropper. Then sequential water drinking is assessed (about 60-70 ml). We assess: coughing, choking, voice changes. At least one symptom means dysphagia.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)</measure>
    <time_frame>At the baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Mini-Mental State Examination was used to identify subjects' cognitive state.The following four cut-off levels should be employed to classify the severity of cognitive impairment: no cognitive impairment=24-30; mild cognitive impairment=19-23; moderate cognitive impairment=10-18; and severe cognitive impairment&lt;9.</description>
