    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective phase II, single arm mono-institutional study conducted in Queen
      Mary Hospital (Hong Kong) assessing the efficacy and safety of the sequential administration
      of trans-arterial chemo-embolization (TACE) and stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) with an
      immune checkpoint inhibitor in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients.

      All the patients must be registered with the Investigator(s) prior to initiation of
      treatment. The registration desk will confirm all eligibility criteria and obtain essential
      information (including patient number).

      TACE should start within 28 days of study registration and its procedure will be
      standardised.

      SBRT screening and planning will be performed by radiation therapists, medical physicists,
      and oncologists.
