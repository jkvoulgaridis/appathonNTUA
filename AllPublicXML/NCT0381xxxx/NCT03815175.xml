      The XIENCE 28 USA Study is prospective, single arm, multi-center, open label, non-randomized
      trial to evaluate safety of 1-month (as short as 28 days) dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) in
      subjects at high risk of bleeding (HBR) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)
      with the approved XIENCE family (XIENCE Xpedition Everolimus Eluting Coronary Stent System
      [EECSS], XIENCE Alpine EECSS and XIENCE Sierra EECSS) of coronary drug-eluting stents.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The XIENCE 28 USA Study will evaluate the safety of 1-month DAPT following XIENCE
      implantation in HBR patients. A minimum of 640 to a maximum of 800 subjects will be
      registered from approximately 50 sites in the United States and Canada. Subject registration
      is capped at 75 per site. Eligibility of P2Y12 receptor inhibitor discontinuation will be
      assessed at 1-month follow-up. Subjects who are free from myocardial infarction (MI), repeat
      coronary revascularization, stroke, or stent thrombosis (ARC definite/probable) within 1
      month (prior to 1-month visit but at least 28 days) after stenting AND have been compliant
      with 1-month DAPT without interruption of either aspirin and/or P2Y12 receptor inhibitor for
      &gt; 7 consecutive days are considered as &quot;1-month clear&quot;, and will discontinue P2Y12 receptor
      inhibitor as early as 28 days and continued with aspirin monotherapy through 12-month
      follow-up.

      All registered subjects will be followed at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months post index procedure. The
      data collected from the XIENCE 28 USA Study will be pooled with the data from the XIENCE 28
      Global Study (Protocol # ABT-CIP-10235) to compare with the historical control of non-complex
      HBR subjects treated with standard DAPT duration of up to 12 months from the XIENCE V USA
      Study.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is considered at high risk for bleeding (HBR), defined as meeting one or more
             of the following criteria at the time of registration and in the opinion of the
             referring physician, the risk of major bleeding with &gt; 1-month DAPT outweighs the
             benefit:

               1. ≥ 75 years of age.

               2. Clinical indication for chronic (at least 6 months) or lifelong anticoagulation
                  therapy

               3. History of major bleeding which required medical attention within 12 months of
                  the index procedure.

               4. History of stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic).

               5. Renal insufficiency (creatinine ≥ 2.0 mg/dl) or failure (dialysis dependent).

               6. Systemic conditions associated with an increased bleeding risk (e.g.
                  hematological disorders, including a history of or current thrombocytopenia
                  defined as a platelet count &lt;100,000/mm3, or any known coagulation disorder
                  associated with increased bleeding risk).

               7. Anemia with hemoglobin &lt; 11g/dl.

          2. Subject must be at least 18 years of age.

          3. Subject must provide written informed consent as approved by the Institutional Review
             Board (IRB) of the respective clinical site prior to any trial related procedure.

          4. Subject is willing to comply with all protocol requirements, including agreement to
             stop taking P2Y12 inhibitor at 1 month, if eligible per protocol.

          5. Subject must agree not to participate in any other clinical trial for a period of one
             year following the index procedure, except for cases where subject is transferred to
             the XIENCE 90 study after the 1-month visit assessment

        Angiographic Inclusion Criteria

          1. Up to three target lesions with a maximum of two target lesions per epicardial vessel.
             Note:

               -  The definition of epicardial vessels means left anterior descending coronary
                  artery (LAD), left circumflex coronary artery (LCX) and right coronary artery
                  (RCA) and their branches. For example, the subject must not have &gt;2 lesions
                  requiring treatment within both the LAD and a diagonal branch in total.

               -  If there are two target lesions within the same epicardial vessel, the two target
                  lesions must be at least 15 mm apart per visual estimation; otherwise this is
                  considered as a single target lesion.

          2. Target lesion must be located in a native coronary artery with visually estimated
             reference vessel diameter between 2.25 mm and 4.25 mm.

          3. Exclusive use of XIENCE family of stent systems during the index procedure.

          4. Target lesion has been treated successfully, which is defined as achievement of a
             final in-stent residual diameter stenosis of &lt;20% with final TIMI-3 flow assessed by
             online quantitative angiography or visual estimation, with no residual dissection
             NHLBI grade ≥ type B, and no transient or sustained angiographic complications (e.g.,
             distal embolization, side branch closure), no chest pain lasting &gt; 5 minutes, and no
             ST segment elevation &gt; 0.5mm or depression lasting &gt; 5 minutes.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject with an indication for the index procedure of acute ST-segment elevation MI
             (STEMI).

          2. Subject has a known hypersensitivity or contraindication to aspirin,
             heparin/bivalirudin, P2Y12 inhibitors (clopidogrel/prasugrel/ticagrelor), everolimus,
             cobalt, chromium, nickel, tungsten, acrylic and fluoro polymers or contrast
             sensitivity that cannot be adequately pre-medicated.

          3. Subject with implantation of another drug-eluting stent (other than XIENCE) within 12
             months prior to index procedure.

          4. Subject has a known left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt;30%.

          5. Subject judged by physician as inappropriate for discontinuation from P2Y12 inhibitor
             use at 1 month, due to another condition requiring chronic P2Y12 inhibitor use.

          6. Subject with planned surgery or procedure necessitating discontinuation of P2Y12
             inhibitor within 1 month following index procedure.

          7. Subject with a current medical condition with a life expectancy of less than 12
             months.

          8. Subject intends to participate in an investigational drug or device trial within 12
             months following the index procedure. Transferring to the XIENCE 90 study will not be
             an exclusion criterion.

          9. Pregnant or nursing subjects and those who plan pregnancy in the period up to 1 year
             following index procedure. Female subjects of child-bearing potential must have a
             negative pregnancy test done within 7 days prior to the index procedure per site
             standard test.

         10. Presence of other anatomic or comorbid conditions, or other medical, social, or
             psychological conditions that, in the investigator's opinion, could limit the
             subject's ability to participate in the clinical investigation or to comply with
             follow-up requirements, or impact the scientific soundness of the clinical
             investigation results.

         11. Subject is currently participating in another clinical trial that has not yet
             completed its primary endpoint.

        Angiographic Exclusion Criteria

          1. Target lesion is in a left main location.

          2. Target lesion is located within an arterial or saphenous vein graft.

          3. Target lesion is restenotic from a previous stent implantation.

          4. Target lesion is a chronic total occlusion (CTO, defined as lesion with TIMI flow 0
             for at least 3 months).

          5. Target lesion is implanted with overlapping stents, whether planned or for bailout.
