  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are no clear conclusive clinical reports defining the adequate effective dose of
      midazolam in patients undergoing day-case esophageal-gastro-duodenoscopy (EGD). Defining such
      dosage will facilitate practitioners who are not anesthesia professionals to administer
      sedative drugs to establish a satisfactory level of moderate sedation. Our first aim is to
      determine the effective dose for 90% of patients (ED 90) of midazolam undergoing day-case
      EGD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Midazolam is widely used in conscious sedation during esophageal-gastro-duodenoscopy (EGD) to
      increase patient's tolerance and cooperation. Its short duration, cardiorespiratory
      stability, anxiolytic and amnestic properties makes it the drug of choice for moderate
      sedation in day case short procedure 1. Therefore, moderate sedation during digestive
      endoscopy can be administered by endoscopist in safe monitored area while a qualified nurse
      monitors the level of consciousness and vital sings. The endoscopist's privileges to
      administer deeper alternative drug, i.e. propofol, might not be provided easily in many
      centers especially outside the hospital due to certain limitations. However, the patient's
      and endoscopist's satisfaction might not be achieved easily with the administration of
      midazolam for moderate sedation. Inappropriate dose will fail to produce amnesia or may cause
      respiratory side effect and delayed recovery and discharge. Therefore, there are no clear
      conclusive clinical reports defining the adequate effective dose of midazolam in patients
      undergoing day case EGD. This is obvious from different dosage used in various studies. In
      addition, midazolam dosage in adult is rarely based on the body weight during our daily
      clinical practice. Defining such dosage will facilitate practitioners who are not anesthesia
      professionals to administer sedative drugs to establish satisfactory level of moderate
      sedation. Our first aim is to determine the effective dose for 90% of patients (ED 90) of
      midazolam undergoing day case EGD.
