  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cannabis is one of the widely used psychoactive substances in the world. With increasing
      legalization, the prevalence of driving under the influence of cannabis will undoubtedly
      rise. At present, roadside detection of cannabis intoxication is largely dependent on drug
      recognition experts who rely on changes in eye movements when impaired. In this regard, use
      of eye trackers can help to detect impairment in drivers. The purpose of the present study is
      to determine the feasibility of the use of eye trackers in detecting impairment in
      participants who smoked a cannabis cigarette.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will attend one study session after determination of eligibility. During this
      session, they will smoke a cannabis cigarette with 12.5% THC prior to driving a simulator.
      Driving will be assessed prior to smoking cannabis and at 7 time points after smoking
      cannabis. Eye tracking measures will also be taken while driving after smoking cannabis.
      Blood will be drawn for determination of levels of the psychoactive substance THC and its
      metabolites. Saliva tests, urine tests and subjective tests will also be performed at various
      times points after smoking cannabis.
