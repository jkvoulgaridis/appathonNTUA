  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epidural block is one of the most difficult skills that can be mastered by trainees probably
      due to the difficulty of recognizing the ligamentum flavum (LF) during the loss of resistance
      technique (LORT).The CompuFlo® Instrument can measure the pressure of human tissues in
      real-time at the orifice of a needle and it has been successfully used in clinical practice
      to identify the epidural space.The aim of this study was to evaluate whether Compuflo® may
      help trainees to identify the ligamentum flavum using a realistic Epidural Simulator

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators enrolled 60 trainees who have never performed an epidural block. After
      having had a standardized learning module on epidural anatomy and technique, each trainee
      practiced the epidural and the Compuflo®-assisted LORT on the simulator for a maximum of 5
      attemps. Trainees were asked to stop the needle entrance whenever they felt a sensation of an
      increase of resistance due to the penetration of the needle in the LF. The correct position
      of the needle was verified by an expert instructor. The number of attempts was noted. The
      power analysis required a sample size of 60 observations to set 80% test power and a 95%
      significance. Unpaired T-test was used to evaluate the differences in the number of epidural
      attempts. A logistic regression model was used to correlate the &quot;success at the first attempt
      ratio&quot; and the technique used.
