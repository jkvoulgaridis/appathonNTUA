    <textblock>
      Despite the availability of numerous cognitive assessment tools, cognitive impairment related
      to dementia is frequently under-diagnosed in primary care settings. The investigators have
      developed a 5-minute cognitive screen (5-Cog) coupled with a decision tree to overcome the
      technical, cultural and logistic barriers of current cognitive screens to improve dementia
      care in primary care patients with cognitive concerns.

      Despite the availability of numerous cognitive assessment tools, cognitive impairment related
      to dementia is frequently under-diagnosed in primary care settings, and is a more prevalent
      problem among older African-Americans and Hispanics than among older whites. Missed detection
      delays treatment of reversible conditions as well as provision of support services and
      critical planning. To overcome the technical, cultural and logistic barriers of current
      cognitive screens and dementia care in primary care settings the investigators have developed
      a 5-minute cognitive screen (5-Cog) coupled with a decision tree to identify persons at high
      risk of developing dementia in multi-ethnic primary care populations.

      The 5-Cog includes the Picture based Memory Impairment Screen (PMIS), Motoric Cognitive Risk
      syndrome (MCR), and a brief non-memory picture based test (Symbol Match). The cognitive
      assessment will sort patients with 'cognitive impairment' from those with 'no cognitive
      impairment'. It is coupled with a decision tree to guide clinicians through the follow up
      based on results of the 5-Cog.

      The primary objective is to test the ability of the 5-Cog and decision tree paradigm to
      improve dementia care in primary care patients with cognitive concerns.

      The investigators propose a single-blind, randomized clinical trial (RCT) in 1,200 older
      primary care patients with cognitive concerns who will be randomized to receive the 5-Cog
      (intervention group) or a 5-minute health literacy and grip assessment (active control
      group). Non-physicians will administer the intervention and control assessments in primary
      care sites and will provide results for both arms to the treating physician with a decision
      tree follow up guide based on the results of the assessments.

Any new diagnosis of dementia (relevant International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 codes) or Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) documented in the EMR.
Tests ordered for reversible causes of cognitive impairment as recommended by the published guidelines of professional societies (i.e. thyroid function tests, B-12 level, Syphilis Panel, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) test, computed tomography (CT) or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans) documented in the EMR.
Any new prescriptions for dementia medications (i.e. Donepezil, Aricept, Memantine, Namenda, Rivastigmine, Exelon, Galantamine, Razadyne, Donepezil, or Namzaric) documented in the EMR.
Referral for cognitive/dementia evaluation by specialists (i.e. Neurology, Geriatrics or Psychiatry) documented in the EMR.</description>

    <description>The 5-Cog coupled with a decision tree is a simple, 5-minute procedure that will identify older persons with cognitive impairment in primary care settings, and flag them for further evaluation. The 5-Cog includes the Picture Memory Impairment Screen (PMIS), Motoric Cognitive Risk syndrome (MCR), and the Symbol Match test. The 5-Cog will be given after randomization and before the patients sees the physician. The 5-Cog will sort patients with 'cognitive impairment' from those with 'no cognitive impairment'. After completing the 5-Cog, the non-physician tester will send a message through the Electronic medical record (EMR) system to provide the physician with the 5-Cog results and guide the them through the follow-up based on the results.</description>
