  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After an initial phone screen process, approximately 50 participants will be enrolled and
      evaluated/screened in person after consenting to achieve 30 eligible participants with a
      principal diagnosis of GAD, panic disorder, or social anxiety disorder and high anxiety
      sensitivity (Anxiety Sensitivity Index score =20). Participants will be given a choice of
      either high intensity interval training (HIIT) or walking interventions, which will be
      completed over the course of 8 weeks. The goal of the study is to 1) obtain pilot data
      comparing the efficacy of HIIT vs. walking for effects on psychiatric, functioning and immune
      outcomes, 2) to identify adherence levels given the choice of exercise intensity, and 3) to
      identify proportion of individuals opting for each intervention. Results from this pilot
      study will be used to inform future grant applications including a K award.

Participants will be shown the appropriate walking intensity (low intensity; i.e., approximately 50% of maximum heart rate (220-age) or lower) by interventionist. Interventionist will observe participant engaging in walking at appropriate intensity level for 15 minutes.
