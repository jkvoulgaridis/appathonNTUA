    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess the therapeutic safety and preliminary efficacy of a
      hematopoietic cell-based gene therapy consisting of autologous CD34+ enriched cells
      transduced with a lentiviral vector carrying the FANCA gene in subjects with Fanconi anemia
      subtype A (FA-A).

      This is a pediatric open-label Phase 1 clinical trial and will include a safety evaluation
      and preliminary assessment of the efficacy of hematopoietic gene therapy consisting of
      autologous CD34+ enriched cells transduced with a lentiviral vector carrying the FANCA gene
      in subjects with FA-A. CD34+ cells will be transduced ex vivo with the therapeutic lentiviral
      vector and infused following transduction, without any prior conditioning. After
      transduction, product quality control evaluations will be carried out in aliquots of the
      transduced population. Investigational product will be infused via intravenous infusion with
      no upper or lower limit; a dose of ≥5 x 105 CD34+ cells/kg body weight will be considered
      optimal.

      The active agent is a self-inactivating lentiviral vector carrying the therapeutic FANCA gene
      and the therapeutic product is subject's autologous HSCs that have been transduced with the
      lentiviral vector. The vector contains the functional FANCA gene.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Fanconi anemia, as diagnosed by chromosomal fragility assay of cultured T-lymphocytes
             in the presence of DEB or a similar DNA-crosslinking agent.

          -  Subjects of Fanconi Anemia complementation group A.

          -  Minimum age: 1 year and a minimum of 8 kg.

          -  Maximum age: 12 years.
