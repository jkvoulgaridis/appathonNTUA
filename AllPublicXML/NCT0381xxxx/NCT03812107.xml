  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a sample of individuals with co-occurring OUD and mental disorders, the investigators plan
      to test two medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) treatment protocols that involve
      differing approaches to the use of opioids and other drugs during and after stabilization on
      MOUD - intensive vs. moderate treatment.The study is being conducted alongside the opening of
      a new clinical service funded by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
      Administration (SAMHSA) known as the Addiction and Behavioral Health Outpatient Recovery
      (ABOVE) program. The ABOVE Program is designed to treat patients with co-occurring opioid use
      disorder (OUD) and mental disorders with MOUD. Participants are individuals seeking treatment
      for co-occurring opioid use disorder (OUD) and mental disorders and are willing to receive
      MOUD treatment. Potential participants will be screened in the context of clinical care for
      opioid use disorder and mental disorders. If they are eligible for treatment in the ABOVE
      program, they will be asked to complete a baseline assessment, again for the purposes of
      clinical care. After completing the baseline clinical assessment, they will be asked to
      participate in this clinical trial, consented, then randomized. Treatment is delivered in the
      context of clinical care which involves delivery of MOUD and can involve psychiatric
      medications, and group and individual psychotherapy. Difference in treatment between the two
      randomization arms will only occur if a relapse to drug use occurs and will only involve two
      protocol-directed treatment responses to relapse.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single-center, two-arm, 6-month (24-week), parallel group, open-label,
      randomized controlled trial to examine the effectiveness of two approaches to managing
      relapse to illicit drug use in treatment with medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD). It
      will compare two treatment protocols for treatment of opioid use disorder with medications.
      The two protocols involve differing approaches to relapse to use of illicit drugs in a sample
      of individuals with co-occurring OUD and mental disorders.

      Intensive Treatment Approach: After stabilization on a medication for OUD (MOUD), if a
      participant tests positive for opioids or other illicit drugs, they will be asked to return
      weekly until 2 consecutive urine drug tests are negative for opioids or other illicit drugs.
      Participants will then be asked to return every other week until 2 consecutive urine drug
      tests are negative for opioids or other illicit drugs, before being asked to return every 4
      weeks. If the participant tests positive for illicit drugs while returning every other week,
      they will return to the beginning of the treatment plan (2 consecutive negative tests before
      going to every other week).

      Moderate treatment approach: The frequency of visits will be organized similarly as the
      intensive treatment arm (weekly, every 2 weeks, and every 4 weeks) but participants in this
      arm will be able to move more freely between these steps and are hypothesized to require
      fewer provider visits than the intensive treatment arm.

    <measure>Retention in MOUD treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This is a continuous measure of days a participant is prescribed medications for opioid use disorder for 24 weeks. For example, if the first prescription is for 7 days, then this measure has a minimum value of 7 days and a maximum value of approximately 168 days (24 weeks). If a participant is without MOUD prescribed by the ABOVE clinical program for 7 days or greater, then the participant will be considered discontinued from treatment for study purposes.</description>

    <measure>Number of medications for opioid use disorder provider visits</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The number of provider visits attended will be recorded for each participant. Types of provider visits include visits with a nurse, psychiatrist, nurse practitioner, or mental health clinician for either individual or group psychotherapy.</description>

    <measure>Change in number of days of past 30-day illicit opioid use by self-report from baseline to 24 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked the number of days of illicit opioid use (includes use of non-prescribed opioid analgesics) in the past 30 days at baseline and 24 week follow-up. This outcome will be the difference in the number of days of illicit opioid use between baseline and 24 weeks.</description>

    <measure>Change in number of days of past 30-day any illicit drug use or heavy drinking days by self-report from baseline to 24 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked the number of days of any illicit drug use or heavy drinking days (5 or more alcoholic drinks in one sitting for males or 4 or more alcohol drinks in one sitting for females) in the past 30 days at baseline and 6 month follow-up. This outcome will be the difference in the number of days of any illicit drug use or heavy drinking days between baseline and 6 months.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of urine drug tests negative for opioids from baseline to 24 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked to provide urine drug tests that test for illicit drugs including illicit opioids at least once every 4 weeks from baseline to 24 weeks. Because urine drug tests will only be obtained on clinical visit days and the two arms may have a different number of urine drug tests obtained per participant, only monthly or near-monthly drug tests in each arm (week 4, week 8, week 12, etc.) will be included in the study.</description>
