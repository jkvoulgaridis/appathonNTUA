  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although the clinical relationship between NAFLD/NASH and cardiovascular (CV) risk is now
      well established, there is very little awareness of the hepatic disease and the way it may
      contribute to increased CV risk in patients seen in cardiology clinics for complications of
      coronary artery disease. Our clinical hypothesis is that NAFLD, possibly at a stage of
      advanced fibrosis, is common in patients with symptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD) and
      increases the risk of severe atherosclerotic lesions. The primary aim of this study is to
      determine (a) the prevalence and (b) the severity spectrum of NAFLD among patients with
      symptomatic coronary artery disease. The secondary aims are: to analyze the impact of the
      presence and the severity spectrum of NAFLD (steatosis, steatohepatitis and fibrosis) on the
      severity of CAD ; To determine the profile of NAFLD patients at risk to develop coronary
      lesions; To explore the mechanistic link between NAFLD and CAD beyond common metabolic risk
      factors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Because of shared metabolic risk factors and pathogenic pathways (insulin resistance, chronic
      low grade inflammation, atherogenic dyslipidemia) non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is
      frequently associated with cardiovascular (CV) disease. Despite a lot of transversal studies
      showing a frequent association between NAFLD and CV disease, it is difficult to determine if
      NAFLD plays an active role in atherogenesis or is just a marker of common risk factors. Some
      longitudinal studies, although retrospectives, showed that NAFLD favors the progression of
      early atherosclerosis, suggesting that NAFLD is an independent CV risk factor beyond the
      association driven by metabolic syndrome.

      Although the clinical relationship between NAFLD/NASH and CV risk is now well established,
      there is very little awareness of the hepatic disease and the way it may contribute to
      increased CV risk in patients seen in cardiology clinics for complications of coronary artery
      disease (CAD). Our clinical hypothesis is that NAFLD, possibly at a stage of advanced
      fibrosis, is common in patients with symptomatic CAD and increases the risk of severe
      atherosclerotic lesions.

      The primary aim of this study is to determine (a) the prevalence of NAFLD among patients with
      symptomatic CAD.

      The secondary aims are:

        -  To determine the severity spectrum of NAFLD among patients with coronary artery disease.

        -  To analyze the impact of the presence and the severity spectrum of NAFLD (steatosis,
           steatohepatitis and fibrosis) on the severity of CAD and long term clinical outcomes
           (ancillary studies)

        -  To determine the profile of NAFLD patients at risk to develop coronary lesions

        -  To explore the mechanistic link between NAFLD and CAD beyond common metabolic risk
           factors.

    <description>NAFLD will be defined by the presence of steatosis at ultrasound concomitant with at least one metabolic risk factor among overweight/obesity, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia.
