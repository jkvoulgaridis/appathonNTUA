    <textblock>
      We prepare this study to compare the efficacy of intermittent intravenous PPI infusion
      (relatively low dose PPI therapy) than continous PPI infusion method. Our hypothesis is that
      intermittent (40mg as a bolus injection daily for 72 hours) PPI therapy is not inferior to
      conventional high dose therapy.

      Background Current guidelines recommend an intravenous bolus dose of a proton pump
      inhibitor(PPI) followed by continuous PPI infusion after endoscopic therapy in patients with
      high-risk peptic ulcer bleeding. However, intermittent PPI have not been inferior to
      continuous PPI infusion regimens in recent studies.

      Objective The aim of this study was to compare the effect of intermittent (40mg as a bolus
      injection daily for 72hours) versus continuous (40mg as a bolus injection followed by
      continuous infusion at 8mg/hr for 72hours) intravenous pantoprazole for prevention of
      bleeding after endoscopic therapy of peptic ulcer bleeding. Also, the same comparison was
      performed in high-risk patients (Rockall scores â‰¥6).

      Methods This single center cross-sectional study was conducted from january 2010 through
      december 2013. Patients who presented with overt or suspected upper gastrointestinal bleeding
      based on hematemesis and/or melena were eligible. These eligible patients were required to
      have a peptic ulcer with bleeding on emergency endoscopy performed within 24 hours after
      hospitalization. Exclusion criteria were refusal of endoscopy, gastrointestinal malignancy,
      Mallory-Weiss syndrome, variceal bleeding, bleeding d/t endoscopic procedure, small bowel
      bleeding, serious medical disease, etc. Demographic and medical data were obtained from the
      patients' medical records. Current or past history of medical diagnosis and drug history were
      also recorded. Statistical analysis performed using SPSS 21.0 software.

    <description>Current guidelines recommend an intravenous bolus dose of a proton pump inhibitor(PPI) followed by continuous PPI infusion after endoscopic therapy in patients with high-risk bleeding peptic ulcers. However, recent many studies suggests intermittent low dose PPI infusion might have equal efficacy at preventing peptic ulcer hemorrhage recurrence. So, the present investigator assumed that intermittent administration of proton pump inhibitor will not be different from administration of continuous proton pump inhibitor for the prevention of rebleeding in patients with peptic ulcer bleeding. Also, intermittent proton pump inhibitor administration in patients with high risk of rebleeding (Rockall score 6 points or more) will not be different from prevention of rebleeding compared with continuous proton pump inhibitor administration.</description>
