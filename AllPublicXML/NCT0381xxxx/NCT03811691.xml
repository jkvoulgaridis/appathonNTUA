    <textblock>
      The interest of the CAPRI study is to confirm the safety and the efficacy of the ENO/TEO/OTO
      pacing system when used under 1.5 or 3 Tesla MRI environment and in accordance with the MRI
      solutions guideline.

      The purpose of CAPRI study is to confirm the safety and the efficacy of the CE marked MR
      conditional pacing system composed of the ENO, TEO or OTO pacemaker with VEGA pacing lead(s).
      Conditions to undergo an MRI scan are provided in the MRI solutions guideline.

      The primary objective is to confirm the clinical safety of the ENO/TEO/OTO pacing system when
      used under 1.5 and 3 Tesla specific MRI conditions without scan exclusion zone.

      The study secondary main objectives are aiming to assess the performance of the MR
      conditional pacing system in the right atrium and ventricle at 1 month following the MRI
      scan:

        -  Stability of the Pacing Capture Threshold

        -  Stability of the lead sensed amplitude

    <time_frame>1 month post MRI</time_frame>
    <description>An MRI-related complication is defined as a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) that led to death or to an invasive intervention or a Device Deficiency that causes the termination of any significant device function per Clinical Event Committee (CEC) adjudication.
The primary endpoint will be assessed independently for each arm of the study (1.5 and 3 Tesla MRI scan).</description>

    <measure>Ventricular Pacing Capture Threshold (PCT) stability in the right atrium and ventricle following the MRI scan</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month post MRI</time_frame>
    <description>Subject's ventricular pacing capture threshold will be measured in Volt (V) at 0.5ms at baseline (at the MRI visit - just before the MRI scan) and at 1 month Post-MRI visit. A success is defined as a PCT increase less than or equal to 0.5V at 0.5ms between the two visits. The secondary endpoints will be assessed independently for each arm of the study (1.5 and 3 Tesla MRI scan).</description>

    <measure>Atrial Pacing Capture Threshold stability in the right atrium and ventricle following the MRI scan</measure>

    <description>Subject's atrial pacing capture threshold will be measured in Volt (V) at 0.5ms at Baseline (at the MRI visit - just before the MRI scan) and at 1 month Post-MRI visit. A success is defined as a PCT increase less than or equal to 0.5V at 0.5ms between the two visits.

    <measure>Ventricular sensed amplitude stability in the right atrium and ventricle following the MRI scan</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month post MRI</time_frame>
    <description>Subject's ventricular minimum sensed amplitude will be measured in mV at Baseline (at the MRI visit - just before the MRI scan) and at 1 month Post-MRI visit. A success is defined as 50% or less decrease between the two visits. If subject's ventricular minimum sensed amplitude is less or equal to 4mV at time of baseline, then this subject will not count for this endpoint. The secondary endpoints will be assessed independently for each arm of the study (1.5 and 3 Tesla MRI scan).</description>
