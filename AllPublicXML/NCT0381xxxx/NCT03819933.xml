      Antenatal family counseling for anticipated extremely preterm deliveries remains ethically
      and practically challenging for maternal-fetal medicine specialists and neonatologists alike.
      The overall goal of this project is to improve antenatal counseling and counseling outcomes
      for families facing anticipated extremely preterm delivery through innovative,
      interdisciplinary simulation-based education for maternal fetal medicine specialists and
      neonatologists, using language preferred by families, and focusing on eliciting values and
      building partnerships through advanced communication and relational skills.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Extremely preterm birth near the limit of viability, defined broadly as birth between 20 and
      26 weeks' gestation, accounts for substantial infant morbidity and mortality as well as both
      parental and provider distress. Prenatal counseling for families anticipating extremely
      preterm delivery remains ethically and practically challenging for both Maternal Fetal
      Medicine (MFM) specialists and neonatologists. Physicians must quickly establish a trusting
      relationship with families and convey complex medical information. They must sensitively
      elicit family preferences and values regarding life and death, carefully explain management
      options and potential outcomes such as long-term disability, and arrive at a mutually
      agreeable plan for delivery and resuscitation. However, prenatal counseling may be disjointed
      or even contradictory. It has been shown that suboptimal counseling is partially explained by
      differences in training, practice and perspectives between the specialties, as well as in
      framing and unconscious biases, time constraints and poor communication. Physicians also
      often emphasize cognitive information versus parental values when counseling. Preferred
      language and counseling approaches are largely unknown. This can lead to poor family
      understanding, inadequate shared decision making, decreased satisfaction and increased
      anxiety.

      There is a need to determine best approaches using language and terminology preferred by
      families, not physicians. There is also a need to develop new methods to educate MFM and
      Neonatology providers to improve antenatal counseling. Simulation and enactments are
      effective in teaching patient-physician communication, ethical dilemmas in medicine, and
      prenatal counseling. This mixed-methods behavioral intervention study will first determine
      preferred language and approaches by families, then redefine current training for prenatal
      counseling at extreme prematurity by developing and implementing two novel, interdisciplinary
      simulation-based educational programs for MFM and Neonatology, focusing on eliciting values
      and building partnerships through advanced communication and relational skills, to improve
      counseling practices and outcomes.

      The overall hypothesis is that family-focused counseling at extreme prematurity by providers
      trained in using language and approaches preferred by families will more effectively address
      parents' values and preferences central to decision making and improve counseling practices
      and outcomes. In this mixed-methods study, the investigators will enroll ~130 families and
      their counseling providers from MFM and Neonatology and compare family-focused counseling
      outcomes after educational interventions to baseline. Investigators will collaborate with
      Family Faculty advisors from study design through publication to incorporate the parental
      perspective.

      Aim 1a: To determine, via semi-structured interviews of up to 30 families, preferred
      language, terminology and approach, including maternal/paternal differences, during family
      counseling for impending extremely preterm delivery, following standard counseling. Aim 1b:
      To establish baseline understanding, perceptions, decision making, and anxiety of 50 families
      and their counseling providers measured via survey, including the Controlled Preferences
      Scale-Pediatrics, Decisional Conflict Scale, and State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI).
      Secondary hypothesis: maternal/paternal preferences for language, involvement and decision
      making differ.

      Aim 2a: To develop a novel, joint-specialty simulation-based workshop for MFMs and
      neonatologists through Boston Children Hospital's (BCH) established Simulation Pediatric
      Program and Institute for Professionalism and Ethical Practice (IPEP). Aim 2b: To create an
      innovative, multi-media online training module for MFMs and neonatologists through BCH
      Simulation Pediatric/IPEP and Open PediatricsTM, a free and globally accessible web-based
      teaching platform to enable widespread dissemination. Both products will use preferred
      language and approaches from a national survey by investigators (in progress) and Aim 1,
      while emphasizing interdisciplinary communication, ethical and relational skills, addressing
      biases, and focusing on family values and preferences central to decision making.

      Aim 3: To evaluate whether developed educational interventions improve counseling practices
      and outcomes on repeat surveys of 50 families and trained counseling providers using
      comparative statistical analyses. Primary hypothesis: counseling by trained providers will
      improve parental 1) understanding, 2) perceptions, 3) decision making, and 4) anxiety, by
      improving communication and more effectively addressing parents' values and preferences
      central to decision making. Secondary hypotheses: 1) the online module will be as effective
      as the workshop; 2) trained providers will report increased comfort and decreased anxiety
      when counseling.

      Given the weight of decisions resulting from family counseling for impending extremely
      preterm delivery, joint-specialty interventions using preferred language and approach to
      optimize counseling are urgently needed. These innovative educational interventions present a
      feasible and effective approach that can be widely disseminated to improve interdisciplinary
      family-focused counseling for anticipated extremely preterm deliveries and counseling
      outcomes, representing a direct and immediate clinical impact.

    <description>The Parental Questionnaire includes the Controlled Preferences Scale-Pediatrics (CPS-P) and the Ottawa Decisional Conflict Scale (ODCS) to assess parental decision making and compare pre/post educational interventions. The CPS-P is a validated, reliable tool adapted for use in pediatrics to assess parental preferences for participation in decision making and consists of 5 statements describing various roles in decision making, ranging from passive (&quot;I prefer to leave all decisions regarding my child's treatment to my doctor&quot;) to active (&quot;I prefer to make the final decision about which treatment my child will receive&quot;), to collaborative. The ODCS is a validated 16-item tool with 5 response categories that measures personal perceptions of decision making. Each of the 16 DCS items is given a score value ranging 0-4, which are summed, divided by 16, and multiplied by 25, yielding a total score ranging from 0-100 (no decisional conflict - extremely high decisional conflict).</description>

    <description>For the qualitative arm of this mixed method study, using an exploratory sequential design, investigators will enroll ~ 30 adult pregnant women admitted estimated 22 0/7-25 6/7 weeks' estimated gestation and their partners to participate in a post-counseling semi-structured interview to explore preferred language and approaches, and better inform questionnaire development. Sample size will be up to 30 families, or until thematic saturation is achieved (total up to 60 if all partners agree to participate).
For the quantitative arm of this study, investigators will enroll ~100 adult pregnant women admitted between estimated 22 0/7-25 6/7 weeks' estimated gestation and their partners (up to total ~200 if all partners present and agree to participate).</description>

    <description>Investigators will enroll ~100 counseling Maternal-Fetal Medicine (MFM) specialists and 100 counseling Neonatologists (total ~200 providers), who provided counseling to the enrolled pregnant women between 22 0/7-25 6/7 weeks' estimated gestation for anticipated extremely preterm delivery. This assumes 1 counseling provider from MFM and 1 from Neonatology per pregnant woman, although there could be more if a consult is performed by both an attending physician and a training fellow or practitioner, or less, if a counseling provider declines to participate in the study. There will be anticipated repetition of counseling providers, accounted for in the statistical analysis. Providers will be asked to complete educational interventions to improve counseling at extreme prematurity.</description>
