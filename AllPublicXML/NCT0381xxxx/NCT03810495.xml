    <textblock>
      This study will examine the pharmacokinetic profile and safety of the O'Neil Long Acting
      Naltrexone Implant (OLANI) overtime in healthy volunteers. All participants will be treated
      in an open label manner. No randomization will occur. It is hypothesized that the OLANI will
      provide sustained therapeutic doses of naltrexone (NTX) for periods up to 6 months via a
      single subcutaneous application of 2 OLANIs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Naltrexone (NTX) is a nonspecific pure opioid antagonist with a high affinity for the
      µ-opioid receptor. It blocks the effects of opioids by competitive binding at opiate
      receptors. NTX is used primarily in the management of opiate and alcohol dependence. It is
      available in the United States (US) as 2 formulations; a once daily oral formulation (Revia)
      and a once monthly intramuscular injection (Vivitrol). While NTX is a potent antagonist and
      efficiently blocks the effects of exogenous opiates such as heroin, the success of NTX for
      the treatment of opiate dependence has been limited by poor patient compliance. Therefore,
      the development of a sustained release NTX formulation (in excess of 1 month) would be of
      great benefit for the treatment of opioid use disorder.
