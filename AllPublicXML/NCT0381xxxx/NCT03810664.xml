  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, single-center, open-label randomized, 2×2 crossover (Ref Test | Test Ref)
      study with a washout of two weeks to establish bioequivalence between single dose of
      somatrogon in a PEN to somatrogon in VIAL administered sc in healthy male volunteers.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The subjects will undergo a screening period (Day -28 to -1), and when eligible for study
      participation will be randomized to receive one sc injection of one of two somatrogon drug
      product presentations on Day 0, either the PEN or VIAL presentation. A series of blood draws
      and study procedures will be carried out over the course of the next 10 days to evaluate the
      subjects. Following a two week washout period, the subjects will be brought back to the
      clinic to receive the other somatrogon drug product presentation, and once again followed for
      the next 14 days to study completion.
