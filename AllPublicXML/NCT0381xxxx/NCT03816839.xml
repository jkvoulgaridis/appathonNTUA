      Primary Objective:

      To assess the incidence rate of dose-limiting toxicity and to confirm the recommended dose as
      well as the maximum tolerated dose of SAR439859 administered as monotherapy to Japanese
      postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor positive and human epidermal growth factor
      receptor 2-negative advanced breast cancer.

      Secondary Objective:

        -  To characterize the overall safety profile of SAR439859 administered as monotherapy.

        -  To characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of SAR439859 administered as monotherapy.

        -  To evaluate the antitumor activity of SAR439859 administered as monotherapy and the
           clinical benefit rate (complete response, partial response and stable disease ≥ 24
           weeks).

      The duration of the study for an individual participant will include a period to assess
      eligibility (screening period) of up to 4 weeks (28 days), a treatment period of at least 1
      cycle (28 days) of study treatment, and an End of Treatment (EOT) visit at least 30 days (or
      until the participant receives another anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier) following
      the last administration of study treatment. Study treatment may continue until precluded by
      unacceptable toxicity, disease progression, or upon participant's request.
