  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many men living with HIV (MLWH) want to have children. HIV-RNA suppression can minimize
      sexual HIV transmission risks while allowing for conception. The study will evaluate a safer
      conception intervention that leverages men's motivations to have healthy babies in order to
      promote serostatus disclosure and early ART initiation. The intervention is based on the
      investigators' Safer Conception Conceptual Framework, which considers individual, dyadic, and
      structural factors that affect periconception risk behavior.

      The study will evaluate and test a safer conception intervention that leverages men's
      motivations to have healthy babies in order to promote serostatus disclosure and early ART
      initiation. The intervention is based on a Safer Conception Conceptual Framework, which
      considers individual, dyadic, and structural factors that affect periconception risk
      behavior.

      The researchers will conduct an open pilot to refine the intervention. The study will enroll
      men who want to have children with uninfected or unknown status female partners. Men will
      participate in three study sessions offering motivational interviewing and problem solving to
      help men develop a plan to have a healthy baby. The counseling will explore safer conception
      options including safe disclosure, delaying conception attempts until on ART with viral
      suppression, STI testing and treatment, timing condomless sex to peak fertility. The primary
      outcome is HIV RNA suppression at 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes include acceptability,
      feasibility, early ART uptake, adherence, serostatus disclosure, couples HIV counseling and
      testing uptake, and limiting unprotected sex to peak fertility.

    <description>Men will participate in 3 counseling sessions with a lay counselor. In the first session, the counselor will share information on the various safer conception strategies and help the participant think about developing a healthy plan. In the following 2 sessions, the counselor and the participant will work together to develop a healthy baby plan using motivational interviewing and problem solving. In the 2 booster sessions, the counselor and the participant will check in to evaluate the success of the plan and make changes as necessary.</description>
