  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite reports that associate donor specific antibody (DSA) with rejection after liver
      transplantation, grafts are still allocated according to blood group (ABO) but not human
      leukocyte antigen (HLA) compatibility, possibly due to the absence of an easily discernible
      clinical association between adverse recipient outcome and DSA. Re-transplantation provides a
      test environment where the presence of preformed DSA or other antibodies is prevalent and
      events (graft loss) more common so that the effect of these antibodies on outcome should be
      apparent. This is an observational study of routine clinical care to determine these effects
      on our own patients. The goal is to perfect donor-recipient matching to attain the best
      outcome. In addition, we may develop hypotheses and potential treatments that would be tested
      in further clinical trials

      Despite reports that associate donor specific antibody (DSA) with rejection after liver
      transplantation, grafts are still allocated according to blood group (ABO) but not human
      leukocyte antigen (HLA) compatibility, possibly due to the absence of an easily discernible
      clinical association between adverse recipient outcome and DSA. Re-transplantation provides a
      test environment where the presence of preformed DSA or other antibodies is prevalent and
      events (graft loss) more common so that the effect of these antibodies on outcome should be
      apparent. This is an observational study of routine clinical care to determine these effects
      on our own patients.

      In phase 1, we will examine the effect of antibodies specifically directed against the second
      donor in liver retransplantation. Other factors known to effect the outcome will be checked
      to allow for risk adjustment.

      In phase 2, we will examine the role played by specific auto-antibodies such as angiotensin
      II receptor type 1 antibodies and endothelin-1 type A receptor antibodies on the outcome of
      liver retransplantation.

      The goal of these observational study is to perfect donor-recipient matching to attain the
      best outcome. In addition, we may develop hypotheses and potential treatments that would be
      tested in further clinical trials.
