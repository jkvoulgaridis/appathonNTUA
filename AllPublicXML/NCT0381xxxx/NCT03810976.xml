  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The eribulin, a microtubule-dynamics inhibitor was approved for specific subtypes of STS.
      Eribulin demonstrated significantly better OS compared to dacarbazine in previously treated
      patients with liposarcoma and leiomyosarcoma and approved as standard treatment. However, the
      median progression free survival (PFS) and response rate (RR) was similar for both groups
      which remains modest outcome of 2.6 months of PFS and 4% of RR. Therefore, to improve
      antitumor activity, further combination strategy is strongly warranted. Based on the previous
      studies, investigators suggest phase II trial of eribulin and gemcitabine combination in
      previously treated patients with unresectable, advanced, or metastatic leiomyosarcoma or
      liposarcoma.
