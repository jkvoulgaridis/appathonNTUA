  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study evaluates the safety and efficacy of the treatment with the CoolLoop®
      cryoablation System (sclerotherapy of muscle tissue of the heart by freezing) in patients
      with atrial fibrillation (permanent atrial fibrillation excepted) over a follow-up period of
      36 months.

      A further aim of this study is to evaluate the average duration of procedure and fluoroscopy
      times.

        Patients have to be planned and be suitable for an ablation procedure. The decision to
        treat the patients with the CoolLoop® cryoablation System has already been made in advance
        by the Investigator. Informed consent has to be obtained before the ablation procedure.

          -  pregnant women at the time of the cryoablation procedure.

          -  any serious medical condition, laboratory abnormality, or psychiatric illness that
             would prevent the subject from signing the Informed Consent Form.

          -  participation in interventional trials for cardiovascular devices or drugs.
