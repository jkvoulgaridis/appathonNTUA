        for mismatch repair proteins or microsatellite instability testing v. Tumours should be
        advanced and inoperable or metastatic vi. Patients must have received at least one prior
        chemotherapy treatment for their cancer, have no established treatment option, or decides

        therapy, if the risk of conception exists. Sexually active female patients must be
        surgically sterile or be postmenopausal or must agree to use highly effective contraception
        which must be used for 10 days before the negative pregnancy test. Sexually active male

             hepatic, haematologic, gastrointestinal, endocrine, respiratory or cardiac disease,
