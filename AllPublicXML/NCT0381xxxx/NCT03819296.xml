      This trial studies the role of the gut microbiome and effectiveness of a fecal transplant on
      medication-induced gastrointestinal (GI) complications in patients with melanoma or
      genitourinary cancer. The gut microbiome (the bacteria and microorganisms that live in the
      digestive system) may affect whether or not someone develops colitis (inflammation of the
      intestines) during cancer treatment with immune-checkpoint inhibitor drugs. Studying samples
      of stool, blood, and tissue from patients with melanoma or genitourinary cancer may help
      doctors learn more about the effects of treatment on cells, and help doctors understand how
      well patients respond to treatment. Treatment with fecal transplantation may help to improve
      diarrhea and colitis symptoms.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the difference in stool microbiome pattern between patients who develop
      immune-checkpoint inhibitor (ICPI)-related colitis and patients who don't develop
      ICPI-related colitis.

      II. To compare the difference in stool microbiome pattern in patients who developed
      ICPI-related colitis before and after colitis medical treatment.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To identify and characterize immune profile and genetic factors associated with onset of
      ICPI-related colitis in blood and colon tissue.

      II. To identify and characterize immune profile and genetic factors in blood and colon tissue
      that are associated with quick response of ICPI-related colitis to medical treatment.

      III. To characterize the endoscopic and histologic features of ICPI-related colitis before
      and after medical treatment.

      IV. To assess stool microbiome features that are associated with good response to fecal
      microbiota transplantation.

      V. To assess the factors in genetic/immune profile obtained from blood and colon tissue that
      are associated with good response to fecal microbiota transplantation.

      VI. To characterize the endoscopic and histologic features of ICPI-related colitis before and
      after fecal microbiota transplantation.

      VII. To assess the adverse events related to fecal microbiota transplantation.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To identify and characterize immune profile and genetic factors associated with onset of
      ICPI-related colitis in inflamed colonic mucosa and its matched normal mucosa.

      II. To characterize the immune profile and genetic factors from the colon tissue in these
      colitis patients among different histological subtypes.

      III. To assess the pattern of stool microbiome that is associated with good tumor response to
      ICPI treatment.

      IV. To assess the association between stool inflammatory markers (i.e. lactoferrin and
      calprotectin) and the severity of endoscopic/histologic inflammation.

      V. To assess the sensitivity and specificity of stool inflammatory markers (i.e. lactoferrin
      and calprotectin) as an indicators of ICPI-relate colitis response to treatment.

      VI. To assess the microbiome pattern that triggers the infections on immunosuppressant
      treatment for ICPI colitis.

      OUTLINE:

      PROJECT 1: Patients receive standard of care and undergo collection of stool and blood
      samples.

      PROJECT 2: Patients receive prednisone, infliximab, or vedolizumab per standard of care and
      undergo standard of care endoscopy 2 months after treatment. Patients also undergo collection
      of stool, blood, and tissue samples.

      PROJECT 3: Patients undergo fecal microbiota transplant (FMT).

      After completion of study, patients are followed up periodically.
