  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AUDs are difficult to treat, and relapse rates are high, with an estimated 80% of individuals
      with AUDs returning to alcohol use after completing addictions treatment. Novel treatment
      approaches are needed to enhance long term sobriety. The investigator's research team has
      been investigating the use of acamprosate to prevent relapse to alcohol use. Unfortunately
      despite being FDA approved and endorsed by the American Psychiatric Association only 10% of
      patients treated for AUD are prescribed acamprosate or other antidipsotropic medications. The
      number is higher for patients treated in programs affiliated with Mayo Clinic Addiction
      Services (approximately 20%) but is way less than expected. The most common reasons behind
      these low numbers are the understanding that not every patient benefits from the use of
      specific medication and the lack of biomarkers predictive of response. The purpose of this
      project is to identify such biomarkers by discovery of genomic and metabolomic markers
      associated with response to acamprosate treatment.

    <description>All participants will be randomized to receive acamprosate or placebo in a double-blinded placebo-controlled trial.
The most common side effect associated with acamprosate use is diarrhea, which occurs in approximately 16% of patients. Other frequently occurring side effects include asthenia, nausea, pruritus, and flatulence, headache, abdominal pain, flu syndrome, edema, weight gain, and myalgia.</description>
