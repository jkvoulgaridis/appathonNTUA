  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of a single oral dose of 600 milligram
      (mg) pimodivir in adult participants with impaired hepatic function compared to adult
      participants with normal hepatic function.

    <description>AUC(last) is defined as the time 0 to the time of the last measurable (non-below quantification limit) concentration of Pimodivir calculated by linear-linear trapezoidal summation.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Area Under Concentration-Time Curve from Time 0 to Infinite Time (AUC[0-infinity]) of Pimodivir</measure>

    <description>The AUC ([0-infinity) is the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to infinite time, calculated as the sum of AUC(last) and C (last)/ lambda(z); wherein AUC(last) is area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to the time of the last measurable concentration, C(last) is the last observed quantifiable concentration, and lambda(z) is elimination rate constant.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants with Adverse Event as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 42 days</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical event that occurs in a participant administered an investigational product, and it does not necessarily indicate only events with clear causal relationship with the relevant investigational product.</description>

             drug is scheduled
