  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to examine the effect of single-task, dual-task and analogy training during
      gait rehabilitation on conscious motor processing propensity, balance, walking ability and
      fear of falling by older adults at risk of falling in Hong Kong. One-hundred and five healthy
      older adults will be recruited from elderly community centres in Hong Kong by convenience
      sampling. They will be randomly assigned into 3 groups (i.e., single-task walking group
      (active control group), dual-task walking group and analogy walking group). Participants in
      different groups will have training sessions (about 45 minutes each) three times per week for
      4 weeks in a group of 5 participants. A total of 12 sessions will be completed by each
      participant. All training sessions will be conducted by experienced Hong Kong registered
      Physiotherapists. In each training session, all groups will have warm-up (5 minutes), balance
      training (5 minutes), body transport training (5 minutes), body transport with hand
      manipulation training (5 minutes), walking training with various difficulties in a 10 meters
      walkway with different instructions in different walking groups (20 minutes) and cool down (5
      minutes). Participants in the different groups will receive different instructions during
      walking training. Well- developed single-task (explicit), dual-task and analogy instructions
      will be utilized in the single-task walking group, dual-task walking group and analogy
      walking group, respectively. Each participant will undergo assessment sessions (total 3
      assessment sessions) before training at baseline (T0), just after completion of all training
      sessions (T1) and 6 months after completion of all training sessions (T2). In the baseline
      assessment, a structural questionnaire will be used to ask for demographics, detailed history
      of fall incident, detailed medical history, social history and social-economic status of the
      participants. A battery of assessments will be done to assess physical and cognitive
      abilities of the participants in all assessment sessions. Single-task walking ability,
      dual-task walking ability, functional gait and balance assessment, cognitive function,
      fearing of falling and propensity for conscious motor processing.

      All participants will also be asked to record their number of falls prospectively at the time
      between T1 (completion of all training sessions) and T2 (6 months after completion of all
      training sessions) using a calendar. The number of falls within the 6-month follow- up period
      will then be collected.
