  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Family planning and the use of contraceptive methods are of the main strategies to reduce
      maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality, because they can prevent unplanned
      pregnancies, teenage pregnancies and abortions in dangerous conditions. It is also a tool
      that contributes to development as it improves children's health, improves access to early
      childhood education, empowers women and contributes to reducing poverty as it improves
      economic conditions.

      Currently the use of modern contraceptive methods has increased worldwide, in Latin America
      and the Caribbean the use of modern contraceptive methods has remained at 66.07% from 2008 to
      2015. However, the number of women who do not want to get pregnant and that do not use a
      contraceptive method is still high - 214 million women of childbearing age in developed
      countries.

      In our country according to the ENDES 2016 survey, the number of women who used a
      contraceptive method decreased by 0.7 percent compared to 2012, of which 54.3 percent used
      some modern contraceptive method and 21.9 percent some method traditional.

      The unmet demand for family planning in 2016 was 6.0%, affecting mainly women from the lowest
      poverty quintile (7.4%) and those living in rural areas (6.8%).

      Of the women who were surveyed and did not use a contraceptive method, 80.6% did not talk
      about family planning either at home or in a health facility in the last 12 months. Only
      16.3% of non-users were women who attended a health facility and received information on
      family planning.

      Through this study the investigators propose the design and evaluation of an interactive
      platform to promote modern contraceptive methods.

      Sample Size: Sample size of 176 participants (interventional group=88, control group=88), it
      is possible to detect minimum differences of 5% to 20%.

      Statistical analysis plan: The data collected will be entered into a database in Microsoft
      Excel, to be analyzed by the Epi Info statistical program. The qualitative variables will be
      analyzed by frequencies and percentages, the quantitative variables by relative risk.
