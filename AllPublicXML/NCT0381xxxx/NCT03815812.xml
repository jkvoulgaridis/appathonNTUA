  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      IBI306 is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds proprotein convertase
      substilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK-9), preventing its interaction with the low-density
      lipoprotein cholesterol receptor (LDL-R) and thereby restoring LDL-R recycling and
      low-density lipoprotein cholesterol（LDL-C）uptake. In phase I study IBI306 was shown to be
      safe and well tolerated. There was robust reduction in LDL-C, Apo(B), non-HDL-C and
      lipoprotein (a) in healthy subjects. This study is a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, repeated-dosing, multiple ascending dose trial to evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of a novel PCSK-9 anti-body, IBI306, in Chinese patients with
      hypercholesterolemia.

    <textblock>
      A total of 60 patients who meet the criteria for admission and have a clinical diagnosis of
      hypercholesterolemia and have received statin for at least 4 weeks will be randomized and
      receive different dose groups of IBI306 or matching placebo. Ascending dose design includes 6
      dose levels: 75 mg Q2W, 140 mgQ2W, 300 mg Q4W，420mg Q4W, 450 mg Q6W，and 600 mg Q6W. Total
      duration of the study per subject is 12 weeks.
