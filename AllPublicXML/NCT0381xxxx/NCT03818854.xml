  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2b, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study to
      assess the safety and efficacy of a single dose of Allogeneic Bone Marrow-derived Human
      Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (hMSCs) infusion in patients with Acute Respiratory Distress
      Syndrome (ARDS). This study is the extension of the Phase 1 pilot study (NCT01775774) and
      Phase 2a study (NCT02097641).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study design is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled Phase 2b
      clinical trial using a 10 million cell/kg dose of human Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (hMSCs).
      Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 randomization scheme to receive hMSCs or cell
      reconstitution media (1:1 mix of 5% human serum albumin and 10% Dextran 40) as the placebo;
      the study will enroll 120 patients who achieve a stable clinical baseline and receive study
      product (either hMSCs or the placebo).

      The Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review adverse outcomes and protocol
      compliance. A pre-specified interim review will occur after 60 subjects have been enrolled
      and received study product; enrollment will continue during the DSMB review. All
      pre-specified clinically important events and unexpected serious adverse events including
      death during hospitalization up to 60 days will be reported to the DSMB on an ongoing basis;
      the study will be stopped for a safety evaluation by the DSMB if they have any concerns or if
      three subjects have pre-specified clinically important events or unexpected serious adverse
      events except death since death will be common in this critically ill population due the
      nature of the underlying illness (e.g., ARDS).
