  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the program is to develop an online module/a health application for cell phones
      which will share didactic information regarding cancer prevention and early detection
      measures. These module/application will be developed, and be tested among volunteers for
      feedback. In the future, these module/application will be disseminated widely to address
      cancer health disparity particularly in Arkansas.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The application or the online module will play a short didactic explanation video that will
      provide information about cancers and benefits of uptake of cancer prevention and early
      detection measures. It is currently unknown which method will be used, the online module or
      the application for the purpose. The study participants will be subjected to only one method
      (once the method have been finalized and created). The video content will engulf information
      about cervical, breast, colorectal and lung cancer prevention and early detection. After the
      video, the application or the module will capture information on gender, age, smoking status,
      body mass index and positive cancer history in family. Watching the video and answering the
      questions will take approximately 5 minutes. The study participants will download the
      application on their personal cell phones and the data collected will be linked to
      identifying information in case they choose to receive the compensation and opt for the
      6-month follow-up. Based on the responses provided, and the age and the gender, the
      participants will be provided with a list of cancer prevention and early detection
      measure(s). A subset of the study participants from ARResearch (only those who have agreed
      for the 6-month follow-up) will be asked if they are willing to be contacted by the study
      staff after 6 Â±1 months (from the date of enrollment in the study) to enquire if they
      received/adopted the screening measures(s) that were suggested based on their age, gender and
      family history. They will be asked whether it is OK to call and/or e-mail them for more
      information to better describe barriers to obtaining cancer prevention and screening
      measures.
