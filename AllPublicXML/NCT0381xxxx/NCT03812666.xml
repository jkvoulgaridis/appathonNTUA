    <textblock>
      This study will look for new biomarkers of infection and evaluate current biomarkers of
      infection in stroke patients. Patients with acute stroke will be monitored with daily blood
      samples for seven days and by clinical examination to detect infections for 10 days.

      Rationale: Stroke is one of the leading causes of death globally, and infections after stroke
      contribute to a large part of the stroke-related mortality. The current study, which has a
      prospective, observational design, constitutes the second phase out of four in the
      Inflammatory Biomarkers In Stroke (IBIS) project, of which the overall goal is to enable
      early treatment of post-stroke infections.

      Aim: To develop a combined clinical and molecular biological signature for early detection of
      pneumonia in patients with stroke.

      Design: Prospective nested case control study

      Methods:Patients (n=200) with acute stroke will be monitored with clinical examinations for
      ten days and by daily blood samples for seven days. When cases of pneumonia have been
      established, samples and examination results from days preceding overt pneumonia will be
      compared to samples from similar patients that did not develop pneumonia.

      Outcome: Using proteomic and metabolomic methods, novel markers of upcoming pneumonia after
      stroke will be sought. Such laboratory markers will be combined with current biomarkers (such
      as C-reactive protein and procalcitonin) and data from clinical examinations, with the aim of
      constructing a biological signature that enables early detection of pneumonia.

    <description>The study will analyze a broad expanse of potential biomarkers, including known markers of infection such as c-reactive protein, procalcitonin and increased respiratory frequency as well as novel markers that will be pursued using proteomic and metabolomic methods. Those that are significantly associated with upcoming pneumonia will be selected. Biomarkers will be evaluated by the area under the curve for the receiver operating characteristic (AUC-ROC).</description>

        Eligible patients admitted to Örebro University hospital will be consecutively offered
        enrollement. The sample is weighted to include more patients with severe stroke (defined as
        NIHSS ≥ 11) than with moderate (NIHSS ≤10 and ≥ 6) or mild (NIHSS ≤5) stroke. The purpose
        of this is to ensure that a high proportion of participants will contract pneumonia since
        patients with a more severe stroke have a higher risk of pneumonia.
