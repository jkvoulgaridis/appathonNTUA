      This proof-of-concept study aims to assess the clinical and biological effects of
      Atezolizumab combined with Bevacizumab in advanced previously treated squamous-cell carcinoma
      of the head and neck (HNSCC).

    <textblock>
      Patients will receive the combination of Atezolizumab 1200 mg and Bevacizumab 15 mg/kg by IV
      infusion every 3 weeks. Treatment will be continued until disease progression, unacceptable
      toxicity or voluntary withdrawal. In the absence of unacceptable toxicity, patients who meet
      criteria for disease progression per RECIST v1.1 while receiving study treatment will be
      permitted to continue the study treatment if they meet all of the following criteria:

        -  Evidence of clinical benefit, as determined by the investigator following a review of
           all available data

        -  Absence of symptoms and signs (including laboratory values, such as new or worsening
           hypercalcemia) indicating unequivocal progression of disease

        -  Absence of decline in ECOG Performance Status that can be attributed to disease
           progression

        -  Absence of tumor progression at critical anatomical sites (e.g., leptomeningeal disease)
           that cannot be managed by protocol-allowed medical interventions.

    <intervention_model_description>The sample size calculation will use an adaptive Simon 2-stage design based on the strategy developed by Lin and Shih (Biometrics 2004). This method allows checking the result at the first stage, adjusting the power and success rate if necessary, and adapting the decision rule accordingly. A minimum of 69 patients (up to 110) will be enrolled in 2 parallel independent cohorts depending on the HPV status of their tumors: cohort A (HPV+, N = 42 to 59) and cohort B (HPV-, N = 27 to 51).</intervention_model_description>

        E22. Significant cardiovascular disease :

          -  Significant cardiovascular disease, such as New York Heart Association cardiac disease
             (Class II or greater), myocardial infarction within 3 months prior to C1D1, unstable
             arrhythmias, acute coronary syndromes (including unstable angina), or history of
             coronary angioplasty/stenting/bypass grafting within past 6 months.

          -  Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) &lt; 40% at screening.

          -  Known coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure not meeting the above
             criteria, or LVEF &lt; 50% must be on a stable medical regimen that is optimized in the
             opinion of the treating physician, in consultation with a cardiologist if appropriate.

          -  Severe cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication or severe conduction abnormalities

          -  Clinically significant valvular disease, cardiomegaly, ventricular hypertrophy, or
             cardiomyopathy.

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension defined by systolic pressure &gt; 150 mm Hg and/or diastolic
             pressure &gt; 100 mm Hg, with or without anti-hypertensive medication. Patients with
             initial blood pressure elevations are eligible if initiation or adjustment of
             anti-hypertensive medication lowers blood pressure to meet entry criteria.

          -  Prior history of hypertensive crisis or hypertensive encephalopathy

          -  History of stroke or transient ischemic attack within 6 months prior to C1D1

          -  Clinically significant peripheral vascular disease (e.g., aortic aneurysm requiring
             surgical repair or recent peripheral arterial thrombosis) within 6 months prior to
             C1D1.

        E23. History of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (including pneumonitis), drug-induced
        pneumonitis, organizing pneumonia (i.e. bronchiolitis obliterans, cryptogenic organizing
        pneumonia), or evidence of active pneumonitis on screening chest CT scan.

        E24. History of abdominal fistula, gastrointestinal perforation, or intra-abdominal abscess
        within 6 months prior to C1D1.

        E25. Serious non-healing wound, active ulcer or untreated bone fracture. E26. History of
        hemoptysis (≥ ½ teaspoon of bright red blood per episode), or any other serious hemorrhage
        or at risk of bleeding (gastrointestinal history of bleeds, gastrointestinal ulcers, etc.).

        E27. History or evidence of inherited bleeding diathesis or significant coagulopathy at
        risk of bleeding.

        E28. Evidence of significant uncontrolled concomitant disease that could affect compliance
        with the protocol or interpretation of results, including significant liver disease (such
        as cirrhosis, uncontrolled major seizure disorder, or superior vena cava syndrome).

        E29. Pregnant or lactating women.
