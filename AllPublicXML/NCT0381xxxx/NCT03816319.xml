      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of TAK-243 in treating patients
      with acute myeloid leukemia, or myelodysplastic syndrome, or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia
      that has come back or that is not responding to treatment. TAK-243 may stop the growth of
      cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To establish the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of ubiquitin-activating enzyme (UAE)
      inhibitor TAK-243 (MLN7243 [TAK-243]) administered intravenously in a twice-weekly schedule
      in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or patients with myelodysplastic syndromes
      (MDS) or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) refractory to hypomethylating agents (HMAs).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) evaluated on the first cycle (Day 1 to 21) of
      MLN7243 (TAK-243), its safety profile, and dose limiting toxicities (DLT).

      II. To investigate preliminary anti-leukemic activity of MLN7243 (TAK-243) monotherapy in
      patients with AML, MDS and CMML.

      III. To relate responses to the molecular/cytogenetic abnormalities in the malignant cells or
      to pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) findings.

      IV. To describe the PK of MLN7243 (TAK-243). V. To describe the PD profile of MLN7243
      (TAK-243) in the study population. VI. To establish the RP2D of MLN7243 (TAK-243)
      administered intravenously in a once-weekly schedule in patients with AML or patients with
      MDS or CMML refractory to HMAs.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation, followed by a dose expansion, study. Patients are
      assigned to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients receive UAE inhibitor TAK-243 intravenously (IV) over 10 minutes on days 1,
      4, 8, and 11. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 12 months in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      GROUP II: Patients receive UAE inhibitor TAK-243 IV over 10 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15.
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 months in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.

             criteria will be considered eligible:

               -  CD4 count &gt; 350 cells/mm^3

               -  Undetectable viral load

               -  Maintained on modern therapeutic regimens utilizing non-CYP-interactive agents

          -  Patients with a history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection must have been treated
             and cured. For patients with HCV infection who are currently on treatment, they are
             eligible if they have an undetectable HCV viral load.

          -  Absence of other malignancy requiring active therapy.

          -  Absence of any co-morbid condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, might
             compromise the patient's safety, might interfere with participation in the trial or
             might interfere with the interpretation of trial results.

          -  Absence of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) following allogeneic
             transplantation; does not require continued treatment with systemic immunosuppressive
             agents.

          -  Female patients who:

               -  Are postmenopausal (age-related amenorrhea &gt;= 12 consecutive months or
                  follicle-stimulating hormone &gt; 40 mIU/mL), for at least 1 year before the
                  screening visit, OR

               -  Are surgically sterile (i.e., who had undergone hysterectomy or bilateral
                  oophorectomy), OR

        If they are of childbearing potential:

          -  Agree to practice 1 highly effective method and 1 additional effective (barrier)
             method of contraception, at the same time, from the time of signing the informed
             consent through 4 months after the last dose of study drug (female and male condoms
             should not be used together), or

          -  Agree to practice true abstinence, when this is in line with the preferred and usual
             lifestyle of the subject. (Periodic abstinence [e.g., calendar, ovulation,
             symptothermal, postovulation methods] withdrawal, spermicides only, and lactational
             amenorrhea are not acceptable methods of contraception.)

               -  Male patients, even if surgically sterilized (i.e., status postvasectomy), who:

          -  Agree to practice effective barrier contraception during the entire study treatment
             period and through 4 months after the last dose of study drug (female and male condoms
             should not be used together), or

          -  Agree to practice true abstinence, when this is in line with the preferred and usual
             lifestyle of the subject. (Periodic abstinence [e.g., calendar, ovulation,
             symptothermal, postovulation methods for the female partner] withdrawal, spermicides
             only, and lactational amenorrhea are not acceptable methods of contraception.)

               -  The effects of MLN7243 (TAK-243) on the developing human fetus are unknown. For
                  this reason and because ubiquitin-activating enzyme inhibitors are known to be
                  teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate
                  contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to
                  study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become
                  pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in
                  this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or
                  enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to
                  the study, for the duration of study participation, and 4 months after completion
                  of MLN7243 (TAK-243) administration.

               -  Absence of any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition
                  potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule;
                  those conditions should be discussed with the patient before registration in the
                  trial. Patients with treated brain metastases are eligible if there is no
                  evidence of progression for at least 4 weeks after central nervous system

          -  Patients (including those newly diagnosed) who are not considered candidates for
             aggressive induction or reinduction chemotherapy regimens.

               -  AML-SPECIFIC ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Absence of active CNS leukemia (patients with
                  prior CNS leukemia who have negative CNS cytology and who receive periodic
                  prophylactic intrathecal chemotherapy are eligible).

               -  MDS-SPECIFIC ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Patients with International Prognostic Scoring
                  System (IPSS) intermediate-2 or high risk MDS that is refractory to treatment
                  with HMA therapy at time of enrollment, defined as:

          -  progression to AML.

                  defined as:

          -  progression to AML.

          -  failure to respond to HMA therapy.

          -  recurrence or progression of CMML following initial response to HMA therapy.

          -  intolerance to HMAs.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have not recovered from adverse events due to prior anti-cancer therapy
             (i.e., have residual toxicities &gt; grade 1).

          -  Patients receiving any medications or substances that are strong inhibitors or
             inducers of CYP3A4 are ineligible, as CYP3A4 is the major cytochrome P450 isozyme
             contributing to the metabolism of MLN7243 (TAK-243). Because the lists of these agents
             are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated
             medical reference. As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient
             will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new
             medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new
             over-the-counter medicine or herbal product.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Pregnant and lactating/breast-feeding women are excluded from this study because
             MLN7243 (TAK-243) is a UAE-inhibiting agent with the potential for teratogenic or
             abortifacient effects and there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in
             nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with MLN7243 (TAK-243). Females
             of child-bearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days
             before enrollment and should not be lactating/breast-feeding. Breastfeeding should be
             discontinued if the mother is treated with MLN7243 (TAK-243).

               -  Myocardial infarction (MI) within 6 months prior to first dose (patients who had
                  ischemic heart disease such as a (acute coronary syndrome [ACS]), MI, and/or
                  revascularization greater than 6 months before screening and who are without
                  cardiac symptoms may enroll);
