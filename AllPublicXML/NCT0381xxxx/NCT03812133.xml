      The Operating Theatre (OT) is the largest cost centre as well as the main revenue generator
      in most hospitals. One of the common problems affecting optimal OT utilization is the
      cancellation of scheduled surgeries. The goal of this study was to identify factors
      associated with cancellation within 24 hours of scheduled surgeries in a tertiary hospital

      The Operating Theatre (OT) is the largest cost centre as well as the main revenue generator
      in most hospitals. The operating theatre involves significant resources - materials,
      medications and manpower. One of the common problems affecting optimal OT utilization is the
      cancellation of scheduled surgeries. This results in a significant waste of resources,
      especially when cancellation occurs within 24 hours of the scheduled surgery, when it is too
      late to arrange replacement surgery. Cancellation also impacts the patient and their
      families.

      Reported cancellation rates range between 5% to 40%. Reasons for cancellations vary,
      including patient factors, surgeon factors, and system issues relating to the preoperative
      anaesthesia assessment clinic attendance, the surgery itself, and the availability of
      post-surgical care facilities. Between 60% to 90% of cancellations have been reported to be
      potentially avoidable.

      The goal of this study was to identify factors associated with cancellation within 24 hours
      of scheduled surgery in a tertiary academic hospital, and the reasons for cancellation, with
      the goal of identifying areas for intervention to reduce avoidable surgery cancellations and
      reduce unnecessary waste.

        The median patient age was 68 years (IQR 63 - 75 years), with 44% being male patients and
        80% Chinese. Majority were Singapore citizens or permanent residents (98%). Two-thirds of
        the surgical patients were in a subsidized ward class (2665, 66%). Only 2% required
        Medifund assistance.

      <textblock>
        Adult patients (age 18 years and older) who were scheduled for elective surgery at the
        Singapore General Hospital main operating theatre or ambulatory surgical centre, regardless
        of surgical discipline, or residency, were included in the study. Only the first surgery in
        the study period was included if a patient had multiple surgeries over this period. Minor
        surgeries under local anaesthesia were also excluded. We excluded those without previous
        admissions in the past 3 years prior to the surgery, as data for chronic disease history
        and healthcare utilization patterns were not available for these patients
