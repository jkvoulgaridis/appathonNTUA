  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The CAPSS Study is a retrospective and prospective, multi-center, single-arm post-market data
      collection study with an FDA cleared device. Physiologic data measurements will be collected
      from enrolled subjects using electronic health records and data streams via the Accuryn
      Monitoring System. Analysis of these data has the potential to be able to acutely guide
      resuscitation and monitor trends for emerging critical conditions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the CAPSS Study is to track and analyze changes in physiologic data
      streams to identify clinical signatures that may enable earlier diagnosis of, and effective
      intervention in, critical conditions.
