  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spinal cord injury is a devastating condition, causing substantial impairment of vital body
      functions caudal to the lesion. A major cause of disability stems from spasticity, a common
      secondary sequelae. Its various clinical manifestations include spasms, clonus, and
      resistance to passive movements, and often present a major hindrance in rehabilitation,
      further deteriorate residual motor performance, and negatively impact independence and
      quality of life. Despite its high prevalence, successful management of spasticity has
      remained difficult. Standard-of-care treatment modalities are often insufficient or bear the
      risk of undesirable side effects further accentuating paresis. Epidural stimulation of the
      lumbar spinal cord via implanted electrodes provides for an alternative approach. It works
      through modifying the dysregulated neural signal processing of spared spinal circuitry caudal
      to the injury. Its ameliorative effects on severe lower-limb spasticity have been
      repetitively reported. Yet, epidural spinal cord stimulation in motor disorders is still
      off-label, applied in relatively few patients only, also because of its invasive character,
      the time consuming testing phase for its effective application, and the lack of markers to
      identify responders in advance. With the development of transcutaneous spinal cord
      stimulation, a method became available to activate the same input structures to the lumbar
      spinal cord as with epidural stimulation and hence to induce similar neuromodulatory effects,
      yet non-invasively, using standard equipment available at rehabilitation centers. A recent
      proof-of-concept study has shown that a single 30-minute session of transcutaneous spinal
      cord stimulation controlled various clinical signs of spasticity and augmented residual motor
      control in spinal cord injured individuals for several hours beyond its application. Further,
      in one subject, the stimulation was repetitively applied for six weeks, resulting in
      cumulative therapeutic effects persisting for 10 days after its discontinuation. These
      observations strongly suggest that the stimulation can induce beneficial neuroplastic
      adaptations of spared spinal systems and their interaction with residual supraspinal control.
      The proposed research aims at studying the reproducibility of these findings in a
      statistically sound cohort of individuals with spinal cord injury and testing the
      applicability and acceptance of transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation as a home-based
      therapy.

    <measure>Change in spasticity index</measure>
    <time_frame>from day 1 to day 57</time_frame>
    <description>Spasticity index based on the Wartenberg pendulum test: For the pendulum test, subjects will be in a supported sitting position with the trunk reclined approximately 30°. The examiner will lift one leg to a horizontal position, release it, and let it oscillate passively until it stops. The pendulum test will be repeated three times on each side, separated by phases of relaxation. The spasticity index is calculated subtracting the knee angle of the initial horizontal leg position from the peak flexion angle of the first swing divided by the final knee resting angle. Scores ≥ 1 denote non-spastic conditions, and 0 extreme spasticity.</description>

    <time_frame>day 1, 8, 29, 50 and 57</time_frame>
    <description>The severity of spasticity is rated using a numeric rating scale from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 10. Higher values represent worse outcome.</description>

    <measure>Change in Modified Ashworth Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>from day 1 to day 57</time_frame>
    <description>The resistance to passive movement will be clinically graded according to the Modified Ashworth Scale. Individual scores from both legs will be summed (with a value of 1.5 for the 1+ scoring category) to result in a single Modified Ashworth Scale-sum score (0-96; 0, no increase in muscle tone) per assessment. Higher values represent worse outcome.</description>
