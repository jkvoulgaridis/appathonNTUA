  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the Phase I portion of the study is to assess the therapeutic safety
      and preliminary efficacy of a hematopoietic cell-based gene therapy consisting of autologous
      CD34+ enriched cells transduced with the therapeutic lentiviral vector, Chim-CD18-WPRE,
      RP-L201. The primary objectives of the Phase II portion of the study are evaluation of
      survival, as determined by the proportion of subjects alive at age 2 (24 months) and at least
      1-year post-infusion without allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) and
      characterization of the safety and toxicity associated with the infusion.

    <textblock>
      This is a pediatric non-randomized open-label Phase I/II clinical trial. The Phase I portion
      will include a safety evaluation and preliminary assessment of the efficacy of hematopoietic
      gene therapy consisting of autologous CD34+ enriched cells transduced with a lentiviral
      vector carrying the ITGB2 gene in subjects with severe LAD-I. CD34+ cells will be transduced
      ex vivo with the therapeutic vector followed by cryopreservation. If the number of CD34+
      cells that are available for infusion is at least 2x10e6 total CD34+ clells/kg, subjects will
      undergo myeloablative conditioning with intravenous busulfan. Subjects will then receive
      infusion of gene-corrected hematopoietic cells approximately 24 hours following the final
      busulfan dose.

      The active agent is a self-inactivating lentiviral vector carrying the therapeutic ITGB2
      gene, encoding for the human CD18 receptor (β2 integrin subunit). The therapeutic product is
      the subject's autologous hematopoietic stem cells that have been transduced with the
      lentiviral vector.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A confirmed diagnosis of severe LAD-I as demonstrated by flow cytometry indicating
             CD18 expression on &lt;2% neutrophils (polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs)). Subjects in
             which CD18+ PMNs are &gt;2% will be considered eligible with &lt;2% CD11a or CD11b
             expressing PMNs and if there is a documented ITGB2 mutation and clinical history
             consistent with LAD-I (or known family history).

          -  At least one (1) prior significant bacterial or fungal infection US NCI CTCAE, v5.0,
             Grade ≥2). This criterion is not required for subjects with documented family history
             who meet the above inclusion criteria.

          -  Age ≥3 months.

          -  Considered to be an appropriate candidate for autologous transplantation of
             hematopoietic stem cells.

          -  A competent custodial parent with legal capacity to execute an institutional review
             board (IRB)/ethics committee (EC)-approved consent form must be available to
             participate in the consent process. (Informed assent will be sought from capable
             subjects, in accordance with the directive of the IRB/EC and with local requirements).

          -  Ability to comply with trial procedures including investigational therapy and
             follow-up evaluations.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Availability of a medically-eligible human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical sibling
             donor transplant. Subjects may not be included in this trial as an alternative to a
             clinically-indicated and feasible HLA-matched sibling donor hematopoietic stem cell
             transplant. If an HLA-identical sibling is identified, but mobilized peripheral blood
             or bone marrow hematopoietic stem cell collection is not feasible (for example: donor
             is in utero, is a newborn from whom cord blood was not collected, or is unable to
             undergo donation procedure because of medical impairments), then inclusion may be
             permitted per Investigator discretion.

          -  Hepatic dysfunction as defined by either:

               -  Bilirubin &gt;1.5× the upper limit of normal (ULN) or

               -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &gt;2.5×ULN.

          -  Renal dysfunction as defined by either Grade 3 or higher abnormalities in serum
             sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium or phosphate as defined by NCI CTCAE v5.0, or
             the requirement for either peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis.

          -  Pulmonary dysfunction as defined by either:

               -  Need for supplemental oxygen during the prior 2 weeks (in absence of acute
                  infection).

               -  Oxygen saturation (by pulse oximetry) &lt;90%.

          -  Evidence of active metastatic or locoregionally advanced malignancy (including
             hematologic malignancy) for which survival is anticipated to be less than 3 years.

          -  Serious infections with persistent bloodstream pathogens at time of trial entry.
             (Subjects with active infections (e.g., unresolved ulcerative lesions, skin or oral
             infections) are permitted as long as appropriate antibiotic therapy has been (or is
             being) administered).

          -  Any medical or other contraindication for both leukapheresis and bone marrow harvest
             procedure, as determined by the treating Investigator.

          -  Any medical or other contraindication for the administration of conditioning therapy,
             as determined by the treating Investigator.

          -  Significant medical conditions, including documented human immunodeficiency virus
             (HIV) infection, poorly-controlled diabetes, poorly-controlled hypertension,

             thromboembolic events (including stroke or myocardial infarction) within the 6 prior
             months.

          -  Any medical or psychiatric condition that in the opinion of the Investigator renders
             the subject unfit for trial participation or at higher than acceptable risk for
             participation.
