  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the present study will be to evaluate the efficacy of photobiomodulation
      (PBM) with LED in pain control, facial edema, paresthesia, bone repair and quality of life
      arising after maxillar surgical disjunction (MSD). A randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled clinical trial involving 72 participants aged 18 to 45 years, who search
      the Service of Oral Maxillofacial Surgery and Traumatology of the Mandaqui Hospital Complex
      to undergo MSD, attend to the eligibility criteria and agree to participate. Surgeries will
      be conducted by three oral maxillofacial surgeons who will perform all surgical procedures,
      two examiners (who will perform pre and post-surgical evaluations, blinded to the
      experimental group) and another researcher who will perform the LED application. Before the
      surgeries, facial measures, radiographic examinations, tests of facial and oral sensitivity
      and the evaluation of the level of anxiety of all the participants will be carried out.
      Immediately after the surgeries, the participant will be inserted into the placebo group or
      the LED group, according to block randomization defined previously. In the LED group, the
      participants will receive PBM with an extraoral device (660 and 850 nm with 6J per point) and
      an intraoral one (660 nm with 2J per point) and in the control group the participants will be
      attended in the same way, but with the LED devices kept off. The applications will be in the
      immediate postoperative period, 1, 2, 7, 14, 30, 60, 90 and 120 days after the end of the
      surgeries, when the evaluations will also be performed. Facial measurements, extra and
      intraoral sensitivity, pain and bone repair will be evaluated. Secondarily, the data
      regarding the occurrence of headache; otalgia; nausea; bruise; nasolacrimation; epistaxis;
      dysphagia; systemic and superficial temperature in the operated region; use of analgesics and
      anti-inflammatories; anxiety and impact of oral health on the participants' quality of life
      will be computed.

    <masking_description>The pre and postoperative evaluations will be done by two examiners who will not be aware of the group in which each patient is allocated. The information that will be obtained in the evaluations will be noted in the clinical evaluation card. Participants will not be aware of whether or not they have received the FBM, since the person responsible for the application will position the equipment in the irradiation locations in all participants and will only trigger the light when and where predicted in the specific experimental group. The characteristic sound of the device will be triggered by recording in the control group.</masking_description>

    <measure>Change in Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>After 1, 2, 7 and 14 days of surgeries.</time_frame>
    <description>A Visual Analog Scale (VAS) will be printed on the patient evaluation form and the subjects will be instructed by the evaluator to mark a point in the line of 10 cm, indicating the intensity of their pain after 1,2, 7 and 14 days of the surgeries. For the NRS-101 scale, the evaluators will ask patients to assign a number between 0 (no pain) and 100 (worst possible pain) that best represents the pain they are currently experiencing after 1, 2, 7 and 14 days of surgeries.</description>

    <description>Using a flexible plastic millimeter tape (0.5mm precision), five facial measurements will be taken corresponding to the distances between the points listed below as described by Ristow et al. (2013).
Line A - posterior tragus point to the most lateral point of the labial commissure Line B - tragus posterior point to pogonium Line C - posterior tragus point to the lateral corner of the eye Line D - lateral corner of eye to lowest point of jaw angle Line E - lower point of the angle of the mandible (gonio) to the middle of the nasal bone</description>

    <time_frame>After 7, 30, 60, 90 and 120 days of surgeries.</time_frame>
    <description>The evaluation of extra and intraoral sensitivity will be performed in 6 regions: below the lower eyelid, cheek, nose wing, upper lip, oral buccal mucosa and oral palatal mucosa on both sides. The tests will be performed sequentially, with a 2 to 3 minute interval between each. The participant will receive instructions on the tests that will be initially performed on the back of his hand so he can become familiar.</description>
