  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      FT-4202 is an oral small-molecule agonist of pyruvate kinase red blood cell isozyme (PKR)
      being developed for the treatment of hemolytic anemias. This initial study will characterize
      the safety, tolerability and the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) of a single
      ascending dose and multiple ascending doses of FT-4202 in the context of Phase 1 studies in
      healthy volunteers and sickle cell disease patients. The effects of food on the absorption of
      FT-4202 will also be evaluated in healthy volunteers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human (FIH), Phase 1 study of FT-4202 that will characterize the safety,
      PK and PD of FT-4202 after a single dose and after repeated dosing first in healthy adult
      volunteers and then in adolescents or adults with sickle cell disease (SCD). Initially, a
      dose range of FT-4202 in single ascending dose (SAD) escalation cohorts will be explored in
      healthy subjects. Enrollment of healthy subjects into 2-week multiple ascending dose (MAD)
      escalation cohorts will be initiated once the safety and PK from at least two SAD cohorts is
      available to inform the doses for the 2-week MAD portion of the study. The MAD cohorts will
      then run in parallel to the single dose cohorts. A single dose cohort of healthy subjects is
      planned to understand food effects (FE) on the PK of FT-4202. After the SAD and FE studies in
      healthy subjects are completed, the safety, PK, and PD of a single dose of FT-4202 that was
      found to be safe in healthy subjects will then be evaluated in SCD subjects. Multiple dose
      studies in SCD subjects will then be initiated upon completion of MAD studies in healthy
      volunteers.
