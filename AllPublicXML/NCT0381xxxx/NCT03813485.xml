      The aim of this study is to compare the surface electromyography (EGM) changes between dry
      needling in the upper trapezius, is a prevalence tonic fiber or lower trapezius is a
      prevalence phasic fiber.

      Several studies already found a disturbed surface electromyography activity in myalgic muscle
      tissue and in the vicinity of myofascial trigger points, however studies about the effect of
      dry needling in this fibers type on these disturbances in EMG activity are scarce.

      The surface electromyography of upper trapezius is related with a tonic muscle dysfunction,
      for example muscle contracture; and the lower fiber of trapezius is related with atrophy
      muscle.

      Dry needling is an effective method for the treatment of myofascial trigger points for
      immediate reduction of pain. There are some studies about latent myofascial trigger point and
      motor activity, but we don't know any research about the effect of dry needling in the
      differences fibers.

    <description>The following criteria are required for a patient to have latent TrPs: the presence of a palpable taut band in the upper trapezius muscle, the presence of a hypersensitive spot in the taut band, a palpable or visible local twitch on snapping palpation, and a no familiar reproduction of referred pain elicited by palpation of the sensitive spot.
Dry needling is performed with solid filiform needles (0.30x30 mm), these needles are sterile and separately packaged. Needles are not reused and are immediately deposited in a needle container after usage. Patients receive dry needling in latent myofascial trigger point (LTRs) in upper trapezius. The needle is penetrated into the muscle fibers of the taut band and was moved upward and downward (&quot;fast in, fast out&quot;) in different directions with the aim to elicit LTRs</description>
