    <textblock>
      This study was completed in two stages. In the first stage, 2000 participants were enrolled
      according to the criteria. Following the principle of informed consent and voluntary consent
      of patients, the standard operation was &quot;right or bilateral thyroidectomy + isthmus resection
      + right area VI lymph node dissection + left area VI lymph node dissection + lateral neck
      lymph node dissection&quot;. The age of participants, the size of right thyroid tumors, the
      invasion of the capsule and the number of lateral neck lymph node metastasis were counted to
      validate and improve the predictive model of lymph node posterior to the right recurrent
      laryngeal nerve in papillary thyroid cancer (Y=−0.029×age+0.771×tumor size+0.660×capsular
      invasion+1.331×right lateral lymph node metastasis−1.687, Y ≥0.16 means right recurrent
      laryngeal nerve posterior lymph node metastasis).

      In the second stage, 2000 participants assessed by the model without posterior right
      recurrent laryngeal nerve metastasis were randomly divided into experimental group and
      control group according to the principle of informed consent and voluntary. The right
      recurrent laryngeal nerve posterior lymph nodes were not dissected in experimental group,
      while the right recurrent laryngeal nerve posterior lymph nodes were routinely dissected in
      control group. Through long-term follow-up and comparison of RFS and OS between the two
      groups, the investigators can scientifically evaluate the effectiveness of the &quot;prediction
      model of lymph node posterior to right recurrent laryngeal nerve metastasis in papillary
      thyroid carcinoma&quot;, and seek evidence for accurate treatment of lymph node posterior to the
      right recurrent laryngeal nerve in thyroid papillary carcinoma.

    <description>The right cervical central compartment VI is subdivided into right cervical central VI-1 subzone and VI-2 subzone. Right central VI-1 subzone lies anterior to the RLN bounded by the hyoid bone superiorly, the suprasternal notch inferiorly, the inner edge of the common carotid artery laterally, and the midline of the trachea medially. Right central VI-2 subzone lies posterior to the right RLN. The superior, inferior, lateral, and medial borders are the laryngeal entry points of RLN, the intersection of the RLN with the innominate artery (near the right apical pleura), the inner edge of the common carotid artery, and esophagus, respectively. The floor of right central VI-2 is the prevertebral fascia.</description>
