  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spasticity is defined as a state of increased muscle tone, which evokes an increased
      resistance to a passive and fast stretching of the muscle. Indeed, the degree of spasticity
      depends, among other things, on the stretching velocity performed to the muscle. However,
      most of the tools used in the clinical setting to assess spasticity do not take into account
      the relationship between increased muscle tone and speed of stretching. Instead of that,
      muscle tone is usually assessed in a relaxed position of the muscle.

      Likewise, to date, despite the functional disabilities related to the presence of chronic
      pain after a stroke, no previous study has correlated muscle tone and pressure pain
      sensitivity within this population

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pressure Pain Threshold, assessed by Manual Pressure Algometry</measure>
    <time_frame>One time assessment</time_frame>
    <description>A handheld electronic pressure algometer with a 1-cm2 contact probe will be used. Pressure pain thresholds (PPTs), as the minimum necessary pressure force to evoke pain, will be assessed bilaterally over biceps brachii and the gastrocnemius muscles (medial and lateral). Assessments will be made using a topographical mapping covering myotendinous and muscle belly sites in the above mentioned muscles. A 30-second break will be used between assessments to prevent bruising, and an average of the two measures over each site will be calculated for the statistical analysis. Pressure algometry is reliable in healthy individuals, and in stroke patients</description>

    <measure>Muscle Tone Assessment, using the modified Tardieu Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>One time assessment</time_frame>
    <description>The modified Tardieu Scale is the most common tool used in the clinical setting to evaluate the muscle tone. The muscle response to a slow and fast stretching will be performed. During the fast stretching, the joint angle in which the muscle responds with difficulty will be collected using an electrogoniometer.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Muscle Stiffness, assessed by a myotonometer</measure>
    <time_frame>One time assessment</time_frame>
    <description>The stiffness of the biceps brachii and gastrocnemius muscles will be collected using a handheld myotonometer device, the so-called MyotonPRO, (Myoton AS, Estonia). The MyotonPRO is small, non-invasive, and it has shown good validity and high reliability in larger and smaller body muscles. This device delivers a multi-scan mode of three brief mechanical impulses, each one shortly followed by a quick release, to record the damped natural oscillation of the muscle using an accelerometer.
Evaluations will be made in the affected and non-affected sides of stroke patients and in dominant and non-dominant sides of control participants.</description>

    <measure>Muscle State of Tension (Muscle Tone), assessed by a myotonometer</measure>
    <time_frame>One time assessment</time_frame>

    <measure>Muscle Thickness</measure>
    <time_frame>One time assessment</time_frame>
    <description>The thickness of the assessed muscles will be evaluated using ecography. Muscle thickness will be assessed in one point corresponding to a myotendinous site and one point corresponding to a muscle belly location in both, the biceps brachii and gastrocnemius muscles.
Evaluations will be made in the affected and non-affected sides of stroke patients and in dominant and non-dominant sides of control participants.</description>
