  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of dacomitinib and osimertinib, at increasing
      doses, to find out what effects, if any, this combination of drugs has on people with
      metastatic EGFR mutant lung cancer that has not been treated with an EGFR TKI.

    <description>The MTD will be defined as the highest dose at which not more than 1/6 of the patients experience dose limiting toxicity (DLT). DLT is defined as any of the toxicity events described below that occurs within cycle 1 of treatment with the combination of dacomitinib and osimertinib.</description>

    <description>Tumor response will be assessed using RECIST 1.1.The NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 5 (NCI-CTCAE) will be used to grade toxicities during the trial. Dose-limiting toxicities (DLT‟s) are defined as any of the following events occurring during the first cycle of treatment</description>
