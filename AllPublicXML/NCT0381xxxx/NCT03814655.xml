  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of the present study is to compare the accuracy of a full digital workflow
      for dental implants insertion to a partially digital workflow, for a limited edentulous space
      (1 to 3 dental units), in the maxilla or mandible.

    <textblock>
      Improvements of dental digital technologies are nowadays enabling clinicians to take the
      digital impressions of the dental arches, therefore avoiding the use of conventional
      impression materials. Digital impression procedures are claimed to be an approach to improve
      the accuracy of dental restorations by minimizing the error prone to conventional impression
      and gypsum model casting, enabling a high degree of standardization. Patients often prefer
      intraoral scan when compared to the traditional impression. Digital impression is also
      recommended when patients have remaining teeth that are extremely mobile or misaligned, due
      to the risk of exfoliation during the conventional impression procedure.

      Despite its poor scientific and clinical evidence, the use of digital technologies into the
      daily practice registers a rapidly growing.

      The precision of digital impressions depends on two different parameters: the resolution of
      the optical scanning system, and the precision of the matching algorithm which may
      significantly influence the precision of full arch scans. In order to minimize the effect of
      matching artifacts, only small parts of the dental arch in close vicinity of the teeth are
      recommended to be scanned.

      For prosthetic restoration purpose, several studies regarding the accuracy of digital vs
      analogue impression have been performed, but none comparing the accuracy of digital vs
      partially digital workflow for prosthetically driven guided dental implant insertion.

Each patient will be randomly assigned to one of the following protocol for dental implant insertion:
Full digital workflow (n=27 patients/sites),

    <description>Accuracy is described, by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard 5725-1, through the use of two parameters: trueness and precision.
Trueness refers to the deviation between the actual dimension of the measured object and the resulting measurement, while precision indicates how closely repeated the measurements in a set are.</description>
