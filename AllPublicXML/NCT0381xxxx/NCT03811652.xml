  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess safety and tolerability, describe the dose-limiting toxicities, assess the
      preliminary antitumor activity, determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or the highest
      protocol-defined dose (maximum administered dose) in the absence of establishing the MTD, and
      a recommended dose for further evaluation of MEDI7247 in patients with selected advanced or
      metastatic solid tumor malignancies that have received at least 1 prior line of treatment.
