      Can a mobile application improve adherence, self-efficacy and range of motion after flexor
      tendon repair? A randomized controlled multicenter trial.

      Aim Evaluate how the use of a mobile application will affect exercise adherence, range of
      motion and self-efficacy when compared to standard rehabilitation after flexor tendon repair.
      Method Multicenter randomized controlled trial. Patients with flexor tendon repair in zone I
      or II were included and rehabilitated with early active motion and followed 12 weeks
      post-surgery. Randomization was performed by a computer-generated concealed block to control
      (n=60) or intervention group (n=60). Both groups received standard rehabilitation according
      to early active motion. Intervention group also received a smart phone app including;
      exercise videos, push-notifications for exercise, exercise diary, written information on the
      surgery, rehabilitation, questions and answers. Evaluation was made at baseline, 2, 6- and
      12-weeks after surgery. Primary outcome was physiotherapist rated adherence on the Sport
      Injury Adherence Scale (SIRAS). Secondary outcome was self-reported adherence, perceived
      self-efficacy, total Active range of motion (TAM) in the Proximal Interphalangeal (PIP) joint
      and Distal Interphalangeal (DIP) joint and perceived satisfaction with rehabilitation and
      information.
