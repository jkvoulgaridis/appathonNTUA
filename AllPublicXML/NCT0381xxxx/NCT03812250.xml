      Purpose of the study: To compare efficacy, stent patency, re-intervention rate, cost, quality
      of life, survival time, and adverse events between EUS-guide biliary drainage (EUS-BD) and
      ERCP assisted trans-papillary drainage for malignant biliary obstruction.

      Subjects of the study: Patients who have malignant biliary obstruction.

      Methods of the study:

        -  Prospective randomized controlled study

        -  Patients were randomly divided into two groups, EUS-BD group or ERCP group

        -  Patients will get assigned procedure (EUS-BD or ERCP assisted trans-papillary
           drainage)for decompression of malignant biliary obstruction

        -  After the procedure, regular follow up, blood test, and imaging test will be done to
           check sufficient biliary decompression, stent patency, re-intervention rate, cost,
           quality of life, survival time, and adverse events rate.

      Statistical methods: SPSS 23.0 statistical software was used. The measurement data was
      expressed as xÂ± s, and t-test or non-parametric test was used. Chi-square test was used for
      count data.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ERCP is a well-established procedure for the management of malignant biliary obstruction.
      However, even in expert hands, ERCP fails in 3%-5% of cases, especially in patients with
      surgically altered anatomy or difficult biliary cannulation. In these cases, more invasive
      options are usually considered, which including percutaneous trans-hepatic biliary drainage
      and surgical intervention, but they all have been associated with a higher risk of
      complications and prolonged hospital stay. EUS-guide biliary drainage using a metal stent,
      particularly a lumen-apposing metal stent, is a promising technique for biliary decompression
      in patients with failed ERCP. There has been growing global experience with EUS-BD in recent
      years, and data from expert centers support the feasibility and efficacy of EUS-BD. However,
      few researches compared the efficacy and complication rates between EUS-BD and ERCP for
      malignant biliary obstruction. The investigators herein aim to conduct a randomized
      controlled clinical trial to compare the efficacy and complication rates between EUS-BD and
      ERCP for malignant biliary obstruction.
