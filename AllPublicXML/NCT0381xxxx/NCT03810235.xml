    <textblock>
      This study will be a single-center, single blind, randomized controlled trial. The study will
      be conducted at UnityPoint-Health Meriter Hospital under investigators from the University of
      Wisconsin-Madison. Obstetric patients with prepregnancy obesity undergoing a Cesarean
      delivery at UnityPoint-Health Meriter will be eligible.

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether transdermal lidocaine administered at the
      time of Cesarean delivery and for 12 hours postoperatively will reduce the total dose of
      opioids received. Our hypothesis is that a lidocaine patch will reduce the total dose of
      opioids received in the immediate 24 hours post-delivery. Secondary outcomes will include
      patient self-reported pain scores, patient-reported incidence of side effects, such as
      pruritis, development of objective complications, such as serious skin reactions (examples
      are acute generalized exanthematous pustolosis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal
      necrolysis), hypersensitivity, nausea, and nervousness. Other outcomes collected will include
      length of stay, time to first rescue analgesic medication, total dose of opioids in 48 hours,
      use of supplemental oxygen during hospitalization, total dose of opioids during
      hospitalization, breastfeeding rates, both exclusive and in combination with formula use,
      amount of opioid prescribed at discharge and whether refills were requested or administered,
      rates of chronic pain at six weeks postpartum, and six week Edinburgh Depression Screen
      scores. Neonatal outcomes such as five-minute Apgar scores and development of adverse
      outcomes will also be collected.
