  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a highly prevalent sleep-disordered breathing disease,
      caused by recurrent episodes of partial or complete collapse of the upper airway during
      sleep, resulting in intermittent hypoxia, fragmented sleep, fluctuations in blood pressure,
      and increased sympathetic nervous system activity. A single-night sleep study (i.e.
      respiratory polygraphy or polysomnography) is currently considered to be the gold standard
      for diagnosing OSA. However, recent studies suggest a significant intra-individual
      night-to-night variability of respiratory events, leading to the hypothesis that one
      single-night study might not reflect an accurate picture of the disease.

      Part A: Patients with suspected obstructive sleep apnea, referred to our clinic, undergo the
      regular diagnostic procedure recommended by the current guidelines. In addition to the
      in-hospital single-night sleep study, these patients will perform 14 nights of pulse-oximetry
      at home. By computing and analysing sensitivity and specificity of every additional night,
      the investigator will answer the questions how many nights of sleep monitoring by home
      oximetry are necessary to diagnose OSA reliably, and how longitudinal sleep monitoring could
      reduce the number of false-negative and false- positive results compared to the in-hospital
      single-night study.

      Part B: Based on the patients' data of part A, the investigator will develop a questionnaire
      and present anonymized cases to experts in the field of sleep medicine. Thereby, the
      investigator will evaluate if the additional information of repeated nocturnal
      pulse-oximetries changes the experts' decision making regarding diagnosis and treatment of
      OSA.

      In a second step, the investigator will perform a classical Delphi study with a panel of
      experts in sleep medicine to establish consensus on repeated sleep studies and how they
      should be used for diagnosis and treatment in patients with suspected OSA.
