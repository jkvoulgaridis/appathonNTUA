      A randomized, double-blind controlled Study from a single center to evaluate the effect and
      safety of pramipexole on peritoneal dialysis patients with restless legs syndrome
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peritoneal dialysis patients diagnosed with restless legs syndrome will be divided into
      experiment group and control group, and will be prescribed with pramipexole and placebo
      respectively.After 12 weeks, we will compare IRLSSG（International RLS Study Group Rating
      Scale）、MOS（Medical Outcomes Study ）Sleeping Scale、Self-Rating Anxiety Scale and Self-Rating
      Depression Scale before and after the prescription.

    <description>Pramipexole will be taken once daily in the evening 2 to 3 hours before bedtime. The starting dose of pramipexole is 0.125 mg/day. During the first 4 weeks, the daily dose could be increased by the treating physician in weekly intervals to 0.25, 0.50, or 0.75 mg/day, according to the Patient Global Impression scale (PGI) rating and overall tolerability of the drug. In the case of adverse events (AEs), the dose could be reduced to the previous dose step. During 5 to 12 weeks, the dose will keep constant.</description>
