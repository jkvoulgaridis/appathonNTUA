  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial was designed to provide empirical evidence with which to compare the efficacy and
      safety of the invisa-RED Technology Elite Low-level Laser Therapy (LLLT) device with a sham
      device as a placebo, when both are used in the treatment of individuals to reduce body fat
      and improve body aesthetics. At the conclusion of the trial; the change in body fat
      percentage, the change in total body fat in pounds, and total inches lost of the two groups
      were statistically analyzed to determine the efficacy of the invisa-RED Technology Elite when
      used for body fat (adipose tissue) loss and/or aesthetics therapy.

      The trial was designed to prove the efficacy and safety of the invisa-RED Technology Elite
      Low-level Laser Therapy (LLLT) device. The trial compared results between two groups; the
      first group was treated using a fully functional invisa-RED Technology Elite device; this
      group was designated the Usual Care Group.

      The second, a control group, was treated utilizing a nonfunctional invisa-RED Technology
      Elite device; this group is referred to as the Sham Group.The sham device consisted of an
      invisa-RED Technology Elite device that will appear to operate as the Usual Care Group device
      to the operator and participants, but the laser diodes will be disabled and will receive no
      power providing a placebo effect. If staff or a participant questions the efficacy of the
      sham device, an assertion may be made that only a near infrared, non-visible frequency of
      light, is being employed.

      The trial was conducted employing a double blind study methodology; participants were
      randomly assigned to each group through a drawing, neither participants nor clinicians knew
      to which trial group they were assigned. To ensure the double blind; treatment for the two
      groups occurred separately using clinicians exclusive to each group.

      A simplified weight loss protocol was employed based on the &quot;Consultation Protocol&quot; from the
      invisa-Red Training Manual. All study participants received nine (9) therapy sessions of 20
      minutes each; power settings were based on the participants Fitzpatrick Scale skin type. For
      skin types i and ii a power setting of 7 was used, for skin types iii and iv a power setting
      of 6, for skin types v and vi a power setting of 4 was employed. At the conclusion of the
      nine (9) therapy sessions; the change in weight of body fat, body fat as a percentage of
      total body weight, and inches lost of the two groups were statistically analyzed to determine
      the efficacy of the invisa-RED Technology Elite as a therapy to reduce adipose tissue. The
      occurrence of any medical errors were documented and included in the statistical analysis.

             device.

          -  People who have hemorrhagic disease, vascular ruptures, skin inflammation, or any
             disease of the skin should not use this device.

          -  People who have immune system dysfunction such as Leukemia, Hemophilia, etc., and
             light sensitive persons should not use this device.

          -  Individuals with a history of melanoma, raised moles, suspicious lesions, keloid scar
             formation, or healing problems should not undergo laser light therapy.

          -  Individuals with active infections, open lesions, hives, herpetic lesions, cold sores,
             or tattoos and permanent make-up in the area of treatment should not undergo laser
             light therapy.

          -  People who have used isotretinoin (commonly known as Accutane), tetracycline, St.
             John's Wort, or any photo sensitizing drugs in the last year should not undergo laser
             light therapy.

          -  Individuals with autoimmune diseases such as Lupus, Scleroderma, or Vitiligo should
             not undergo laser light therapy.

          -  Individuals who have pacemakers or other electro-stimulation devices surgically
             implanted should not undergo laser light therapy.

          -  Any insulin dependent individual should consult their physician before undergoing
             laser light therapy.

          -  All individuals considered &quot;vulnerable&quot; such as children, pregnant women, nursing home
             residents or other institutionalized persons, students, employees, fetuses, prisoners,
             and persons with decisional incapacity.
