  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) of pevonedistat in
      participants with severe renal impairment and mild hepatic impairment.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called pevonedistat. The study will characterize the
      PK of pevonedistat, assess the safety, and determine the dose of pevonedistat, in combination
      with azacitidine, in participants with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), CMML and AML who also
      have severe renal impairment or mild hepatic impairment.

      The study will enroll approximately 60 participants. The study will be conducted in 2 parts:
      Part A (PK run-in and dose escalation phase) and Part B. In Part A, participants will be
      assigned to one of the 3 treatment groups on the basis of their renal and hepatic function:

        -  Control Arm (Normal Renal and Hepatic Function)

        -  Renal Arm (Severe Renal Impairment)

        -  Hepatic Arm (Mild Hepatic Impairment)

      Part A will include pevonedistat PK run-in starting on Day -7, followed by a dose-escalation
      phase with the combination of pevonedistat and azacitidine starting on Day 1. Eligible
      participants from Part A will continue treatment in optional Part B with the same treatment
      received in Part A: pevonedistat in combination with azacitidine.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States and Spain. The overall time to
      participate in this study is approximately 2.5 years. Participants will attend end of the
      study visit 30 days after the last dose of study drug or before the start of subsequent
      therapy, if that occurs sooner for safety follow up.

    <description>Disease response in AML are based on international working group (IWG) for diagnosis, standardization of response criteria, treatment outcomes, and reporting standards for therapeutic trials in AML. For AML participants, all CR includes both CR and complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (Cri). CR: morphologic leukemia-free state with absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of greater than (&gt;) 1000 per microliter (/mcL) and platelets of greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 100,000/mcL, and no residual evidence of extramedullary leukemia. Cri: After chemotherapy, some participants fulfill all criteria for CR except for residual neutropenia (less than [&lt;] 1000/mcL) or thrombocytopenia (&lt;100,000/mcL). PR: requires all hematologic values for a CR but with a decrease of at least 50 percent (%) in the percentage of blasts to 5% to 25% in the bone marrow aspirate.

    <ipd_description>Takeda makes patient-level, de-identified data sets and associated documents available for all interventional studies after applicable marketing approvals and commercial availability have been received (or program is completely terminated), an opportunity for the primary publication of the research and final report development has been allowed, and other criteria have been met as set forth in Takeda's Data Sharing Policy (see www.TakedaClinicalTrials.com for details). To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias. Once approved, qualified researchers who sign a data sharing agreement are provided access to these data in a secure research environment.</ipd_description>
