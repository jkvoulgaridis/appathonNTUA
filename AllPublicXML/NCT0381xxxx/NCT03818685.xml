      To evaluate the clinical benefit of a post-operative adjuvant therapy combining radiotherapy

    <textblock>
      This trial is an open-label, randomised, multicentric, comparative, Phase II study aiming to
      evaluate the clinical benefit of a combined treatment associating radiotherapy + Nivolumab +
      Ipilimumab versus radiotherapy + Capecitabine (standard treatment) in early TNBC patients who
      have Residual cancer burden (RCB) III residual disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

      Following validation of eligibility criteria, patients will be randomised (1:1) to receive:

        -  Arm A: Nivolumab (360 mg IV, every 3 weeks) for 8 doses and Ipilimumab (1 mg/kg, IV,
           every 6 weeks or every 2 doses of Nivolumab in case of dose delays) for 4 doses.

        -  Arm B: Capecitabine (1000 mg/m2 twice a day, Bis In Die [BID]), 14 days on / 7 days off
           for 8 cycles.

      In both arms, radiotherapy will be administered as per standard practice and has to be
      initiated one week before C1D1.
