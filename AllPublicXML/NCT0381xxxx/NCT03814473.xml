  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Overweight, physically inactive but otherwise healthy adults habitually eating a traditional
      Western diet will follow an ad libitum self-administered Paleo diet for 8-weeks. Blood and
      body composition will be measured before and after the intervention period.

      The Paleo diet is a dietary method that is gaining popularity among the general population
      due to potential weight loss and disease prevention benefits. The feasibility of the Paleo
      diet and the effectiveness of self-administration in improving cardiometabolic disease risk
      factors remains uncertain. Examination od cardiometabolic disease risk factors in overweight,
      physically inactive adults before and after 8-weeks of an ad libitum self-administered Paleo
      dietary intervention. Methods: Overweight, physically inactive but otherwise healthy adults
      habitually eating a traditional Western diet follow an ad libitum self-administered Paleo
      diet for 8-weeks. Blood samples were analyzed for fasting cardiometabolic disease biomarkers.
      Participants complete three-day dietary recalls prior to, and during weeks 4 and 8 of the
      intervention to confirm Western diet consumption at pre-, track compliance, and to assess
      dietary changes.
