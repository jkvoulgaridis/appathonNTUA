  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the systemic impact of salting out of trace
      elements (TE) by metallic and nonmetallic implantable medical devices (IMD) and in particular
      the immune response of the organism to these trace elements and of their target organs, and
      to identify circulating protein biomarkers which might indicate an evolution of inflammation
      caused by an IMD.

    <textblock>
      As secondary objectives, the study aims:

        -  to establish the norms of concentrations of free TE and nanoparticles for some forty of
           elements (in particular Chrome, Cobalt, Nickel, Titanium, Tantalum, Zirconium, Tungsten,
           Gold, Silver, Mercury, Molybdenum, Strontium ...) in different materials (blood, urine,
           hair and the viscera), with non-IMD holder subjects, before and after mineralization of
           these materials (dead patients and autopsied non-IMD holder subjects and subjects before
           placement of IMD.

        -  to evaluate the distribution of concentrations of metals in the same materials and in
           peri-prothetic environment with IMD holder subjects (dead autopsied patients), more
           often with no inflammatory sign, with possibility of some probably inflammatory IMD.

        -  to evaluate the parameters of distributions of concentrations of metals in same
           materials (with the exception of the viscera) with living IMD holder patients, with
           inflammatory reaction (during revision surgery).

        -  to define the most suitable material (accessibility, concentrations, absence of
           contamination) for follow-up and evolution of inflammation in order to determinate norms
           of studied metals concentration.

        -  to determinate proportion between different forms of circulation: particulate form
           (analysis after full mineralization) or free form (analysis without mineralization,
           permitting measurement of free forms), trace elements in organism.
