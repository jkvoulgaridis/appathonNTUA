      The purpose of this study is:

        -  to assess efficacy of MMH-MAP in the treatment of mild cognitive impairment in early
           stage of recovery after ischemic stroke

        -  to assess safety of MMH-MAP in the treatment of mild cognitive impairment in early stage
           of recovery after ischemic stroke

      A double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial in parallel groups.

      Study subjects are patients of either sex aged between 45 and 80 years presenting 3 to 6
      months after cerebral infarction which has led to moderate cognitive impairments.

      After the patients provide signed Participant Information Sheet and Informed Consent, they
      are interviewed for complaints and medical history and undergo physical examination and
      laboratory tests. The doctor rates the severity of patients' cognitive impairments on the
      Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) scale and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scale,
      assess their performance in activities of daily living on the Barthel Index scale, and
      administer the Stroke Specific Quality of Life Scale (SS-QOL) questionnaire. Eligible
      participants have to have moderate cognitive impairments (MMSE score of at least 21 and MoCA
      score of at least 26). Therapy received by patients for their comorbidities and for their
      primary diagnosis is recorded. All women of childbearing potential are administered pregnancy
      tests.

      If a patient meets all inclusion criteria and does not meet any of the exclusion criteria at
      Visit 1 (Day 1), he/she is randomized to either of the study groups: Group 1 - patients
      receive MMH-MAP at a dose of 2 tablets twice daily; Group 2 - patients receive Placebo under
      the MMH-MAP dosing regimen. The length of the observation period is 28 weeks, during which
      subjects make 5 more scheduled visits to the doctor's office.

      At Visit 2 (Week 4±7 days), the doctor records patients' complaints and physical examination
      data, reviews the progress of study treatment and comorbidity/primary therapies, and assesses
      treatment safety and patient compliance with treatment.

      At Visit 3 (Week 8±7 days), Visit 4 (Week 16±7 days), and Visit 5 (Week 24±7 days), the
      doctor assesses patients' cognitive impairments (MoCA) and performance in activities of daily
      living (the Barthel Index). The patients complete the SS-QOL questionnaire.

      At Visit 5 (Week 24±7 days), the doctor additionally completes the Clinical Global Impression
      Efficacy Index (CGI-EI) scale and collects samples for laboratory testing. The patient stops
      taking the study drug.

      After four weeks following treatment termination patients complete a follow-up visit -Visit 6
      (Week 28±7 days). The patients are interviewed for complaints and undergo physical
      examination, with a check on their comorbidity and primary therapies as well as on the safety
      of study treatment. The doctor assesses patients' cognitive impairments (MoCA) and
      performance in activities of daily living (the Barthel Index) and administers the SS-QOL
      questionnaire.

      The total length of the observation period is 28 weeks. Subjects are allowed to take
      medications for their comorbidities in the course of the study, except for the medicines
      listed in 'Prohibited Concomitant Treatment'.
