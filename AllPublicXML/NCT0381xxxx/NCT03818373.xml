  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim is to evaluate the correlation between the respiratory control to hypercapnia at rest
      and the VE/VCO2 slope measured during cardiopulmonary exercise testing.

      The hypothesis is that patient with univentricular congenital heart disease have a increasing
      of respiratory drive like chronic heart failure. This increasing of respiratory drive could
      participate in the increasing of VE/VCO2 slope measured during cardiopulmonary exercise
      testing and in the genese of central apnea index during the sleep.

      The patients with univentricular congenital heart disease will perform :

        -  a cardiopulmonary exercise testing with measure VE/VCO2 slope,

        -  a measure of the respiratory drive to hypercapnia with occlusion pressure during the
           rebreathing with at rest (P0,1/PetCO2).

        -  A polysomnography with a scoring of central apnea index. Correlation will be evaluate
           between P 0,1/PetCO2 with VE/VCO2 slope and between P0,1/PetCO2 central apnea index.
