  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To measure and quantify the postprandial glucose variations in response to a meal in the
      healthy 6-12 months old child and correlate this response with the composition of this meal.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      14 full-term infants (boys and girls) aged six to twelve months and fed a diversified diet
      including infant formula, solid foods such as mixed meat and vegetable preparation or
      marketed preparations will be recruited. Children will be recruited in the Lausanne Childrens
      hospital and only be included in the study whenin good general health.

      FreeStyle® Libre Pro Interstitial Glucose Meter will be applied on the last day before
      discharge from the hospital after skin preparation with anesthetic cream (Emla®) during
      hospitalization and measurements will be recorded during 2-5 days.

      It is not intended to measure capillary or venous blood glucose levels during this study.
      However, if blood is collected during hospitalization, blood glucose will be measured in
      parallel with the interstitial glucose measured with the device.

      The child will follow his usual diet without modifications. The amount of food consumed by
      the child as well as the length of the meals will be recorded by the parents. For meals made
      by the parents they will be asked to keep a sample not seen to analyze their carbohydrate
      content. The total carbohydrate content will be measured .

             composition.

          -  Hospitalized at the Lausanne Children's Hospital for non-severe reasons that do not
             affect or suspect to affect glucose metabolism

          -  Measures of feeding (time and compositions with samples) feasible for 3 consecutive
             days by the parents at home

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Child born premature

          -  Allergy known to adhesive plaster

          -  Infectious diseases affecting the skin (eg chickenpox, scarlet fever,)

          -  disorders of cutaneous microcirculation

          -  Infants suffering from diseases affecting nutrition or digestion (diarrheal
             gastroenteritis) and children undergoing antibiotic treatment that may affect
             gastrointestinal absorption

          -  Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Computed Tomography (CT), or Diathermy Therapy
