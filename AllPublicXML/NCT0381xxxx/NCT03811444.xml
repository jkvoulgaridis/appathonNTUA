      A simulated clinical use testing on the HTL-Strefa's safety lancets
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the safety of the use of the safety lancets: Haemolance Plus,
      Prolance and MediSafe Solo in the prevention of NSI and to evaluate the user's opinion with
      regards to the handling characteristics of the medical devices.

      The simulated use clinical study will involve healthcare professionals (HCPs) who routinely
      use safety lancets to collect blood samples.

          -  evaluators have no concerns about the ability to perform the simulated skin pricking.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Individuals will be excluded if:

          -  They do not routinely use safety lancets to collect capillary blood samples,

          -  They cannot read, write, and speak English,

          -  They or a family member have a business or consulting relationship with a
             pharmaceutical or medical device company, or
