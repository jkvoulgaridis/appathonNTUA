    <textblock>
      This is an open label, randomized, controlled clinical trial. The primary aim of this project
      is to determine the safety and tolerability of NF135.C10 sporozoite immunization under
      chemoprophylaxis against homologous and heterologous challenge infection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 49 healty volunteers will be allocated to receive either three immunizations with
      15 NF135.C10 infected Anopheles mosquitoes (n=30), 3 immunizations with 5 NF135.C10 infected
      mosquitoes (n=10) or no immunizations (n=6). Immunizations in cohort A (n=20) will be
      performed under mefloquine prophylaxis, spaced 4 weeks apart. In cohort B, volunteers will
      not take mefloquine prophylaxis, instead all volunteers will be treated presumptively on day
      7 after each immunization with a curative regimen of artemeter/lumefantrine, regardless of
      parasitaemia or symptoms.

      Nineteen weeks after the last immunization, all volunteers plus naïve controls will be
      challenged either by the bites of 5 NF135.C10 (n=36) or 5 NF54 (n=13) infected mosquitoes.
      After challenge infection, volunteers will be followed up on an out-patient basis once daily
      for qPCR and safety lab measurements from day 6 until day 21 post challenge. All volunteers
      will be treated with a curative regimen of atovaquone/proguanil, either at the time of
      detection of blood stage parasitemia, or 28 days after challenge infection.
