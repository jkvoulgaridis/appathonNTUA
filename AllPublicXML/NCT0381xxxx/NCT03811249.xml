  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to obtain an additional 36 months of safety and effectiveness
      data from all subjects who were implanted with the VisAbility™ Micro Insert in the VIS-2014
      clinical trial.

      VIS-2014-5YR is a multicenter, observational study to evaluate the long-term safety of the
      VisAbility™ Micro Inserts in subjects who were implanted with the VisAbility™ Micro Insert in
      the VIS-2014 clinical trial. Study subjects will be examined at 36, 48, and 60 months
      post-operatively (based on the anniversary of their first VisAbility™ surgery) with no
      planned interventions.
