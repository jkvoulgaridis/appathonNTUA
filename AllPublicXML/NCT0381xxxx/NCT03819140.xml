  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The mainstay treatment for females with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) has long been a
      combination of an oral contraceptive pill or OCP (containing both estrogen and progestin)
      along with an anti-androgen medication (such as Spironolactone) to not only prevent chronic
      anovulation but also suppress elevated testosterone levels and its clinical effects on the
      body. While there are multiple OCPs available on the market today and several studies that
      look at different progestins and their anti-androgenicity, not much is known about whether
      the length of active pills in OCP therapy (3 weeks versus 6 months) has any further benefit
      in continued suppression of testosterone and subsequently improvement in clinical findings of
      hyperandrogenism in the PCOS population. In this pilot randomized open label clinical trial,
      females between the ages of 16 and 35 years diagnosed with PCOS based on the Rotterdam
      Criteria, and not currently on medical therapy with an OCP will be enrolled in the study and
      randomized to either a continuous 6 month OCP or cyclical 21 day active OCP therapy. Our aim
      is to conduct a pilot randomized clinical trial to determine the effect of 6 months of active
      monophasic OCPs on testosterone levels and cutaneous findings of hyperandrogenism (hirsutism
      and acne) as compared to a traditional 21 day active/7 day placebo OCP in women with PCOS.
      These findings will be compared over a 6 month period.

      Those who meet criteria to take part in the study (women between the ages of 16-35 years,
      diagnosed with PCOS and have findings of hyperandrogenism either by serum testosterone levels
      above the normal reference range or by their modified Ferriman Gallwey score of &gt;8, and are
      recommended to start an oral contraceptive pill for therapy) and give consent, will be
      randomized into either of two oral contraceptive (OCP) treatment groups:

        1. Ethinyl estradiol 30 mcg-Drospirenone 3 mg (Yasmin): 168 days of active hormone pills
           (no placebo pills) for 6 months.

        2. Ethinyl estradiol 30 mcg-Drospirenone 3mg (Yasmin): 21 days of active + 7 days of
           placebo pills for 6 months

      Participants will be given the OCP Yasmin with instructions to take the medication at the
      same time each day for the length of the study (6 months). On the 4th, 12th and 24th week of
      therapy (roughly the 1st, 3rd and 6th month), blood work will be drawn and is detailed below.

      At 1 month into therapy, (near the end of the 4th week on an OCP) both treatment groups will
      be expected to get blood work (total and free testosterone, SHBG, estradiol, LH, and FSH
      levels will be checked). At the time of the blood draw, subjects in the cyclical group should
      be on placebo/sugar pills and those in the continuous group on active hormone pills.

      At 3 months into therapy, participants will come back to the PCOS clinic for routine care
      follow up and be seen by a Reproductive Endocrinology and Fertility specialist. This visit is
      considered &quot;standard of care&quot; and not specific to the study. However, during this visit a
      study investigator will also touch base briefly with the participants to see how they are
      doing. An online survey (through REDCap) will also be sent to participants that addresses if
      they have missed any doses of their medication and assess their acne quality of life. In
      addition, participants will once again get blood work (including total and free testosterone,
      SHBG, estradiol, LH, FSH, fasting lipid panel, fasting serum glucose, insulin, and HbA1c). As
      before, the cyclical group should be on placebo/sugar pills at the time of blood draw and the
      continuous group on active hormone pills.

      At 6 months into therapy, participants will come in for a study visit (this is not considered
      routine care) in which they will have their vitals taken, a physical exam that includes a
      re-evaluation of their mFG score, and an in-clinic pelvic ultrasound to assess ovarian volume
      and follicle counts. They will also be emailed a post-study survey through REDCap, that
      includes a quality of life questionnaire for both acne and hirsutism, and includes questions
      regarding satisfaction with current therapy and any missed doses of their medication. Lastly,
      participants will again be expected to get blood work (total and free testosterone, SHBG,
      estradiol, LH, FSH).

    <description>Participants will be examined and scored using the modified Ferriman-Gallwey Hirsutism. score. This scoring system is considered the standard scoring system that defines hirsutism (excess male pattern hair growth on the body) quantitatively. There are 9 body areas measured on a scare of 0-4, with higher values indicative of significant hair growth. All subscales are combined for a total score, with a minimum score of 0 and max of 36. A total score of &gt;/=8 is considered diagnostic for hirsutism.</description>

                  total testosterone level above the normal reference range for assay, and/or an
                  modified Ferriman-Gallwey hirsutism score &gt;8)

               3. Polycystic ovary morphology on ultrasound

          3. Adolescents should be at least 2 years out from menarche (first menstrual period).

          4. Participants must not be on an oral contraceptive pill (OCP) at the start of the study
             and or Spironolactone therapy (an anti-androgen medication), but recommended by their

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Females with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) who do not have either biochemical
             (elevated total or free testosterone levels) or clinical (modified Ferriman-Gallwey
             hirsutism score &lt;8) findings of hyperandrogenism will not be included in the study as
             this is one of the primary outcome measures.

          2. Females with PCOS who are already on and currently using a form of contraceptive
             (oral, IUD, vaginal ring, or patch)

          3. Females that are concurrently using or plan to use an anti-androgenic medication such
             as Spironolactone in the next 6 months.

          4. Females currently or are planning to obtain permanent hair removal (ex. laser hair
             removal, electrolysis) in the concurrent 6 months of starting oral contraceptive (OCP)

          5. Women who are pregnant or have contraindications for starting an OCP, including active
             smokers, history of clotting disorders, history of deep vein thrombosis or blood
             clots, neoplasia, vascular disease, migraines, hypertension, or have renal/hepatic
             disease will be excluded from the study as OCP therapy would not be indicated or
             approved in this population.

          6. Females with elevated potassium levels above the normal reference range for age.
