  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The double-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, one-period effectiveness study will
      include 30 subjects (women, aged between 25 to 55 years, Fitzpatrick phototype II and III).
      Subjects will be divided in two groups, 15 in each. One group (test group) will receive
      investigational product - lutein syrup (4 mg/mL; daily dose 20 mg) and the other (placebo
      group) placebo syrup. Participants will test continuous administration of placebo or
      investigational product for 12 weeks in order to demonstrate and assess multiple-dose
      effects. The primary objective is to assess the photoprotective potential of the
      investigational product in relation to placebo product. The secondary objectives are to
      assess effects of investigational product on dermis density and skin viscoelasticity after 12
      weeks of dietary supplementation.

    <description>The primary objective is to assess the photoprotective potential of the investigational product in relation to placebo product. It will be assessed through measurements of minimal erythema dose with MED Tester using UVB irradiation. Significant change of minimal erythema dose from baseline in test group, in comparison to placebo group, after 12 weeks of dietary supplementation with study product is expected.</description>
