  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to verify the effect of acute sodium bicarbonate (SB) and
      placebo (PLA) supplementation on buffering potential kinetics, physical capacity,
      discipline-specific performance as well as concentration of diagnostically significant blood
      biochemical indices in athletes, in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover
      trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Effective muscle work is conditioned by maintaining the proper range of muscles pH, regulated
      by buffering systems, in which the main role is played by bicarbonates (HCO3-). For this
      reason, sodium bicarbonate (SB) is often proposed as an ergogenic agent, especially during
      high-intensity efforts. Until now the major limitation to SB supplementation has been the
      gastrointestinal (GI) side effects. There is also a lack of data of the individual SB-induced
      changes of buffering potential kinetics and its actual connection with physical capacity and
      discipline-specific performance. Therefore, this study aims to examine the effect of acute,
      different-dose SB ingestion on buffering potential kinetics, physical capacity,
      discipline-specific performance as well as changes of diagnostically significant blood
      biochemical indices concentration in athletes, in a randomised, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled crossover trial.

    <description>Interventions:
The experimental procedure for each athlete included an acute SB supplementation in a different-dose regimen in order to assess whether the dose affects the actual physical and exercise capacity (doses: 0,15-, 0,25- and 0,35 g/kgFFM, respectively). SB (Alkala T, SANUM, Poland) will be administered as dissolved form in a 600 ml of fluid (water + fruit juice). On testing days the supplements will be taken 2 hours before physical and exercise capacity tests session.
Between the SB and PLA or a PLA and SB treatments, a minimum 7-day washout period will be introduced.</description>
