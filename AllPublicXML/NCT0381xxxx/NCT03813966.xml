  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that persons over the age of 13 years can obtain
      a self-collected nasal swab reliably and safely for subsequent use in the diagnosis of
      influenza. Similarly, the purpose is to demonstrate that parents or guardians can safely and
      effectively collect nasal swab specimens from children, ages 0 through 12 years, and others
      needing assistance in doing so, and that these parent/guardian-collected nasal swabs can also
      be used in the diagnosis of influenza. Clinical performance of the swabs will be based on the
      comparison of the performance of the nasal swab that is self- or parent/guardian-collected to
      one collected from the same specimen donor by a skilled clinical coordinator and used in CLIA
      (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments)-waived, rapid diagnostic test called Sofia
      Influenza A+B FIA (fluorescence immunoassay analyzer).

    <description>Hypothesis tested is that self-collected nasal swab are as accurate as nasal swabs collected by a trained healthcare worker for the diagnosis of influenza by CLIA-waived, rapid diagnostic test called Quidel Sofia Influenza A+B Fluorescent Immunoassay. The investigators will specifically measure the specificity of self-collected specimens as compared to the clinical standard (trained healthcare worker collected specimen), estimating it using standard methods along with 95th% confidence intervals.</description>
