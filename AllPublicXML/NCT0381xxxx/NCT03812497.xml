    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators aimed to observe changes in the gut microbial composition
      before and after the weight-loss intervention, including dietary control and exercise, in
      obese children. The main metabolites produced by gut microbiome, short chain fatty acids
      (SCFAs) will be also analysed. The investigators will analyse the change of gut microbiome
      composition and metabolites related with weight-loss intervention and the relationship
      between microbiome composition and metabolites.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many recent studies have suggested that dysbiosis of the gut microbiome might related to
      obesity. There is growing evidence that the composition of gut microbiome changes in
      childhood obesity compared to normal-weight children, and it is attracting attention as an
      adjustable environmental factor in obesity treatment. It has been reported that gut
      microbiome could be changed due to environmental influences such as diet and exercise. In
      this study, the investigators aimed to observe changes in the gut microbial composition
      before and after the weight-loss intervention, including dietary control and exercise, in
      obese children. The main metabolites produced by gut microbiome, short chain fatty acids
      (SCFAs) would be also analysed to investigate the relationship with gut microbiome and with
      weight-loss intervention. Intervention is not performed for normal-weight children, and
      samples from normal-weight children will be used as a control for gut microbiome and
      biochemical tests.
