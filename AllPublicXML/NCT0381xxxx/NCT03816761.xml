  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The iLet™ is a new insulin pump that is programmed to work with a Continuous Glucose
      Monitoring (CGM) device. This is to give participants insulin automatically. The CGM device
      is already available for sale. The iLet™ is not yet approved for use. Fast-acting insulin
      aspart is a type of insulin that doctors can already prescribe for use with insulin pens, but
      not for use in an insulin pump. This study is to test how safe fast acting insulin aspart is
      when used with different insulin delivery settings in the iLet™ in people with type 1
      diabetes. Participants will get fast-acting insulin aspart as participants' insulin and use
      the iLet™ as participants' insulin pump with a CGM device. Participants' iLet™ will be set to
      2 different insulin delivery settings for 7 days on each setting. The setting participants
      get first is decided by chance. The study will last for about 5 to 9 weeks. Participants will
      have 4 visits and 1 phone contact with the study or staff.

    <measure>Number of Treatment Emergent Severe Hypoglycaemic Episodes</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to day 7</time_frame>
    <description>Number of treatment emergent severe hypoglycaemic episodes from initiation of treatment (day 1) to end of treatment (day 7). Treatment emergent is defined as an episode that has onset in the period from initiation of treatment to end of treatment.
Severe hypoglycaemia: An episode requiring assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon or take other corrective actions. Plasma glucose (PG) concentrations may not be available during an event, but neurological recovery following the return of PG to normal is considered sufficient evidence that the event was induced by a low PG concentration.</description>

    <description>Mean number of self-manageable (able to self-treat) treatment emergent hypoglycaemic episodes that require oral carbohydrate intervention per day. Self-manageable (able to self-treat) hypoglycaemic episodes that require oral carbohydrate intervention per day is calculated as the sum of all hypoglycaemic episodes where the subject is able to self-treat and that require oral carbohydrate intervention divided by the actual duration of the treatment period in days. Treatment emergent is defined as an episode that has onset in the period from initiation of treatment to end of treatment.</description>

After 7 days they received fast-acting insulin aspart with the iLet™ having non-default tmax in the algorithm settings (t40 = 40 minutes) for 7 days. The total treatment duration for each cohort was 14 days.</description>

        <description>Number of treatment emergent severe hypoglycaemic episodes from initiation of treatment (day 1) to end of treatment (day 7). Treatment emergent is defined as an episode that has onset in the period from initiation of treatment to end of treatment.
Severe hypoglycaemia: An episode requiring assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon or take other corrective actions. Plasma glucose (PG) concentrations may not be available during an event, but neurological recovery following the return of PG to normal is considered sufficient evidence that the event was induced by a low PG concentration.</description>

        <title>Number of Treatment Emergent Overall Hypoglycaemic Episodes Classified According to the American Diabetes Association (ADA) Definition</title>
        <description>ADA classification of hypoglycaemia:
Severe hypoglycaemia: An episode requiring assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon or take other corrective actions.
Asymptomatic hypoglycaemia: An episode not accompanied by typical symptoms of hypoglycaemia, but with a measured PG concentration ≤3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL).
Documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia: An episode during which typical symptoms of hypoglycaemia are accompanied by a measured PG concentration ≤ 3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL).
Pseudo-hypoglycaemia: An episode during which the person with diabetes reports any of the typical symptoms of hypoglycaemia with a measured PG concentration &gt; 3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) but approaching that level.
Probable symptomatic hypoglycaemia: An episode during which symptoms of hypoglycaemia are not accompanied by a PG determination but that was presumably caused by a PG concentration ≤ 3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL).</description>

        <title>Number of Treatment Emergent Daytime Hypoglycaemic Episodes Classified According to the American Diabetes Association (ADA) Definition</title>
        <description>ADA classification of hypoglycaemia:
Severe hypoglycaemia: An episode requiring assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon or take other corrective actions.
Asymptomatic hypoglycaemia: An episode not accompanied by typical symptoms of hypoglycaemia, but with a measured PG concentration ≤3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL).
Documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia: An episode during which typical symptoms of hypoglycaemia are accompanied by a measured PG concentration ≤ 3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL).
Pseudo-hypoglycaemia: An episode during which the person with diabetes reports any of the typical symptoms of hypoglycaemia with a measured PG concentration &gt; 3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) but approaching that level.
Probable symptomatic hypoglycaemia: An episode during which symptoms of hypoglycaemia are not accompanied by a PG determination but that was presumably caused by a PG concentration ≤ 3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL).</description>

        <title>Number of Treatment Emergent Nocturnal Hypoglycaemic Episodes Classified According to the American Diabetes Association (ADA) Definition</title>
        <description>ADA classification of hypoglycaemia:
Severe hypoglycaemia: An episode requiring assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon or take other corrective actions.
Asymptomatic hypoglycaemia: An episode not accompanied by typical symptoms of hypoglycaemia, but with a measured PG concentration ≤3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL).
Documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia: An episode during which typical symptoms of hypoglycaemia are accompanied by a measured PG concentration ≤ 3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL).
Pseudo-hypoglycaemia: An episode during which the person with diabetes reports any of the typical symptoms of hypoglycaemia with a measured PG concentration &gt; 3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) but approaching that level.
Probable symptomatic hypoglycaemia: An episode during which symptoms of hypoglycaemia are not accompanied by a PG determination but that was presumably caused by a PG concentration ≤ 3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL).</description>
