  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fracture of the upper extremity of the femur is a condition whose frequency increases with
      age. It is a serious disease, with multiple consequences such as a decrease in life
      expectancy, quality of life and patient autonomy. In this observational study, the
      investigators wish to evaluate the evolution of the autonomy of very elderly patients
      operated on for an upper extremity femur fracture as a function of early post-operative
      anemia.
