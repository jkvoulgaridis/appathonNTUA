  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the influence of acupuncture on heart rate
      variability, skin conductance (sweating), and rated behavioral expression of agitation,
      irritability, and anxiety and mood in qualifying adults with a diagnosis of cognitively
      unimpaired, or probable Alzheimer's Disease, Frontotemporal Dementia or Dementia with Lewy
      Bodies. Study subjects will all receive one real acupuncture treatment; mood scales will be
      assessed before and after.

      Massachusetts General Hospital is paying for this research to be done.

      Acupuncture is a system of integrative medicine that involves pricking the skin or tissues
      with needles, used to alleviate pain and to treat various physical, mental, and emotional
      conditions. Originating in ancient China, acupuncture is now widely practiced globally.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Ages 55-95 inclusive, male or female.

          -  Diagnosis of CU, or probable AD, FTD or DLB as determined by established clinical
             criteria at screening14.

          -  For the AIA symptomatic groups, a score of &gt; 2 for Severity on at least 1 of the
             AIA-relevant items on the NPI-Q, i.e., Anxiety, Irritability/Lability, Agitation or
             Aggression.

          -  For the CU and no neuropsychiatric symptoms group, NPI-Q score must be 0 for
             AIA-relevant items, i.e., Anxiety, Irritability/Lability, Agitation or Aggression.

          -  No concurrent use of therapies with prohibitive effects on interpretation of HRV and
             SC measurements, e.g., those with major direct adrenergic or anticholinergic
             activities.

          -  Stable doses (&gt;2 weeks) of concurrent dementia or psychiatric drugs for those
             applicable.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Atrial or junctional arrhythmias or other cardiac conditions, including pacemakers or
             other implantable devices that affect RR intervals or their measurement.

          -  AIA symptoms or dementia so severe that subject cannot assent and cooperate with all
             study procedures or requires immediate rescue medication for behavioral control.

          -  Seizure disorders or other potentially confounding medical, neurological or
             longstanding psychiatric illnesses.
