  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers have found a link between chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and heart
      disease; however, a link is all they have found. Cardiovascular health in COPD is controlled
      by different mechanisms including vascular health and systemic inflammation. The
      investigators have collected preliminary data to support that concentrations of Sirtuin 1
      (Sirt1), a protein that plays a key role in cardioprotection, may be involved in
      cardiovascular health in patients with COPD. Resveratrol, an over the counter natural
      polyphenol found in a variety of food, is a direct activator of Sirt1 and has been used to
      improve cardiovascular health in different cohorts. The current project is an attempt to
      expand previous findings and explore the effects of the sub-chronic use of resveratrol in
      sustaining the improvements in cardiovascular health in COPD.

      The present study is designed as a double-blind, randomized, cross-over, placebo-controlled
      protocol. Patients with COPD will receive either resveratrol (500 mg) or placebo for 12
      weeks. A comprehensive evaluation of cardiovascular health will be performed. Results will
      provide novel insights into the mechanistic role that Sirt1 mediates in COPD related vascular
      dysfunction and systemic inflammation.
