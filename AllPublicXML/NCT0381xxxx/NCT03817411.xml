  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the trial is to compare the combination regimen of Telatinib and Capecitabine
      and Oxaliplatin vs. Capecitabine and Oxaplatin to explore superiority of the Telatinib
      combination in terms of progression-free survival (PFS) in patients previously untreated for
      advanced HER2 negative advanced gastric or Gastroesophageal Junction adenocarcinoma.

      This trial is a Phase 2, prospective, double-blind, randomized, comparative, multicenter
      trial in patients with advanced HER2 negative adenocarcinoma of the stomach or
      Gastroesophageal Junction which has progressed after resection and adjuvant or neoadjuvant
      therapy, or is unresectable or metastatic at time of first diagnosis. a total of
      approximately 90 patients will be enrolled and randomized into Telatinib combined with
      Capecitabine and Oxaliplatin or chemotherapy combined with placebo. All patients will be
      treated until progressive disease (radiologically documented or symptomatic deterioration) or
      the occurrence of unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent or investigator's judgment.
