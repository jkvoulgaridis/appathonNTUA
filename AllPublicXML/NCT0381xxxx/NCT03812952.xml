  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is the first multi-center cross-sectional study on the diagnosis and misdiagnosis
      of allergic conjunctivitis in the ophthalmology clinic in China. It provides a clinical basis
      for the standardized diagnosis and treatment of allergic eye diseases.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Allergic conjunctivitis is a common disease in ophthalmology. The European Allergy
      Association, Japan, the United States and other countries have clear diagnostic criteria or
      guidelines for the definition and diagnosis of allergic diseases and allergic conjunctivitis.
      However, China is currently lacking related guidelines. Allergic conjunctivitis has some of
      the same symptoms and signs as other infections/non-infectious conjunctival inflammation.
      When the symptoms and signs are atypical, it is prone to missed diagnosis and misdiagnosis,
      resulting in prolonged disease duration, drug abuse and waste of medical resources.

      The current abuse of antibiotics is considered to be a huge problem in the treatment of
      ocular surface diseases. A study in our country believes that the rate of misdiagnosis of dry
      eye is as high as 66.2%, and most of them are misdiagnosed as chronic conjunctivitis,
      resulting in frequent using a variety of antibiotic eye drops. At present, the misdiagnosis
      of allergic conjunctivitis and the abuse of antibiotics caused by misdiagnosis in China are
      still unclear, therefore clinical research is urgently needed. We intend to use this study to
      understand the status of diagnosis and treatment of allergic conjunctivitis in China, and
      provide clinical evidence for the standard diagnosis and treatment of allergic eye diseases.
