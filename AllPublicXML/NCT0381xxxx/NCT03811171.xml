  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open-label, multi-center, single-arm (non-randomized) study to assess
      the safety and effectiveness of breaking stones in the upper urinary tract using the
      SonoMotion Break Wave technology. Up to 30 subjects will be included. The procedure will be
      performed in a hospital surgical environment as an outpatient (without being admitted) or in
      a non-surgical environment such as a clinic or office procedure room. The procedure will be
      performed under varying levels of anesthesia ranging from no anesthesia to general anesthesia
      (fully asleep). Stones will be limited to ≤ 10 mm for lower pole stones and ≤ 20 mm
      everywhere else.

      Safety will be measured by the self-reported occurrences of adverse events, unplanned
      emergency department or clinic visits, and the need for further intervention. Fragmentation
      will be measured by self-reported stone passage and a comparison of computed tomography (CT)
      images before and after the procedure.

    <description>The Break Wave device will be used to exert a low amplitude burst of ultrasound waves focused at the kidney stone. The primary components of the device include an 85 mm aperture diameter therapy probe driven by a high voltage generator. The therapy probe has a cavity in the middle to accommodate coaxial alignment of an ultrasound imaging probe for treatment guidance.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Individuals presenting with at least one kidney stone apparent on CT.

          -  Stones must be within the upper urinary tract.

          -  Stones are indicated for SWL treatment per the American Urology Association (AUA) 2016
             guidelines.8

          -  Stones must be measured under CT to be within the AUA 2016 SWL guidelines (i.e. ≤ 10
             mm for lower pole stones and ≤ 20 mm for non-lower pole stones).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Acute untreated urinary tract infection or urosepsis.

          -  Uncorrected bleeding disorders or coagulopathies.

          -  Pregnancy.

          -  Uncorrected obstruction distal to the stone.

          -  Patients receiving anticoagulants and who are unable or not willing to cease the
             medication for the Break Wave procedure.

          -  Stones that are not echogenically visible or cannot be positioned within the Break
             Wave therapy focus.

          -  Individuals belonging to a vulnerable group (pregnant, mentally disabled, prisoner,
             etc.).

          -  Patients unwilling to comply with the follow-up protocol, including post-procedure CT.

          -  Individuals under 18 years of age.

          -  Anatomic presentations preventing adequate positioning or delivery of the Break Wave
             pulse.

          -  Calcified abdominal aortic aneurysms or calcified renal artery aneurysms.

          -  Solitary kidney

          -  Comorbidity risks which, in at the discretion of the physician, would make the patient
             a poor candidate for the Break Wave procedure, such as anatomical anomalies that may
             not be conducive to adequate stone fragment passage.
