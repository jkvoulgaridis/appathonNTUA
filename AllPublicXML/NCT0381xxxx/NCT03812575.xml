  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate of the relationships between fractionated exhaled
      nitric oxide, disease activity, and symptom severity in patients with eosinophilic
      esophagitis compared to those without eosinophilic esophagitis.

    <description>The FeNO measurement will be performed using a hand-held analyzer, the NIOX MINO (Aerocrine, Sweden). During this non-invasive procedure the patient is asked to perform a 4-6 second single-breath exhalation into the NIOX MINO, which measures FeNO in 100s with an electrochemical sensor.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pediatric patient who will undergo esophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsies at
             Children's Memorial Hermann Hospital, as part of the standard of care in the
             evaluation of EoE

          -  Able to perform the single-breath exhalation for the hand-held analyzer, &quot;NIOX VEROÂ®&quot;
             (Aerocrine, Sweden)

          -  Signed informed consent by a parent or legal guardian

          -  Signed assent form by the child/adolescent subjects 7-18 years of age

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Past medical history of asthma, allergic rhinitis, IBD, parasitic infection, hay fever
             and any exposure to smoking (including secondhand smoke) because these disorders are
             known to affect the FeNO levels

          -  Active respiratory tract infections at the time of FeNO evaluation because this can
             affect the result of the FeNO as well

          -  Asthma questionnaire and/or Spirometry test consistent with asthma
