    <textblock>
      This study aims at evaluating the correlation between foot perfusion on angiographies
      performed before and after revascularization and limb salvage in patients with critical limb
      ischemia.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Critical limb ischemia (CLI) in diabetic patients is increasing drastically worldwide, and is
      already recognized as a major health issue. CLI is frequently leading to major amputations.
      Therefore, one of the key point to prevent limb loss is to restore a good vascularization to
      the foot, usually thanks to endovascular means.

      No consensual indicator is currently available to estimate if the limb revascularization will
      be sufficient or not to prevent amputation, and to help physicians decide if they should be
      more aggressive during the endovascular procedure. Transcutaneous oximetry and value of the
      ankle-brachial index (ABI) are commonly used in the ward (not available in the operating
      room), but have shown poor correlation to wound healing or limb salvage and results are
      frequently biased because of the arterial wall calcifications due to diabetes. Value of the
      first toe systolic pressure is currently under evaluation to predict survival without
      amputation, with promising results, but cannot be applied to patients with wounds at this
      level or previous minor amputation.

      The emergence of hybrid rooms in the operating theater offer access to high quality imaging
      and image post-treatment. Those capabilities could be used to analyze the flow and the tissue
      perfusion in the foot, and correlate those imaging parameters to positive clinical outcomes,
      such as wound healing, thus creating a useful tool to guide physicians in daily practice.

      Differences between foot angiographies performed before and after revascularization could be
      used to estimate the quality of the revascularization and predict wound healing and limb
      salvage. This method would be directly available in the operating room and could help
      physicians to optimize their strategy during the procedure
