  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the hemodynamic changes during dry cupping therapy (DCT) on
      low back pain. 50 patients with low back pain as experimental group and 50 healthy people as
      control group are treated by DCT. They will receive four consecutive WCT application in one
      month. Optical sensors were used to monitor the hemodynamic changes including oxyhemoglobin
      ([HbO2]), deoxy-hemoglobin ([Hb]) and the derived change in blood volume ([tHb]) in/surround
      the cupping sites during treatment. The investigators hope to interpret the curative effect
      of DCT from the perspective of modern hemodynamics.
