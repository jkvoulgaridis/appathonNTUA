    <textblock>
      The benefit of induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced head
      and neck squamous cell carcinoma is unknown. The present study is investigating if this
      therapeutic strategy improve overall survival.

    <description>The QLQ-C30 is composed of both multi-item scales and single-item measures. These include five functional scales, three symptom scales, a global health status / QoL scale, and six single items. Each of the multi-item scales includes a different set of items - no item occurs in more than one scale. All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level. Thus a high score for a functional scale represents a high / healthy level of functioning, a high score for the global health status / QoL represents a high QoL, but a high score for a symptom scale / item represents a high level of symptomatology / problems.</description>
