  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study does not target any disease or condition in itself, but is evaluating the safety,
      tolerability and pharmacokinetics of single oral doses of GT-002 in the setting of healthy
      volunteers.

      A longer-term objective is to apply the findings from this study to design and later conduct
      a clinical development programme of GT-002 as a medication to treat schizophrenia.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is willing and able to give written informed consent for participation in the
             study. Sufficient command of the Finnish language will be needed for informed consent
             and adequate communication with the study personnel.

          2. Healthy male subjects from 18 up to 45 years of age.

          3. Body mass index (BMI) from 18 kg/m2 up to 28 kg/m2.

          4. Body weight from 60 kg up to 120 kg.

          5. Clinically normal medical history, physical findings, vital signs, ECG and laboratory
             values as judged by the investigator at the time of the screening visit. A subject
             with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters outside of the reference range
             for the population being studied may be included at the investigator´s discretion
             provided the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors, jeopardize
             study integrity, or to interfere with the study assessments or procedures.

          6. Subjects must be willing to use condom or other contraceptive methods with a failure
             rate of &lt; 1% and refrain from donating sperm from the date of dosing until one month
             after last dosing.

             -

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Current or history of any clinically significant disease or disorder which, in the
             opinion of the investigator, may either put the subject at risk because of
             participation in the study, or influence the results or the subject's ability to
             participate in the study

          2. History of any type of cancer.

          3. Subjects considered unlikely to comply with study procedures, restrictions and
             requirements

          4. Any clinically significant illness, medical/surgical procedure or trauma within 4
             weeks of the administration of investigational product that is likely to introduce
             additional risk factors, jeopardize study integrity, or to interfere with the study
             assessments or procedures

          5. Any clinically significant abnormalities in clinical chemistry, haematology,
             coagulation or urinalysis results at the time of screening visit as judged by the
             investigator

          6. Any positive result on screening for serum hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C
             antibody or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)

               2. Diastolic blood pressure &gt; 90 mm Hg (average of two measurements)

               3. Heart rate &lt; 40 or &gt; 85 beats per minute (average of two measurements)

               4. Body temperature (auricular) ≥38oC

          8. Prolonged QTcF interval (&gt;450 ms), clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia or any

             investigator

          9. Intake of any medication, vitamin or mineral supplement product that could affect the
             outcome of the study, within 2 weeks prior to the first study treatment administration
             or less than 5 times the half-life of the medication. Possible prior use of enzyme
             inducing drugs will be considered case-by-case by the investigator.

         11. Has received another new chemical entity (defined as a compound which has not been
             approved for marketing) or has participated in any other clinical trial that included

         12. Current or history of alcohol or drug abuse within the last 5 years, current excessive
             use of alcohol (current regular alcohol drinking of more than 24 units/week) or use of
             illicit drugs.

         13. Positive screen for drugs of abuse at screening or on admission to the unit or
             positive breath test result for alcohol at screening or on admission to the unit prior
             to the administration of investigational product.

         15. Current smokers or users of nicotine products. Irregular use of nicotine (e.g.
             smoking, snuffing, and chewing tobacco) up to five doses per week is allowed before
             screening visit.

         16. Intake of &gt;5 cups of coffee/day or the corresponding amount of other caffeine
             containing beverages (e.g. energy drinks containing caffeine) during the study.
