    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of inactivated subunit
      H5N1 influenza vaccine in individuals who have previously received live attenuated H2N2,
      H6N1, or H9N2 influenza vaccine, as well as in individuals who have never previously received
      H5N1 or other pandemic live attenuated influenza vaccines.

      This study will evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of inactivated subunit H5N1 influenza
      vaccine in individuals who have previously received live attenuated H2N2, H6N1, or H9N2
      influenza vaccine, as well as in individuals who have never previously received H5N1 or other
      pandemic live attenuated influenza vaccines (pLAIVs).

      Participants will be enrolled in two cohorts. Cohort 1 will include participants who received
      two doses of live attenuated H2N2, H6N1, or H9N2 influenza vaccine during a prior Center for
      Immunization Research (CIR) study; Cohort 2 will include participants who have never
      previously received a pLAIV. Participants in both cohorts will receive one dose of H5N1 pISV
      vaccine by injection at Day 0.

      Participants will attend study visits on Days 0, 7, 14, 28, 56, 90, and 360. Study visits may
      include a physical examination, medical history, and blood and urine collection. All
      participants will be followed for approximately 360 days after receiving the H5N1 pISV
      vaccine.
