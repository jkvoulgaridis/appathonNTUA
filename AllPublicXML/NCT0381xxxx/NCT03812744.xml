  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to characterize the changes in the brain and body associated with
      whole coffee cherry extract (WCCE). WCCE is a patented extract of whole coffee fruit (coffee
      berries) from coffea arabica. Whole coffee cherries are a source of naturally occurring
      nutrients. There are no known side effects or allergens associated with WCCE other than that
      which would be associated with a consuming typical cup of coffee.

      Previous studies suggest that increases in serum concentrations of both serum total and
      exosomal brain-derived neurotrophic factors (BDNF) may represent one of the mechanisms
      responsible for improved cognitive function after acute WCCE administration. Mild cognitive
      impairment (MCI) is an intermediate stage between the expected cognitive decline of normal
      aging and the more serious decline of dementia. It can involve problems with memory,
      language, thinking and judgment that are greater than normal age-related changes.
      Furthermore, MCI is associated with reduced circulating BDNF. Due to earlier studies
      reporting the ability of WCCE to stimulate increases in circulating and exosomal BDNF, it has
      been postulated that WCCE may also acutely improve cognitive function (as measured using
      behavioral tasks and fMRI). The purpose of this study is to extend and elucidate the findings
      of previous investigations by examining the acute neurophysiological effects of WCCE using
      blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetic
      resonance spectroscopy (MRS) employing a double-blind, randomized crossover design to
      investigate the acute effects of a single dose of WCCE or placebo (silica oxide) on neuronal
      activity in older participants.

    <description>Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) measurements pre/post ingestion. The following are measured: glutamate, glutamine, gamma-aminobutyric acid, N-acetylaspartate, choline, creatine, glutathione, myo-inositol, aspartate, taurine, and lactate. LCModel software performed automatic quantification of in vivo proton MR spectra by analyzing spectra as a linear combination of model spectra from sequence-specific simulations. Water-suppressed spectra were eddy current corrected and quantified using the unsuppressed water signal. Cramer-Rao lower bounds were used as a measure of fit with CRLB &gt; 50% rejected from further analysis. Metabolite concentrations were CSF-corrected, and quantified (in ppm).</description>
