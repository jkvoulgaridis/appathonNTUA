  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is the assessment of the effectiveness of medical nutrition therapy
      (MNT) among obese patients, including a well-balanced low-calories diet, an individual
      dietary counseling conducted by dietitians and supported by telemedicine (T) or hypnotic
      suggestions (HS).

      The study will cover a group of 90 adult patients, both sexes, with obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m^2)
      undergoing MNT a dietetic treatment. Three arms are planned in the study scheme, according to
      the scheme: Group 1 - individual MNT (30 people); Group 2 -individual MNT and T (30 people);
      Group 3 - individual MNT and HS (30 people).

      The authors hope that the results of the study will allow to develop a new model of the most
      effective management of obesity, resulting in weight reduction and maintaining this effect
      over time. The results obtained during the study will also allow to assess the impact of the
      therapy applied on lifestyle changes, dietary habits and the knowledge about the disease
      among obese patients.

      This is a prospective randomized control trial among obese subjects. The scope of the study
      includes: identification of nutritional habits leading to obesity; assessment of patient's
      motivation to introduce life style changes; assessment of anthropometric parameters, body
      composition, arterial stiffness and resting metabolic rate at baseline and at specific
      control points; development of individual medical nutrition therapy (MNT) and weight
      reduction plan depending on the initial body weight of the subjects; quantitative and
      qualitative assessment of the diet at baseline and in each month for a period of 6 months
      (Part A) and 9, 12 months (Part B); assessment of nutritional knowledge at baseline and at
      specific control points; education of patients using the behavioral-cognitive method,
      conducted for 6 months; introduction of hypnotic suggestion (HS) or telemedicine (T) to
      support the achievement and the maintenance of the lifestyle changes.

      The study covers a group of 90 adults, both sexes, with obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m^2), undergoing
      individual MNT, randomly assigned to one of three groups for 6 months (Part A): Group 1 -
      individual MNT (30 people); Group 2 - individual MNT and T (30 people); Group 3 - individual
      MNT and HS (30 people). All subjects will continue the program for additional 6 months (Part
      B follow up).

      The selection of subjects for the study is purposeful and the participation in the study is
      voluntary. All subjects are educated to follow a reduced calorie Dietary Approaches to Stop
      Hypertension diet (&quot;DASH&quot;) for 6 months (Part A). Education materials (handouts and sample
      meal plans) are provided to the subjects.

      The primary and secondary outcomes will be evaluated at baseline, months 1,2,3,4,5, 6 (Part
      A) and months 9, 12 (Part B follow up).
