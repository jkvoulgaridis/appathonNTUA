  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Concordance between walking tests and pedometer data may seem like a logical outcome for
      pulmonary hypertension (PH) patients. However, many individuals have discordant results:
      results much worse or better during an in-hospital walking test as compared to real life
      activity.

      The primary objective of this study is: to determine variables associated with discordance
      between the distance walked during an in-hospital 6-minute walking test (6MWT) and the
      average distance travelled per day (observed over a period of 28 days (2 Ã— 14 days) using a
      pedometer) among PH patients.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Secondarily, the discordance between 6MWT results versus total pedometer recorded distance
      and versus maximum daily pedometer-recorded distance will be similarly studied. The aim of
      the study is also to search for variables associated with progression free survival. The
      relationships between pedometer data and self-reported dyspnea variation will be studied.
      Factorial analysis may be used to study the overall view of variable correlations and patient
      similarity/dissimilarity.

    <description>Linear regression is performed for the distance walked during an initial 6 minute walking test (6MWT) and the average distance walked per day according to the pedometer intervention. The residuals from this regression will determine categories:
Category 1 (pedometer high): the 25% of subjects not in category 2 and with higher values for pedometer data
Category 2 (concordance): the 50% of included subjects with the smallest residuals in terms of absolute value.
Category 3 (6MWT high): the 25% of subjects not in category 2 and with higher values for 6MWT data</description>
