  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label, two-arm, phase III trial in Germany to investigate whether
      vinorelbine-based triple combination presents a less toxic treatment option than
      docetaxel-based triple combination in patients with HER2-positive advanced breast cancer who
      have not previously received any systemic treatment in the metastatic setting.

      The primary objective of the study is to compare patient-reported quality of life in the two
      treatment arms. Patients will be followed-up for survival until death or end of study after
      at least 79 deaths occured in each arm, whatever comes first.

    <description>Area under the curve (AUC) in the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Breast (FACT-B) questionnaire subscale Trial Outcome Index-Physical/Functional/Breast (TOI-PFB) after 18 weeks (irrespective of disease or treatment situation at that time point). Higher AUC indicates better quality of life.
To calculate the TOI-PFB the three subscales Physical well-being (PWB - 7 statements), Functional well-being (FWB - 7 statements) and breast cancer subscale (BCS - 10 statements) are summed up. In all subscales each statement will be rated by the patient from 0 (not at all) - 4 (very much). Therefore ranges of subscales are: PWB 0 - 28; FWB 0 - 28; BCS 0 - 40; TOI-PFB 0 - 96; higher values indicate better quality of life.</description>
