  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The major morbidities of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant with non-human
      leukocyte antigen (HLA) matched siblings are graft vs host disease (GVHD) and life
      threatening infections. T depletion of the donor hematopoietic stem cell graft is effective
      in preventing GVHD, but immune reconstitution is slow, increasing the risk of infections. An
      addback of donor CD45RA (naive T cells) depleted cells may improve immune reconstitution and
      help decrease the risk of infections.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The risk of severe graft versus host disease (GVHD) is increased with the use of unrelated
      and partially matched related donors. T cell depletion reduces the risk of severe GVHD, but
      immune reconstitution is delayed. Important memory T cells that may protect patients from
      fungal and viral infections are also removed in the T depletion process. CD45RA depletion has
      been studied both as a single step to reduce the risk of GVHD, and also, in conjunction with
      αβTCR depleted hematopoietic stem cell grafts to accelerate immune reconstitution. This is a
      single institutional pilot trial of this T cell depletion technique. Patients with acute
      leukemias at high risk for relapse are eligible to participate. Patients will be given CD45RA
      depleted donor peripheral stem cells (PSCs) following T depleted hematopoietic stem cell
      transplant (HSCT) if there is no GVHD present at Day 21. A short course of GVHD prophylaxis
      will be used after CD45RA depletion.
