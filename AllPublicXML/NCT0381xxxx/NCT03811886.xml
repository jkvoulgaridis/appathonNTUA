    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Natalizumab in
      children, adolescent and young adult patients with pulmonary metastatic osteosarcoma (pOS)
      and to assess clinical response associated with this treatment as well as overall survival.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single-arm, open-label, proof of concept clinical trial in children,
      adolescent and young adult patients with unresectable pOS that have progressed, relapsed or
      are refractory to standard systemic therapy.

      All participants will receive the study therapy and there will be dose escalation in a
      traditional 3 + 3 design during the Phase I study of this trial.

      In the Phase II study of the trial, treatment will continue if the subject has Complete
      Response (CR), Partial Response (PR) or Stable Disease (SD) of pOS after every 3 cycles after
      the first 6 cycles but not beyond 24 cycles, unless it is judged to be in his/her best
      interest.

      Approximately 3-9 subjects will be enrolled in the phase I part and 10-12 in the phase II
      part of this trial. Participants will be followed for toxicity for 30 days after treatment
      has been discontinued or until one of the protocol-defined reasons

      This study seeks to evaluate if Natalizumab can be used safely and effectively as
      immunotherapy in children, adolescent and young adult patients with pOS. Natalizumab is
      currently Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for the treatment of T-cell mediated
      autoimmune disorders The study team will evaluate the safety and tolerability of Natalizumab
      as well as the clinical response associated with Natalizumab treatment and evaluate overall
      survival.

    <description>Natalizumab is an FDA approved monotherapy for treatment of relapsing forms of MS. It is also indicated for inducing and maintaining clinical response and remission in adult patients with moderately to severely active CD who have had an inadequate response to, or intolerance of, conventional therapies and TNF-α inhibitors.
Traditional 3+3 escalation of Natalizumab at a weight-based dosing 2mg/kg not to exceed 300mg. If no subjects experience a dose limiting toxicity (DLT), 3 more subjects are enrolled at the next dose of 3mg/kg, not to exceed 300mg. If no subjects experience a DLT, 3 more subjects will be enrolled at the next and final dose of 4mg/kg, not to exceed 300mg.
Phase II will continue if the subject has Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR) or Stable Disease (SD) of pOS, defined by RECIST 1.1 criteria after every 3 cycles after the first 6 cycles but not beyond 24 cycles. If subject has progressive disease after cycle 6, they will be removed from the study.</description>

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The presence of any of the following will exclude a subject from study enrollment.

          -  Ongoing prior treatment toxicities &gt; Grade 1 according to NCI CTCAE Version 5.0 with
             the exception of alopecia, anorexia, bone pain and tumor pain.

          -  Subjects receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to Natalizumab.

          -  Subjects currently on immunosuppressive therapy.

          -  Subjects with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing
             or active infection, liver failure, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable

             would limit compliance with study requirements.

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding women are excluded from this study because Natalizumab
             crosses the placenta and can increase the risk of spontaneous abortion. There is an
             unknown, but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with Natalizumab, therefore breastfeeding should be
             discontinued if the mother is treated with Natalizumab.

             pregnancy test result has been obtained.

          -  Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception prior
             to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become
             pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should
             inform her treating physician immediately.

          -  HIV-positive subjects and HIV-positive subjects on antiretroviral therapy are
             ineligible because of the risk for developing a lethal infection when treated with
             immunosuppressive therapy.
