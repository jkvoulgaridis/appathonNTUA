    <description>440/5000 Laughter yoga; It is an exercise program that combines breathing techniques with unconditional laughter. During the sessions, laughter is simulated by hand clapping and warm-up exercises and by eye contact with other members in the group and by playing childish games with group members. Most of the time this simulation turns into genuine and contagious laughter. Laughter yoga is based on the argument that the brain cannot distinguish between real and unreal laugh.</description>
