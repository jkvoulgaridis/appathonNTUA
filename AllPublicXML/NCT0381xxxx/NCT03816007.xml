  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PTSD is prevalent among Veterans and is associated with physical and functional impairments
      in addition to PTSD symptoms. Veterans with PTSD experience more chronic pain and
      pain-related functional limitations than Veterans without PTSD. Mind-body interventions such
      as yoga and meditation are non-pharmacological options for treating both chronic pain and
      PTSD. This pilot study will add an existing mantram repetition (MR) component designed for
      Veterans with PTSD to an active yoga intervention known to improve function in chronic back
      pain patients. The study will examine the acceptability of the interventions, adverse events,
      and the feasibility of recruitment, attendance, retention, treatment fidelity, and
      assessments by recruiting and randomizing 32 VA patients with PTSD to either yoga plus MR or
      to a relaxation/health education control. Health outcomes including pain-related function,
      pain, and PTSD symptoms will be measured. If feasible, the data will be used to plan a
      full-scale trial of enhanced yoga for pain in VA patients with PTSD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of the proposed project are to examine the feasibility of delivering a
      combined yoga and MR intervention to VA patients with PTSD and cLBP and/or cNP within a
      randomized controlled trial study design. MR enhances the active yoga intervention for this
      specific population by providing a portable tool for managing stress and anxiety, and
      improving mental and emotional functioning in situations of daily life. The investigators
      will recruit and randomize 32 Veterans with PTSD to either enhanced yoga interventions or a
      relaxation/health education (R/HE) comparison intervention. The goal of the pilot randomized
      trial is to demonstrate the acceptability of the interventions, to study the feasibility of
      recruitment, retention, adherence, randomization, and assessments with military Veterans with
      PTSD, and to measure any adverse events. Data will inform plans for a full-scale
      effectiveness RCT.

      Researchers and content experts will adapt and blend two manualized interventions (MR and
      yoga) into a single manualized and acceptable intervention. In addition, the existing yoga
      intervention and MR manuals will be adapted to provide a structured intervention guide for
      instructors. Next, the investigators will recruit and screen 32 Veterans with PTSD. Eligible
      participants will be randomized to either the enhanced yoga interventions or the (R/HE)
      comparison intervention. Assessments will occur at baseline, 12-weeks, and again 6-weeks
      after the intervention ends (18-weeks). The enhanced yoga intervention will consist of 1x
      weekly instructor-led yoga sessions lasting approximately 75 minutes, augmented by home
      practice of yoga for 20 minutes/day. The R/HE control intervention will be manualized and
      will meet weekly for 12 weeks for approximately 75 minutes per week. Short homework
      assignments will be included. The investigators will track and measure adverse events,
      recruitment rates, attendance and home practice rates, use of MR and yoga principles in daily
      life, attrition rates, and time to complete assessments. Questionnaires will assess
      pain-related function, pain, PTSD symptoms, insomnia/sleep, alcohol use, and quality of life.
      The investigators will also conduct qualitative interviews with 12 study participants to
      examine acceptability, recommendations, and factors affecting attendance and attrition. The
      investigators will target 7-8 yoga participants and 4-5 control participants. Data will be
      used to plan a full-scale RCT powered to detect differences in health outcomes.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change between baseline and 12-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The RMDQ has 23 questions asking about limitations experienced with daily activities. The scale is reliable and well validated. It has been used in other yoga studies. Scores can range from 0-24. Higher scores indicate more impairment, and when considering the change from baseline to follow-up assessments, negative scores indicate improvement. The scale has been shown to be reliable and is well validated. It has been used in another yoga RCT, allowing for comparisons.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Brief Pain Inventory (BPI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change between baseline and 12-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The short version of the Brief Pain Inventory is a self-rated questionnaire designed to assess the severity of pain and the impact of pain on daily functions in the past day and week. The BPI takes about 5 minutes to complete and has been validated with low back pain patients. It has been shown to respond to both behavioral and pharmacological pain interventions. The BPI measures severity of pain, impact of pain on daily function, location of pain, pain medications, and amount of pain relief. Items are answered utilizing a scoring algorithm, with the mean of the 4 severity items used as measures of pain severity. Scores range from 0-10, with higher scores indicating more pain, and when considering the change from baseline to follow-up assessments, negative scores indicate improvement.</description>

    <measure>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist- version 5 (PCL-5)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change between baseline and 12-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PCL-5 is a 20-item self-report measure assessing 20 DSM-5 symptoms of PTSD. Each question is rated on a scale from 0-4 and the total score ranges from 0-80 with higher scores indicating a greater severity of PTSD symptoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change between baseline and 12-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Insomnia Severity Index is a 7-item instrument that assesses the impact of insomnia. Each question is rated on a scale from 0-4 and the total score ranges from 0-28 with higher scores indicating a greater severity of insomnia.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Short-Form 36 (SF-36)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change between baseline and 12-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Health-related Quality of Life will be measured with the SF-36, a descriptive measure providing eight domains of HRQOL. SF-36 norms, reliability and validity are well established. The measure has 8 subscales and 2 summary scales. Each scale score is standardized and thus range from 0-100, with higher scores indicating better health-related quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>AUDIT-C</measure>
    <time_frame>Change between baseline and 12-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>AUDIT-C is a 3-item screen for problem drinking and will refer to alcohol use over the past 3-month period. The measure has questions on typical consumption and binge drinking frequency. Each question is rated on a scale from 0-4 and the total score ranges from 0-12 with higher scores indicating a greater likelihood of alcohol use problems.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Non-VA Medications/Treatments</measure>
    <time_frame>12-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will assess medications and self-care treatments used outside of VA via a questionnaire.
