  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to offer open label ITI-007 treatment to patients who poorly
      respond or poorly tolerate approved medications.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be started on ITI-007 and current medication will be slowly discontinued within
      the first 7 days of starting ITI-007, with some flexibility allowed if clinically indicated.
      No patients will be left unmedicated because of this study.

      Patients will be seen weekly for the first 4 weeks, biweekly for the second month and then
      monthly for six months. Patients will be monitored by clinical and safety rating scales, and
      will be required to show improvement after 3 months to remain in this study. Patients not
      improving at this time will be assessed for the risks/benefits of continuing.

    <description>schizophrenia symptoms will be measures using the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) Total PANSS score (range: 30-210). Individual items scored from 1(absent) to 7 (extremely severe). Total PANSS score is sum of the 30 individual items with lowest score (30) indicating all symptoms absent and the maximum score (210) indicating all symptoms rated as extremely severe.</description>
