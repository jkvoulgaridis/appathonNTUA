      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of treating patients with intermediate
      risk smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) with combinational therapy with dexamethasone and
      lenalidomide (Rd) and patients with high risk SMM with combinational therapy with Rd and
      carfilzomib.

      This is an open label, single center, phase II study assessing the efficacy of treating
      patients with intermediate-risk smoldering myeloma (SMM) with combinational therapy with
      dexamethasone and lenalidomide and treating patients with high risk SMM and active multiple
      myeloma (MM) with combinational therapy with dexamethasone, lenalidomide and carfilzomib.
      Patients that are eligible for this study are participants in the IstopMM study
      (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03327597) that are diagnosed with intermediate or high-risk
      SMM or active MM.

          6. Peripheral neuropathy &gt; Grade 3 on clinical examination or grade 2 with pain within 30
             days prior to C1D1.

         10. Known hepatitis B surface antigen-positive status, or known or suspected active
             hepatitis C infection.
