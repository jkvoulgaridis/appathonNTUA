      After a screening, which consists of pathology confirmation, physical examination, magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI), body computed tomography (CT) scan, blood tests, and case analysis
      on Multidisciplinary Team (MDT) meeting, patient will be irradiated 5x5 Gy and after
      radiotherapy and then referred for surgery 6-8 weeks after the radiotherapy completion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Myxoid liposarcoma has been reported to be more radiosensitive compared with other soft
      tissue sarcomas (STS). Response to preoperative treatment involves in decrease in tumor size,
      a large percentage in tumor necrosis (which according to some reports has a beneficial effect
      on the reduction of local recurrence rates) and also among other in a change in vasculature
      of the tissue.

      Hypofractionation represents a variation of radiotherapy fractionation in which the total
      dose is divided into fewer fractions with an increased fraction dose. Such treatment may lead
      to additional biological effects when compared to conventionally fractionated radiotherapy
      (eg. vascular damage, increased immunogenicity, and antigenicity). The main advantages of
      hypofractionation are those related to the decreased overall treatment time what is more
      convenient for both patients and physicians, increased compliance and makes the treatment
      more cost-effective. Intriguing, such an approach may provide an additional benefit when
      treating non-radiosensitive tumors with a low alpha/beta ratio (eg. sarcomas).

      The use of preoperative hypofractionated radiotherapy 5x5 Gy for five consecutive days, and
      then immediate surgery in patients with locally advanced soft tissue sarcomas showed in a
      published study a good local control rate, with a favorable amount of late toxicities. In
      this patient population, there were 22 patients with primary myxoid liposarcoma and the local
      control rate in this group was 86%.

      In the proposed study we plan to increase the gap between the end of radiotherapy and surgery
      to commonly applied five weeks to better assess the changes occurring in the tumor after
      treatment and to evaluate the impact of longer treatment interval on reducing the proportion
      of early complications of treatment.
