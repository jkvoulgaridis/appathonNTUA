  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a prospective observational study, the investigators investigate the prevalence of sleep
      disordered breathing in patients with severe valvular regurgitation and the effect of using
      the minimal invasive Clip technique on sleep disordered breathing.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to analyze the prevalance of sleep disordered breathing in
      patients with severe valvular regurgitation and the impact of a therapy with the
      minimal-invasive Clip technique.

      Therefore, the investigators want to include consecutive patients with unknown
      sleep-associated respiratory distress syndrome and, in addition, as a study-specific
      achievement, the investigators want to obtain the quality of life and specific symptoms of
      the patients by using established questionnaires. After three month of post-interventional
      care, the patients will get a post-interventional check-up in our cardiological outpatient
      clinic, where the course of sleep-associated respiratory distress syndrome and the actual
      quality of life and specific symptoms will be documented by using a cardiorespiratory
      polygraphy and the same questionnaires.

      The entire hospital stay, including possible post-interventional complications, will be
      documented for this study from the patients' medical records. The routine examinations
      (laboratory values, ECG, 6-minute walk test, pulmonary function examinations, spiroergometry,
      transthoracic / -oesophageal echocardiography, etc.) shall also be recorded in the database
      of this study.

      The plan is to include 100 evaluable patients with complete follow-up and the associated test
      results. For this purpose, a screening of 150 patients is expected to be required.
