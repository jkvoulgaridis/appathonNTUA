      This study is focused on understanding how the investigators can improve upon breast cancer
      and health outcomes for older participants with breast cancer, a group of participants who
      often have low risk cancers, but who may do worse than younger participants with the same
      kind of cancers. Researchers want to better understand the experiences, barriers, and changes
      in physical function older participants with breast cancer have.

      Archival tissue will be collected from participant's prior surgeries and procedures. Some
      participants undergoing breast surgery during the five years of participation may have a
      sample of fresh tissue taken for research purposes in the operating room. Blood will be
      collected at registration and at serial timepoints over a period of five years.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 70 or older at the time of diagnosis (as indicated by the date of breast biopsy)

          -  No more than 67 patients (1/3) will be aged 70-74, with the remaining patients on
             study ages 75 or older

          -  Any gender is eligible

          -  Invasive, non-metastatic breast cancer at diagnosis

          -  Those with prior diagnoses of pre-invasive (DCIS) or invasive breast cancer are
             eligible as long as their current diagnosis is felt by the treating provider to
             represent a NEW non-metastatic primary invasive breast cancer (e.g. someone with a
             nodal recurrence from prior disease are not eligible but those with a new
             contralateral breast cancer 3 years after a first breast cancer would be eligible)

          -  Any breast cancer subtype is allowed

          -  Breast cancer-diagnosing biopsy within 90 days of enrollment

          -  Receiving or will receive medical oncology care (+/- surgical and radiation oncology
             treatments) at the participating center: DFCI/satellites and affiliate sites

          -  Patients must be able to understand, speak, and read English or assign a designated
             caregiver/proxy for the duration of the study who understands, speaks, and reads
             English and who is willing to assist with filling out the survey components which do
             not have a validated, translated version. This is because the surveys are not readily
             available in multiple languages as a whole, although some components (such as the
             Geriatric Assessment and PROs are readily available in multiple languages).

          -  If a patient scores 11 or higher on the baseline Orientation-Memory-Concentration Test
             done at baseline (Appendix E), a proxy/designee must then be assigned to help the
             patient fill out the questionnaires for the duration of the study in order to
             participate. The treating provider will also be notified about the cognitive
             impairment.

          -  Ability to provide informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pathological or clinical stage 0, IV disease

          -  Those with nodal or metastatic recurrences at the time of enrollment

          -  Unable to speak and read English AND no designee who speaks and reads English, as
             above

          -  Unable to provide informed consent
