    <textblock>
      This is an ongoing prospective Phase II clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of 131I-MIBG
      for the treatment of patients with metastatic or unresectable pheochromocytoma and related
      tumors.

    <textblock>
      1. To assess the efficacy of high-dose 131I-MIBG in the treatment of patients with
           malignant pheochromocytoma and related tumors, with the basis of this initial
           examination being the percentage of patients in CR or PR, and the percentage of patients
           without PD for 3 years after the initial administration on 131I-MIBG therapy.

        2. To describe the response rate of malignant pheochromocytoma patients treated with
           high-dose 131I-MIBG.

        3. To describe the toxicity of high-dose 131I-MIBG in patients with malignant
           pheochromocytoma.

        4. To describe the overall survival and failure-free survival of malignant pheochromocytoma
           patients treated with high-dose 131I-MIBG.

        5. To determine the utility of using the serum level of Chromogranin A as a tumor marker
           for patients with malignant pheochromocytoma.

    <description>Therapeutic 131I-MIBG will be synthesized at Nuclear Diagnostic Products (NDP; Rockaway, New Jersey) with specific activities of 9-18 Ci/mmole. The therapeutic dose: 8-12 mCi/kg (maximum 1200 mCi ± 10% at investigator's discretion) will be diluted in 25 ml of normal saline, and will be infused intravenously through a patient's peripheral or central line over 120 minutes. The patient will remain in a radiation protected isolation room until radiation emissions are ≤ 2 mr/hr at a 1 meter distance or meets institutional and state guidelines. This usually takes 4-6 days. In all cases, special shielding will be equipped in the room to minimize exposure to the outside environment and personnel will observe institutional radiation safety precautions.</description>

                  concurrent with high-dose 131I-MIBG.

               -  &gt; 2 weeks since major surgery.

               -  &gt; 4 weeks since completion of prior radiation therapy, as long as measurable

               -  No treatment with an investigational agent concurrent or within 30 days of
                  high-dose 131I-MIBG.

               -  Patients who have received previous chemotherapy or radiation therapy must have
                  evidence of persistent disease on 123I-MIBG scan and elevated tumor markers or
                  measurable CT lesions before receiving high-dose 131I-MIBG.

          -  Metastases Excluding Eligibility: No patients with a known significant MIBG-avid
             parenchymal brain metastasis; leptomeningeal metastases do not exclude eligibility.
             Hepatic metastases exclude eligibility if they functionally impair liver function (AST
             or total bilirubin ≥ 2.5 times the ULN).

          -  Measurable Disease Lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension
             (longest diameter to be recorded) as &gt; 10 mm as measured with CT scanning. Lesions &lt;
             10 mm diameter or bone lesions in the presence of demonstrable uptake of 123I-MIBG on
             diagnostic scanning, plus elevated levels of tumor markers that are specific for
             malignant pheochromocytoma: plasma catecholamines or metanephrines, urine
             catecholamines or metanephrines, serum chromogranin A. Lesions whose size is
             considered non-measurable include the following:

               -  Bone lesions (see above)

               -  Leptomeningeal disease

          -  131I-MIBG or 123I-MIBG Avidity: All patients must have 123I-MIBG or 131I-MIBG
             whole-body scanning prior to therapy. Metastases must be avid for the isotope such
             that their measured gamma radiation measures ≥ twice that of background radiation.

          -  Subsequent 131I-MIBG Therapies: Patients must have had pain relief or a SD or PR after
             a prior therapy to be eligible for another therapy. Patients with PD within 9 months
             of the prior therapy are excluded from receiving subsequent therapy.
