    <textblock>
      This study will examine the efficacy of a computerized cognitive behavioral therapy (CCBT)
      program for children with anxiety disorders in community health centers. The first phase of
      the study will offer insight into the feasibility of providing this intervention in community
      health centers, while the second phase will compare CCBT to treatment as usual.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Childhood anxiety disorders are quite common and associated with significant psychosocial
      impairment and distress. Offering equivalent efficacy to pharmacotherapy without the common
      side effect profile, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a first line treatment for anxiety
      disorders in youth. However, dissemination of CBT to community settings is very limited.
      Effective treatment via traditional CBT often necessitates that the patient travel to a
      center that specializes in this treatment, and cost can prove an impediment to those of lower
      socioeconomic status, in particular. As well, differing theoretical approaches and training
      result in a minority of children with anxiety receiving evidence-based CBT. Accordingly,
      there is a great need for more widely accessible practices. As such, we are proposing a two
      phase trial that evaluates the feasibility of implementing a patient-centered intervention in
      community mental health centers, followed by an efficacy trial. In Phase I, an open trial of
      computerized CBT (CCBT) will be completed that focuses on feasibility issues of providing
      this intervention in community mental health centers. Thereafter, we will complete a
      randomized controlled trial comparing CCBT to treatment as usual (TAU) in Phase II. The open
      trial will recruit 18 youth ages 7 to 13 years, with the purpose of testing both practicality
      and management of an already developed CCBT protocol (Kendall &amp; Khanna, 2008). The outcome
      trial will recruit 110 youth, with the purpose of measuring the efficacy of the CCBT protocol
      in front-line settings. Significantly greater symptom reductions in the CCBT group as
      compared to the TAU group would provide critical evidence for the inclusion of CCBT as a
      treatment option for anxious youth without immediate access to such in-person care. While
      this study will be coordinated by the University of South Florida Rothman Center for
      Neuropsychiatry team who is located at All Children's Hospital (USF/ACH), recruitment will
      take place at three community mental health centers throughout Florida that serve families of
      lower socioeconomic status. Primary outcomes will be assessed by an independent evaluator,
      and will include change in anxiety symptom severity; response rates; and remission rates.
      CCBT will follow the Kendall and Khanna (2008) manual with appropriate integrity checks. The
      implications of this study are significant, as computerized CBT may enable widespread
      dissemination of efficacious therapy for anxiety disorders among youth.

    <description>Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale (PARS)- The PARS (RUPP, 2002) is a clinician-rated scale assessing anxiety symptoms and the associated severity and impairment in children over the past week. The scale score ranges from 0 to 30 with higher scores reflecting worse anxiety. The score, ranging from 0-30 represents a total score by summing all 6 items (which have item response options ranking from 0 to 5 each).</description>

    <description>Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for DSM-IV: Child and Parent Versions (ADIS-IV-C/P)- The ADIS-IV-C/P (Silverman &amp; Albano, 1996) is a clinician-administered, semi-structured interview that assesses for the presence and severity of DSM-IV anxiety disorders as well as Dysthymia and Major Depression, ADHD, Conduct Disorder, and Oppositional-Defiant Disorder. Excellent psychometric properties have been reported (e.g., Wood et al., 2002). The Clinical Severity Rating score is a one item metric reflecting the severity of the anxiety diagnosis. This is rated by the clinician based on their interview with the patient and parent, together with their judgment. The Rating ranges from 0 to 8 with higher scores reflecting worse anxiety.</description>

This group will follow the CCBT protocol (Camp Cope-A-lot), which is the computer-assisted intervention for anxious children being examined in this study. The first 6 levels of this program are skill building levels to be completed by the user in his/her own home. The remaining 6 levels are completed with the therapist and consist of exposure tasks and rehearsal geared toward each child.</description>

        <description>Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale (PARS)- The PARS (RUPP, 2002) is a clinician-rated scale assessing anxiety symptoms and the associated severity and impairment in children over the past week. The scale score ranges from 0 to 30 with higher scores reflecting worse anxiety. The score, ranging from 0-30 represents a total score by summing all 6 items (which have item response options ranking from 0 to 5 each).</description>

        <description>Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for DSM-IV: Child and Parent Versions (ADIS-IV-C/P)- The ADIS-IV-C/P (Silverman &amp; Albano, 1996) is a clinician-administered, semi-structured interview that assesses for the presence and severity of DSM-IV anxiety disorders as well as Dysthymia and Major Depression, ADHD, Conduct Disorder, and Oppositional-Defiant Disorder. Excellent psychometric properties have been reported (e.g., Wood et al., 2002). The Clinical Severity Rating score is a one item metric reflecting the severity of the anxiety diagnosis. This is rated by the clinician based on their interview with the patient and parent, together with their judgment. The Rating ranges from 0 to 8 with higher scores reflecting worse anxiety.</description>
