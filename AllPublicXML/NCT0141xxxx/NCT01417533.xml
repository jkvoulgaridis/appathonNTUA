    <textblock>
      Background:

      - GNE Myopathy is a disease that causes walking difficulties and increasing muscle weakness.
      It usually develops in young adults (between 20 and 30 years of age), and affects arm and leg
      muscles. HIBM is caused by mutations in a gene that may affect how the muscles function.
      Researchers want to learn more about the causes, symptoms, and effects of HIBM.

      Objectives:

      - To collect genetic and medical information from people with GNE Myopathy .

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals between 18 and 80 years of age who have GNE Myopathy and do not use a
      wheelchair. - Participants must be willing to stop any current treatment of HIBM while
      enrolled in the study.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical exam, and neurological
           exam.

        -  At the first visit, participants will have the following tests:

        -  Questionnaires about the impact of HIBM on daily activities, mood, and quality of life

        -  24-hour urine collection

        -  Blood samples

        -  Heart function tests

        -  Muscle strength and endurance tests, including walking

        -  Imaging study of the muscles

        -  Participants will return for followup visits at 6, 12, and 18 months. They may be asked
           to return for a final visit at 24 months. Not all tests will be performed at each visit.

        -  Treatment will not be provided as part of this protocol.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      GNE myopathy, previously known as Hereditary Inclusion Body Myopathy (HIBM), or Nonaka
      Myopathy, is an autosomal recessive myopathy with onset in early adulthood characterized by
      progressive muscle atrophy and weakness. The causative gene, GNE, encodes for the
      bifunctional enzyme UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase (GNE) that
      catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of sialic acid (Neu5Ac). The subsequent
      impairment of Neu5Ac production is presumed to cause decreased sialylation of GNE myopathy
      muscle glycoproteins, resulting in muscle deterioration. In this protocol, we will clinically
      evaluate patients with GNE myopathy. To date, the amount of prospectively collected and
      published natural history data on GNE myopathy has been minimal due to the rare nature of
      this disease. This natural history study seeks to further characterize the phenotype,
      progression and complications of the disease. Additionally, the study is designed to identify
      endpoints and biomarkers for future therapeutic trials

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

               1. Age 18-80 years, either gender, inclusive.

               2. Diagnosis of GNE myopathy based upon:

                    1. Consistent clinical course, family history of GNE myopathy or characteristic
                       findings on muscle biopsy, and

                    2. Identification of two GNE gene mutations. Molecular confirmation of the
                       diagnosis will be obtained for all subjects in the study.

               3. Subjects may be taking ManNAc at the time of their enrollment, but must be
                  willing to stop treatment with ManNAc, sialic acid (SA), intravenous
                  immunoglobulin (IVIG), and/or other supplements containing SA (e.g., St John s
                  wort, sialyllactose) after the screening assessment and must be willing to remain
                  off treatment for the duration of the study.

             aminotransferase [ALT], gamma-GTP) or renal laboratory parameters (creatinine, blood
