  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This observational cohort study is being conducted to further characterize selected adverse
      events of interest among a patient population with osteoporosis who are prescribed
      bazedoxifene, raloxifene, or a bisphosphonate in usual clinical care outside of a randomized
      clinical trial setting. The study will compare the rates of the selected clinical events
      among the three treatment groups.

    <measure>Cumulative Incidence of Venous Thromboembolism (VTE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to a maximum of follow-up period of 92.1 months</time_frame>
    <description>VTE is defined as deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), retinal vein thrombosis, and sinus thrombosis. DVT: occurs when a blood clot forms in a vein located deep inside the body. PE: a blockage of an artery in the lungs by a substance that has moved from elsewhere in the body through the bloodstream (embolism). Sinus thrombosis: presence of a blood clot in the dural venous sinuses, which drain blood from the brain. Retinal vein thrombosis: blockage of the small veins that carry blood away from the retina. Cumulative incidence was calculated as total participants with VTE events during follow-up period divided by total persons at risk during follow-up period*100 and hence cumulative incidence was expressed as percentage of participants.</description>

        <title>Cumulative Incidence of Venous Thromboembolism (VTE)</title>
        <description>VTE is defined as deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), retinal vein thrombosis, and sinus thrombosis. DVT: occurs when a blood clot forms in a vein located deep inside the body. PE: a blockage of an artery in the lungs by a substance that has moved from elsewhere in the body through the bloodstream (embolism). Sinus thrombosis: presence of a blood clot in the dural venous sinuses, which drain blood from the brain. Retinal vein thrombosis: blockage of the small veins that carry blood away from the retina. Cumulative incidence was calculated as total participants with VTE events during follow-up period divided by total persons at risk during follow-up period*100 and hence cumulative incidence was expressed as percentage of participants.</description>
        <time_frame>Up to a maximum of follow-up period of 92.1 months</time_frame>

        <description>Goitre is a swelling in the neck resulting from an enlarged thyroid gland. Cumulative incidence was calculated as total participants with thyroid disorders-goitre events during follow-up period divided by total persons at risk during follow-up period*100 and hence cumulative incidence was expressed as percentage of participants.</description>
