  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An estimated 8 million individuals in America are affected by peripheral arterial disease
      (PAD), blockages of the leg arteries that can cause excruciating calf pain when walking. PAD
      can have a tremendous impact on patients' quality of life. It is also associated with high
      rates of heart attacks and premature death. While there are a number of treatments, there
      have been few previous studies that have prospectively examined treatment patterns for PAD or
      sought to systematically identify opportunities to improve care. Most importantly, there have
      been no rigorous studies examining the impact of the disease from patients' perspectives -
      their symptoms, function and quality of life - as a function of different patient
      characteristics and treatments. The PORTRAIT study (Phase II) will systematically document
      the treatments and health status (symptom, function and quality of life) outcomes of 840 US
      patients over the course of one year (assessments at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months) from 10
      centers to address these gaps in knowledge. It will illuminate whether disparities in
      treatment or health status outcomes exist as a function of patients' age, gender, race,
      socioeconomic or psychological characteristics. PORTRAIT will substantially elevate the field
      and identify critical gaps in the way PAD is currently managed, including potential
      disparities in care, so that the quality of care can be improved.

    <textblock>
      Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a highly prevalent, but undertreated atherosclerotic
      disease with a disproportionately poor cardiovascular prognosis, as compared with other
      cardiovascular diseases. Cardiac events are, however, only one manifestation of PAD.
      Patients' health status (symptoms, function, and quality of life) are critical outcomes from
      patients' perspectives. To date, there have been no systematic prospective evaluations of
      disease-specific health status outcomes in PAD and how these vary by treatment and patient
      characteristics. The long-term goal of our work is to create an evidence-based multi-modal
      PAD management program that can be individualized to each patient. Following our preparatory
      work in Pilot PCORI grant 1 IP2 PI000753-01, the current proposal will develop a multi-center
      observational registry called PORTRAIT (Patient-centered Outcomes Related to Treatment
      Practices in peripheral Arterial disease: Investigating Trajectories). PORTRAIT will
      prospectively define and relate patients' care to their health status outcomes as a function
      of their treatment received at specialty clinics for new-onset, or exacerbations, of their
      PAD. We hypothesize that there will be substantial variability in treatment patterns across
      providers and by patient characteristics and that these will explain much of the variation in
      patients' health status outcomes. Four hypothesis-driven specific aims will be tested; the
      5th aim will result in a direct deliverable from this study:

      Aim 1: We hypothesize strong associations between the severity of patients' health status and
      the use of revascularization and that these will vary by age, gender, race, and
      socio-economic status. This aim will examine variations in treatment by patient
      characteristics as a foundation for identifying disparities in care.

      Aim 2: We hypothesize that revascularization will be associated with more rapid, and larger,
      improvements in health status as compared with non-invasive options, and that these benefits
      will vary by age, gender, baseline health status, smoking cessation, minority race, and
      depressive symptoms. The primary objective of PORTRAIT is to quantify patients' PAD-specific
      health status outcomes overall, and as a function of treatment and patient characteristics.

      Aim 3: We hypothesize that variations in performance measure adherence exist across
      providers, with greater adherence to pharmacologic therapies for prevention, than exercise
      treatments to improve function. We will compare real world PAD care against 4 PAD performance
      measures to provide insights into the quality of PAD care.

      Aim 4: We hypothesize that variations in pharmacologic and supervised exercise will be
      associated with differences in health status outcomes and provide the evidence to suggest
      that failure to prescribe these evidence-based treatments will result in lower health status
      scores.

      Aim 5: Use the new information to create educational tools to assist patients in selecting
      treatments.

        Patients presenting to a PAD specialty clinic with new-onset exertional leg symptoms, or
        recent exacerbations of symptoms, will be screened for enrollment at 10 specialty PAD
        clinics. Trained study coordinators will have access to the outpatient clinic's schedule
        and be able to identify potentially eligible patients a priori so as to review medical
        records and identify potential patients. The diagnostic enrollment criterion includes a
        Doppler resting ankle-brachial index (ABI) ≤0.9026 or a significant drop in post-exercise
        ankle pressure of ≥20 mmHg. Patients will be asked to participate upon first visiting the
        PAD clinic, before treatment is started.

        Study coordinators at each center will obtain informed consent and perform the baseline
        interview at the outpatient clinic.
