  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to estimate the proportion of Ventricular Assist Device (VAD)
      patients with abnormal gastrointestinal bleeding as assessed by HemoQuant fecal occult blood
      test. Also, in patients with gastrointestinal bleeding present, to summarize the extent of
      gastrointestinal bleeding; to examine the behavior of HemoQuant fecal occult blood test over
      time by estimating the proportion of VAD patients with a positive test prior to implantation;
      at one week, one month, three months, six months and one year post implantation, and after
      explantation of the VAD and to evaluate whether presence of any abnormal fecal HemoQuant test
      is predictive of a future major bleeding event.

    <measure>Proportion of VAD Patients with Gastrointestinal Bleeding as Assessed by HemoQuant Fecal Occult Blood Testing</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>We will estimate the proportion of VAD patients with gastrointestinal bleeding as assessed by HemoQuant fecal occult blood test along with an exact binomial 95% confidence interval (CI). HemoQuant values will be summarized using the sample median, minimum, 25th percentile, 75th percentile, and maximum. These measures will be reported overall, regardless of time after implantation, in order to provide an estimate of the frequency of gastrointestinal bleeding in VAD patients that will be able to be published quickly and raise awareness of this issue.</description>

    <measure>Examine Behavior of Gastrointestinal Bleeding in VAD Patients By Estimating the Proportion of VAD Patients with an Abnormal HemoQuant Test Prior to Implantation</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>We will examine the behavior of gastrointestinal bleeding over time in VAD patients (as assessed by HemoQuant fecal occult blood test), by estimating the proportion of VAD patients with an abnormal HemoQuant test (and 95% CI) prior to implantation; at one week, one month, three months, six months and one year post implantation, and after explantation of the VAD.</description>
