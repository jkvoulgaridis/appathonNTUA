  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare two very similar designs of knee replacement device. One device
      (Sigma CR150) is a slightly modified version of the original (Sigma CR) and has been modified
      to enhance/accommodate higher flexion. The original device has been in widespread clinical
      use with excellent results since 1996 and this study will determine whether the design
      modifications of the newer device add further value. The newer device has been in clinical
      use with good short-term(unpublished) outcomes since becoming commercially available in
      January 2009.

      Achieving higher knee flexion may be required for cultural reasons or by the increasingly
      younger, more active patient population undergoing knee replacement today. In addition to
      promoting flexion, it is also possible that this design change may help the knee replacement
      to last longer than traditional implants in patients who achieve higher flexion. Therefore,
      the study will compare the two devices in terms of survivorship, flexion and other measures
      of the success of a total knee replacement (range of motion, knee-related quality of life,
      activity and generic quality of life) over the short-term.

      A minimum of one hundred and forty subjects (minimum 70 per group) with osteoarthritis and
      aged 50-75 years will be included at UK/international hospitals.

      Study duration is 2 years and patients will complete standard knee outcome scores plus
      radiological evaluation.

      Subjects would receive one of the study devices regardless of their involvement in the study,
      and apart from (possible)additional visits, x-rays and/or questionnaires, treatment and
      follow-up care will be as per the care they would receive outside of the study.

    <description>Total Knee Society Knee Score change from baseline at 1 year
The Total Knee Society Score is comprised of two scores: the Knee Score and the Function Score. Both have a 0-100 range. Sub-scales are combined to compute a total score of 100
The Total Knee Society Score is made up of pain, range of motion, alignment and stability subscores. An Excellent score is 80-100, a good score is 70-79, a fair score is 60-69 and a poor score is anything below 60.</description>

    <description>Anatomic angle measured at 1 year time point.
If one draws a line from the center of the hip joint to the center of the ankle joint this is considered to be the mechanical axis of the femur.
A line drawn through the center of the femoral shaft is the anatomic axis.
The angle created at the intersection of these lines is referred to as the anatomic alignment angle.
A normal angle is approximately 7-9 degrees &quot;valgus&quot; or slightly &quot;knock-kneed&quot;. &quot;Varus&quot; angles are less common and are also referred to as &quot;bow-legged&quot;.</description>

The Total Knee Society Score is comprised of two scores: the Knee Score and the Function Score. Both have a 0-100 range. Sub-scales are combined to compute a total score of 100
The Total Knee Society Score is made up of pain, range of motion, alignment and stability subscores. An Excellent score is 80-100, a good score is 70-79, a fair score is 60-69 and a poor score is anything below 60.</description>

        <title>Anatomic Alignment Angle</title>
        <description>Anatomic angle measured at 1 year time point.
If one draws a line from the center of the hip joint to the center of the ankle joint this is considered to be the mechanical axis of the femur.
A line drawn through the center of the femoral shaft is the anatomic axis.
The angle created at the intersection of these lines is referred to as the anatomic alignment angle.
A normal angle is approximately 7-9 degrees &quot;valgus&quot; or slightly &quot;knock-kneed&quot;. &quot;Varus&quot; angles are less common and are also referred to as &quot;bow-legged&quot;.</description>
