    <textblock>
      This prospective study collected safety information from more than 600 participants treated
      with Pergoveris®.

      During the Post-Marketing Surveillance (PMS) period, data about the participant's background,
      participant's medical history, Pergoveris® indication, prior infertility medication,
      Pergoveris® treatment status, concomitant drugs, all adverse events (regardless of the causal
      relationship to Pergoveris®) and efficacy (follicular growth and clinical pregnancy) were
      collected for study purposes.The post marketing surveillance was based on all cases treated
      with Pergoveris®.

    <description>Adverse Event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. Adverse events included both Serious AEs and non-serious AEs. A serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death; life threatening; persistent/significant disability/incapacity; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; congenital anomaly/birth defect or was otherwise considered medically important. Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR) was defined as an adverse event for which a causal relationship between the product and the occurrence was suspected, that was judged possible or probable by the reporting physician.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants, who were eligible for Pergoveris® treatment according to the indication
             in the national label of Pergoveris®. The national label approved by Korea Food &amp; Drug
             Administration is &quot;Pergoveris® in association with a follicle stimulating hormone(FSH)
             preparation was recommended for the stimulation of follicular development in women
             with severe Luteinizing Hormone (LH) and FSH deficiency. In clinical trials these
             participants were defined by an endogenous serum LH level less than (&lt;)1.2
             International units per liter IU/L&quot;
