      This study is a regulatory post-marketing surveillance in Japan, and it is a local
      prospective and observational study of patients who have been administered with Nexavar for
      unresectable or advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The objective of this study is to assess
      safety and effectiveness of Nexavar under real-life practice conditions. This study is an all
      case investigation of which the enrollment period is 15 months, and all patients who received
      Nexavar will be recruited and followed one year since starting Nexavar administration.
