    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ARGX-110 and/or
      the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) in combination with a standard dose of azacytidine (AZA)
      in Phase 1; and to evaluate efficacy of ARGX-110 when administered at a RP2D level
      established in Phase I in combination with a standard dose of AZA (proof-of concept) by
      evaluating overall response rate (ORR) in Phase 2.
