  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypothermia contributes to a significant portion of neonatal deaths. Kangaroo mother care
      (KMC) is a safe and effective method of warming; however, it is not always feasible, and not
      possible in settings such as resuscitation or clinical instability. Electric warmers are the
      standard of care in developed countries, but are extremely costly, complicated with risk of
      causing both hypo and hyperthermia with misuse, and often not feasible in settings without
      stable electricity. Through a multi-institutional collaboration, the investigators have
      developed an electricity-free infant warmer. After laboratory based prototype testing for
      safety and efficacy, the investigators aim to study the supervised use of the warmer under
      routine implementation conditions in a resource-limited setting.

      Hypothermia contributes to a significant portion of neonatal deaths. Kangaroo mother care
      (KMC) is a safe and effective method of warming; however, it is not always feasible, and not
      possible in settings such as resuscitation or clinical instability. Electric warmers are the
      standard of care in developed countries, but are extremely costly, complicated with risk of
      causing both hypo and hyperthermia with misuse, and often not feasible in settings without
      stable electricity. Through a multi-institutional collaboration, the investigators have
      developed an electricity-free infant warmer. After laboratory based prototype testing for
      safety and efficacy, the investigators aim to study the supervised use of the warmer under
      routine implementation conditions in a resource-limited setting. The primary aim of Phase 1
      is to determine if the infant warmer is a safe, effective, usable and functional addition to
      KMC. This is planned in a convenience sample of patients in two district hospitals, one in a
      relatively warm environment, and one in a colder setting using quantitative methods and
      observer audits of usability and functionality. After determination of safety and
      effectiveness and making any necessary modifications to the warmer, Phase 2 aims to study the
      warmer in rural health centers and transport, as this is where we ultimately aim to use the
      electricity free devices due to the limited access to functioning and stable electricity in
      these settings. The overall goal of the project is dissemination of the study results, and
      ultimately the infant warmer to the district and national level for key policy makers and
      stakeholders, as well as globally via publication.

    <description>In line with current recommended practice, mothers will be encouraged to provide Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) whenever possible. If an infant's temp is not rising by ½ degree C per hour with KMC alone, the infant warmer will be offered as an addition by the study team. If the mother is not available for KMC at any time, the infant will be warmed exclusively with the warmer. Bundling in clothes will only be used in addition to the warmer per carer preference. Temp measurement of the infant, warmer, and ambient air will be measured every 15 mins for the first hr, then hrly and as needed for the remainder of use or until warmer endpoint is reached (warmer temp below 36 degrees or phase-change material hardens [soft, semisoft, or hardened]).</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Any infant with the following criteria for whom caregiver is not available for
             Kangaroo Mother Care, or Kangaroo Mother Care is not adequate (less than ½ degree
             Celsius per hour rise in temperature).

               1. axillary temperature &lt; 36 degrees C and ≥35 degrees C 1a) If an electric warmer
                  is available and the infant's temperature is &lt; 35 degrees C, then the infant
                  would start by being warmed on the electric warmer until the infant's temperature
                  reaches 36 degrees C, then can start non-electric infant warmer use

               2. Infants at-risk for hypothermia (criteria: estimated post-menstrual age of &lt; 35
                  weeks or current body weight of &lt; 2.5 kg)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any infant whose family is unwilling to consent to study.

          2. Mothers who are critically ill at the time of infant eligibility or deemed not
             medically stable by nursing staff to be approached for consent.

          3. Any infant with a contraindication to Kangaroo Mother Care (medical instability) and
             electrical heating source available.

          4. Any infant with initial temperature &lt; 35 degrees C and electrical heating source
             available.

          8. Infants with Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy (HIE)

        Stopping Criteria:

        If an electric heating source is available, the infant will be taken off the study and
        warmed with an appropriate source of electric heat if the infant:

          1. Is hypothermic and temperature decreases on any measurement

          2. Is hypothermic and temperature does not begin to rise within 30 minutes

          3. Is hypothermic and not heating at a rate of &gt; ½ degree C per hour until temperature is
             &gt;36.5 degrees C

          4. Has a temperature that falls below 36 degrees C despite maximum exposure to the heat
             source

          5. Is ever considered to be too severely ill by the medical team to be safely cared for
             in the non-electric infant warmer.

          6. The warmer will be removed once its temperature drops below 36 degrees, and/or the
             phase change material begins to harden.

            <title>Non-Electric Infant Warmer</title>
            <description>In line with current recommended practice, mothers will be encouraged to provide Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) whenever possible. If an infant’s temp is not rising by ½ degree C per hour with KMC alone, the infant warmer will be offered as an addition by the study team. If the mother is not available for KMC at any time, the infant will be warmed exclusively with the warmer. Bundling in clothes will only be used in addition to the warmer per carer preference. Temp measurement of the infant, warmer, and ambient air will be measured every 15 mins for the first hr, then hrly and as needed for the remainder of use or until warmer endpoint is reached (warmer temp below 36 degrees or phase-change material hardens [soft, semisoft, or hardened]).</description>
