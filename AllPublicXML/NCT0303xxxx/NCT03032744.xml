  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Project ASTHMA is a school-based health center intervention program that institutes
      guideline-based chronic asthma care and provides supervised administration with daily
      preventive asthma medications to improve asthma symptoms and lung function, reduce emergency
      visits, and decrease missed days of school among children from communities with health
      disparities.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Project ASTHMA in schools is a 7 month randomized control intervention pilot trial. Forty
      students, ages 4 to 14 years, with persistent asthma, or who utilize acute care facilities
      frequently for their asthma, will be recruited from 3 urban SBHCs in the fall of 2018. All
      students will receive NHLBI guideline-based asthma assessments to determine eligibility and
      proper dosing of preventive medication. The asthma assessment will include spirometry
      testing. All enrolled students and parents will receive asthma education at the time of
      enrollment. Eligible students will be randomized to an intervention or usual care group using
      permuted block randomization stratified by SBHCs. In collaboration with the student's PCP,
      the SBHCs' mid-level providers will prescribe the preventive medication to the students in
      the intervention group. These students will receive the morning dose of their preventive
      medication from the school nurse each school day for the remainder of the school year.
      Students and their parents will be responsible to administer the evening and non-school day
      doses. Students randomized to the usual care group will be referred back to their PCP for
      further asthma management. All participants will be re-evaluated at 1, 3 and 7 months after
      enrollment, and medication dose adjustments will be made in the intervention group as needed.
