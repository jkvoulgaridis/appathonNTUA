      Design: a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial in
      parallel groups.

      This study will enrol subjects of both sexes aged from 6 months to 6 years who are admitted
      to hospital within 48 h of the onset of acute intestinal infection (AII), presumably of viral
      aetiology. Patients to be enrolled in the screening will be children with typical viral
      gastroenteritis/enteritis symptoms. The key symptom is decreased in the consistency of stools
      (loose or liquid) and increased in the frequency of its evacuations (at list 3 time daily).
      Virus detection in stool samples will be performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

      After the parent/adopter signs a parents/adopters information sheet (Informed Consent form)
      for the child's participation in the clinical trial, the recording of medical history data, a
      medical examination including the evaluation of symptoms on the Clinical Dehydration Scale
      (CDS) by pediatrician, and laboratory tests will be performed during Visit 1 (Day 1). If
      inclusion criteria are met and non-inclusion criteria are absent (day 1), the patient will be
      included in the trial and randomized to administer either Ergoferon or Placebo.

      In addition to the standard/pathogenetic therapies, group 1 patients will take Ergoferon
      following a 5-day regimen, whereas group 2 patients will receive Placebo. The
      parents/adopters of the patient will be provided with a patient diary and instructed how to
      complete the diary.

      Before treatment stool specimens will be collected from the patients for detection and
      differentiation of Rotavirus A, Norovirus 2 genotype, Astrovirus, Adenovirus F, Shigella
      spp., enteroinvasive E.coli (EIEC), Salmonella spp., and thermophilic Campylobacter spp.
      using a PCR assay to diagnose the etiology of intestinal infection. In total, the patients
      will be monitored for 10 days (screening, randomization, treatment initiation - Day 1; the
      treatment on Days 1-5; observation in hospital - Day 6, and follow-up period - Day 7-10).
      During the treatment and inpatient observation periods (Days 1-6, Visits 1-6), the patients
      will be examined daily by a pediatrician, and the examination results, including the CDS
      scores, will be recorded in source documents. The patient's parent/adopter will complete the
      patient diary every day, recording the presence/absence of diarrhoea signs, vomiting, and
      body temperature. The paediatrician will check them each time for the correctness of
      completion. On day 10 (after hospital discharge), Visit 7 will be done (as an in-person visit
      (a hospital or calling a doctor) or a distance, 'phone' visit) to interview the
      parents/adopters about the patient's health, presence of any complications, and use of
      medications (the paediatrician will use this information to complete a questionnaire).
      Collection of stool specimens and repeat PCR for
      Rotaviruses/Noroviruses/Astroviruses/Adenoviruses, Shigella spp., EIEC, Salmonella spp., and
      Campylobacter spp. will be performed on Days 3, 4, and 6 of inpatient observation and after
      discharge from the hospital (Day 10); collection of blood and urine specimens for safety
      tests will be carried out at baseline and before hospital discharge (day 6). The recording of
      the intake of study therapies and of concomitant medications as well as the assessment of
      compliance with and safety of the study therapies will be performed on Days 2-6 and 10.

      Patients who recovered while in hospital and are discharged from the unit earlier than at 5
      days will undergo the procedures of Visit 6, including the collection of biological specimens
      for PCR (efficacy evaluation) and biochemistry, blood test and urinalysis (safety
      assessment). The parents/adopters will be given the blister pack with the remaining study
      drug so that the patient can continue the treatment.

    <description>Diarrhea duration is considered as the time between receiving the first dose of investigational medicine /placebo and the normal consistency of stool pattern (to the previous stool consistency before diarrhea), i.e.
time to the first loose stool which is followed by two normal consistency stools over 24 h (infants may have three episodes of loose stool over a 24-hour period), or
time to ≤3 episodes of stool occurring over 24 h, at least 2 of which are normal consistency stools, or
time to the absence of stools for ≥12 h which is not followed by new episodes of diarrhea (total stool frequency over 24 h - less than 3 times).</description>
