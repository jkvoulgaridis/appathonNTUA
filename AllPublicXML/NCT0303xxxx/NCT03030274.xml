  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate safety and efficacy of the Occlutech® AFR device in patients
      with HFrEF (Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction) and HFpEF (Heart failure with
      preserved ejection fraction)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will enroll subjects with HFrEF or HFpEF, until a maximum of 100 patients have
      undergone implantation with the Occlutech® AFR device.

      Enrolled patients will be stratified according to their ejection fraction as either HFrEF
      (ejection fraction &gt; 15% and &lt;40 %) or HFpEF ( ejection Fraktion &gt; 40 % to 70 %). It is
      planned to enroll at least 100 patients per stratification subgroup.
