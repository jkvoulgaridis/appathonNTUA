  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Gastric cancers are cancers of the stomach. Hereditary ones are passed from parent to child.
      Researchers want to gather data about hereditary gastric cancers. They want to learn about
      changes these cause in the body and about the genes involved.

      Objective:

      -To gather data about hereditary gastric cancer.

      Eligibility:

        -  People at least 2 years old with personal or family history with a hereditary gastric
           cancer.

        -  People at least 2 years old with gene changes that lead to such cancer or a lesion that
           may be hereditary.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened in a separate protocol.

        -  Participants will have:

             -  Physical exam

             -  Medical history

             -  Blood tests

             -  Scans

             -  Photos of skin lesions and other findings

             -  Gynecology consultation for women

             -  Cheek swab (some participants)

        -  For some participants, their relatives will be asked to join the study.

        -  Some participants will be asked to allow the study to get stored tissue samples for
           relatives who have died.

        -  Some samples will be sent to outside labs. All personal data will be protected. Samples
           will be destroyed when the study ends.

        -  Participants will get the results of genetic testing.

        -  Participants who cannot come to the NIH clinic may just give a cheek swab and have
           genetic testing done.

        -  Some participants will be contacted for more testing.

      Background:

        -  An estimated 1-3% of gastric cancer cases occur within a familial background as part of
           an inherited cancer syndrome

        -  Hereditary Diffuse Gastric Cancer (HDGC) is the most frequent form of familial gastric
           cancer and has been linked to a germline mutation in the CDH1 gene

        -  Gastric Adenocarcinoma and Proximal Polyposis of the Stomach (GAPPS) is a more recently
           described autosomal dominant syndrome characterized by fundic gland polyposis with
           antral sparing

        -  Other germline mutations that predispose to gastric cancer such as SDH (succinate
           dehydrogenase protein subunits) gene and CTNNA1 (alpha catenin).

      Objectives:

      - Characterize the natural and clinical histories of hereditary gastric cancer syndromes

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals, and family members, who fulfill clinical criteria for a hereditary gastric
      cancer syndrome irrespective of previous genetic testing or treatment

      Design:

        -  These rare families will be recruited to genetically confirm diagnosis and study the
           natural history of hereditary gastric cancers

        -  Genetic testing will be offered to gain appreciation of the effect of mutations on the
           relative activity of various germline and somatic mutations.

        -  We will determine if there is a relationship between mutation and disease phenotype.
