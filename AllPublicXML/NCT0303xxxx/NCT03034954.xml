  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As we age, a number of factors can reduce our cognitive (or thinking) abilities. This study
      will evaluate whether transcranial electrical stimulation (TES), which uses small amounts of
      electricity to modulate brain functioning, can improve cognitive abilities. Here, the effects
      of TES on working memory, learning, and memory, will be evaluated in a group of healthy older
      adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to investigate the cognitive effects of high definition anodal tDCS
      (HD-tDCS; anode at center electrode) at 3 mA (for 20 minutes) on learning, memory, and
      working memory. Participants will be randomized to active or sham stimulation and will
      complete a series of cognitive tests both during and after stimulation.

      Tolerability and blinding will also be evaluated using standard side effect questionnaires.

    <measure>Object Location Touchscreen Task (Version C) Free Recall Total Error</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes after encoding</time_frame>
    <description>The Object Location Touchscreen Task (OLTT) is an ecologically relevant measure of object location association memory. The OLTT requires participants to learn and recall the location of 15 object-location associations. Memory is evaluated using a touchscreen monitor, which allows for the continuous measurement of memory accuracy (i.e., distance from targeted location). During the Free Recall, participants are given a black screen and asked to touch the area of the screen an object was located. Total Score is the sum of error for all 15 trials. Lower scores represent better performance.</description>

    <description>The n-back is a well validated measure of working memory. During 0-back, participants are asked to respond by pressing a key when the picture on the screen is the same as the given target (e.g., a cow). Discriminability (d') is a measure of signal detection that accounts for signal to noise ratio. Higher scores represent better discriminability.</description>

    <description>The n-back is a well validated measure of working memory. During 0-back, participants are asked to respond by pressing a key when the picture on the screen is the same as the given target (e.g., a cow). During 2-back, participants are asked to respond when a picture shown is the exact same as two items ago. Discriminability (d') is a measure of signal detection that accounts for signal to noise ratio. By subtracting the 0-back d', the calculated score represents a more pure working memory measure. Scores closer to zero or positive represent better working memory performance.</description>

          <title>Object Location Touchscreen Task (Version B) Free Recall Total Error</title>
          <description>The Object Location Touchscreen Task (OLTT) is an ecologically relevant measure of object location association memory. The OLTT requires participants to learn and recall the location of 15 object-location associations. Memory is evaluated using a touchscreen monitor, which allows for the continuous measurement of memory accuracy (i.e., distance from targeted location). During the Free Recall, participants are given a black screen and asked to touch the area of the screen an object was located. Total Score is the sum of error for all 15 trials. Lower scores represent better performance.</description>

          <title>Object Location Touchscreen Task (Version B) Free Recall Average Error</title>
          <description>The Object Location Touchscreen Task (OLTT) is a measure of object location association memory. The OLTT requires participants to learn and recall the location of 15 object-location associations. Memory is evaluated using a touchscreen monitor, which allows for the continuous measurement of memory accuracy (i.e., distance from targeted location). During the Free Recall, participants are given a blank screen and asked to touch the area of the screen an object was located. Average Score is the average error across all 15 trials. Lower scores represent better performance.</description>

        <title>Object Location Touchscreen Task (Version C) Free Recall Average Error</title>
        <description>The Object Location Touchscreen Task (OLTT) is a measure of object location association memory. The OLTT requires participants to learn and recall the location of 15 object-location associations. Memory is evaluated using a touchscreen monitor, which allows for the continuous measurement of memory accuracy (i.e., distance from targeted location). During the Free Recall, participants are given a blank screen and asked to touch the area of the screen an object was located. Average Score is the average error across all 15 trials. Lower scores represent better performance.</description>

          <title>Object Location Touchscreen Task (Version C) Recognition Total Correct</title>
          <description>The Object Location Touchscreen Task (OLTT) requires participants to learn and recall the location of 15 object-location associations. Memory is evaluated using a touchscreen monitor, which allows for the continuous measurement of memory accuracy (i.e., distance from targeted location). During the Recognition, participants are asked to select the correct location of an object from three options on the screen. Recognition total is the number of correct selections on all 15 trials. Higher scores represent better performance.</description>

        <description>The Object Location Touchscreen Task (OLTT) requires participants to learn and recall the location of 15 object-location associations. Memory is evaluated using a touchscreen monitor, which allows for the continuous measurement of memory accuracy (i.e., distance from targeted location). During the Recognition, participants are asked to select the correct location of an object from three options on the screen. Recognition Average Response Time is the average latency to respond across all 15 trials. Lower scores represent faster responses.</description>
