      This trial studies how well comprehensive nutritional geriatric assessments work in
      identifying malnutrition in older cancer participants. Comprehensive nutritional geriatric
      assessments may help doctors learn about ways to check for malnutrition (loss of
      weight/appetite that may result in health problems) that is due to cancer or cancer
      treatment.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate whether nutritional status, as determined by each of 4 screening tools (Mini
      Nutritional Assessment [MNA], weight loss, body mass index [BMI], and lean muscle mass),
      correlates with 6-month and 12-month mortality in older cancer patients after geriatric
      assessment, after adjusting for covariates.

      II. To evaluate whether nutritional status, as determined by each of by 4 screening tools
      (MNA, weight loss, BMI, and lean muscle mass) correlates with 6-month and 12-month unplanned
      hospitalization in older cancer patients who undergo geriatric assessment, after adjusting
      for covariates.

      III. To evaluate whether nutritional status, as determined by each of 4 screening tools (MNA,
      weight loss, BMI, and lean muscle mass) correlates with 6-month and 12-month hospital
      readmissions in older cancer patients who undergo geriatric assessment, after adjusting for
      covariates.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants undergo nutritional geriatric assessment over 15 minutes in person or on the
      phone every 3 months for 12 months.

    <description>The association between nutrition status and mortality (6-month and 1-year mortality since geriatric assessment) will be assessed by logistic regression analysis, considering mortality as a response variable. Univariate logistic regression analysis will be used to estimate the crude odds ratio, and multivariable logistic regression will be used to estimate the adjusted odds ratio, after controlling for potential confounder variables, such as age, race, cancer type, cancer stage, co-morbidity, cognitive status), and frailty. ROC curve to predict 6-month and 1-year mortality will be constructed for nutritional status, as determined by each screening tool. The area under the ROC curve, sensitivity, and specificity and 95% confidence intervals will be obtained for each screening tool.</description>

    <description>The associations between nutrition status and unplanned hospitalization will be assessed by logistic regression analysis. Univariate logistic regression analysis will be used to get the crude odds ratio, and multivariable logistic regression will be used to get the adjusted odds ratio, after controlling for potential confounder variables, such as age, race, cancer type, cancer stage, co-morbidity, cognitive status, and frailty. Patients who died before 6 months or 1 year from geriatric test will be considered as having unplanned 6-month or 1-year hospitalization. ROC curve to predict each of secondary outcomes will be constructed for nutritional status, as determined by each screening tool. The area under the ROC curve, sensitivity, and specificity and 95% confidence intervals will be obtained for each screening tool. Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize data. Two sample t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test will be used for the comparison in numeric variables.</description>
