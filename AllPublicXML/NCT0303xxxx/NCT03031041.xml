  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common peripheral entrapment neuropathy with
      involving compression of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel. Rather than other progressive
      disease, CTS is characterized by remission and recurrence. The hydrodissection could decrease
      the entrapment of nerve to restore blood supply. Despite the hydrodissection was pervasively
      used in clinical practice, current researches contain small participant without control group
      or randomized leading to foreseeable selection bias. The investigators design a randomized,
      double-blind, controlled trial to assess the effect of different method of ultrasound-guided
      hydrodissection in patients with CTS.

      After obtaining written informed consent, patients with bilateral CTS will been randomized
      into intervention and control group. Participants in short-axis group received one-dose
      ultrasound-guided hydrodissection with short-axis approach and long-axis group received
      one-dose ultrasound-guided injection with long-axis approach. No additional treatment after
      injection through the study period. The primary outcome is Boston Carpal Tunnel Syndrome
      Questionnaire (BCTQ) and secondary outcomes include visual analog scale (VAS),
      cross-sectional area (CSA) of the median nerve, sensory nerve conduction velocity of the
      median nerve, and finger pinch strength. The evaluation was performed pretreatment as well as
      on the 2nd week, 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 6th month after the treatment.

    <description>Boston carpal tunnel syndrome questionnaire (BCTQ) is a frequently used patient-based questionnaire for measurement of CTS which encompasses two components. In total, 11 questions and 8 items were evaluated to rate the symptom severity scale (SSS) and functional status scale (FSS), respectively. Both subscales range from 1 to 5 with a higher score indicating a higher degree of disability. The mean of total SSS and FSS divided with each item score were used for further analysis.</description>
