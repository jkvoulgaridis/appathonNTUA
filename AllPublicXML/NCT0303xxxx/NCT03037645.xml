  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label Phase 1b/2 study in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small
      lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL)or non hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) who have failed prior standard
      of care therapies including a BTK inhibitor where one is approved for the indication.

    <textblock>
      This study includes 2 parts: phase 1 (dose escalation) and phase 2 (cohort expansion) in
      patients with CLL/SLL or NHL who have failed prior standard of care therapies including a BTK
      inhibitor where one is approved for the indication. NHL indications include
      lymphoplasmacytoid lymphoma/Waldenström's macroglobulinemia (LPL/WM), mantle cell lymphoma
      (MCL), marginal zone lymphoma (MZL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of the activated B-cell
      subtype (DLBCL-ABC), and follicular lymphoma (FL). In Phase 1b, cohorts of 3 to 6 patients
      are studied at each dose level, starting with 25 mg vecabrutnib BID in oral capsule form.
      Following identification of the MTD and/or recommended dose, in Phase 2 patients will be
      enrolled to expansion cohorts to further characterize the clinical activity, safety, and
      pharmacology of vecabrutinib. Cycle length is 4 weeks.
