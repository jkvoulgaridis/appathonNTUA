  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypoglycemia is the most common metabolic problem faced after birth. The investigators will
      be studying the utility of using a continuous glucose monitoring(CGM) system to more closely
      monitor low blood sugars in newborns. The investigators will evaluate the number of
      hypoglycemic events detected using CGM and compare it to those detected using current
      standard of care screening methods.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A CGM will be subcutaneously inserted by trained staff on a healthy area of skin and will be
      calibrated according to the manufacturer's instructions. Blood glucose measurements will be
      taken using a blinded study glucometer to calibrate the device. Calibration by trained study
      staff will take place about every 12 hours. Sensor insertion sites will be monitored for
      infection throughout the course of the study by nursing and clinical staff or by trained
      study staff on an as needed basis. At the conclusion of the study, the CGM will be removed
      and assessed for signs of infection. Study duration will be up to 7 days while the patient is
      admitted to the hospital.

      Participants will be randomized into 2 groups. The control group will have a blinded CGM in
      place for the duration of the study. The remote monitoring group will be blinded to clinical
      staff. This group will have a CGM connected to an iPod that sends continuous glucose data to
      the study phone and will be monitored 24/7 by study staff. If a blood sugar level of &lt;46
      mg/dl is detected, the infant will first be evaluated for positioning that could be causing a
      falsely low value. If the infant is re-positioned and CGM continues to show a blood sugar
      level of &lt;46 mg/dl, study staff will prompt the nurse taking care of the patient to obtain a
      capillary glucose value to verify the low blood sugar and treat it as deemed appropriate by
      the clinical team.

      The investigators will evaluate the number of hypoglycemic events that occur in the blinded
      CGM group versus the number that occur in the remote monitoring group to assess if the CGM is
      able to more sensitively detect low blood sugars in infants than current hospital standard of
      care measures.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Infants who are at least 34 weeks gestation that are born to mothers with gestational
             or pre-gestational diabetes and are admitted to LPCH are eligible for the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Infants &lt;2,000 grams will be excluded from the study. Infants will also be excluded if
             they have an anomaly of the skin or subcutaneous tissue that would prevent proper
             adhesion, placement, and function of the sensor.
