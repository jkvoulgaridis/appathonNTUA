      The purpose of this study is to evaluate descriptively the long-term immunogenicity of at
      least 1 NoV vaccine administration.

      The drug being tested in this study is called NoV vaccine. NoV vaccine is being tested for
      protection against acute gastroenteritis (AGE) due to norovirus.

      The study will enroll maximum of 575 participants. Participants who previously received NoV
      vaccine in studies NOR-107, NOR-210 and NOR-204 will be enrolled. Participants from study
      NOR-107 will enter the study at the time of their 3rd year post-primary vaccination, and from
      studies NOR-210 and NOR-204, at their 2nd year post-primary vaccination. The duration of
      participation in the study will be different for each participant.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Belgium and the United States. The overall time
      to participate in this study is maximum 5 years after primary NoV vaccination. Participants
      will have a maximum of 4 visits over 3 years.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        1. Male and female participants who previously received at least 1 dose of NoV vaccine in
        trials NOR-107, NOR-210 and NOR-204, have baseline and post-vaccination data, and completed
        the primary vaccination trial protocol as initially described.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Participation in any clinical trial is allowed, on condition that no investigational
             product is administered within 30 days prior to blood sampling.

          2. In the opinion of the investigator, the participant is not medically eligible to
             provide blood specimens.

          3. Individuals with behavioral or cognitive impairment or psychiatric disease that, in
             the opinion of the investigator, may interfere with the participant's ability to
             participate in the trial.

    <ipd_description>Takeda makes patient-level, de-identified data sets and associated documents available after applicable marketing approvals and commercial availability have been received, an opportunity for the primary publication of the research has been allowed, and other criteria have been met as set forth in Takeda's Data Sharing Policy (see www.TakedaClinicalTrials.com/Approach for details). To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias. Once approved, qualified researchers who sign a data sharing agreement are provided access to these data in a secure research environment.</ipd_description>
