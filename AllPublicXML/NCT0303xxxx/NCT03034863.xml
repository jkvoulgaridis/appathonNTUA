  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The management of suicide risk is a pressing national public health issue especially among
      Veterans, and there exist no guidelines of how best to involve family members in this effort.
      This proposal will integrate family and couples communication skills training with suicide
      safety planning. The goal is for the sharing of Veteran suicide safety plans with family
      members and the construction of a parallel family member safety plan, in efforts to mobilize
      and support family involvement.

    <textblock>
      Psychological models of suicidality emphasize the role of social factors in the development
      and intensification of suicidal thoughts and behavior, including feeling like a burden on
      family and friends, feelings of isolation and not belonging, and perceptions of diminished
      support from one's family and social network. Despite the critical role of family factors in
      protecting against suicidality, families lack education on how their behavior can help avert
      or unwittingly aggravate suicidal thoughts/ behavior. Families worry about their relative but
      feel uncertain of how to help and need professional guidance. Family worries about
      suicidality are associated with compromised family physical and mental health and
      consequently, diminished ability to offer needed support. Because suicide safety plans rely
      on mobilizing support in times of crisis, families need to be equipped to provide needed
      support.

      Family recommendations from the VA Behavioral Health Autopsy Program (BHAP) Annual Report
      6/30/15 based on interviews with 114 family members highlighted the importance of:

        1. educating families about suicide warning signs:

        2. improving communication between the veteran and family member

        3. involving the family in the veterans' treatment to enhance support and trust

        4. providing families with coaching on how to assist their loved one to seek help.

      Management of suicidal behavior is covered in comprehensive family psychoeducation programs,
      but there is an urgent need for a brief family-based intervention specifically focused on
      suicide prevention that can be used in conjunction with the currently mandated SSP and as a
      part of routine care.

      Despite the enrichment of VA suicide prevention services and implementation of the national
      suicide hotline, Veteran suicide completions have risen to 22 per day and suicide attempts
      numbered over 15,000 in 2012. These data underscore the urgency of developing additional
      interventions targeting suicidal Veterans. One potential avenue to further suicide treatment
      and rehabilitation efforts is to develop strategies that maximize family support, however
      almost no family interventions exist for suicidal Veterans. The construction of a Suicide
      Safety Plan (SSP); a &quot;best practice,&quot; is mandated throughout the VA system, and a vital
      component of the VA's coordinated effort at suicide prevention and recovery. The pilot data
      on patterns of SSP use in suicidal Veterans highlighted the importance of sharing the plan
      with family or close friends. However, respondents also noted significant obstacles in their
      ability to reach out to others when in distress. To the knowledge of Investigators, there are
      currently no recommended guidelines or mechanisms for involving family in safety planning,
      despite its inclusion as a step of the plan. &quot;Safe Actions for Families to Encourage
      Recovery&quot; (SAFER) a novel suicide safety planning family intervention has been designed to
      fill this critical gap and provide a mechanism to communicate about safety planning. SAFER, a
      4-session, family intervention, combines education about suicide and suicide safety planning
      with communication skills training from evidence-based practices. The aim is to facilitate
      communication about suicide safety planning and to develop both a Veteran and family member
      safety plan.

      Data from this project will test the intervention's feasibility, acceptability and
      preliminary efficacy in a Stage II small-scale randomized clinical trial in 60 moderate
      suicide risk Veterans and their family members. The comparison condition will be safety
      planning without family involvement plus weekly check-in phone calls. Primary Veteran
      outcomes include reducing suicidal ideation/behavior. Secondary Veteran outcomes include
      reducing suicidal cognitions (hopelessness, perceived burdensomeness, thwarted belongingness)
      and depression and improving subjective social support. Family member primary outcomes
      include reducing caregiver burden and secondary outcomes of improving suicide-related coping
      and family empowerment.

    <description>Suicidality will be measured using the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (BSS), a 21-item self-report scale designed to assess severity of suicidal attitudes and plans for suicide. The BSS is internally consistent (Cronbach's coefficients range from .87-.97) and has been used extensively in treatment studies for suicidal individuals, including recent studies. A principal components factor analysis identified 3 factors for the BSS: desire for death, preparation for suicide and actual suicide desire.</description>

    <measure>Self-Harm and Suicide Disclosure Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 1 month; change from 1 month to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Self-Harm and Suicide Disclosure Scale will be used to assess the degree to which Veterans disclose past suicide-type harming behavior to their family. Veterans are first asked to select a family member with whom they talk the most about life's challenges. Then, they are asked to indicate whether they had shared each of ten possible topics with the target family member, such as &quot;when I am thinking about hurting myself on purpose&quot; or &quot;the reason why I attempted suicide.&quot; Response options are no (0) and yes (1).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Family Quality Reaction Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 1 month; change from 1 month to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Family Quality Reaction Scale (FQRS) measures how the target family member's reaction to suicide disclosure was perceived. Veterans are asked the degree to which they agree with five statements regarding the target family member's reaction to their suicide disclosure, such as &quot;I felt more comfortable with this person after I told him or her.&quot; Response options range from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (4), and total scores are summed with higher scores indicating more positive reactions to suicide disclosure. Internal reliability of this scale yielded a Cronbach's alpha of .87.</description>

    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 1 month; change from 1 month to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>We have developed a family counterpart to the Stanley Suicide-related Coping Scale for Veterans that taps family members' appraisal of their ability to participate effectively in Veteran safety planning. Items include, &quot;I recognize the triggers and warning signs for suicidal ideation/urges for my Veteran&quot; and &quot;I know the numbers for the mobile crisis team to contact and nearest hospital or urgent care facility to accompany my Veteran to in a crisis.&quot; This measure will be validated against the more general Family Empowerment Scale.</description>

    <measure>Family Assessment Device</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 1 month; change from 1 month to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Family Assessment Device (FAD), based on the McMaster Model of Family Functioning (MMFF), will measure structural, organizational, and transactional characteristics of families. It consists of 6 scales that assess the 6 dimensions of the MMFF - affective involvement, affective responsiveness, behavioral control, communication, problem solving, and roles - as well as a 7th scale measuring general family functioning. For the purposes of this study, we will only administer the communication and problem-solving scales. Veterans are asked to rate how well each statement describes their own family. The FAD is scored by adding the responses (1-4) for each scale and dividing by the number of items in each scale (6-12). Higher scores indicate worse levels of family functioning.</description>

    <description>SAFER: A novel, 5-session intervention to enhance currently mandated VA suicide safety planning by involving family members to support its implementation. Incorporation of education about suicide risk factors and teaching communication skills of active listening and making a positive request will supply Veterans and family members with the knowledge and tools needed to 1) identify potential warning signs, and 2) discuss Veteran ideation or family concerns with assurance that such requests will be listened to with validation and support, creating an ally for the suicidal Veteran in his struggle. As discussed above, research has demonstrated compellingly that suicidal desire is motivated by two interpersonal factors; perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness. SAFER aims to increase family support for the Veteran to directly mitigate Veteran loneliness and sense of being a burden to others.</description>
