      The goal of project is to target advanced or locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) with
      photodynamic therapy (PDT) to evaluate response of tumor.

      Entry Criteria:

      Patients with good performance status and locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
      Eligible patients should be able to tolerate additional chemotherapy for disease treatment.
      The cancer should be accessible with endoscopic ultrasound and have correctable bleeding
      disorders that would permit safe placement of a photoradiation catheter.

      Methods:

      Patients will be admitted to our clinical research center and undergo preliminary blood tests
      as well as a contrast CT scan of the tumor to assess the tumor size. The next day,
      verteporfrin will be administered 1 hour prior to an endoscopic procedure where EUS will be
      performed and the tumor accessed with a standard FNA needle. A diffusing catheter will be
      placed through the the needle into the tumor to deliver light which activates the
      verteprofrin drug. Two days after the light treatment, the tumor will be assessed again with
      a CT scan of the tumor to assess the degree of tumor necrosis. Chemotherapy can be
      administered within 72 hours of the treatment. The treatment may enhance the effect of
      chemotherapy.

      Studies should be complete at the Mayo Clinic Rochester within 4 days.

    <description>the study drug will be given through an IV infusion. approximately one hour later The physician will direct the endoscope that has an ultrasound to your pancreas, and the treatment laser will be guided to the sites on your pancreas where the tumors are located. This will be done using a ultrasound to find the tumor and place a needle from inside the stomach or small intestine into the tumor. This is a standard procedure for obtaining tissue from a tumor. In this study, a special fiberoptic probe will be placed through the needle to allow light to be delivered to the tumor</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histological/cytological diagnosis of advanced or locally advanced or small volume
             metastatic pancreatic cancer or other solid pancreatic tumor that is not amendable to
             curative surgical resection or the patient is unfit for surgery

          2. Measureable disease as defined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
             (RECIST)

          3. ECOG performance status 0,1 or 2

          4. Estimated life expectancy of at least 12 weeks

          5. Capable of giving informed consent

          6. adequate biliary drainage (serum bilirubin &lt; 2.5 ULN) with no evidence of active
             uncontrolled infection (patients on antibiotics are eligible)

          7. Women of childbearing potential with a negative pregnancy test (qualitative serum HCG)
             prior to study entry and must be using adequate contraception method and continue this
             for one week after PDT

          8. Must be willing and able to travel to study site for screening, treatment and all
             follow up visits

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. For locally advanced patients, evidence of metastases other than lung or liver and if
             lung or liver metastases are present, greater than three lesions, and any lesion
             greater than 5cm. in diameter. For advanced patients, any metastasis is acceptable for
             enrollment.

          2. Porphyria; Pregnant or breast-feeding

          3. Locally advanced disease involving &gt;50% circumference of the duodenum or a major
             artery (hepatic, gastro-duodenal) with in the treatment area

          4. ECOG performance status of 3 or 4

          5. Previous treatment with curative intent for current disease in the last 2 weeks (i.e.
             prior resection, radical radiotherapy or chemotherapy)

          6. Any psychiatric disease making reliable informed consent impossible

          7. A history of documented hemorrhagic diathesis or coagulopathy, currently on
             therapeutic anticoagulation. History of prior or concomitant other malignancy that
             will interfere with the response evaluation

          8. Any evidence of severe of uncontrolled systemic disease or laboratory finding that in
             the view of the investigator makes it unsafe for the patient to participate in the
             study
