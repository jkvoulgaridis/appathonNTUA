  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized study will be conducted in two parts to evaluate the safety, tolerability,
      pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of subcutaneous administration of RO7062931. Part 1
      will include only healthy participants and Part 2 will include only participants with chronic
      hepatitis B (CHB). Part 1 is an adaptive, single-ascending dose study with an adaptive
      dose-escalating schedule to determine the best dose to be evaluated in participants with CHB.
      Part 2 is an adaptive, parallel multiple-dose study comprised of three sub-parts which will
      be used to further refine the dose and dosing regimen, and to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of RO7062931 when administered with standard-of-care (SoC) therapy.
