    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this trial is to evaluate the impact of empagliflozin, as compared
      with placebo, on hemodynamic parameters (pulmonary artery diastolic pressure) in patients
      with heart failure (reduced or preserved ejection fraction, ischemic or non-ischemic
      etiology) who already have a CardioMEMs device implanted for non-study related clinical
      reasons.

      A 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to explore the effects of
      once-daily empagliflozin 10mg on hemodynamic parameters (pulmonary artery pressures) in
      patients with heart failure (reduced or preserved ejection fraction, ischemic or non-ischemic
      etiology) who already have a CardioMEMs device implanted for non-study related clinical
      reasons.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Established diagnosis of heart failure (for at least 16 weeks prior to the screening
             visit) with either preserved (LVEF&gt;40%) or reduced systolic function (LVEF≤40%), due
             to either ischemic or non-ischemic etiology, documented by an imaging modality
             (echocardiography, nuclear imaging, LV angiography, magnetic resonance imaging) within
             the past 24 months.

          2. No major change in diuretic management for 48 hours prior to screening visit or 48
             hours prior to randomization visit (major change defined by doubling of diuretic dose
             or addition of another diuretic medication)

          2. History of type 1 diabetes

          3. Major change in diuretic management during 48 hours prior to screening visit or 48

          4. Significant variability in baseline PA diastolic pressures during screening period.
             Defined as changes greater than +/- 6 mmHg from average PA diastolic pressure during

             screening phase for those patients with an average baseline PA diastolic pressure
             during week 1 of the screening phase of &lt;30 mmHg. If the average baseline PA diastolic
             pressure during week 1 of the screening phase is ≥30 mmHg, then ≥20% relative change
             in average PA diastolic pressure between week 1 and week 2 of the screening phase will
