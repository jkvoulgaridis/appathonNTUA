      The purposes of this study are:

        -  To further examine the efficacy and safety of Tenoten® in the treatment of anxiety in
           patients with somatoform, stress-related and other neurotic disorders.

        -  To compare the efficacy of two dosing regimens of Tenoten® (4 tablets daily vs.8 tablets
           daily, both for 12 weeks) in the treatment of anxiety in patients with somatoform,
           stress-related and other neurotic disorders.

      Design: an international, a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel group
      placebo-controlled trial to evaluate efficacy and safety of study treatment.

      The study will enroll outpatient subjects of both genders aged 18-45 years with verified
      diagnoses of somatoform, stress-related and other neurotic disorders (F43, F45, F48) and
      signs of clinically relevant anxiety according to The Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale
      (HADS).

      After signing information sheet |(informed consent form) to participate in the clinical study
      the subject will be interviewed (complaints, medical history, concomitant therapy) and
      objective examination will be performed; the subject will fill HADS scale. Degree of anxiety
      at screening should be ≥ 11 according to HADS. Where the subject meets inclusion criteria and
      has no exclusion criteria he/she will be enrolled into the study. The investigator will
      determine degree of anxiety using НАМ-А scale; the subject will fill EQ-5D-3L questionnaire.
      At Visit 1 (Day 1) the subject will be randomized into one of the treatment groups:

        -  Group 1: Tenoten® at 2 tablets twice daily (4 tablets/day);

        -  Group 2: Placebo at 2 tablets twice daily (4 tablets/day);

        -  Group 3: Tenoten® at 2 tablets 4 daily (8 tablets/day).

        -  Group 4: Placebo at 2 tablets 4 daily (8 tablets/day). The first dose of the product
           should be administered at Visit 1 after the visit procedures are completed. Further
           administration of the study product will be made according to the dosing scheme. The
           subject will administer the study product and will be followed for 12 weeks during which
           additional three visits will be made. At Visit 2 (Week 4), Visit 3 (Week 8) and Visit 4
           (Week 12) the physician will record patients' complaints and physical examination data,
           fill HAM-A scale, check the study and concomitant therapy, assess treatment safety and
           patient compliance with the study treatment. At the final Visit 4 the subject will fill
           EQ-5D-3L questionnaire and the investigator will determine Clinical Global Impression
           Scale Efficacy Index (CGI-EI) score.

      Subjects will be allowed to take symptomatic therapy and medications for their co-morbidities
      in the course of the study, except for the medicines listed in &quot;Forbidden concomitant
      therapy&quot;.
