      This trial evaluates the impact of a systemic social work driven approach on medical power of
      attorney documentation, knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs in participants with stage I-IV
      gynecological cancers. Social work counseling and education may help increase the number of
      participants who complete medical power of attorney documents. Counseling and education may
      also affect attitudes about decision-making and willingness to take part in these
      conversations in participants with stage I-IV gynecological cancers and their family members
      and/or caregivers.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate medical power of attorney documents (MPOAD) completion rate after a systematic
      social work counseling and education clinical process.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine change in medical power of attorney (MPOA)/primary family caregivers'
      knowledge, attitudes and beliefs about conditions for quality surrogate medical
      decision-making (MDM).

      II. To determine change in MPOA/primary family caregivers' knowledge of patients' values and
      goals for MDM.

      III. Evaluate patients' and MPOA/primary family caregivers' willingness to participate in
      future advance care planning discussions to discuss patients' values and goals important to
      MDM.

      IV. Evaluate predictors of patient subgroups most likely to respond to the social work
      counseling and education clinical process.

      V. Explore aspects of the Spanish language version of the advance care planning engagement
      survey to inform future validation studies.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants (patients and family caregiver/MPOA) complete questionnaires about knowledge,
      attitudes, and beliefs of MPOAD. Participants without a MPOAD watch a 4-minute educational
      video about the importance of the role of MPOA.

      After completion of intervention, participants are followed up at 3 months.

Baseline and changes in MPOA/primary family caregivers' knowledge, attitudes and beliefs about conditions for quality surrogate medical decision-making (MDM), in patients/primary family caregivers' self-efficacy and readiness for MPOA, and in patients/Primary family caregivers' knowledge of patients' values and goals for MDM, will be summarized and compared among the four patient groups: 1) had MPOAD at the consult already, 2) complete MPOAD at the first visit, 3) complete MPOAD after initial social work counselor visit and by 3 months, 4) do not complete MPOAD by 3 months, using Kruskal-Wallis test for continuous variables and either Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test for discrete variables, whenever appropriate. Univariate/multi-covariate logistic regression will be employed to evaluate the effect of potential factors on completion of MPOAD.</description>
