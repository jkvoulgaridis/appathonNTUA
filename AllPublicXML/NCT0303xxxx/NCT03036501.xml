    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-randomized study investigating the excretion balance, PK and
      metabolism of a single oral dose of [14C]-labeled Risdiplam (RO7034067) in healthy male
      participants. This study will assess the characterize mass balance, routes and rates of
      elimination of [14C]-labeled Risdiplam (RO7034067), using conventional analytical methods and
      assess the pharmacokinetics of total drug related [14C]-radioactivity, Risdiplam (RO7034067)
      and its metabolite(s).
