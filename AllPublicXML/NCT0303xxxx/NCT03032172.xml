    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, exploratory, non-comparative, and open-label study to investigate the
      safety, tolerability, PK, and PK/PD relationship of risdiplam in adults, children and infants
      with Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) previously enrolled in Study BP29420 (Moonfish) with the
      splicing modifier RO6885247 or previously treated with nusinersen, olesoxime or AVXS-101.

             months and &gt;= 90 days prior to screening) or 3.) AVXS-101 (provided that the time of
             treatment was &gt;= 12 months prior to screening)

             hydration, nutrition and treatment delivery; 2.) Parent or caregiver of participant is
             willing to consider the use of non-invasive ventilation, as recommended by the
