      The aim of the study is to show that auriculotherapy decreases the number of days with
      painful episodes of migraine and headache after 3 months of treatment

      Prospective, multicenter, controlled and randomized study.

      At the inclusion:

        -  initial assessment of migraine and headache attacks of the last 3 months with the
           migraine/headache/treatment diary;

        -  quality of life assessment (MIDAS questionnaire).

      Patients are randomized in 2 groups (distribution 2/3 AUR+, 1/3 AUR-):

        -  AUR+: experimental group &quot;Auriculotherapy&quot;. Patients benefit from 3 sessions of
           auriculotherapy at one month intervals.

        -  AUR-: control group. Patients do not benefit from auriculotherapy.

      After 3 months, a visit of Algology is carried out :

        -  final assessment of migraine and headache attacks of the last 3 months with the
           migraine/headache/treatment diary;

        -  quality of life assessment (MIDAS questionnaire).
