        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Have been informed of the nature of the study and provided written informed consent,
             prior to initiation of any study activities;

          2. Have an undiagnosed suspicious solid or mostly solid thyroid nodule.;

          3. 18 years of age or older at the time of consent;

             clinical protocol; and,

          5. Have received recommendation for and are scheduled for an ultrasound guided FNAB,
             ultrasound guided core biopsy, excisional biopsy, lobectomy or complete thyroidectomy
             of at least one thyroid nodule.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Are prisoners;

          2. Have a condition or impediment (i.e., insect bites, poison ivy, open sores, chafing of
             the skin, scar, tattoos, moles, etc.); that could interfere with the intended field of
             view (within one probe length or 4 cm of the nodule),

          3. Previous or on-going radioactive iodine treatment.

          4. Nodule to be biopsied is greater than 3.0 cm in maximum diameter;

          5. Is pregnant;

          6. Have an acute or a chronic hematoma and/or acute ecchymosis of the thyroid;

          7. Is experiencing photo-toxicity or photo-sensitivity or is undergoing treatment for a
             photo-sensitive condition such as porphyria or lupus erythematosus;

          8. Patient has received chemotherapy for any type of cancer within 90 days from date of
             screening CDU;

          9. Have had previous image guided FNAB or surgical biopsy of the target nodule of
             interest within the 45 days of baseline Imagio Scan;

         10. Patient has participated in a clinical study of an investigational drug or device
             within 3 months prior to screening CDU that may have an impact on clinical outcomes;
             and,

         11. Patient has previously participated in this study.
