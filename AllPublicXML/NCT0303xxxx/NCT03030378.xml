      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of pembrolizumab and recombinant
      interleukin-12 in treating patients with solid tumors. Immunotherapy with monoclonal
      antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and
      may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Recombinant interleukin-12
      may kill tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor and by stimulating white blood cells
      to kill tumor cells. Giving pembrolizumab and recombinant interleukin-12 may work better than
      giving pembrolizumab alone in treating patients with solid tumors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of
      edodekin alfa (recombinant human interleukin [rhIL]-12) in combination with MK-3475
      (pembrolizumab).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the safety of the regimen by continuously monitoring adverse events that will be
      documented utilizing Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v).5.0.

      II. Evaluate the overall response rate (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST]
      v.1.1) and the progression free survival of patients enrolled on the study.

      III. Measure CD8+ T cell infiltration by immunohistochemistry in tumor biopsies obtained at
      baseline, after one week of rhIL-12 and after 2 cycles of MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) in
      combination with rhIL-12.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Conduct exploratory translational laboratory correlative studies utilizing banked
      biospecimens (tumor and blood) obtained at baseline and during therapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of recombinant interleukin-12.

      Patients receive recombinant interleukin-12 subcutaneously (SC) on days 2, 5, 9, and 12 and
      pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 8 of cycle 1 and day 1 of subsequent
      cycles. Treatment continues for 28 days for cycle 1 and repeats every 21 days for subsequent
      cycles for up to 8 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patient then receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21
      days for up to 8 additional cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 weeks for 2 year and
      then every 24 weeks for up to 5 years.

          -  Patients with known active and untreated brain metastases should be excluded from this
             clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop
             progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic
             and other adverse events

          -  Patients with primary brain tumors or carcinomatous meningitis should also be excluded

          -  Patients with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are
             stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least 4 weeks prior to the
             first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have returned to baseline),

             or a documented history of clinically severe autoimmune disease, or a syndrome that
             requires systemic steroids or immunosuppressive agents; patients with vitiligo or
             resolved childhood asthma/atopy would be an exception to this rule; patients that
             require intermittent use of bronchodilators or local steroid injections would not be
             excluded from the study; patients with hypothyroidism stable on hormone replacement or
             Sjogren's syndrome will not be excluded from the study

          -  Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the patient's
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the patient to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator

          -  Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial

          -  Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, anti-CD137, or
             anti-CTLA-4 antibody (including ipilimumab or any other antibody or drug specifically
             targeting T-cell co-stimulation or checkpoint pathways)

          -  Patients on any systemic corticosteroid therapy within one week before the planned
             date for first dose on study would not be eligible; exception: patients on physiologic
             replacement doses of corticosteroids are permitted

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, interstitial lung disease or active, non-infectious pneumonitis,
             symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or
             psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
             requirements

          -  Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit
             through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment; pregnant women are excluded
             from this study because MK-3475 is an agent with the potential for teratogenic or
             abortifacient effects; because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with MK-3475,
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with MK-3475; these
             potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study; MK-3475 may have
             adverse effects on a fetus in utero; furthermore, it is not known if MK-3475 has
             transient adverse effects on the composition of sperm

          -  Men and non-pregnant, non-breast-feeding women may be enrolled if they are willing to
             use 2 methods of birth control or are considered highly unlikely to conceive; highly
             unlikely to conceive is defined as 1) surgically sterilized, or 2) postmenopausal (a
             woman who is &gt;= 45 years of age and has not had menses for greater than 2 years will
             be considered postmenopausal), or 3) not heterosexually active for the duration of the
             study; the two birth control methods can be barrier method or a barrier method plus a
             hormonal method to prevent pregnancy; patients should start using birth control from
             study visit 1 throughout the study period up to 120 days after the last dose of study
             therapy; the following are considered adequate barrier methods of contraception:
             diaphragm, condom (by the partner), copper intrauterine device, sponge, or spermicide;
             appropriate hormonal contraceptives will include any registered and marketed
             contraceptive agent that contains an estrogen and/or a progestational agent (including
             oral, subcutaneous, intrauterine, or intramuscular agents)

               -  Patients should be informed that taking the study medication may involve unknown
                  risks to the fetus (unborn baby) if pregnancy were to occur during the study; in
                  order to participate in the study they must adhere to the contraception
                  requirement (described above) for the duration of the study and during the
                  follow-up period of pregnancy and lactation; if there is any question that a
                  patient will not reliably comply with the requirements for contraception, that
                  patient should not be entered into the study

               -  Pregnancy: If a patient inadvertently becomes pregnant while on treatment with
                  MK-3475, the patient will immediately be removed from the study; the site will
                  contact the patient at least monthly and document the patient's status until the
                  pregnancy has been completed or terminated; the outcome of the pregnancy will be
                  reported without delay and within 24 hours if the outcome is a serious adverse
                  experience (e.g., death, abortion, congenital anomaly, or other disabling or
                  life-threatening complication to the mother or newborn); the study investigator
                  will make every effort to obtain permission to follow the outcome of the
                  pregnancy and report the condition of the fetus or newborn; if a male patient
                  impregnates his female partner the study personnel at the site must be informed
                  immediately and the pregnancy reported and followed

               -  It is unknown whether MK-3475 is excreted in human milk. Since many drugs are
                  excreted in human milk, and because of the potential for serious adverse
                  reactions in the nursing infant, patients who are breast-feeding are not eligible
                  for enrollment

          -  Has known active hepatitis B (e.g., hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] reactive) or
             hepatitis C (e.g., hepatitis C virus [HCV] ribonucleic acid [RNA] [qualitative] is
             detected)

          -  Has received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment

          -  Patient would not be eligible if he/she has known psychiatric or substance abuse
             disorders that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the trial
