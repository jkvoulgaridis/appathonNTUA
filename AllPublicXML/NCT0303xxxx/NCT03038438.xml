        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has at least one of the following clinical manifestations (i.e. symptoms
             and/or signs) of venous disease in lower extremity:

          -  CEAP score ≥ 3

          -  Venous Clinical Severity Score pain score (VCSS) ≥2

          -  Suspected deep vein thrombosis (DVT);

          -  Patient is willing and capable of complying with specified follow-up evaluations at
             the specified times;

          -  Patient has been informed of the nature of the study, agrees to its provisions and has
             provided written informed consent, approved by the appropriate Ethics Board.

          -  diagnosis of non-malignant venous obstruction within the common iliac, external iliac,
             and/or common femoral vein. The proximal point of the obstruction may extend to the
             iliac venous confluence of the inferior vena cava and the distal point may be at or
             above the deep femoral vein. Diagnosis must be made based on objective imaging by
             using venography and/or intravascular ultrasound (IVUS);

          -  Patient has an obstructive lesion defined as:

             i. Occluded, or ii. ≥50% in diameter reduction on venography or IVUS, or iii. ≥50%
             area reduction on IVUS

          -  Acute DVT patients should be treated with the Abre stent within 14 days after onset of
             symptoms. Patients with acute DVT must first undergo successful treatment of acute
             thrombus by catheter based techniques; successful treatment is defined as 30% or less
             residual thrombus by venogram, as determined by physician, no bleeding, no symptomatic
             pulmonary embolism (confirmed by imaging), and no renal compromise.

          -  Target vessel can accommodate a 9 French Sheath, from insertion site to target
             segment;

          -  Exchangeable guidewire must cross target lesion(s) with successful predilation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient with DVT in the target limb of which the onset of symptoms is between 15 days
             and 6 months prior to planned treatment or patient has an acute DVT anywhere else than
             in the target vessel;

          -  Patient has peripheral arterial disease causing symptoms in target limb;

          -  Patient is pregnant, female patients of child-bearing potential must have a negative
             pregnancy test done within 7 days prior to the index procedure;

          -  Patient has a known or suspected systemic infection at the time of the index
             procedure;

             days following index procedure, or a contralateral iliofemoral lesion requiring
             planned treatment within 12 months;

          -  Patient requires femoral endovenectomy and patch venoplasty, greater saphenous vein
             ablation, and/or small saphenous vein stripping during the index procedure;

          -  Patient has an active vasculitic inflammatory disorder (e.g. Behcet disease)
             predisposing the patient to thrombosis and requiring systemic corticosteroid therapy;

          -  Patient has impaired renal function (GFR &lt; 30) or is on dialysis;

          -  Patient has a platelet count &lt; 50,000 cells/mm3 or &gt; 1,000,000 cells/mm3 and/or a

          -  Patient has a history of bleeding diathesis or either a history or presence of heparin
             induced thrombocytopenia antibodies;

          -  Patient has a known hypersensitivity or contraindication to antiplatelets or
             anticoagulation, nitinol, or a contrast sensitivity that cannot be adequately
             pre-medicated;

          -  Patient has presence of other severe co-morbid conditions, which in the investigator's
             opinion may interfere with the patient's compliance with study visits and procedures,
             or may confound interpretation of study data (e.g. congestive heart failure Class III
             and IV, non-ambulatory patients, severe hepatic dysfunction, life expectancy &lt; 1
             year);

          -  Patient belongs to a vulnerable population per investigator's judgment or patient has
             any kind of disorder that compromises his/her ability to give written informed consent

             themselves;

          -  Patient is currently participating in another investigational drug or device study or
             observational competitive study.

          -  Patient has a vena cava obstruction or lesion extending into the inferior vena cava
             (IVC), or the presence of bilateral iliofemoral venous lesions requiring planned
             treatment within 12 months;

          -  Patient has significant venous bleeding, arterial dissection or other injury requiring
             additional percutaneous or surgical intervention prior to enrollment;

          -  Patient has a previously placed stent in the ipsilateral venous vasculature;

          -  Patient has disease that precludes safe advancement of the venous stent to the target
             lesion(s)
