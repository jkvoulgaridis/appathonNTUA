  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized-withdrawal, multicenter study of the
      efficacy and safety of JZP-258.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be transitioned to JZP-258 based on their treatment status at study entry. All
      subjects will begin JZP-258 treatment at the beginning of this period and continue through
      Week 12. They will be treated with JZP-258 alone for the final two weeks of this 12-week
      period. Once the JZP-258 dose has been optimized per the Investigator's judgment, these
      subjects may enter the 2-week Stable-Dose Period with that dose. Subjects are eligible to
      enter the Double-Blind Randomized-Withdrawal Period if the dose of JZP-258 remains unchanged
      during the Stable-Dose Period and, in the judgment of the Investigator, no clinically
      significant worsening in narcolepsy symptoms or clinically significant adverse events due to
      JZP-258 treatment have occurred. Subjects will return for a Safety Follow-up visit 2 weeks
      after the Double-Blind Randomized-Withdrawal Period. Subjects who complete the double-blind
      treatment period during the Main Study are eligible to enter a 24-week Open-Label Extension.
      During this period subjects will receive open label JZP-258. Subjects will return for a
      Safety Follow-up visit 2 weeks after the Open-Label Extension Period.

    <measure>The Change in Weekly Number of Cataplexy Attacks</measure>
    <time_frame>From the 2 weeks of the open-label Stable Dose Period to the 2 weeks of the Double Blind Randomized- Withdrawal Period)</time_frame>
    <description>The change in the weekly number of cataplexy attacks from the 2 weeks of the Stable-Dose Period to the 2 weeks of the Double-Blind Randomized-Withdrawal Period will be assessed. For subjects with at least one day of cataplexy attack data, the weekly number of cataplexy attacks will be the average number of daily attacks from days with nonmissing data within the 2 week period, and then multiplied by 7.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Change in the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>From the end of the Stable Dose Period to the end of the Double Blind Randomized- Withdrawal Period</time_frame>
    <description>The ESS provides a measure of a person's general level of daytime sleepiness, or their average sleep propensity in daily life.The ESS is a self-administered questionnaire with 8 questions asking the subject how likely they would be to doze off or fall asleep in different situations. Responses range from 0 = would never doze to 3 = high chance of dozing. Subjects will be asked to complete the ESS with regard to the level of sleepiness they experienced over the past 7 days at end of the Stable-Dose Period (Visit 15) and at the end of the Double-Blind Randomized-Withdrawal Period (Visit 16) or Early Termination from the Double-Blind Period.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female subjects between 18 and 70 years of age, inclusive.

          2. Have a primary diagnosis of narcolepsy with cataplexy that meets ICSD-3 criteria or
             DSM-5 criteria, and currently untreated or treated with or without anticataplectics.

          3. If applicable, treated with a stimulant or alerting agent at unchanged doses for at
             least 2 months prior to dosing or not treated with a stimulant or alerting agent.

          4. Willing and able to comply with the study design schedule and other requirements.

          5. Willing and able to provide written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Narcolepsy secondary to another medical condition (e.g., CNS injury or lesion)

          2. History or presence of any unstable or clinically significant medical condition,
             behavioral or psychiatric disorder (including active suicidal ideation), or history or
             presence of another neurological disorder or surgical history that might affect the
             subject's safety and/or interfere with the conduct of the study in the opinion of the
             Investigator.

          3. Treatment with any central nervous system sedating agents, including but not limited
             to benzodiazepines, nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytics/ hypnotics/sedatives, neuroleptics,
             opioids, barbiturates, phenytoin, ethosuximide, or MCT inhibitors, e.g. diclofenac,
             valproate, ibuprofen, within 2 weeks prior to enrollment (discontinuation for the
             purpose of study enrollment is permitted only if considered safe by the Investigator
             and approved by the Medical Monitor).

          4. Treatment with an antidepressant for cataplexy, if the withdrawal of the
             antidepressant during cross-titration with JZP-258 might be unsafe due to prior
             history of depression.

          5. Unsafe for the subject to receive placebo treatment for 2 weeks, in the opinion of the
             Investigator.
