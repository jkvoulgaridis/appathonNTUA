  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The focus of this study is to evaluate how risk factors like age, gender, body mass index,
      smoking, alcohol consumption, etc. can influence immune response when subjects are vaccinated
      with GSK Biologicals' combined hepatitis A/hepatitis B vaccine or monovalent hepatitis A and
      B vaccines (from GSK Biologicals' or different manufacturers). The Protocol Posting has been
      updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep 2007.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will also evaluate the persistence of hepatitis A and hepatitis B antibodies at
      months 12, 24 and 36 after the first dose of primary vaccination course.

The reference seropositivity cut-off values for anti-HAV and anti-HBs antibodies were equal to or above (≥) 15 mIU/mL and ≥ 3.3 mIU/mL, respectively. The antibody concentrations were stratified by gender (females and males).</description>
          <population>The analysis was performed on the ATP cohort for immunogenicity, which included all subjects who met all eligibility criteria and for whom data concerning immunogenicity endpoint measures were available.</population>

        <description>Anti-HAV and anti-HBs antibody concentrations are presented as geometric mean concentrations (GMCs), expressed in milli International Units per milliliter (mIU/mL). The reference seropositivity cut-off values for anti-HAV and anti-HBs antibodies were equal to or above (≥) 15 mIU/mL and ≥ 3.3 mIU/mL, respectively. The antibody concentrations were stratified by BMI as follows: healthy, overweight and obese.</description>
