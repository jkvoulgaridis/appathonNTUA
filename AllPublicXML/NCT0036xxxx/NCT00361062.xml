  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SSRIs are the first line of therapy for anxiety and depressive disorders and for many other
      clinical diagnoses. One of the most disturbing side effects that is observed is a tendency
      towards aggressiveness among patients receiving medications from this group, mainly during
      the first month of therapy. Aggressive behavior tends to occur in some individuals but not in
      others. In some sub-groups of people, personality and character traits might make a person
      more prone to aggressive behavior.

      In this study the investigators try to estimate the tendency towards aggressive behavior in
      patients prescribed to a medication from the SSRI group. By using a comparative computer
      simulation they hope to be able to detect delicate changes and to maybe get some clues of the
      personalities prone to aggressive behavior in the future.

      Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) became the first line therapy for anxiety and
      depressive disorders and for many other clinical diagnoses. One of the most disturbing side
      effects that is observed is a tendency towards aggressiveness among patients receiving
      medications from this group, mainly during the first (one month) period of therapy.
      Aggressive behavior tends to occur in some individuals but not in others. Until now most of
      the cases and reports in the literature demonstrate the extreme events of aggressive
      behavior. These personality or any other character traits that are more prone to develop
      aggressiveness have not been studied and it is not clear if this side effect manifests itself
      just in the extreme rare cases or if it is a more common phenomenon that occurs in a wider
      group of people.

      In this study we try to estimate the tendency towards aggressive behavior of patients
      prescribed to a medication of the SSRI group. By using a comparative computer simulation we
      hope to be able to detect more delicate changes and maybe to get some clues of the
      personalities prone to aggressive behavior in the future.
