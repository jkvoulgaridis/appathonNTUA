      The purpose of this study is to test the safety, efficacy and mechanism of action of
      subgenual cingulate (Cg25) deep brain stimulation (DBS) for major depression in patients who
      have not responded to prior antidepressant treatments. Participation in the study will
      continue for ten years or until the device receives FDA approval for depression. Forty (40)
      patients will be enrolled in this study.

    <textblock>
      Major Depression is one of the most common and costly of all psychiatric disorders. While
      depression can be effectively treated in the majority of patients by either medication or
      some form of evidence-based psychotherapy, up to 20% of patients fail to respond to standard
      interventions. For these patients, trial-and-error combinations of multiple medications and
      electroconvulsive therapy are often required. For patients who remain severely depressed
      despite these aggressive approaches, new strategies are needed.

      Converging clinical, biochemical, neuroimaging, and post-mortem data suggest depression is
      unlikely to be a disease of a single brain region or neurotransmitter system. Rather, it is
      now generally viewed as a systems-level disorder affecting integrated pathways linking select
      cortical, subcortical and limbic sites and their related neurotransmitter and molecular
      mediators. Treatments for depression can be viewed within a limbic-cortical system framework,
      where different modes of treatment modulate specific regional targets, resulting in a variety
      of complementary, adaptive chemical and molecular changes that re-establish a normal mood
      state. Functional neuroimaging studies have played a critical role in characterizing these
      limbic-cortical pathways. Previous studies have demonstrated consistent involvement of the
      subgenual cingulate (Cg25) in both acute sadness and antidepressant treatment effects,
      suggesting a critical role for this region in modulating negative mood states.

      This study will test whether high frequency deep brain stimulation of the subgenual cingulate
      white matter (Cg25-DBS) is a safe and efficacious antidepressant treatment in forty patients
      with treatment resistant depression, and to investigate potential mechanisms of action of
      this intervention.

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 24 post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17) contains 17 items that are scored from 0 to 2, 3, or 4, where 0 is lack of difficulty and the highest number for an item is the most extreme difficulty. Total scores range from 0 to 53 and higher scores indicate greater depression. For this study, a response to treatment will be defined as a decrease in the HDRS-17 score of 50% or greater from the average pre-surgical baseline.</description>

    <description>The deep brain stimulation system (consisting of a lead, extension wire, and implanted pulse generator) will be surgically implanted to stimulate the targeted area of the brain. Stimulation will be turned off for 4 weeks following implantation, then participants will use brain stimulation for 6 months. Participants will also take part in Behavioral Activation therapy during the 6 months of active stimulation. Participants will be followed for 10 years, or until the DBS device has been FDA approved, with adjustments made to the stimulator and medications as necessary.</description>

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Ability to provide written informed consent.

          -  Current Major Depressive Episode (MDE), secondary to either Major Depressive Disorder
             or Bipolar Disorder (I, II or NOS), diagnosed by structured clinical interview for
             Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV-text revision (DSM-IV-TR).

          -  Current MDE at least two years duration OR a history of more than 4 lifetime
             depressive episodes.

          -  Minimum score at study entry of 20 on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale
             (HDRS-17).

             pre-surgical evaluations during the four weeks prior to surgery) and an average
             pre-operative HDRS-17 score no more than 30% lower than the baseline screening HDRS-17
             score.

          -  A maximum Global Assessment of Functioning of 50.

          -  Treatment-resistant depression defined as:

        <title>Change in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-17 Score</title>
        <description>The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17) contains 17 items that are scored from 0 to 2, 3, or 4, where 0 is lack of difficulty and the highest number for an item is the most extreme difficulty. Total scores range from 0 to 53 and higher scores indicate greater depression. For this study, a response to treatment will be defined as a decrease in the HDRS-17 score of 50% or greater from the average pre-surgical baseline.</description>

            <description>Participants with treatment resistant depression will have a device implanted for deep brain stimulation.
Deep Brain Stimulation: The deep brain stimulation system (consisting of a lead, extension wire, and implanted pulse generator) will be surgically implanted to stimulate the targeted area of the brain. Stimulation will be turned off for 4 weeks following implantation, then participants will use brain stimulation for 6 months. Participants will also take part in Behavioral Activation therapy during the 6 months of active stimulation. Participants will be followed for 10 years, or until the DBS device has been FDA approved, with adjustments made to the stimulator and medications as necessary.</description>
