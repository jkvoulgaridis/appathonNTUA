  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Little is known about the causes and degree of cognitive dysfunction in patients with Chronic
      Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), especially their driving abilities. The purpose of the
      study is to examine the cognitive skills of patients with COPD by using a driving simulator
      and to examine correlations to factors that may predict cognitive dysfunction in these
      patients.
