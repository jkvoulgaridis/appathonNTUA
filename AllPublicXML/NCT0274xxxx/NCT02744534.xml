  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if using Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan and
      transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) guided biopsy together (creating a 3-dimensional ultrasound)
      will detect prostate cancer more accurately than the standard 2-dimensional approach which
      uses only the TRUS to guide the biopsy.

      The objective of the proposed study is to evaluate a molecular image directed,
      three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound guided biopsy system in human patients. Prior studies have
      shown that Positron Emission Tomography (PET)/Computed Tomography (CT) imaging with the PET
      molecular imaging agent, a synthetic amino acid, anti-1-amino-3-[18F]fluorocyclobutane-1-
      carboxylic acid (FACBC), is more sensitive than the FDA-approved prostate specific membrane
      antigen single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) radiotracer in prostate cancer
      detection. FACBC images showed higher focal uptake in tumor foci than in normal prostate and
      thus could be ideal information to direct targeted biopsy of the prostate. This targeted
      biopsy system has a unique feature that PET/CT images can be registered with 3D ultrasound
      images, as a result, a suspicious PET lesion is superimposed over the real-time ultrasound
      data; and the fused image is then used to direct biopsy needles to tumor targets.

      The hypothesis of the study is that PET/ultrasound fusion targeted biopsy can detect more
      cancer per core than the standard 12-core TRUS guided biopsy.

      The specific aims include:

        1. To perform PET/CT directed, 3D ultrasound-guided biopsy and determine if fusion targeted
           biopsy can detect more cancers than 2D transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided biopsy

        2. To develop the workflow for performing deformable registration and fusion of PET/CT and
           3D ultrasound images of human patients

      Thirty six patients, who have suspicion of recurrent prostate cancer after definitive therapy
      such as radiotherapy, will be recruited into this study. At least half of the patients will
      have positive imaging findings and will undergo 2D TRUS-guided biopsy as well as
      PET/ultrasound fusion biopsy. The proposed study will be the first-in-human trial that uses
      PET/CT imaging to direct 3D ultrasound-guided biopsy of the prostate. The multimodality
      imaging approach will combine the high sensitivity from PET and real-time information from
      ultrasound for improved cancer detection.

    <description>One hour prior to scanning, participants will drink one glass (450 ml) of oral contrast to allow for better pictures of abdomen and pelvic organs. The participants will have their temperature taken before and after the injection of the FACBC. Blood pressure and pulse will be taken every 15 minutes during the PET scan.
Participants will lie on a scanning bed and the bed will move slowly through the PET/CT scanner. This portion usually takes about one minute. Following this the FACBC will by administered by an intravenous (IV) catheter and the PET scan portion of the exam will begin. The table moves slowly through the scanner and many sets of PET-CT images are produced. When the imaging is complete, the scanner will send the results to a computer. The computer then generates a number of images that will be reviewed by a specially trained radiologist.</description>

    <intervention_name>Three-dimensional ultrasound-guided biopsy</intervention_name>
    <description>A lubricated rectal probe will be inserted and a local anesthetic to numb the prostate will be administered. The ultrasound probe allows visualization of the prostate in two-dimensional (2D) images. The probe connects to a computer that will link to the FACBC PET-CT scan results that the participant has already had performed. These combined images will provide a three-dimensional (3D) image from the FACBC PET-CT scan previously obtained as well as real-time, 2D ultrasound images, resulting in an improved visualization tool to target the biopsy needle to a suspicious lesion.
The needle tip position for each biopsy sample will be recorded on the real-time ultrasound images; this information allows the physician to either re-biopsy the same area for a follow-up examination or not to re-biopsy the same region if the original biopsy was negative.
This biopsy process is estimated to take about 10 minutes.</description>

    <description>A lubricated ultrasound probe of about 2.5 cm in diameter is gently inserted into the rectum and a local anesthetic to numb the prostate is administered. The ultrasound probe allows visualization of the prostate in two-dimensional (2D) images and allows for the placement of a biopsy needle that collects samples of the prostate. Usually, a total of 12 biopsy specimens are collected. The procedure takes about 20 minutes. This TRUS-guided biopsy is considered as the standard method for prostate cancer diagnosis.</description>

      <time_frame>The time period for collecting adverse events was from the the time of the FACBC PET-CT scan until 7 days after the scan. Since 95% of the ligand used during the scan is eliminated within 7 days, any events beyond 7 days after the scan were not considered to be adverse events due to study procedures.</time_frame>
      <desc>This study only collected adverse events that were a significant shift from baseline and which could be attributed to the radiotracer injection and not the patient’s prior medical condition. No adverse events due to the study procedures were anticipated.</desc>
