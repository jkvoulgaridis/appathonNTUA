  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and activity of BPX-601 CAR-T cells in
      participants with previously treated advanced solid tumors (pancreatic, stomach, or prostate)
      expressing high levels of prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA). Participants' T cells are
      modified to recognize and target the PSCA tumor marker on cancer cells.

      The goal of this study is to characterize the feasibility, safety, and clinical activity of
      PSCA-specific CAR-T cells, BPX-601, administered with rimiducid to subjects with previously
      treated, PSCA-positive advanced solid tumors (pancreatic, stomach, or prostate). BPX-601
      CAR-T cells are genetically engineered to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) to target
      the PSCA antigen and a rimiducid-inducible signaling domain which functions as a molecular
      &quot;go-switch&quot; to enhance activation and proliferation.

      Phase 1: Cell dose escalation to identify the ideal safe dose of BPX-601 T cells (escalating
      doses from 1.25 x 10^6 cells/kg up to 5.0 x 10^6 cells/kg to be explored) administered with
      single or repeat doses of rimiducid (fixed dose of 0.4 mg/kg per infusion).

      Phase 2: Indication-specific dose expansion to assess the safety, pharmacodynamics (including
      BPX-601 T cell persistence), and clinical activity at the recommended dose identified in
      Phase 1 in various PSCA-expressing solid tumors.
