    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK)
      of TAK-041:

        1. Following oral single and multiple doses in healthy participants.

        2. As add -on therapy to antipsychotics in stable schizophrenia participants.

        3. To determine the oral bioavailability of the TAK-041 tablet formulation compared to the
           oral suspension formulation in the fasted state.

        4. To assess the effect of food on the PK of TAK-041 in healthy participants.

    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-041. TAK-041 is being tested to evaluate
      its safety, tolerability, and PK of single and multiple doses in healthy participants and as
      add-on therapy to antipsychotics in participants with stable schizophrenia. This study will
      also assess the oral bioavailability in healthy participants administered with tablet
      formulation compared to oral suspension formulation in fasted state, and effect of high-fat,
      high-calorie meal on the PK of single dose of TAK-041 tablet formulation.

      The study will enroll approximately 114 participants. The study is composed of 4 parts. Part
      1 (single-rising dose [SRD], alternating panel design and a sequential panel design), Part 2
      (multiple-rising dose [MRD], sequential panel design), Part 3 (open label parallel design),
      and Part 4 (single dose cohort).

      Part 1 consists of 5 cohorts, participants in Cohorts 1 and 2 will be randomly assigned (by
      chance, like flipping a coin) to treatment sequences of 2 periods and for Cohorts 3 to 5
      participants will be assigned to a single dose sequential-panel:

        -  TAK-041 5-160 mg

        -  Placebo (inactive) - this is a similar formulation that looks like the study drug but
           has no active ingredient.

      Part 2 consists of 4 cohorts, participants will be randomly assigned to one of the two
      treatments:

        -  TAK-041

        -  Placebo Dose levels for Part 2 cohort 1 will be based on emerging safety/tolerability
           and PK data from Part 1. The dose levels for Part 2 Cohorts 2 onwards will be based on
           emerging safety/tolerability and available PK data from Part 1 and from preceding
           cohorts in Part 2.

      Part 3 consists of 2 cohorts, participants will be randomly assigned to one of the two
      treatments under fasted state or fed state:

        -  TAK-041 40 mg tablet (Fasted state)

        -  TAK-041 40 mg tablet (Fed state)

      Part 4 consists of 1 cohort, participants will be randomly assigned to one of the two
      treatments:

        -  TAK-041

        -  Placebo The dose levels for Part 4 will be based upon the emerging safety/tolerability
           and PK data of same dose in healthy participants from Part 2.

      This single center trial will be conducted in the United States. Participants will remain
      confined to the study site from check-in (Day -1) through Days 5 of each period in Part 1, on
      Days -2 to 3, Days 7 to 10, Days 14 to 17, Day 21 to 24 in Part 2, on Days 1 to 3 in Part 3,
      and on Days -2 to 3, Days 7 to 10, Days 14 to 17, Days 21 to 24 in Part 4. A final visit that
      completes the study will occur 12 to 16 days after the last safety and PK follow-up visit in
      Part 1, 2 and 4, and 18 days after dosing in Part 3.

             hematopoietic disease, renal dysfunction, metabolic or endocrine dysfunction, serious
             allergy, asthma, hypoxemia, hypertension, seizures, or allergic skin rash. There is
             any finding in the participant's medical history, physical examination, or safety
             laboratory test results (including elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP), elevated
             bilirubin, elevated GGT, or elevated 5'-nucleotidase) that in the judgment of the
             principal investigator represents a reasonable suspicion of a disease that would
             contraindicate taking TAK-041, or that might interfere with the conduct of the study.
             This includes, but is not limited to, peptic ulcer disease, cholestasis, seizure
             disorders, and cardiac arrhythmias.

         10. The participant has current or recent (within 6 months) gastrointestinal disease that
             would be expected to influence the absorption of drugs (that is, a history of
             malabsorption, esophageal reflux, peptic ulcer disease, erosive esophagitis, frequent
             [more than once per week] occurrence of heartburn, or any surgical intervention).

             cigarettes, pipes, cigars, chewing tobacco, nicotine patch or nicotine gum) within 21
             days prior to Check-in on Day -1. Cotinine test is positive at Screening or Day -1.

         14. The participant has poor peripheral venous access.

         15. Had a transfusion of any blood product within 30 days prior to Day 1.

         16. Participant has a Screening or Check-in abnormal (clinically significant)
             electrocardiogram (ECG). Entry of any participant with an abnormal (not clinically
             significant) ECG must be approved, and documented by signature of the principal
             investigator or a medically qualified sub-investigator.

         17. The participant has a sustained resting heart rate outside the range 40 to 100 beats
             per minute (bpm), confirmed on repeat testing within a maximum of 30 minutes, at
             Screening or Check-in.

         18. The participant has a QT interval with Fridericia correction method (QTcF) &gt;450
             millisecond (ms) or PR outside the range 120 to 220 ms, confirmed on repeat testing
             within a maximum of 30 minutes, at the Screening Visit or Check-in.

         19. The participant has abnormal Screening or Check-in laboratory values (&gt; upper limit of
             normal [ULN] for the respective serum chemistries) of alanine transaminase (ALT),
             aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin (TBILI), ALP, gamma-glutamyl
             transpeptidase (GGT), 5'nucleotidase (Screening only) and/or abnormal urine
             osmolality, confirmed upon repeat testing.

         20. The participant has a clinically significant history of head injury or trauma
             associated with loss of consciousness for &gt;15 minutes.

         21. Is considered by the investigator to be at an imminent risk of suicide injury to self,
             other, property, or participants who within the past year prior to Screening have
             attempted suicide. Participants having positive answer on item 4 or 5 on Columbia
             Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) (based on the past year) prior to randomization
             are excluded.

         22. The participant has a history of significant skin reactions (hypersensitivity) to
             adhesives, metals or plastic; this criterion applies only to participants
             participating in the study of the two wearable digital devices.

        Participants with schizophrenia only:

          1. Has an undetectable level of baseline antipsychotic medication at Screening.

          2. Has a lifetime diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder; a lifetime diagnosis of bipolar
             disorder; or a lifetime diagnosis of obsessive compulsive disorder based on the Mini
             International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) combined with the general psychiatric
             evaluation. As an exception, participants with a historical prior lifetime diagnosis
             of schizoaffective disorder may be enrolled in the study with sponsor or designee
             approval provided that the principal investigator can attest that the participant's
             overall history and current clinical presentation and history is most consistent with
             schizophrenia, not schizoaffective disorder.

          3. Has a recent (within the last 6 months) diagnosis of panic disorder, depressive
             episode, or other comorbid psychiatric conditions requiring clinical attention based

          4. Has a history of drug abuse (defined as any illicit drug use) or a history of alcohol
             abuse (defined as 4 or more alcoholic beverages per day) within 1 year prior to the
             Screening Visit or is unwilling to agree to abstain from alcohol and drugs throughout
             the study.

          5. Has a diagnosis of substance use disorder (with the exception of nicotine dependence)
             within the preceding 6 months based on the MINI for DSM-5 and the general psychiatric
             evaluation.

          6. Has evidence or history of current clinically significant cardiovascular disease,
             including uncontrolled hypertension (standing or supine diastolic blood pressure &gt;90
             millimeter of mercury (mm Hg) and/or standing or supine systolic blood pressure &gt;145
             mm Hg, with or without treatment), symptomatic ischemic heart disease, uncompensated
             heart failure or recent (past 12 months) acute myocardial infarction or bypass
             surgery. Controlled essential hypertension, non-clinically significant sinus
             bradycardia and sinus tachycardia will not be considered significant medical illnesses
             and would not exclude a participant from the study. Other well-controlled medical
             illnesses may be permitted that do not increase hepatic risks or other safety risks to
             the participant's participation in the judgement of the investigator in consultation
             with the sponsor or designee.

          7. Has evidence of clinically significant extrapyramidal symptoms as measured by a
             Simson-Angus Scale (SAS) score &gt;6.

             (CDSS) score &gt;9.

          9. Has received TAK-041 in a previous clinical study; or has previously or is currently
             participating in this study; has received treatment with other experimental therapies
             within the preceding 60 days or &lt;5 half-lives prior to randomization, whichever is
             longer; has participated in 2 or more clinical studies within 12 months prior to
             Screening; or has participated in a clinical study for a psychiatric condition that is
             exclusionary per this protocol.
