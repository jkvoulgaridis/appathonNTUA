  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this trial, monoclonal anti-Disialoganglioside GD2 (GD2) antibody ch14.18/CHO will be
      assessed for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma. The
      antibody is used as a single agent applied in a new treatment schedule associated with less
      side effects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Treatment with ch14.18 antibody has demonstrated efficacy in patients with neuroblastoma.
      However the treatment is associated with an on target side effect, i.e. neuropathic pain.
      This requires coadministration of intravenous morphine.

      In this clinical Trial we will evaluate a less toxic treatment regimen consisting of
      continuous longterm Infusion (LTI) of ch14.18/CHO administered at a dose of 10 mg/m2/day over
      10 days (total dose 100 mg/m2/cycle). Patients may receive up to five 35-day cycles in
      absence of signs of progression.
