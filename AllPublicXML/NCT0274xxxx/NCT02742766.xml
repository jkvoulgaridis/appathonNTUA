  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a phase I, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind (sponsor unblind),
      three part study. The primary objective of the study is to characterize the safety, and
      tolerability of GSK3008356 single dose, 14 daily repeat doses in healthy subjects and 28
      daily repeat doses in obese subjects. The study has three parts. Part 1, will be a single and
      multiple-dose, dose-rising study in healthy subjects. Part 2, will be a 14-day, repeat-dose,
      dose-rising study in healthy subjects, and part 3 will be a 28-day, repeat-dose study in
      obese subjects. For Parts 1 and 2, data from prior doses cohorts will be available prior to
      escalation decisions. Data from Parts 1 and 2 will be available prior to initiation of the
      three parallel cohorts in Part 3. A dose escalation meeting will be held to review these data
      and document the decision to proceed as planned or make any alterations in dosing, if
      indicated. Part 1, Part 2 and Part 3 study will have approximately 88, 24 and 30 subjects,
      respectively.

    <time_frame>Up to Day 8</time_frame>
    <description>A complete physical examination included assessment of the cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, dermatologic and neurological systems, height, and weight.

    <measure>Part 1: Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AE) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 8</time_frame>
    <description>AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. For marketed medicinal products, this also includes failure to produce expected benefits (i.e., lack of efficacy), abuse or misuse. SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is medically significant or is associated with liver injury and impaired liver function.</description>

        <description>AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. For marketed medicinal products, this also includes failure to produce expected benefits (i.e., lack of efficacy), abuse or misuse. SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is medically significant or is associated with liver injury and impaired liver function.</description>

        <description>AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. For marketed medicinal products, this also includes failure to produce expected benefits (i.e., lack of efficacy), abuse or misuse. SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is medically significant or is associated with liver injury and impaired liver function.</description>

        <description>Preliminary pharmacodynamics of GSK3008356 was evaluated by assessing the postprandial triglyceride levels at the indicated time points. Corrected triglyceride value (Day 1) at each nominal sampling time point was defined as the corresponding post dose value by adding the following value: Part 1 Day 1 Correction: (Day -1 (1 hour + 2 hour)/2) - (Day 1 (1 hour + 2 hour)/2). Mean triglyceride levels are presented.</description>

          <title>Part 1: Postprandial Triglyceride Levels Following a Single Dose and Multiple Doses of GSK3008356</title>
          <description>Preliminary pharmacodynamics of GSK3008356 was evaluated by assessing the postprandial triglyceride levels at the indicated time points. Corrected triglyceride value (Day 1) at each nominal sampling time point was defined as the corresponding post dose value by adding the following value: Part 1 Day 1 Correction: (Day -1 (1 hour + 2 hour)/2) - (Day 1 (1 hour + 2 hour)/2). Mean triglyceride levels are presented.</description>
          <population>Pharmacodynamic (PD) Population comprised of participants in the Safety population for whom at least one postprandial triglyceride sample was obtained and analyzed at Baseline and post Baseline. Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed.</population>

        <title>Part 2: Dose Proportionality of GSK3008356 for Dose 1 mg BID vs 10 mg BID and 3 mg BID After Repeat Dose Administration Based on AUC</title>
        <description>Dose proportionality was assessed from Day 1 and Day 14 AUC (0 to tau) obtained from multiple cohorts in Part 2. The dose proportionality was assessed using a power model on logarithmic transformation of AUC, with the logarithmic transformation of dose as the single covariate in the linear regression. Due to the cancellation of Part 2, Cohort B1, there are no PK parameters available on Day 14 for that dose. Point estimates and 90% confidence interval are presented.</description>

        <title>Part 2: Postprandial Triglyceride Levels Following 14-day Repeat Dosing of GSK3008356</title>
        <description>Preliminary pharmacodynamics of GSK3008356 was evaluated by assessing the postprandial triglyceride levels at the indicated time points. Corrected TG value (Day 1 and Day 14) at each nominal sampling time point defined as the corresponding post dose value by adding the following value: Part 2 Day 1 Correction: (Day -1 (1 hour + 2 hour)/2) - (Day 1 (1 hour + 2 hour)/2); Part 2 Day 14 Correction: (Day -1 (1 hour + 2 hour)/2) - (Day 14 (1 hour + 2 hour)/2). Mean triglyceride levels are presented.</description>
