  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the tolerability and preliminary efficacy of transcranial direct current
      stimulation (tDCS) combined with a cognitive training program, remotely-delivered using a
      telemedicine protocol in 60 adults with multiple sclerosis (MS). The study will evaluate the
      efficacy of tDCS to evaluate two of the most debilitating symptoms of MS: cognitive
      impairment and fatigue.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been demonstrated to:

        1. successfully treat fatigue in adults with MS, and

        2. improve learning ability and other aspects of cognitive functioning in healthy controls
           and in participants with a range of medical disorders.

      Cognitive impairment in MS remains a major treatment challenge and a trial of tDCS combined
      with a cognitive training program to treat MS-related cognitive impairment is warranted.
      However, one barrier for the study of tDCS has been the need for the participant to travel to
      the study site for each tDCS administration. To address this issue, the biomedical company
      Soterix, has recently designed a remote-delivery tDCS device designed for use in clinical
      trials. Therefore, the primary goal of this study is to establish a protocol for
      remotely-supervised in-home tDCS delivery for studies with MS participants. Established
      safety and feasibility of remotely-supervised tDCS delivery will facilitate the next steps of
      larger controlled trials, in both MS as well as other conditions, to determine efficacy and
      appropriate real-world use.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Total Score of the Brief International Assessment of Cognition in MS (BICAMS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Four Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>BICAMS comprises two tests, the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) and the Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised (BVMT-R).
Scoring for SDMT involves summing the number of correct substitutions within the 90 second interval (max = 110. The higher the score, the better).
Visual/spatial memory is assessed in BICAMS using the BVMTR. In this test, six abstract designs are presented for 10 sec. The display is removed from view and patients render the stimuli via pencil on paper manual responses. Each design receives from 0 to 2 points representing accuracy and location. Thus, scores range from 0 to 12 (the higher the score, the better).
The total score range for BICAMS is 0-122. The higher the score, the better.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Score on Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>MFIS consists of 21 statements. The number that best indicates how often fatigue has affected the participant in the manner described during the past 4 weeks is circled. Answer choices include: 0 - never, 1 - rarely, 2 - sometimes, 3 - often, 4 - almost always. The total score ranges from 0 to 84. The higher the number, the more frequently fatigue impacted the participant during the past 4 weeks.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Score of CogState Brief Battery (CBB)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 Week</time_frame>
    <description>CBB is a brief, computer-administered cognitive test battery that requires approximately 10 minutes for administration. If the CBB score falls between -10 to +10, it is considered normal. CogState scoring is such that 0 could be considered as performing in the average range for that subtest compared to people of similar age. A negative score means that the performance was lower than average, and a positive score means the performance was higher than average. Higher positive scores (for instance 0.2 becoming 0.5) may indicate slightly better performance and higher negative scores (for instance, -0.4 becoming -0.8) may indicate slightly worsening performance.</description>

        <title>Change in Total Score of the Brief International Assessment of Cognition in MS (BICAMS)</title>
        <description>BICAMS comprises two tests, the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) and the Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised (BVMT-R).
Scoring for SDMT involves summing the number of correct substitutions within the 90 second interval (max = 110. The higher the score, the better).
Visual/spatial memory is assessed in BICAMS using the BVMTR. In this test, six abstract designs are presented for 10 sec. The display is removed from view and patients render the stimuli via pencil on paper manual responses. Each design receives from 0 to 2 points representing accuracy and location. Thus, scores range from 0 to 12 (the higher the score, the better).
The total score range for BICAMS is 0-122. The higher the score, the better.</description>

        <description>CBB is a brief, computer-administered cognitive test battery that requires approximately 10 minutes for administration. If the CBB score falls between -10 to +10, it is considered normal. CogState scoring is such that 0 could be considered as performing in the average range for that subtest compared to people of similar age. A negative score means that the performance was lower than average, and a positive score means the performance was higher than average. Higher positive scores (for instance 0.2 becoming 0.5) may indicate slightly better performance and higher negative scores (for instance, -0.4 becoming -0.8) may indicate slightly worsening performance.</description>
