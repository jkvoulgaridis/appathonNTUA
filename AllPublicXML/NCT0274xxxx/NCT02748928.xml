      Prospective, one arm, baseline-controlled, clinical study for the evaluation of the
      UltraShape Power treatment using the U-Sculpt Power Transducer for non-invasive abdominal fat
      and circumference reduction.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 120 healthy adult volunteers, seeking noninvasive abdominal fat and circumference
      reduction, male and females, 18 to 60 years of age from 6 investigational sites. Eligible
      subjects will receive 3 bi-weekly treatments (2 weeks interval) with the UltraShape Power
      device utilizing the U-Sculpt Power Transducer according to the study protocol. Subjects will
      return for 3 follow-up visits: four weeks (4wk FU), eight weeks (8wk FU) and 12 weeks (12wk
      FU) after the last treatment (Third Treatment).

      Each subject will be enrolled for total expected study duration of 16 weeks. Subject's
      abdominal fat thickness and circumference will be measured at the measurements points and
      will be assessed at each visit. Additionally, a subject questionnaire will be completed in
      each follow-up visit (4wk, 8wk and 12wk FU). Finally, photography will be performed under
      visible light conditions of the front, right, left and back view. Most of the assessments
      will occur at each of the visits (all treatments and all follow-up visits) to the clinic.

    <description>Tissue selectivity is achieved by a proprietary knowledge of ultrasound parameters ensuring specific destruction of the fat cells only within the target area. All other types of tissue, such as blood vessels, muscles and peripheral nerves remain intact. There are no thermal effects. Fat cell destruction is achieved by ultrasound-induced mechanical effects during a very short exposure time</description>
