      This study will be conducted at approximately ten sites in the United States. Approximately
      178 patients will be enrolled in this trial.

    <textblock>
      Combining standard chemotherapy with a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor holds great appeal in the
      treatment of SCLC. While this approach may be appropriate for many cancer types, SCLC may be
      particularly vulnerable to this treatment strategy. Early studies have suggested greater
      efficacy with agents targeting PD-1/PD-L1 in tumors that are more mutationally complex, such
      as those associated with tobacco use. SCLC has a strong association with tobacco use and
      indeed, genome-wide sequencing studies have consistently shown that SCLC carries one of the
      highest rates of non-synonymous mutations. In addition, MPDL3280A has been safely combined
      with platinum based chemotherapy doublets in the treatment of NSCLC. Thus, a combination of
      carboplatin, etoposide and MPDL3280A may significantly improve outcomes in the treatment of
      SCLC.
