    <textblock>
      The proposed study will examine the role of reward and emotion in women with and without a
      history of binge eating. It is important to understand how the brain responds to reward and
      emotion in binge eating in order to identify different pathways toward binge eating and
      provide individualized targets for treatment. This is particularly important in light of the
      fact that for many patients, the current treatments for binge eating are not effective.

    <measure>Brain activity during emotion conflict</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Functional magnetic resonance imaging will be used to measure brain activity during a task where participants respond to images of faces with emotional expressions overlaid with an emotion word written in text. We will focus on brain response during this task when emotion face vs word are in conflict.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Functional magnetic resonance imaging will be used to measure brain activity during a game where participants can win or lose money if they respond to a shape on the computer screen. Brain response during wins and losses will be examined.</description>
