  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of udenafil, an orally
      administered, potent and selective inhibitor of PDE5, versus placebo for the treatment of
      adolescent subjects who have undergone the Fontan procedure.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, double-blinded, efficacy trial of the effects of udenafil vs.
      placebo on the background of standard therapy on maximal VO2 (ml/kg/min) from baseline to six
      months in adolescent survivors of the Fontan procedure. . The target sample size is 400
      subjects (200 per group).
