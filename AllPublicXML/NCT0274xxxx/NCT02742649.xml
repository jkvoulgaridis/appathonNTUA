  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a combination of two drugs (bimatoprost and
      timolol) delivered to the surface of the eye over 10 weeks is better at lowering intraocular
      pressure (IOP) than either of the drugs delivered alone.

    <measure>Intraocular Pressure (IOP) on Day 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 8</time_frame>
    <description>IOP is a measurement of the fluid pressure inside the eye. IOP was measured at the following three time points: 8 am (T=0 hour), 12 pm (T=4 hour) and 4 pm (T=8 hour). The IOP measured in the two eyes was averaged to compute a single IOP value for each timepoint.</description>

    <description>IOP is a measurement of the fluid pressure inside the eye. IOP was measured at the following three time points: 8 am (T=0 hour), 12 pm (T=4 hour) and 4 pm (T=8 hour). The IOP measured in the two eyes was averaged to compute a single IOP value for each timepoint.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Ocular and Non-Ocular Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>From Randomization (Day 0) to Day 70</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events. Reported here is the number of participants with adverse events related to the eye as well as number of participants with all other adverse events.</description>

    <measure>IOP During Open Label Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 98, Day 112</time_frame>
    <description>IOP is a measurement of the fluid pressure inside the eye. IOP was measured at the following three time points: 8 am (T=0 hour), 12 pm (T=4 hour) and 4 pm (T=8 hour) at the start (Day 98) and end (Day 112) of the Open Label Period during which participants were treated with timolol 0.5% ophthalmic solution twice daily. The IOP measured in the two eyes was averaged to compute a single IOP value for each timepoint.</description>

        <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events. Reported here is the number of participants with adverse events related to the eye as well as number of participants with all other adverse events.</description>

        <title>IOP During Open Label Period</title>
        <description>IOP is a measurement of the fluid pressure inside the eye. IOP was measured at the following three time points: 8 am (T=0 hour), 12 pm (T=4 hour) and 4 pm (T=8 hour) at the start (Day 98) and end (Day 112) of the Open Label Period during which participants were treated with timolol 0.5% ophthalmic solution twice daily. The IOP measured in the two eyes was averaged to compute a single IOP value for each timepoint.</description>
        <time_frame>Day 98, Day 112</time_frame>
        <population>FAS included all participants who were randomized, treated and returned for at least one (1) regularly scheduled post-treatment visit. Participants were analyzed in the treatment group to which they were randomized (Double Blind Treatment Period). Number analyzed is the number of participants with data at the given time-point.</population>
