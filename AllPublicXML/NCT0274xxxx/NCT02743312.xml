  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this pilot study is to test the protocol for investigating the longer-term
      effects of torso weighting on physical activity, number of falls, and muscle activation (when
      muscles turn on and off and how intensely) in five volunteers with multiple sclerosis. The
      hypotheses of this study include: torso weighting will (1) increase physical activity, (2)
      decrease the number of falls, and (3) improve the timing and coordination of muscle
      activation during balance perturbations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Torso weighting, using the balance-based torso-weighting (BBTW) method, is an intervention
      that addresses balance by first challenging stability in standing using a series of
      perturbations (nudges) and resisted rotations to people. Challenging stability allows the
      assessor to determine directional instability. Once the direction of instability is
      determined, small weights are placed on a vest-like garment and retesting of balance occurs.
      In this study, participants will be tested with no weights (NW), with sham weights (SW), and
      with BBTW weighting (WT). Following non-weighted baseline assessment, participants will be
      randomly allocated into the sham weight condition or BBTW weight condition in a cross-over
      design. The initial condition (NW) will last four weeks and the final two conditions (SW,WT)
      will last two weeks each. Following each condition, outcome measures will be reassessed.
      Throughout the study, participants will be asked to wear a commercially-available remote
      monitoring device (e.g., Fitbit Flex) and keep a daily log of physical activity and number of
      falls. During the SW and WT conditions, participants will wear the assigned garment for 2-4
      hours daily.
