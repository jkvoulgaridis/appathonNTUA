    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of IRX5183 in 1) patients with relapsed
      and/or refractory AML and 2) patients with high-risk MDS or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia
      (CMML).

      This research is being done to learn about the safety and effectiveness of an investigational
      drug, IRX5183, in treating acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).
      IRX5183 is a derivative of Vitamin A. IRX5183 is a drug that is designed to cause cancer
      cells to mature and then die. It is thought that it will stop the uncontrolled growth of
      leukemia cells.

      These are 2 parts to this study. The purpose of the first part is to test the safety of
      IRX5183 at different dose levels. The investigators want to find out what effects, good
      and/or bad, it has on AML or MDS. Once the investigators figure out the best and safest dose
      of IRX5183, the investigators will enter the second part of the study using this dose. The
      purpose of the second part is to see if IRX5183 is effective as a treatment for AML or MDS.
      To date, IRX5183 has been used in about 25 people.

      The first part of the study is called a &quot;Phase I&quot; study. Phase I studies use drugs starting
      at low doses and slowly increase the amounts of the study drugs that are given to people
      until the side effects of the drugs are too high to give more. This means that not all people
      in the study will get the same dose of IRX5183. Doses at the beginning of the study will be
      lower than doses at the end of the study. Because of the design of the study, some people may
      get doses that are too low to have an effect, and other people will probably get doses that
      cause side effects.

      People with AML, MDS, or CMML that has 1) not responded to standard therapy or 2) has
      returned after a previous response may join.

    <description>IRX5183 will be administered orally daily on days 1-28 of each cycle for 2 cycles of induction. In the phase I part of the study, there will be 3 dose levels (dose level 1 [DL1] with 50 mg, DL2 with 75 mg, and DL3 with 100 mg), with 1 additional dose level to be only used if excessive toxicity noted at the DL1. There will be no intra-patient dose escalation. A phase II portion of the study was originally planned, but the study was terminated prior to phase II enrollment.</description>

          7. Patients must not have received any other treatment for their disease, including
             hematopoietic growth factors, aside from hydroxyurea for count control, within three
             weeks of beginning the trial, and should have recovered from all toxicities of prior
             therapy (to grade 0 or 1).

          8. Patients requiring hydroxyurea to bring WBC below 10,000/µL prior to study enrollment
             will require a 48-hour washout prior to starting the study drug.

          9. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test
             within 72 hours prior to start of IRX5183.

             leukostasis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, or CNS leukemia.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any serious medical condition or uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not
             limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure,
             unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, laboratory abnormality, or psychiatric
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements or
             prevent the subject from signing the informed consent form.

          2. Any condition, including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, which places the
             subject at unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study or confounds
             the ability to interpret data from the study.

          3. Use of any other experimental drug or therapy within 21 days of baseline.

          4. Known hypersensitivity or history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of
             similar chemical or biologic composition to IRX5183.

          5. Prior use of other retinoid therapies in the 3 months prior to enrollment in the
             study.

          6. Patients with other active cancers receiving anti-cancer agents, with exceptions being
             hormonal therapy for breast or prostate cancer and skin cancers treated with local
             therapies only.

          7. Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not
             recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier
             (e.g. alopecia, hypothyroid, neuropathy, etc.).

          8. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because of potential for teratogenic or
             abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with IRX5183,
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with IRX5183.
