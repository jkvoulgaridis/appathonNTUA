      Antirejection medicines, also known as immunosuppressive drugs, are prescribed to organ
      transplant recipients to prevent their bodies from rejecting the new organ. Some organ
      transplant recipients can stop taking anti-rejection medicines without rejecting their
      transplanted organ (this is called 'tolerance'). The purpose of this study will collect
      samples and data from 'tolerant' liver or kidney transplant recipients in order to find out:

      The purpose of this study is to collect samples and data in order to find out:

        -  How long liver or kidney transplant recipients can remain tolerant;

        -  What happens in the tolerant recipient's body over time; and

        -  If there are patterns in the body that are linked to tolerance.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Loss of Operational Tolerance</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 to Year 5</time_frame>
    <description>Operational tolerance (to their kidney or liver transplant) defined by:
Absence of rejection (biopsy-proven or clinical rejection), as determined by medical history;
Maintenance off immunosuppressive medication, except for short courses of steroids for non-allograft related conditions (i.e., asthma); and
Normal and stable allograft function:
For liver transplant recipients-Liver function tests (ALT, GGT) that have not increased more than 50% above the participant's baseline values; and
For kidney transplant recipients- Serum creatinine values that have not increased more than 25% above the participant's baseline values.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Development of Anti-Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) Antibody or Donor Specific Antibodies (DSA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 to Year 5</time_frame>
    <description>Time to development of either:
de novo HLA antibodies (anti-HLA Ab) post-transplant. Alloantibody is defined as an antibody produced following the introduction of an alloantigen into the system of an individual lacking that particular antigen; OR
Donor Specific Antibodies (DSA), a newly developed alloantibody that is against the donor organ.
Alloantibodies are important mediators of acute and chronic rejection.</description>

    <description>Operational tolerance at baseline is defined as:
An absence of any immunosuppressive therapy for ≥ 52 weeks prior to the screening visit;
No evidence of allograft rejection in the 52 weeks prior to the screening visit (Day 0), based on the participant's medical history; and
Normal and stable allograft function at screening visit defined as-
For liver transplant recipients: Liver function tests (ALT, GGT) both less than or equal to the upper limit of normal (ULN)
For kidney transplant recipients: Serum creatinine value corresponds to an estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &gt; 45 ml/min/1.73 m^2.</description>
