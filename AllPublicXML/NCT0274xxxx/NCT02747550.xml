    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the temporary simultaneous
      two-arterial occlusions (TESTO) on operative blood loss during laparoscopic myomectomy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Significant hemorrhage is major perioperative concern in myomectomy, and can result in need
      of blood transfusion, conversion to hysterectomy, development of hypovolemic shock and
      postoperative anemia, and delayed recovery. Therefore, methods to decrease operative blood
      loss during myomectomy in women wishing to preserve their uterus and fertility are important
      and must be developed.
