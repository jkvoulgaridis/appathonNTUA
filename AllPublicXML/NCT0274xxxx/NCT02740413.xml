      The overall aim of the study is to describe demographic and clinical characteristics,
      treatment patterns and outcomes, as well as the related direct treatment costs in the
      populations of hemophilia patients treated with BeneFIX and ReFacto/ReFacto AF, and in
      subgroups (e.g. level of severity) at the MHC in Sweden.

      The study population will consist of all patients diagnosed with haemophilia (D66.9
      (haemophilia A) D67.9 (haemophilia B) in International Statistical Classification of Diseases
      and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) that have been registered in the MHR since 1977 and that
      have had at least one registered prescription of BeneFIX or ReFacto/ReFacto AF in the MHR
      since market authorization of the respective product (Benefix August 27 1997, ReFacto April
      13 1999, ReFacto AF July 1 2009). Diseased individuals are included. Information on drugs
      picked up at the pharmacy is available in the Prescribed Drug Register from 2005.
