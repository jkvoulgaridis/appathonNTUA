  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with Late Life Depression (LLD) often have cognitive problems, particularly
      problems with memory, attention, and problem solving, all of which contribute to
      antidepressant non-response. Our group and others have shown that decreased thinking speed is
      the central cause of functional problems in patients with LLD. Similarly, decreased walking
      speed is associated with depression and carries additional risk for falls, hospitalization,
      and death. Available evidence suggests that declining functionality in the brain's dopamine
      system contributes to age-related cognitive and motor slowing. The central hypothesis of this
      R61/R33 Phased Innovation Award is that by enhancing dopamine functioning in the brain and
      improving cognitive and motor slowing, administration of carbidopa/levodopa (L-DOPA) will
      improve depressive symptoms in older adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will elucidate the neurobiology of slowing and LLD, identify a novel therapeutic
      target for depression, and contribute to the development of personalized treatment regimens
      for LLD. The multimodal neuroimaging methods detailed in this application will provide
      information about the neurobiology of aging-associated slowing and LLD at molecular,
      structural, and functional levels of analysis. These data will fill a crucial gap in our
      knowledge regarding what are the physiologic and functional consequences of dopamine
      depletion occurring across the lifespan in individuals without PD. Results from this project
      also will allow us to evaluate a novel therapeutic approach to LLD, which could have large
      public health ramifications given the prevalence, frequent treatment resistance, and
      chronicity characteristic of LLD. Even apart from patients with LLD, cognitive and motor
      slowing exact a large public health burden in terms of impaired functioning and increased
      morbidity and mortality, and this burden will only grow as the population ages. It is
      critical to develop treatments capable of altering the negative health trajectories
      associated with slowing in order to help older adults maintain independent functioning and
      live longer with an increased quality of life. Finally, while PET and MRI may prove critical
      to understand the neurobiology of slowing and LLD, their invasiveness and expense limit their
      roles in informing treatment decisions in clinical practice settings. For this reason the
      investigators are also assessing the influence of genetic moderators such as interleukin-6
      (IL-6) and catechol-O-methyl-transferase (COMT) genotype on baseline dopamine functioning and
      response to L-DOPA. This may facilitate the identification of both high-risk individuals and
      those most likely to benefit from treatment interventions.

    <measure>Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (24 Item)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 3</time_frame>
    <description>Our target is depressive symptomatology as measured by the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD). The HRSD is a 24-item questionnaire used as an indication of depression and a guide to evaluate recovery. Total scores range from 0-74, not including atypical symptoms sub-scale. A score of 16 or above is typically considered to indicate the presence of depressive symptoms. Higher scores indicate greater severity.</description>

    <measure>Digit Symbol Substitution Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening</time_frame>
    <description>Digit symbol substitution test (DSST) is a neuropsychological test sensitive to brain damage, dementia, age and depression. The test is not sensitive to the location of brain-damage (except for damage comprising part of the visual field). It consists of (e.g. nine) digit-symbol pairs (e.g. 1/-,2/┴ ... 7/Λ,8/X,9/=) followed by a list of digits. Under each digit the subject should write down the corresponding symbol as fast as possible. The number of correct symbols within the allowed time (e.g. 90 or 120 sec) is measured. The higher the number, the better the score.</description>

    <description>This test required participants to identify whether two visual patterns are the &quot;same&quot; or &quot;not the same&quot; (responses were made by pressing a &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; button). Patterns were either identical or varied on one of three dimensions: color (all ages), adding/taking something away (all ages), or one versus many. Scores reflected the number of correct items (of a possible 130) completed in 90 s; items were designed to minimize the number of errors that were made.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects received 2 [11C]-raclopride positron emission tomography (PET) scans: baseline and post-L-DOPA treatment. High resolution anatomical T1-weighted MRI scans were acquired for each subject and PET data were co-registered to the MRIs using maximization of mutual information (SPM12, Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging). Regions of interest (ROIs) were applied to the MRIs and transferred to the PET data and included the sensorimotor striatum (post-commissural putamen, SMST), associative striatum (whole caudate and pre-commissural putamen, AST) and the limbic striatum (nucleus accumbens and the most ventral aspects of the pre-commissural caudate and putamen, LST). Additionally, an ROI was drawn on cerebellum as a reference tissue. ROI time activity curves were derived as the average activity in each ROI in each frame. The primary outcome measure was BPND, the binding potential with respect to the non-displaceable compartment, derived by the simplified reference tissue model.</description>

        <title>Digit Symbol Substitution Test</title>
        <description>Digit symbol substitution test (DSST) is a neuropsychological test sensitive to brain damage, dementia, age and depression. The test is not sensitive to the location of brain-damage (except for damage comprising part of the visual field). It consists of (e.g. nine) digit-symbol pairs (e.g. 1/-,2/┴ ... 7/Λ,8/X,9/=) followed by a list of digits. Under each digit the subject should write down the corresponding symbol as fast as possible. The number of correct symbols within the allowed time (e.g. 90 or 120 sec) is measured. The higher the number, the better the score.</description>

        <title>Digit Symbol Substitution Test</title>
        <description>Digit symbol substitution test (DSST) is a neuropsychological test sensitive to brain damage, dementia, age and depression. The test is not sensitive to the location of brain-damage (except for damage comprising part of the visual field). It consists of (e.g. nine) digit-symbol pairs (e.g. 1/-,2/┴ ... 7/Λ,8/X,9/=) followed by a list of digits. Under each digit the subject should write down the corresponding symbol as fast as possible. The number of correct symbols within the allowed time (e.g. 90 or 120 sec) is measured. The higher the number, the better the score.</description>

        <description>Subjects received 2 [11C]-raclopride positron emission tomography (PET) scans: baseline and post-L-DOPA treatment. High resolution anatomical T1-weighted MRI scans were acquired for each subject and PET data were co-registered to the MRIs using maximization of mutual information (SPM12, Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging). Regions of interest (ROIs) were applied to the MRIs and transferred to the PET data and included the sensorimotor striatum (post-commissural putamen, SMST), associative striatum (whole caudate and pre-commissural putamen, AST) and the limbic striatum (nucleus accumbens and the most ventral aspects of the pre-commissural caudate and putamen, LST). Additionally, an ROI was drawn on cerebellum as a reference tissue. ROI time activity curves were derived as the average activity in each ROI in each frame. The primary outcome measure was BPND, the binding potential with respect to the non-displaceable compartment, derived by the simplified reference tissue model.</description>

          <title>Post-Treatment [11C]-Raclopride Binding Potential: Limbic Striatum</title>
          <description>Subjects received 2 [11C]-raclopride positron emission tomography (PET) scans: baseline and post-L-DOPA treatment. High resolution anatomical T1-weighted MRI scans were acquired for each subject and PET data were co-registered to the MRIs using maximization of mutual information (SPM12, Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging). Regions of interest (ROIs) were applied to the MRIs and transferred to the PET data and included the sensorimotor striatum (post-commissural putamen, SMST), associative striatum (whole caudate and pre-commissural putamen, AST) and the limbic striatum (nucleus accumbens and the most ventral aspects of the pre-commissural caudate and putamen, LST). Additionally, an ROI was drawn on cerebellum as a reference tissue. ROI time activity curves were derived as the average activity in each ROI in each frame. The primary outcome measure was BPND, the binding potential with respect to the non-displaceable compartment, derived by the simplified reference tissue model.</description>
