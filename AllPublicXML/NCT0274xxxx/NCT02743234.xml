    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Global resolution is defined as combined clinical and microbiological resolution, without need for rescue FMT or colectomy. Clinical resolution is absence of abdominal pain (pain score 0 (no pain), 1 (mild pain), 2 (moderate pain), 3 (severe pain)) and less than 3 bowel movements of Bristol 5 or lower, per day. Microbiological resolution is negative Clostridium difficile test 8 weeks after finishing allocated treatment</description>

    <time_frame>8 and 26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>EQ5D-3L (www.euroqol.com) measures self-reported quality of life in 5 dimensions (each three levels), rendering score from 5 (lowest and best) to 15 (highest and worst) plus an overall reporting of general well being (0, lowest, worst to 100, highest, best). Scoring is obtained week 0,8,26 after randomization. Numerical changes are documented and compared using non-parametric statistics</description>
