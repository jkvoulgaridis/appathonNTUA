  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will examine how intensive interdisciplinary pain treatment (IIPT,
      specifically the Rehabilitation for Amplified Pain Syndrome, or RAPS, program at Children's
      Mercy Hospital) impacts neurofunctional mechanisms of emotional and physical pain processing
      in patients. There has been recent interest in characterizing the brain regions responsible
      for processing pain (Wager et al., 2013), but little research has included youth. A better
      understanding of the physiological mechanisms of pain can lead to better treatment outcomes.

    <textblock>
      Youth will be scanned before or during the first week of participation in the Rehabilitation
      for Amplified Pain Syndrome (RAPS) program, and a second time near or just after program
      completion (typically 3-5 weeks later). One functional MRI task will involve passive viewing
      of emotional and pain-related images including some that have been widely used in previous
      neuroimaging research (e.g., the International Affective Picture Set, Human Facial
      Expressions; alternating positive and negative affect/valence). The other functional MRI
      task, will involve systematic external application of somatosensory stimulation (pressure) to
      the hand in alternating blocks. The entire imaging procedure will take approximately an hour.
      MRI technicians and/or study staff will administer the scanning protocol. Study team will be
      responsible for the systematic external application of sensory input.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in brain response (as measured by fMRI) to viewing images of physical and emotional pain, and experiencing somatosensory simulation to the arm.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline fMRI will be conducted when the participant starts IIPT. A second scan will be conducted at the end of treatment (3-5 weeks later).</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will undergo scanning without intravenous contrast, performed with a 3-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner. Structural scan will be completed for spatial normalization and registration with the functional data. Functional scans use blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) assessments during active tasks to determine regional brain activation while viewing pictures and experiencing somatosensory stimulation.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Discounting Questionnaire (PDQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pain Discounting Questionnaire (PDQ), will be completed at the beginning of IIPT (same time as fMRI) and 3-5 weeks later or at the end of the IITP (same time as last fMRI.)</time_frame>
    <description>- Pain Discounting Questionnaire (PDQ). This measures the extent to which later rewards (in this case pain relief) lose value related to the delay (being a number of days later). - This was adapted from the 27-item Monetary-Choice Questionnaire. Scoring procedures include calculating the value of k (hyperbolic discount parameter) for small, medium, and large delays. Using the geometric mean of responses allows for a single score if necessary. The values of k ranges from 0-1. - Greater values indicate more delay discounting, or more tendency to value a sooner, smaller reward rather than wait for a later, larger reward. Subscales are not combined.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fear of Pain Questionnaire (FOPQ), child and parent report</measure>
    <time_frame>Fear of Pain Questionnaire (FOPQ), child and parent report will be completed at the beginning of IIPT (same time as fMRI) and 3-5 weeks later or at the end of the IITP (same time as last fMRI.)</time_frame>
    <description>- Fear of Pain Questionnaire, child report (FOPQ-C) and Fear of Pain Questionnaire, parent proxy report (FOPQ-P). These each measures the extent to which youth with chronic pain experience cognitive and physiological signs of fear when experiencing pain. Scale ranges: - FOPQ-C total: 24 items, range 0-96, FOPQ-C fear of pain: 13 items, range 0-52, FOPQ-C avoidance of activities: 11 items, range 0-44, FOPQ-P total: 21 items, range 0-84, FOPQ-P fear of pain: 8 items, range 0-32, FOPQ-P avoidance of activities: 10 items, range 0-40, FOPQ-P school avoidance: 5 items, range 0-20. For all total scores and subscales, greater scores indicate more fear of pain. For both the FOPQ-C and FOPQ-P, the total scores indicate a sum of all items.</description>

        Target study population is youth ages 13-19, regardless of gender, who have been admitted
        to the RAPS program for intensive treatment. When offered a spot in the RAPS program,
        patient/parent will be informed about the study and asked if they would like to be
        contacted to receive more information. Prior to any study procedures, the permission/assent
        or consent form will be reviewed carefully with the participant (and parent, if
        applicable).
