      This study will examine the potential differences between femoral nerve blockade (FNB) and
      adductor canal blockade (ACB) for pain control and quadriceps muscle activation for patients
      following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adequate pain control following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACL) often
      requires a regional nerve block. The femoral nerve block (FNB) has been traditionally
      employed. More recently, ultrasound application to regional nerve blocks allows for the use
      of alternatives such as the adductor canal block following ACL reconstruction. In 2009,
      Manickam et al. were the first to describe the ultrasound guided adductor canal technique for
      the purposes of knee joint analgesia. Unlike other traditional techniques that seek to cause
      a sensory as well as a motor blockade, the adductor canal block attempts to spare the motor
      block of the neighboring distributions in an attempt to offer selective analgesia and
      strength preservation. Chisholm et al demonstrated the adductor canal block provides similar
      and adequate postoperative analgesia when compared to the FNB, following arthroscopic ACL
      reconstruction with patellar tendon autograft. Their study focused on analgesia and did not
      evaluate quadriceps function or impact on rehabilitation. Sharma et al drew the first
      association between femoral nerve blocks and increased fall risk due to muscle weakness in
      total knee arthroplasty population. A randomized, blinded study to compare quadriceps
      strength following adductor canal versus FNB was performed by Kwofie et al. They showed that
      compared with FNB, adductor canal block results in significant quadriceps motor sparing and
      significantly preserved balance. These studies focused on acute muscle weakness after
      regional anesthesia and its relation to safety. Quadriceps function is very important in
      rehabilitation of ACL reconstruction. Luo et al demonstrated long term deficits related to
      FNB. They demonstrated that patients treated with FNB after ACL reconstruction had
      significant isokinetic deficits in knee extension and flexion strength at 6 months when
      compared with patients who did not receive a nerve block. Patients without a block were 4
      times more likely to meet criteria for clearance to return to sports at 6 months. In
      addition, Krych et al found significantly inferior quadriceps strength and function at 6
      months in FNB group. Based on the available literature, we aim to compare femoral nerve
      versus adductor canal block in regards to pain control and muscle strength in ACL
      reconstruction patients until return to sport.

    <description>Quadriceps muscle activation was examined using surface electromyography (sEMG) of the vastus medialis oblique muscle. Peak sEMG activity was recorded in microvolts (uV) on the surgical and contralateral limbs while performing five maximal effort isometric contractions in full knee extension--the reported values are equal to the quadriceps sEMG in uV of the contralateral limb minus the quadriceps sEMG in uV of the surgical limb.</description>

    <description>The straight leg raise assessment was performed in a standardized long-sitting position with well-knee flexed to 90 degrees. Patients were asked to complete 30 repetitions of straight leg raises with a small bolster supporting the heel using the following criteria; (1) perform with no visible quad lag (2) reach the height of the opposite tibial tubercle and (3) maintain a controlled rate of 30 hertz for the ascending and descending phases. The examination was only performed on the surgical limb and the absolute number of successful repetitions is reported.</description>

        <title>Quadriceps Muscle Activation as Assessed by Surface Electromyography (sEMG)</title>
        <description>Quadriceps muscle activation was examined using surface electromyography (sEMG) of the vastus medialis oblique muscle. Peak sEMG activity was recorded in microvolts (uV) on the surgical and contralateral limbs while performing five maximal effort isometric contractions in full knee extension--the reported values are equal to the quadriceps sEMG in uV of the contralateral limb minus the quadriceps sEMG in uV of the surgical limb.</description>

        <description>The straight leg raise assessment was performed in a standardized long-sitting position with well-knee flexed to 90 degrees. Patients were asked to complete 30 repetitions of straight leg raises with a small bolster supporting the heel using the following criteria; (1) perform with no visible quad lag (2) reach the height of the opposite tibial tubercle and (3) maintain a controlled rate of 30 hertz for the ascending and descending phases. The examination was only performed on the surgical limb and the absolute number of successful repetitions is reported.</description>

          <description>The straight leg raise assessment was performed in a standardized long-sitting position with well-knee flexed to 90 degrees. Patients were asked to complete 30 repetitions of straight leg raises with a small bolster supporting the heel using the following criteria; (1) perform with no visible quad lag (2) reach the height of the opposite tibial tubercle and (3) maintain a controlled rate of 30 hertz for the ascending and descending phases. The examination was only performed on the surgical limb and the absolute number of successful repetitions is reported.</description>
