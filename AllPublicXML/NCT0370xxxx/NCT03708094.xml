  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kidney transplantation is the worldwide recognized best renal replacement treatment for
      children with end-stage renal disease. Successful kidney transplantation can not only
      alleviate uremia symptoms, improve survival and quality of life, but also achieve optimal
      growth and cognitive development in children. Clarifying the cause of end-stage renal disease
      before transplantation is of vital importance to the comprehensive assessment and follow-up
      of the extra renal organs, reducing the risk of recurrence of the primary disease, the choice
      of the timing and the mode of transplantation, the scheme of immunosuppressive agents, as
      well as providing accurate genetic counseling for families. Timely molecular diagnosis and
      correct data analysis play a positive role in promoting the etiological diagnosis of uremic
      children before renal transplantation. We hypothesized that identifying the molecular
      diagnosis can improve prognosis of kidney transplantation. 300 cases of end-stage renal
      disease children were included and whole exome sequencing are performed to identify the
      molecular diagnosis. The cohort was divided into 2 groups according to whether the molecular
      diagnosis was clear. Clinical information before and after renal transplantation of each
      group are collected, and the decision tree analysis model and logistic regression model are
      used to study the effect of clear molecular diagnosis on the 3 year survival rate of renal
      transplantation.
