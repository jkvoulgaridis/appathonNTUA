  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This early phase I trial studies the side effects and how well local consolidative therapy
      (LCT) and brigatinib works in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer that is stage
      IV or has come back (recurrent). Giving LCT, such as surgery and/or radiation, after initial
      treatment may kill any remaining tumor cells. Brigatinib may stop the growth of tumor cells
      by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving LCT and brigatinib may work
      better in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety, tolerability, and feasibility of brigatinib with local consolidative
      therapy (LCT) in tyrosine kinase inhibitor-naive ALK-rearranged advanced (non-small cell lung
      cancer) NSCLC.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine progression-free survival (PFS) using modified Response Evaluation Criteria
      in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) in advanced ALK+ NSCLC patients treated with local consolidative
      therapy (LCT) after achieving stable disease or partial response with first-line brigatinib
      treatment.

      II. To determine overall survival (OS). III. To assess time to progression (TTP) of non-LCT
      lesions.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess time to appearance of new metastatic lesion(s). II. To determine the utility of
      pre-treatment, pre-LCT, and post-LCT circulating free tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)
      (cfDNA) as a potential prognostic and predictive biomarkers.

      II. To evaluate potential impact of LCT on mechanisms of ALK resistance with molecular
      analysis of post-progression biopsies.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive brigatinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every
      28 days for up to 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients then undergo LCT for up to 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Within 7 days after completion of LCT, patients receive brigatinib PO
      QD on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and every 3 months
      for up to 2 years.
