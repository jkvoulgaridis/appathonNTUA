  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The diseases derived from Metabolic Syndrome caused 75% of the total deaths. It is more
      profitable to invest in prevention than in the treatment of most cardiovascular diseases.
      Several institutions consider prevention as one of the main priorities in public health.

      Patients with Metabolic Syndrome, undergoing Mediterranean diet and exercise program, will
      have lower fat mass, greater lean mass and muscle strength; in addition to the lower
      expression of proinflammatory biomarkers, compared to those subjected to standard diet and
      exercise.

      OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the changes in body composition and cardiovascular risk in the
      population with metabolic syndrome undergoing a Mediterranean diet program and / or
      controlled physical activity.

      Design: Experimental, longitudinal design, controlled clinical trial, randomized. Population
      with Metabolic Syndrome in which the effect of Mediterranean diet and / or controlled
      physical activity will be compared on anthropometric parameters, body composition,
      cardiometabolic risk and plasma biomarkers.
