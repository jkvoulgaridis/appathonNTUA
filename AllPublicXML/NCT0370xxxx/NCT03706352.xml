  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomized single blinded study in patients planned to undergo general
      anesthesia and epidural catheter insertion for pain control after abdominal, thoracic and
      orthopedic surgery.

      Patients meeting participation criteria will be selected and enrolled sequentially.

      The study recruitment will be carried out over one year with follow-up for each patient until
      either the catheter is dislodged or once decided that the patient is to be discontinued from
      the epidural pain control.

      Study Population and Sample Size The study aims to enroll 200 adult patients planned to
      undergo general anesthesia and epidural catheter insertion. The study sample will be selected
      to fulfill the selection criteria.

      Patients will be selected if they meet the following participation criteria:

      Planned Procedures and Assessments Follow -up on dislodgments, adverse events, pain and pain
      relief assessment, standard practice Study Site All study conduction from start to end
      including procedures and assessments, data acquisition and analysis and final study
      conclusion report and any publications will be at King Hussein Cancer Center (KHCC).

      Ethical Considerations The study will be submitted to the KHCC IRB for review. The study will
      not start before IRB approval is obtained.

      All patients who provide consent to participation in the study will be randomized and
      enrolled.

      Statistical Plan Descriptive statistics will be used to present the two groups baseline
      characteristics. Comparison between groups will be carried out using Chi-square test or
      t-test or Wilcox on rank test as appropriate. Comparison between groups while adjusting for
      other variables will be carried out using logistic regression. Odds ratios along with their
      95% confidence intervals will be calculated.
