  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      My MS Toolkit is a web-based symptom self-management program for persons with multiple
      sclerosis.

      This study is evaluating various aspects of My MS Toolkit and how it impacts symptom
      self-management in multiple sclerosis. The research team believe that the toolkit will be
      feasible, acceptable, and beneficial to participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study participants will be asked to use a newly developed web-based symptom self-management
      program, called the My MS Toolkit, for 12 weeks. Participants will also be asked to complete
      online surveys throughout the study.

      The My MS Toolkit includes 8 modules that describe symptom self-management strategies.
      Participants will explore the My MS Toolkit on their own, following the prompts and guides
      built into the program, and are encouraged to practice and apply the skills learned.

      The study can be done from participants' homes using a reliable internet-connected device. No
      travel is required.

    <measure>Acceptability of My MS Toolkit</measure>
    <time_frame>week 12-week 14</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed by the Patient Satisfaction Evaluation Scale, 12 question scale where each response score ranges from 4 to 1 and the total score ranges from 48 to 12. Higher scores indicate increased satisfaction.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Feasibility of My MS Toolkit</measure>
    <time_frame>up to week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed by the treatment adherence questionnaire that consists of 5 questions that assess: 1) how many times the participant accessed the website in the prior two weeks; 2) how many minutes the participant spent on the website; 3) which parts of the website the participant accessed; 4) which activities the participant engaged in; and 5) which skill from the website the participant used. The items on this questionnaire will be used to describe the use of the website for assessing treatment adherence by participants in the study.</description>

    <measure>Impact of My MS Toolkit: Change in fatigue</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre- and post-treatment, up to 14 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Modified Fatigue Impact Scale will be used to assess fatigue. It is a self-report survey that contains 21 items. Each item is rated 0-4. Higher scores indicate a greater impact of fatigue on a person's activities.</description>

    <measure>Impact My MS Toolkit: Change in pain interference</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 14 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The BPI-SF is a 9-item questionnaire (15 prompts) with two domains: pain severity and pain interference. The 7 pain interference items have values which range from 0 (&quot;does not interfere&quot;) to 10 (&quot;completely interferes&quot;); items are averaged for a scale score range of 0-10, with higher scores indicating more pain interference.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Impact My MS Toolkit: Change in depressive symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 14 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The eight-item Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale (PHQ-8) is established as a valid diagnostic and severity measure for depressive disorders in large clinical studies. Scores range from 0 - 24 and a score of 10 or greater is consistent with at least moderate depressive symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in self-efficacy for managing symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 14 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes measured by the University of Washington Self-Efficacy Scale (UW-SES), higher score indicates higher levels of self-efficacy (total score range: 6-30)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Participant perception of change</measure>
    <time_frame>week 12-14</time_frame>
    <description>Perception of change is assessed by the patient global impression of change questionnaire, which is 1 question and responses range from 1-7. Higher numbers indicate greater improvement in condition.</description>
