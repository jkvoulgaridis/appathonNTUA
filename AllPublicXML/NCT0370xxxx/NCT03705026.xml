  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative nausea and vomiting ( PONV ) is one of the common complications after general
      anesthesia while genetic factors may play an important role in Postoperative nausea and
      vomiting. In this study, the ivestigators investigated the relationship between gene
      polymorphism ( such as single nucleotide polymorphism ) of the gene HTR3A (
      5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 3A ), HTR3B ( 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 3B ), HTR3C (
      5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 3C ) and TACR1 ( tachykinin receptor 1 ) etc. with nausea and
      vomiting after general anesthesia. Simultaneously, the investigators explored the influencing
      factors of nausea and vomiting.

      Materials and methods:

      Demographic data and risk factors responsible for PONV, including the history of PONV and
      motion sickness, were collected preoperatively by interviewing paticipants the day before
      anesthesia.

      All study subjects received a standardized anesthesia regimen. General anesthesia was induced
      by midazolam 0.04 mg/kg, propofol 1.5 mg/kg, sufentanil 0.4 μg/kg, and cisatracurium 0.2
      mg/kg (to facilitate tracheal intubation) given intravenously.Paticipants' lungs were
      ventilated with 50% oxygen in air.

      During general anesthesia, concentration of sevoflurane maintained 1.0% to 3.0% at the
      discretion of anesthetist who was not involved in the study. General anesthesia also uses
      propofol 1 mg kg-1 h-1 and sufentanil 0.1 μg kg-1 h-1 by continuous intravenous infusion. An
      Entropy index monitor was used to maintain the appropriate anesthesia depth by 40-60.
      Paticipants received a repeated bolus of sufentanil 0.1 μg/kg or cisatracurium intravenously
      on demand.

      After surgery the investigators recorded the data such as Anesthesia duration, doses of
      sufentanil and propofol and so on.

      At the end of surgery and after returning to the ward, flurbiprofen axetil 50 mg injection
      i.v. was administered as an analgesic therapy, respectively. Cholinesterase inhibitor-based
      neuromuscular reversal drugs and vitamine B6 were not administered after surgery. Bucinnazine
      hydrochloride 100 mg intramuscular injection (i.m.) as a rescue medication was administered
      to any paticipant whose visual analogue scale/score (VAS) was &gt; 3.

      Ondansetron was given intravenously to the paticipant if necessary or requested . Unaware of
      the genotypes of the subjects, the investigators collected the paticipants' data including
      nausea, vomiting and pain.

    <description>The investigators defined an emetic episode as a single occurrence of vomiting/retching or as a series of immediately successive vomiting/retching. However, vomiting/retching had to be separated by at least 1 minute to be classified as a single emetic episode.</description>
