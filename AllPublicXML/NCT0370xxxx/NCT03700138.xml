  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To summarise, the peripheral neurological complications experienced by patients with primary
      Sjögren's syndrome are particularly bothersome since they are common and often result in
      significant disability related to pain or motor impairment. There is currently no standard
      treatment for these patients.

      As these neuropathies are caused by an immune system dysfunction, which is related to a
      variety of different pathogenic mechanisms, the use of immunosuppressant or immunomodulator
      drugs is often justified.

      With the exception of the vascularitis-related multiplex mononeuropathies, other pSS-related
      neuropathies could be suitable candidates for IV Ig treatment.
