  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adiposity is associated with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. In very severe cases of
      adiposity in combination with type 2 diabetes, bariatric surgery has proven to be a
      successful therapy option. So far the molecular mechanisms that lead to an improvement of
      type 2 diabetes after bariatric surgery are not fully understood. It is planned to
      characterize the metabolic and neuroendocrine changes in subjects before and after bariatric
      surgery. One special focus of the study is brain insulin resistance, a condition known to be
      associated with obesity with impact on the brain and whole body metabolism.
