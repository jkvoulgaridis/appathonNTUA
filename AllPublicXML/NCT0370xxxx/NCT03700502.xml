  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN) often combine with anxiety and depression.
      However, the pathogenesis of PDN is unclear, especially the mechanism associated with central
      nervous system. The investigators used fraction Amplitude of Low Frequency Fluctuation
      (fALFF) and Regional Homogeneity (ReHo) of resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance
      Imaging (rs-fMRI) to explore the brain activity in patients with PDN in order to study the
      central mechanism.The investigators evaluated the symptoms, signs and mental conditions of
      patients with PDN and non-pain neuropathy. The brain Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) fMRI
      scan was performed in patients together with some gender and age matched healthy controls.
      Maybe this study can find that patients with PDN have abnormal brain activity, indicating
      central nervous system may contribute to painful diabetic neuropathy.
