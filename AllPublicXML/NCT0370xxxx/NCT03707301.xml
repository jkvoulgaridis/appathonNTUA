  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer is pathology with a high impact on patients and relatives quality of life. Most of the
      time, it is a stressful trial. Professionals have often resort to pharmaceutical solutions,
      but sometimes, it is not sufficient. So, patients resort to alternative and complementary
      medicines, as sophrology. In Lucien Neuwirth Cancer Institute, patients can benefit from
      sophrology.

      Anxiety levels have never been reported before and after sessions. Indeed, the present study
      wants to report anxiety levels before, after, and one and three weeks after session. Levels
      of satisfaction will also be reported.
