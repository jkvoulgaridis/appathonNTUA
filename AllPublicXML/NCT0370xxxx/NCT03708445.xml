  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The sensitivity of brushing cytology used to distinguish the cause of biliary strictures is
      low and clinical usefulness is not secured. The aim of this study was to develop a new
      differential staining method for cytology which is difficult to differentiate by the
      conventional staining method using biliary cancer related protein expressed only in bile duct
      cancer.

      Hypothesis: The statistical significance of new staining method using aminoacyl-tRNA
      synthetases (ARSs) group in normal bile duct cells and the bile duct cancer cells collected
      by endoscopic retrograde pancreaticoduodenoscopy (ERCP) will be compared to prove the
      usefulness of the new staining method.

      Clinical study design: The bile duct cytology will be obtained by brushing cytology using
      ERCP in patients with biliary stenosis. The expression of ARSs in the brushing cytology will
      be evaluated by new staining method and compare with the results of conventional cytology
      staining method including Papanicolaou staining. Immunofluorescence or immunohistochemistry
      staining will be performed to differentiate the presence of the tumor. The sensitivity and
      specificity of the new staining method will be compared with the conventional staining method
      and its usefulness be confirmed.
