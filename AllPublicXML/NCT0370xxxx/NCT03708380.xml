  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Geographic analyses of diabetes burden have found that poor glycemic control, high rates of
      diabetes-related hospital utilization, and a high prevalence of microvascular diabetic
      complications all cluster in the same neighborhoods.This proposed study seeks to identify
      Black barbers with undiagnosed diabetes or prediabetes using point-of-care HbA1c testing,
      perform qualitative interviews to identify health behaviors that may explain poor sugar
      control, and develop a workplace-based food intervention to promote primary prevention and
      test its effect on sugar control in these individuals.
