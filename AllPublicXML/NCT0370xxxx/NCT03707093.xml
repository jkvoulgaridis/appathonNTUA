  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation, multicenter study of ADG106 in subjects with
      advanced or metastatic solid tumors and/or relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma. ADG106
      is a fully human ligand-blocking, agonistic anti-CD137 IgG4 mAb. It binds to the activated
      human T cells via a T cell receptor CD137. T cell is a kind of lymphocyte (a subtype of white
      blood cells) that protects bodies by eliminating tumor cells, and normal cells infected with
      viruses or bacteria. By binding to CD137, the study drug is expected to enhance the activity
      of activated T cells and thus stimulate a more intense immune attack to kill tumor cells.
      ADG106 is expected to enhance the activity of activated T cells.

      The primary objective of the study is to assess safety and tolerability at increasing dose
      levels of single agent ADG106 in subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors and/or non
      Hodgkin lymphoma Secondary Objectives

        -  To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of ADG106

        -  To evaluate the immunogenicity of ADG106

        -  To evaluate the potential anti-tumor effect of ADG106 Exploratory Objective To identify
           the potential biomarkers of ADG106
