  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of targeted in-person and online education on
      cardiovascular outcomes of AF patients (inpatient and outpatient), compared with standard
      care. Several other parameters (i.e. knowledge level, quality of life, symptom burden,
      self-care capabilities, adherence to oral anticoagulation, and an evaluation of the
      educational efforts) will be studied. Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility will also be
      investigated.

      The main research hypothesis is that individualized education based on the knowledge gaps
      measured with the JAKQ (Jessa Atrial fibrillation Knowledge Questionnaire) in each individual
      patient (called 'targeted education') is superior when compared to current AF care, both from
      an efficacy perspective (evaluated by different outcome measures) and from a
      cost-effectiveness perspective.

    <measure>Patients' knowledge level, assessed by the Jessa Atrial fibrillation Knowledge Questionnaire (JAKQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline, 1 month, 3-, 6-, 12- and 18 months and if applicable at 24-, 30- and 36 months or at the end of the study in the intervention groups. In the standard care group at 18 months and if applicable at the end of the study.</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire includes 16 knowledge questions: 8 about atrial fibrillation, 5 about oral anticoagulation medication and 3 about vitamine K antagonists or non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants. A total score between 0% and 100% will be generated in which 100% is the best possible score (all questions are answered correctly).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patients' quality of life, assessed by the EQ-5D-3L questionnaire and the Atrial Fibrillation Effect on QualiTy-of-Life (AFEQT) Questionnaire.</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline, 3-, 12- and 18 months and if applicable at the end of the study in the intervention groups. In the standard care group at baseline and 18 months and if applicable at the end of the study.</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-3L descriptive system includes a total of 5 questions for 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression). Each question has 3 levels (no problems, some problems, and extreme problems). The EQ Visual Analogue Scale records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale where the endpoints are labelled 'Best imaginable health state' (score of 100) and 'Worst imaginable health state' (score of 0). The AFEQT is an atrial fibrillation-specific health-related quality of life questionnaire based on 18 questions in the domain of symptoms, daily activities and treatment concerns. A treatment satisfaction score can be calculated based on 2 additional questions. All questions are rated on a 7 point Likert scale. A scoring key is used to determine an overall AFEQT score and a treatment satisfaction score ranging from 0 to 100. A lower score indicates a worse health-related quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Patients' symptom burden, assessed by the Leuven ARrhythmia Questionnaire (LARQ).</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline, 3-,12- and 18 months and if applicable at the end of the study in the intervention groups. In the standard care group at baseline and 18 months and if applicable at the end of the study.</time_frame>
    <description>The LARQ is based on 6 atrial fibrillation-related symptoms: palpitations, shortness of breath, chest pain, syncope, dizziness and fatigue. For each of these symptoms (except syncope), symptom prevalence, occurrence (frequency, duration, severity), distress, circumstances triggering the symptom, and effect on daily activities are requested. Subscale scores on five domains (symptom frequency, duration, effect on daily activities, severity and distress) are calculated by summing the raw scores and transforming them to a 0-100 scale. Higher scores represent a more pronounced symptom burden.</description>

    <measure>Patients' self-care capabilities, assessed by the Self-Care Questionnaire (SCQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline, 3-,12- and 18 months and if applicable at the end of the study in the intervention groups. In the standard care group at baseline and 18 months and if applicable at the end of the study.</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire includes a total of 15 questions. The first 6 questions will be scored on a 1 to 5 Likert scale. 1 is the best score and 5 is the worst score. The other 9 questions measure evolutions of self-care capabilities over time.</description>

    <description>The number of questions will depend on the specific group allocation, ranging from a minimum of 4 questions to a maximum of 20 questions. These questions assess patients' satisfaction and opinion about the education provided during the study.</description>
