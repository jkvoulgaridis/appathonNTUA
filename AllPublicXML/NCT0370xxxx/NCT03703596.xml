  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is conducted to explore the safety and efficacy of anlotinib, a tyrosine kinase
      inhibitors of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor 2（VEGFR）、FGFR（Fibroblast Growth
      Factor Receptor）, Platelet-derived growth factor Receptor（PDGFR） and c-kit, vs docetaxel in
      advanced Non-squamous Non-small cell lung cancer harbouring wild-type epidermal growth factor
      receptor (EGFR) .

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicentre randomised controlled clinical trial conducted in China to compare the
      efficacy and and safety of Anlotinib vs Docetaxel in patients of EGFR mutation-negative
      advanced nonsquamous non-small Cell Lung Cancer.

      Eligible patients will be randomized to arm A and arm B:

      Arm A: Patients on the anlotinib arm received 12mg anlotinib orally daily on day 1 to 14 of a
      21-day cycle.

      Arm B: Patients on the docetaxel arm received 75mg/m2 docetaxel as intravenous infusion on
      day 1 of a 21-day cycle.
