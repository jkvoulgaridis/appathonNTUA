  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to estimate the relative bioavailability of TAK-931 tablets in
      reference to powder-in capsule (PIC) and to assess the effect of food and esomeprazole on the
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of TAK-931 as a tablet.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-931. TAK 931 is being tested to treat
      participants who have advanced solid tumors. This study will look at relative
      bioavailability, effect of food and gastric pH modification on the PK of TAK-931.

      The study will enroll approximately 44 participants. The study will be conducted in 2 parts:
      Part 1 and Part 2. In Part 1 and Part 2, participants will be randomly assigned (by chance,
      like flipping a coin) in a crossover design. In Part 1, participants will be assigned to 1 of
      the 2 following treatment sequences:

        -  TAK-931 80 mg PIC + TAK-931 80 mg Tablet

        -  TAK-931 80 mg Tablet + TAK-931 80 mg PIC

      Part 2 of the study will be initiated, once the preliminary PK data from Part 1 is available
      to determine the relative bioavailability of the tablet formulation in reference to PIC and
      to calculate the single dose of TAK-931 tablet to be used in Part 2.In Part 2, participants
      will be assigned to 1 of the 2 following treatment sequences:

        -  TAK-931 TBD Fed + TAK-931 TBD Fasted

        -  TAK-931 TBD Fasted + TAK-931 TBD Fed

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the Netherlands. The overall time to participate
      in this study is approximately 2 years. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic
      and will be contacted for approximately 30 days after receiving their last dose of study drug
      or until the start of subsequent anticancer therapy, whichever occurs first for a follow up
      assessment.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Adult participants with histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic or
             locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors for whom there is no available standard
             treatment with proven survival benefit, this therapy is not indicated, or it is
             refused by the participant. Based on the nonclinical data, the following indications
             may have a higher probability of clinical benefit: high-grade serous ovarian cancer,
             uterine carcinosarcoma, squamous esophageal cancer, squamous non-small cell lung
             carcinoma (NSCLC), rectal adenocarcinoma, and in general tumors with known tumor
             protein 53 (TP53) gene mutations. For any of these preferred indications, participants
             should have exhausted standard therapeutic options with a proven survival benefit.

          2. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 1.

          3. Recovered to Grade 1 or baseline from all toxic effects of previous therapy (except
             alopecia or neuropathy).

          4. Suitable venous access for the study-required blood sampling including pharmacokinetic
             (PK) and pharmacodynamic sampling.

          5. Must have a radiographically or clinically evaluable tumor, but measurable disease as
             defined by RECIST v1.1 is not required for participation in this study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Participants who require continuous use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) or
             histamine-2 (H2) receptor antagonists and participants who are taking PPIs within 5
             days before the first dose of study drug.

          2. Treatment with clinically significant enzyme inducers, such as phenytoin,
             carbamazepine, enzalutamide, mitotane, ritonavir, rifampin, or St John's wort within
             14 days before the first dose of study drug.

          3. With treated brain metastases are eligible if there is no evidence of progression for
             at least 4 weeks after central nervous system-directed treatment, as ascertained by
             clinical examination and brain imaging (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] or CT) during
             the screening period.

          4. Part 2 only: known hypersensitivity to PPIs (example, angioedema or anaphylaxis have

    <ipd_description>Takeda makes patient-level, de-identified data sets and associated documents available after applicable marketing approvals and commercial availability have been received, an opportunity for the primary publication of the research has been allowed, and other criteria have been met as set forth in Takeda's Data Sharing Policy (see www.TakedaClinicalTrials.com/Approach for details). To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias. Once approved, qualified researchers who sign a data sharing agreement are provided access to these data in a secure research environment.</ipd_description>
