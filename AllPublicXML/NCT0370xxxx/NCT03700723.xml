      Phase 2a study to assess the safety and efficacy of IV infused spray-dried solvent/detergent
      -treated plasma (Resusix) when compared with an equal volume of plasma frozen within 24 hours
      after phlebotomy (FP24) in patients with liver disease who are actively bleeding or who
      require prophylaxis for surgical bleeding
