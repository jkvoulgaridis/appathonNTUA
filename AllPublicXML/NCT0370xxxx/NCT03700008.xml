  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Trial to prove the functionality and efficacy of a content-free speech analysis tool to
      detect problematic mental health status or phases of patients with pre known or unknown
      mental health disorders, focussed on affective disorders or neurodevelopmental disorders. The
      participants talk in free speech to the tool, this will be analyzed content-free and compared
      with psychological instruments to detect the mental status in conventional way.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants with and without pre known mental disorders will be recruited and analyzed with
      speech analysis and conventional psychological instruments, as primary measurement the
      SCL-90-Scale, as secondary instruments the PRIME-MD (explicit in use the PHQ-9 for depressive
      symptoms and the GAD-7 for anxiety), B5T and an ADHD-VAS-Score (t0). Then the investigators
      check the status of the participants later at t1 (4-6 weeks after t0) and t2 (4-6 weeks after
      t1).

      The speech measuring instruments is the &quot;VoiceSense&quot; digital voice analysis tool, which
      enables the analysis of 200 specific speech parameters and the assessment of the findings
      through the use of psychometric instruments and questionnaires.

      The hypothesis is that the data of the voicesense analysis tool compared to the psychological
      instruments provide a good match and the voicesense technique can be used as a predictive and
      course-description tool in mental illness.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Global scores of Symptom-Checklist 90 (SCL-90)</measure>
    <time_frame>score at the date of start of participation (day 1)</time_frame>
    <description>The SCL-90 evaluates the psychological distress during the past seven days using nine scales for primary symptom dimensions and three scores among global distress indices. The basic psychological distress is determined by the GSI (Global Severity Index), the intensity of the responses by the PSDI (Positive Symptom Distress Index) and by the PST (Positive Symptom Total). The global scales provide an overview of the severity of the psychological distress. The scores ranged from 0.0 to 2.9 (GSI), 0-90 (PSI) and 0.0-2.9 (PSDI), all were calculated in T-values, so no cut-off but reliable T-values are published.</description>

    <measure>Global score of depression measured with the &quot;Patients-Health-Questionnaire 9&quot; (PHQ9)</measure>
    <time_frame>score at the date of start of participation (day 1)</time_frame>
    <description>The PHQ-9 is a diagnostic tool, extracted from the PRIME-MD of Spitzer et al., used in DSM-5-diagnostic criteria for defining major depressive disorder. There is a Range from 9 to 36, the cut off for diagnosis of depressive disorder is 15</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Global score of anxiety, measured with the &quot;Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7&quot; GAD-7</measure>
    <time_frame>score at the date of start of participation (day 1)</time_frame>
    <description>The GAD-7 is a diagnostic tool, extracted from the PRIME-MD of Spitzer et al., used in many studies and clinical practice to identify anxiety disorders. There is a Range from 7 to 21, the cut off for diagnosis of anxiety disorder is 9 (cutoff score 10-&gt; sensitivity 89%, specificity 82%, test-retest reliability with ICC=0.83)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Personality disorders and states, measured with the Big five personality test (B5T)</measure>
    <time_frame>score at the date of start of participation (day 1)</time_frame>
    <description>The B5T is a diagnostic tool to measure the impact of personality traits extraversion, consciousness, neuroticism, openess, agreeableness and three special motivational scales. There are 72 items, the overall-consistency is good, the test is evaluated in a german population sample with N= 7400.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visuel analogue scale Attention-Deficit-Hyperactivity-Disorder (ADHD-VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>score at the date of start of participation (&quot;day 1&quot;)</time_frame>
    <description>The ADHD-VAS is a compressed form to ask the three core-parameters of ADHD in participants with diagnosed adult ADHD, hyperactivity, impulsivity/emotional stability and inattention. There are three visual scores, ranges from 0 to 10 each, cut-off is 4 each.</description>

    <measure>Changes of global scores of Symptom-Checklist 90 (SCL-90)</measure>

    <description>The SCL-90 evaluates the psychological distress during the past seven days using nine scales for primary symptom dimensions and three scores among global distress indices. The basic psychological distress is determined by the GSI (Global Severity Index), the intensity of the responses by the PSDI (Positive Symptom Distress Index) and by the PST (Positive Symptom Total).
