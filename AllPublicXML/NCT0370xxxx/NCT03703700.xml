      This will be a multi-center double-blind randomized controlled trial, which aims to explore
      the application of Zishen Yutai Pill in controlled ovarian stimulation and effect on
      pregnancy outcome in aged women undergoing in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer.The target
      population will be infertile women aged between 35 and 42 years, BMI＜28kg/m2 and bilateral
      ovaries who undergo IVF-ET (long or antagonist protocol). Qualified 1,466 patients are
      randomized into either of two groups.They will be randomized to receive either Zishen Yutai
      Pill or the placebo. The pregnancy test results and pregnancy complications will be followed
      up by checking medical records and telephone calls.
