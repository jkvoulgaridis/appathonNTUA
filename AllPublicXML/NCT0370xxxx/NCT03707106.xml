  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) combined with medication is an established intervention
      for smoking cessation. However, long-term abstinence rates of maximum 35% are yielded.
      Moreover, acceptance of drug treatment is partly very low. Professional recommendation of
      drug treatment besides nicotine-replacement aids is restrained considering side effects and
      contraindications. Currently, cue exposure is highly discussed as intervention for craving
      reduction supporting CBT. There is evidence for benefits of cue exposure optimizing smoking
      cessation outcomes, as well as evidence for efficacy of exposure in virtual reality (VR) up
      to date.

      However, this is the first randomized controlled study focusing on efficacy increases by VR
      cue exposure supporting an established CBT smoking cessation manual. The control group
      receives a specific stress reduction treatment (independent of smoking cues), namely, the
      Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR, according to Jacobson) additionally to the established
      smoking cessation CBT.
