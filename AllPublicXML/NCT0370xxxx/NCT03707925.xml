  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As our population ages and we diagnose early lung cancer in patients who cannot undergo
      surgery due to multiple medical conditions, there is growing interest in minimally invasive
      modalities to treat these tumors. In this study we are assessing the ability of bronchoscopic
      laser ablation to kill the cancer cells in these tumors. Patients will undergo bronchoscopy
      (a tube-like instrument inserted through the mouth to view the inside of the trachea, air
      passages, and lungs). A thin catheter will be passed through the wind-pipes and into the lung
      tumor with computed tomography guidance. A laser probe is then passed through this catheter
      and it is used to destroy the tumor with heat. Patients will then undergo lung surgery with
      resection of the tumor, and the resected specimen will be reviewed to describe the amount of
      tumor-kill produced by the laser.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the pathologic changes that result from bronchoscopic laser ablation of
      peripheral lung tumors focusing on the proportion of complete tumor ablation.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety of this technique by describing both procedure-related complications
      such as bleeding or pneumothorax and post-procedure adverse effects such as fever or
      pneumonitis.

      II. To assess the pathologic changes observed in the lung tissue surrounding the treated lung
      tumor.

      III. To assess radiographic changes observed by cone-beam computed tomography (CT)
      immediately after the application of bronchoscopic laser ablation.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo bronchoscopic laser ablation following standard bronchoscopy and
      endobronchial ultrasound. Patients also undergo CBCT before and after laser ablation. 48-72
      hours after the procedure, patients undergo standard surgical resection of the lung tumor.

    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Pathologic changes will be categorized into three groups: 1. Complete Ablation: absence of staining (anti-mitochondria antibody [MAB] 1273 or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-hydrogen [NADH], or both) of tumor cells. 2. Quasi-Complete Ablation: positive staining of 10% of tumor cells. 3. Incomplete ablation: positive staining in &gt; 10% of tumor cells. Will conduct extensive descriptive analyses of the data collected. Will calculate the appropriate summary statistics and 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for the measures of interest.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Will be graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). Will be measured by serious adverse effects (SAE), defined as pneumothorax requiring chest tube, bleeding requiring balloon tamponade or leading to respiratory failure, and hypoxemia during bronchoscopy, post-bronchoscopy pneumonitis with need of supplemental oxygen.</description>
