  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label study will evaluate the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profile of
      CM4620-IE in patients with acute pancreatitis. The first five (5) patients will receive ≤
      2.08 mg/kg of CM4620-IE by continuous IV infusion on Day 1. If necessary, up to an additional
      4 patients may be treated at a different dose of CM4620-IE as determined by the obtained PK
      and PD data. The infusion of CM4620-IE will start within 12 hours from the time the patient
      or LAR provides informed consent.
