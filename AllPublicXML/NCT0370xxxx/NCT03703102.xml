    <description>In the EASI assessment, the severity of 4 elements of eczema (erythema, induration/papulation, excoriation, and lichenification) at each of 4 body regions (head and neck, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities) will be assessed on a scale of 0 to 3 (0 = None , 1 = Mild, 2 = Moderate, 3 = Severe). Half scores (1.5 and 2.5) are allowed, with the exception of 0.5. Any signs must be at least 1 (mild) in severity. In addition, the extent of eczema at each of the 4 body regions will be assessed on a scale of 0 to 6 (0 = 0%, 1 = 1% to 9%, 2 = 10% to 29%, 3 = 30% to 49%, 4 = 50% to 69%, 5 = 70% to 89%, 6 = 90% to 100%).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>In the SCORAD assessment, the extent of AD will be calculated as the sum of the percentage of each defined body area, with a maximum score of 100% (assigned as &quot;A&quot; in the overall SCORAD calculation). The severity of 6 specific symptoms of AD will be assessed using the following scale: 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe, with a maximum score of 18 (assigned as &quot;B&quot; in the overall SCORAD calculation). Itch and sleeplessness will be assessed by subjects on a visual analogue scale (VAS), where 0 is no itch (or sleeplessness) and 10 is the worst imaginable itch (or sleeplessness), with a maximum score of 20 (assigned as &quot;C&quot; in the overall SCORAD calculation). The SCORAD score is calculated as A/5 + 7B/2 + C.</description>
