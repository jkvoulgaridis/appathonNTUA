  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Post Marketing Study is to study the safety and effectiveness of the
      ACRYSOF IQ PanOptix intraocular lens (IOL) in an Indian population.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study population will consist of adult Indian males and females, at least 18 years of age
      or older at the time of screening, with no ocular pathology that could confound study
      outcomes, who are advised bilateral cataract extraction and who desire an IOL that provides
      the potential for correction of near, intermediate, and distance vision. Both eyes will be
      implanted. The second eye surgery will take place 15-30 days after the first eye surgery.
      Subjects will be followed for approximately 3 months after the second eye surgery. Total
      individual subject participation will be approximately 4 months. This study will be conducted
      in India.
