    <textblock>
      This is a Pilot Phase III single-blind randomized controlled clinical trial in patients, aged
      18 years and older, presenting with symptoms of apical periodontitis. The overall goal is to
      assess whether 2% Chlorhexidine (CHX) is superior to Calcium Hydroxide in reducing
      interappointment pain.

      This is a Pilot Phase III single-blind randomized controlled clinical trial in patients, aged
      18 years and older, presenting with symptoms of apical periodontitis. Patients will be
      treated with one of two current clinically-used medications, 2% chlorohexidine (intervention)
      vs. calcium hydroxide (standard-of-care). One week following treatment (+/- 2 days), patients
      will return for reevaltuion of apical periodontitis symptoms, via patient's pain perception
      after a bite test.

      The primary objective of the proposed study is to determine if there is a difference in 7-day
      (+/- 2) post-procedure apical periodontitis following randomization to either 2%
      chlorohexidine vs. calcium hydroxide paste among patients presenting with symptoms of apical
      periodontitis. Additionally, the investigators will assess the number of adverse events that
      occur in each treatment group to determine if there appears to be a difference across groups,
      descriptively.

    <description>The endpoint for the proposed study will be self-reported pain post-bite test, as recorded on the visual analog scale (VAS) 7 (+/- 2) days post treatment. We will be using the Visual Analog Scale (range 1-100) and plan to analyze this as a continuous variable to maintain maximum statistical power.</description>
