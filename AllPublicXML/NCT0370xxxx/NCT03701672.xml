  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain is a significant problem for a large part of the adult population. Opioids are
      the mainstay of therapy for moderate to severe pain because of their safety, multiple routes
      of administration, reliability, and effectiveness for all types of pain. However, there is a
      wide variation in treatment response and a high frequency of side effects associated with the
      use of opioids. Thus it is important to identify patients who will experience successful pain
      control with treatment. Unfortunately, as of today no robust objective measures exist for the
      assessment of the pain-relieving effect of opioids. The pain treatment offered to any given
      patient is thus largely dependent on the treating physician's experience and the primary pain
      diagnosis, rather than the characteristics of the individual patient. Unfortunately, this
      strategy often leads to inadequate treatment, side effects and distress. An implementable
      clinical tool that can predict and distinguish successful pain control with opioid treatment
      is therefore warranted.

      Quantitative sensory testing (QST) is a method to evaluate the individual pain system. It has
      been successfully used to describe the problems of individual variation in pain and to
      predict and measure the responses to an intervention. The investigators recently examined how
      advanced analyses of QST and pain-related catastrophic thinking could predict opioid response
      in chronic pain patients whom had not previously received opioid treatment. This study showed
      that the effect of opioid treatment was predicted by certain pain system responses,
      catastrophic thinking related to pain and brainwave patterns. The investigators now want to
      expand on this study by including all patients assigned to opioid treatment by their treating
      physician. The investigators are also increasing their data collection and using a more
      elaborate pain system characterization, investigating pain-relevant psychological factors and
      sleep patter by questionnaires, socio-demographic parameters and collecting descriptive
      genetic information.

      The overall goal of the ABILITY-2 study is to help improve pain diagnostics and treatment by
      developing an implementable algorithm based on individual patient characteristics to be used
      in the clinic. The investigators hypothesize that successful pain control with opioids can be
      predicted before treatment initiation with advanced analyses of QST, pain-related
      psychological factors and socio-demographic data.

    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>The absolute and percentage change from baseline in ratings of health-related quality of life in the past week at Day 30. A subjectively significant change in QLQ-C30 scores is one that is ≥10 from baseline.The QLQ-C30 is composed of both multi-item scales and single-item measures. These include five functional scales, three symptom scales, a global health status / QoL scale, and six single items.
Each of the multi-item scales includes a different set of items - no item occurs in more than one scale. All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level. Thus a high score for a functional scale represents a high / healthy level of functioning, a high score for the global health status / QoL represents a high QoL, but a high score for a symptom scale / item represents a high level of symptomatology / problems.</description>
