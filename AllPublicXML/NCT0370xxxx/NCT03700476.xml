    <textblock>
      This trial plans to enroll 420 patients with stage III-IVA (AJCC 8th, except T3N0-1 or T4N0)
      locoregionally-advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (LANPC). Patients will be randomized in a
      1:1 ratio to receive 3 cycles of induction chemotherapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin and
      concurrent cisplatin-radiation or the same regimen plus Sintilimab. All patients will receive
      intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). Sintilimab will begin on day 1 of induction
      chemotherapy and continue every 3 weeks for 12 cycles, including 3 cycles before, 3 cycles
      concurrent with, and 6 cycles after IMRT.

    <measure>Quality of life (QoL)</measure>
    <time_frame>16 months</time_frame>
    <description>The change of QoL from randomization to 12 months after chemoradiation. The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer quality of life questionnaire-C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30）version 3.0 will be used. This questionnaire comprises 30 questions, 24 of which are aggregated into nine multi-question scales, that is, five functioning scales (e.g., physical), three symptom scales (e.g., fatigue) and one global health status scale. The remaining six single-question (e.g., dyspnoea) scales assess symptoms. These 15 scales will be scored according to the official Scoring Manual: 1. Estimate the average of the questions that contribute to the scale; this is the raw score. 2. Use a linear transformation to standardise the raw score, so that scores range from 0 to 100. Thus, a high score for a functional scale represents a high level of functioning, a high score for the global health status represents a high QoL, but a high score for a symptom scale represents a high level of problems.</description>
