  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spinal cord (SC) involvement is prevalent in multiple sclerosis (MS) and contributes
      importantly to disease progression. To be able reliably evaluate spinal cord volume and its
      changes in MS patients we need to understand variability of these parameters in sex and age
      matched healthy controls (HC). To date, no generally available data about these parameters in
      HC are available.

      The objective of this study is to investigate age and sex matched HC by MRI to get the basic
      set of the data representing both cross sectional values and its longitudinal changes.

      The present study will also investigate different strategies how to normalize the absolute
      spinal cord and brain volume data, what is a relationship between spinal cord volume and
      brain volume and what is the best protocol to be used in a routine clinical practice.
