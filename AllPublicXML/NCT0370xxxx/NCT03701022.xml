  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-center, nonrandomized, Phase 2 study to evaluate efficacy and
      safety of SHR-1210 combined with Apatinib in subjects with relapsed or refractory NK/T cell
      lymphoma.Efficacy will be assessed every 8 weeks according to 2014 Lugano criteria.Safety
      evaluations (both clinical and laboratory) are performed at baseline, before each study
      treatment, and throughout the study.

      The primary objective of this phase 2 study is to assess objective response rate of SHR-1210
      combined with Apatinib in patients with relapsed or refractory NK/T cell lymphoma. The
      secondary objective is to observe time to response,progression free survival rate at 2
      years,overall survival rate at 2 years，safety and immunogenicity of SHR-1210 combined with
      Apatinib in relapsed or refractory NK/T cell lymphoma.
