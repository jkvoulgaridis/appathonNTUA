  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a phase II trial testing if the combination of stereotactic ablative body
      radiotherapy (SABR) and L19-IL2 improve the progression-free survival in patients with
      limited metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The trial consists of one cohort with
      two arms; C-arm and an E-arm.

      Patients with oligometastatic disease will receive SABR to minimal 1 and max all metastatic
      sites (max 5 sites irradiated) and patients with diffuse metastatic lesions (6 to max 10)
      will receive radiotherapy to max 5 sites. In the experimental arm, immunotherapy will be
      given after irradiation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      IMMUNOSABR will include 126 patients. In this single-stage controlled randomised open-label
      phase II trial, we aim to demonstrate an absolute increase in progression-free survival
      (primary endpoint). PFS will be determined as the time between randomisation and disease
      progression, according to RECIST 1.1, death due to any cause or last patient contact alive
      and progression-free. Patients will be randomized between control (no immunocytokine) and
      experimental arms (with immunocytokine L19-IL2) in a 1:1 ratio. The accrual period will be 29
      months (or 2.41 years), and the minimum follow-up will be 18 months (or 1.5 years), making
      the total study duration 47 months. Comparison between control and experimental arms will be
      made using the Log-Rank statistic. This test for superiority will be one-sided with the
      desired type I error of 0.10 and power of 0.90.

      Patients enrolled in the trial will be randomised into the control arm (C-arm) or
      experimental arm (E-arm).

        -  C-arm: Standard of Care (SOC) according to the local and national guidelines: (wait and
           see or surgery and/or chemotherapy and/or standard (symptomatic) radiotherapy and/or
           SABR, oligometastatic disease.

        -  E-arm: Standard of Care (SOC) SABR (oligometastatic disease) or radiotherapy (diffuse
           disease) + L19-IL2 up to 6 cycles (+ aPD(L)1 if SOC)

      The expected 1.5-year PFS is 15% in the C-arm and 35% in the E-arm. A sample size of 116
      patients (58 patients per treatment arm) is needed to show this difference of 20% in PFS,
      using a logrank test with a two-sided alpha of 0.05 and power of 85%. Patients will be evenly
      divided over the two arms. Assuming a drop-out rate of 10%, a total of 126 patients (63 per
      arm) need to be included.

      Primary objective The main objective of the trial is to test if the activity of the
      combination of (SAB)R and L19-IL2 in patients with metastatic NSCLC will result in improved
      progression-free survival (PFS) compared to the SOC.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  Assessment of the PFS of the patient cohort, at 5 years after randomisation.

        -  Assessment of the overall survival of the patient cohort, at 5 years after
           randomisation.

        -  To assess the toxicity of this treatment schedule;

        -  To assess Quality of Life (QoL);

        -  To assess the occurrence of an Out of Field Radio-Immune (OFRI) response / abscopal
           effect using imaging;

        -  To assess the occurrence of an In Field Radio-Immune (IFRI) response using imaging;

        -  To perform correlative biomarker studies related to treatment response.

      Exploratory endpoints:

        -  Correlative biomarker studies:

             -  Tumour tissue: e.g EDB expression, non-synonymous mutations, immune monitoring;

             -  Blood: e.g. EDB expression, cfDNA, and immune monitoring;

             -  Radiomics on CT and if available MRI;

             -  Faeces: diversity in microbiota.

        -  iRECIST

        -  Tumour grow kinetics

    <intervention_model_description>This will be a multicentre, randomised controlled open-label phase II trial testing if the combination of (SAB)R and immunocytokine L19-IL2 improves the progression-free survival in patients with limited metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The patients included in the trial will be stratified for the metastatic load (oligo; max 5 or diffuse; 6-10 metastases). After randomisation, patients will be assigned either to the experimental arm or the standard of care (SOC) arm. Depending on the metastatic load, patients with (max 5 metastases) will receive in the experimental arm SABR to all lesions followed by L19-IL2 followed by standard of care therapy. Patients with more extensive metastatic disease (6 to up to 10 metastasis) in the experimental arm will be included following first or second line treatment with a platinum doublet and receive radiotherapy (3x8 Gy) to at least one (symptomatic) lesion, followed by L19-IL2 followed by SOC.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The EORTC QLQ assesses health-related QoL of cancer patients; it consists of 30 items and covers 9 domains + 6 single symptoms. There are 5 functional scales: physical, role functioning, cognitive, emotional, social; 3 symptom scales: fatigue, pain, nausea + vomiting; a global health and QoL scale, and 6 single items. Each item has four response alternatives: 1) not at all, 2) a little 3) quite a bit 4) very much (score 1-4 with range 3); except for the global health-status/quality of life scale, which has options ranging from 1) very poor to 7) excellent (score 1-7, range 6). Answers are combined into dimensions and scores are linearly transformed into a score of 0 to 100 according to the scoring manual of the EORTC QoL group. For functional and global QoL scales, higher scores mean better level of functioning. For symptom-oriented scales, a higher score means more severe symptoms. Scores are reported as mean and standard deviation. Scores will be used in multilevel-analysis.</description>

             therefore should be avoided. However, patients who develop life-threatening signs or
             symptoms may be treated with dexamethasone until toxicity resolves or reduces to an
             acceptable level (generally grade 1 and 2, however must be based at the research
             physician's discretion).

          -  History of allergy to intravenously administered proteins/peptides/antibodies/
             radiographic contrast media.

          -  HIV positive; active HIV infection, or active hepatitis B or C (assessed in local
             lab).

          -  Systemic treatment with either corticosteroid (&gt;10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or
             Interferon alpha or immunosuppressive medications within 14 days prior to
             randomisation. Topical or inhalation steroids are allowed. If a patient needs to take
             unexpectedly immunosuppressive medication during the trial, it will be allowed but
             decreasing the dose as soon as possible is strongly advised.

          -  Prior history of organ transplant, including autologous stem cell transplant.

          -  Acute or sub-acute coronary syndromes within the last year, acute inflammatory heart
             disease, heart insufficiency NYHA &gt; 2, or irreversible cardiac arrhythmias.

          -  A known impaired cardiac function defined as left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)
             &lt; 50 % (or below the study site's lower limit of normal) as measured by MUGA or ECHO.

          -  Uncontrolled hypertensive disease; (systolic blood pressure (SBP) ‚â•160 or diastolic
             blood pressure (DBP) ‚â•100 mm Hg during two measurements).

          -  History or evidence of active autoimmune disease.

          -  Severe diabetic retinopathy (neoangiogenesis targeted by L19 outside the tumour).

          -  Major trauma, including oncologic surgery, but excluding smaller procedures like the
             placement of porth-√†-cath or surgical biopsy, within 4 weeks prior to randomisation
             (neoangiogenesis targeted by L19 outside a tumour).

          -  Any underlying mental, medical or psychiatric condition which in the opinion of the
             investigator will make administration of study drug hazardous or hinder the
             interpretation of study results. Unstable or serious concurrent uncontrolled medical
             conditions.

          -  Pregnancy or breast feeding; it is well known that ED-B, the target of both L19IL2, is
             expressed in a variety of fetal tissues. Furthermore, anti-PD(L)1 treatment may
             increase the risk of immune-mediated disorders. Therefore, it will be contra-indicated
             for pregnant or lactating women.
