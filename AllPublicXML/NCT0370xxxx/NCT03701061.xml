      The study is a prospective single site exploratory study to examine the impact of Food and
      Drug Administration (FDA) approved seasonal flu vaccine on the immune responses of H5N1
      vaccine previously received with or without the AS03 adjuvant.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Influenza, caused by the influenza virus, is a contagious respiratory disease that can result
      in mild to severe illness. It is estimated that up to 80,000 deaths and approximately 200,000
      Americans are hospitalized annually due to complications. Vaccination is the most effective
      way of controlling flu and preventing its illness and complications; however, antibody
      responses to seasonal influenza vaccines decrease over time and only target a small number of
      antibody binding sites In 2015, the Hope Clinic of the Emory Vaccine Center completed a study
      analyzing human immune responses to a pandemic H5N1, or &quot;bird flu&quot; vaccine, either alone or
      combined with the GlaxoSmithKline adjuvant system 03 (AS03).

      Participants that took part in the 2013 HIPCVAX-010 Systems Biology of Influenza A (H5N1)
      Virus Monovalent Vaccine with and without AS03 Adjuvant study will be enrolled in this study
      to assess the effect of seasonal influenza vaccine in shaping the immune responses. The study
      aims to address important immunological mechanisms that can assist scientists in the creation
      of a universal influenza vaccine.

    <description>Serious adverse events are recorded from Day 1 post vaccination to Day 365 post vaccination. A serious adverse event is any adverse event that results in death, is life threatening, results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, results in hospitalization or prolongs an existing hospitalization, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or is considered an &quot;other important medical event&quot; based on medical judgement.</description>
