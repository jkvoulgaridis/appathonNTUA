  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial evaluates the learning effectiveness of three different
      types of Colposcopy simulators objectively with Objective Structured Assessment of Technical
      Skill (OSATS) and subjectively with self-reported confidence survey. A total of 60
      participants, randomly assigned into 3 groups, will learn from Hefler's, Reeve's or authors'
      simulators. The investigators hypothesize that the proposed simulator affords better learning
      objectively and subjectively with improved functional fidelity.

      Colposcopy and colposcopic treatment is a unique skill that is acquired only following
      careful training. A colposcopist plays an important role to correctly diagnose, take
      appropriate biopsies and perform appropriate safe and effective treatment of women with
      preinvasive cervical disease. However, no surgical treatment comes without risk and
      colposcopy treatment is no different. Risks from a colposcopy treatment can include
      intraoperative complication such as bleeding, injury to surrounding organs by the instrument
      used i.e. laser burns, diathermy burns and damage to bladder, rectum, vulva or vagina. Other
      complication may include insufficient tissue excised or ablated during treatment leading to
      failure of cure and risk of recurrent treatment. Recurrent treatment especially excisional
      treatment has been shown to increase the risk of preterm labour for future pregnancies. In
      view of this, training in colposcopy and colposcopy treatment is a crucial part of effective
      cervical cancer prevention.

      In this study, the investigators aim to determine if Hefler's, Reeve's or authors' simulators
      are more effective at supporting the colposcopy training. The significance of the result lies
      in the effectiveness of training simulator for colposcopy training and the confidence of
      doctors when they perform their first colposcopy.
