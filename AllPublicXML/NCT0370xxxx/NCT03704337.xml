      Fit-joy is a commercially available food bar marketed as having a low glycemic index and
      being relatively high in dietary fiber. The fiber contained within this product is
      isomalto-oligosaccharides (IMO) which is a food ingredient with a relative sweetness level
      equal to approximately 60% of sucrose. Chemically, IMO is a mixture of glucose oligomers with
      alpha - (1-6) - linkages. Short and hard exercise produces muscle damage and soreness. The
      Fit-joy bar contains whey protein that previous research in the investigator's lab showed may
      be able to decrease the muscle damaging effects of exercise while also helping with muscle
      growth. The purpose of this study will be to determine if eating a Fit-joy bar before and in
      the middle of a hard weight training workout will promote positive results during the workout
      and 48 hours after the workout.

Participants were instructed to scribe one clear mark bisecting the line which represented their pain level the best for each of the three pressure application sites.
