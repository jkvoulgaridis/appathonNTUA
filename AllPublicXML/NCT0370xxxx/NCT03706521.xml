  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase 2 study is a single center, open-label study of SM04690 injected intraarticularly
      (IA) into the target knee (most painful) joint of moderately to severely symptomatic
      osteoarthritis (OA) subjects at a single dose of 0.07 mg SM04690 per 2 mL injection. This
      study will utilize three-dimensional spoiled gradient recalled (3D-SPGR) pulse sequence
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), radiographs and patient reported outcomes (PROs) to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of SM04690.
