  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALRP) is a surgical technique for the
      treatment of prostate cancer. The aim of this study was to report our initial experience with
      RALRP, by applying the concept of pentafecta. Pentafecta consists of the five main outcomes
      in the postoperative period of RALRP: erectile dysfunction, urinary incontinence,
      postoperative complications, surgical margins and biochemical failure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will describe a initial experience in RALRP in Brazilian University Hospital. The
      follow-up of patients was performed as an examination at the medical consultation every three
      months. Complications were categorized according to the Clavien classification system.
      Biochemical failure was established by PSA level. Continence was defined as patients who
      remain dry and who do not require any kind of protection in their everyday activities. Sexual
      potency was defined as the ability to get and keep an erection for long enough to have
      satisfying sexual relations with or without the use of type-5 phosphodiesterase inhibitors
      (PDE-5) and a Sexual Health Inventory for Men (SHIM) score greater or equal to 21. Positive
      surgical margin is defined as the presence of neoplastic glands in direct contact with the
      ink on the surface of the piece, with no interposed connective tissue.
