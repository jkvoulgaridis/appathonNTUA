    <textblock>
      Berberine is an isoquinoline alkaloid extracted from medicinal herbs, has been demonstrated
      to produce beneficial effects on diabetes and hyperlipidemia, fewer study reported its
      modification on lipid metabolism in schizophrenia. Metformin, have been used for metabolic
      abnormalities in schizophrenia, findings from these studies indicated that they did have some
      effect,which are still in experimental stage.This study is aim to compare the efficacy and
      safety of berberine and metformin for preventing metabolic dysfunction in schizophrenia
      patients.
