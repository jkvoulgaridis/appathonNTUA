    <textblock>
      The objective of this protocol is to develop an institution-wide liquid biopsy protocol that
      will establish a common process for collecting blood and corresponding archived tumor
      specimens for future research studies at the University Health Network's Princess Margaret
      Cancer Centre. Circulating cell-free nucleic acids (cfNA), including cell-free DNA (cfDNA)
      and cell-free RNA (cfRNA), are non-invasive, real-time biomarkers that can provide diagnostic
      and prognostic information before cancer diagnosis, during cancer treatment, and at disease
      progression. Cancer research scientists and clinicians at the Princess Margaret are
      interested in incorporating the collection of peripheral blood samples (&quot;liquid biopsies&quot;)
      into research protocols as a means of non-invasively assessing tumor progression and response
      to treatment at multiple time points during a patient's course of disease.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with either histological confirmation of a solid tumor or hematological
             malignancy, OR patients identified as high-risk for cancer (based on identified
             aberration in cancer predisposition gene or on hormonal and/or family history without
             known aberration).

          2. Patient must be â‰¥ 18 years old.

          3. All patients must have signed and dated an informed consent form for this LIBERATE
             study.

          4. If patients are being co-consented for a separate primary research study listed in
             Appendix I, they must fulfill the eligibility criteria for that separate primary
             research study. If there is a discrepancy in the eligibility criteria between
             protocols, the separate primary research study's criteria take precedence.
