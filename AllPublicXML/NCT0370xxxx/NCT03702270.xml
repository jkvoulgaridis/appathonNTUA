  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently it is estimated that at least 25 million people in the United States are labeled as
      penicillin allergic although less than 1.5 million of these are truly allergic. Although
      combined skin testing and oral challenge is an evidence-based de-labeling strategy the high
      burden of penicillin allergy labels means these services are available only through specialty
      allergy practices. There is therefore a need to provide evidence for alternative penicillin
      de-labeling strategies such as direct oral challenge. Previous studies have utilized
      quasi-experimental designs. Test dose challenges are currently recommended as a strategy for
      removal of low risk drug allergies, but the current experience is limited to single arm
      observational studies and evidence-based strategies for identifying low risk patients are
      lacking. Our objective is to demonstrate the benefit of providing risk stratification in
      removing penicillin allergy labels for low risk penicillin allergy patients in a randomized
      controlled trial.

    <intervention_model_description>During the trial, randomization will occur using a stepped wedge cluster randomized controlled trial design. Medical units at VUMC will assigned to clusters. A single cluster will be selected for intervention at the outset of the trial. Subsequent additional clusters will first contribute to the control group, and be selected to randomly cross over to the intervention group at regular intervals of 2 months.</intervention_model_description>
