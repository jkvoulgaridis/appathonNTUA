  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) often drastically disrupts the lives of affected patients and
      their relatives and caregivers. This observational study will provide new knowledge on how
      patients and their family caregivers cope in the first years after injury in terms of work
      inclusion, participation, care giver burden and quality of life. This project will utilize
      Norwegian spinal cord injury quality register data and link clinical individual data from the
      quality register to national administrative data on employment and social insurance benefits.

      All individuals in the Norwegian Spinal Cord Injury Registry (NorSCIR) in the period
      2011-2017, meaning that they have already given their consent, will be asked to participate.
      They will be sent a letter with information about the study including a questionnaire.

      In the letter they will also be asked, if they agree, to forward an invitation letter to
      their closest caregiver addressed to &quot;the main family caregiver&quot;.

      Main family caregiver will be defined as persons who are providing unpaid assistance and
      support to the person with a SCI. The letter for the caregiver with information about the
      study, includes a questionnaire. All patients in the NorSCIR and their main caregivers (after
      consent) will be linked to national administrative register to provide data on social
      insurance benefits, education and work.

      Control groups from the general population will be selected and identified in the national
      registries (for both the patient cohort and caregiver cohort). These control groups will be
      used to compare the level of work/benefit over time for patients and caregivers with that of
      the general population. Also, within-person approaches will be used to assess the impact of
      the injury, comparing each participant's status in the period after injury with their own
      status at a time period before injury.
