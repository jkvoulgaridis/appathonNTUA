      Compassionate use access to molibresib/GSK525762 for eligible participant with NUT Midline
      Carcinoma; indication is a seriously debilitating or life-threatening disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigational Product GSK525762 is an orally bioavailable small molecule that is a potent
      inhibitor of the binding of BET proteins to acetylated histones. Binding of GSK525762 induces
      squamous differentiation and inhibits proliferation of patient-derived NMC cell lines both in
      culture and in murine xenografts.

      Compassionate use access to molibresib is restricted to patients with confirmed diagnosis of
      NUT Midline Carcinoma.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Participants meeting all three of the following criteria will be eligible:

               -  Diagnosis of NUT Midline Carcinoma based on ectopic expression of NUT protein as
                  determined by IHC and/or detection of NUT gene translocation as determined by
                  FISH.

               -  there is no satisfactory alternative treatment; and

               -  there is reason to believe that the benefit:risk ratio for molibresib in the
                  indication is positive.

          2. Written informed consent can be obtained from the participant or legally authorised
             representative.

          3. Participant must be ≥16 years of age, at the time of signing the informed consent.

          4. Demonstrate adequate organ function defined as :Hematological Absolute neutrophil
             count (ANC) ≥1.5 X 109/liter (L) ; Platelets ≥100 X 109/L ; Hemoglobin≥9.0 g/deciliter
             ; total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x X ULN (upper limit of normal)(isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5 X ULN
             is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35% or participant
             has a diagnosis of Gilbert's syndrome) ; Alanine transaminase ≤ 2.5 X ULN OR ≤ 5 X ULN
             with documented liver metastases/tumor infiltration; Prothrombin Time (PT) or Partial
             Thromboplastin Time (PTT) ≤ 1.5 X upper limit of normal (ULN); Renal creatinine OR
             calculated creatinine clearance [calculated or directly measured] ≤1.5 X ULN or ≥ 50
             mL/min; Ejection fraction ≥ Lower limit of normal (LLN); Troponin ≤ ULN

          5. Female participants who are not pregnant, breastfeeding and at least one of the
             following applies:

             a. Is not a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) OR Is a WOCBP and using a
             contraceptive method that is highly effective (with a failure rate of &lt;1% per year,
             see Appendix 5), preferably with low user dependency, during the intervention period
             and for at least 7 months after the last dose of molibresib. The investigator should
             evaluate the effectiveness of the contraceptive method in relationship to the first
             dose of molibresib.

          6. Female participants of childbearing potential: Negative highly sensitive serum
             pregnancy test (as required by local regulations) within 72 hours prior to the first
             dose of molibresib.

          7. NOTE: The investigator is responsible for review of medical history, menstrual history
             and recent sexual activity to decrease risk for inclusion of a woman with an early
             undetected pregnancy.

          8. Male participants are eligible to participate if agree to the following during
             intervention period and for at least 16 weeks after the last dose of molibresib:

          9. Refrain from donating sperm

         10. PLUS, if have a female partner of childbearing potential, either:

        Be abstinent from heterosexual intercourse as their preferred and usual lifestyle
        (abstinent on a long term and persistent basis) and agree to remain abstinent -OR- Agree to
        use a male condom and if female partner is not pregnant, partner to use an additional
        highly effective contraceptive method with a failure rate of &lt;1% per year.

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Use of anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin, heparin) at therapeutic levels within 7 days
             prior to the first dose of molibresib. Low dose (prophylactic) anticoagulants (e.g.,
             low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or oral anticoagulants) is permitted. In addition,
             INR must be monitored in accordance with local institutional practices, as
             appropriate.

          2. Concurrent use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) except for cases
             where NSAIDs provide benefit over other analgesics or high dose aspirin (allowed up to
             100 mg PO daily).

          3. Participants with a history of known bleeding disorder(s) or history of clinically
             significant hemorrhage (e.g., GI, neurologic) within the past 6 months.

          4. Evidence of cardiac abnormalities as evidenced by any of the following:

               -  History or current clinically significant conduction abnormalities, uncontrolled
                  arrhythmias or hypertension.

               -  History or evidence of current ≥Class II congestive heart failure as defined by
                  New York Heart Association (NYHA).

               -  Recent history (within the past 3 months) of acute coronary syndromes (including
                  unstable angina and myocardial infarction), coronary angioplasty, or stenting

               -  Baseline QTcF interval ≥480 msec

          5. Current active liver or biliary disease (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or
             asymptomatic gallstones, liver metastases or otherwise stable chronic liver disease
             per investigator assessment).

          6. Evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic diseases (e.g., unstable or uncompensated
             respiratory, hepatic, renal, cardiac disease, or clinically significant bleeding
             episodes). Any serious and/or unstable pre-existing medical or psychiatric disorder,
             or other conditions that could interfere with participant's safety, obtaining informed
             consent or compliance in the opinion of the investigator.

          7. Presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or positive hepatitis C antibody test
             result at screening.

             NOTE: Participants with positive Hepatitis C antibody due to prior resolved disease
             can be enrolled only if a confirmatory negative Hepatitis C RNA PCR is obtained.

          8. History of known HIV infection.

          9. Hemoptysis &gt;1 teaspoon in 24 hours within the last 28 days.

         10. GSK525762 is a benzodiazepine class molecule. Any serious known immediate or delayed
             hypersensitivity reaction(s) to molibresib or idiosyncrasy to drugs chemically related
             to molibresib.
