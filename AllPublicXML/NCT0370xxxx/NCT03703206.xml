    <textblock>
      This is a perspective, randomized, blinded study with a parallel design and an allocation
      ratio of 1 to 1 for the treatment groups to assess the analgesic efficacy of adding the iPACK
      (injection between the popliteal artery and the capsule of the knee) in addition to the
      adductor canal block (ACB) for Total Knee Arthoplasty patients (TKA).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of patients presenting with pain in the back of the knee 6 hours after surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>Six hours after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Each patient will be provided by a colored chart that will have different parts of the knee marked clearly and they will indicate whether the pain they have in which region of the knee. the different regions are ( anterior, posterior, lateral, medial, and the middle of the thigh). it will be marked as a yes or no question. it will be measured as a ratio of patients in each patient who has the pain in the numerator and all patients in the study will be in the denominator</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain score measurement reported by patients</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Average of pain scores over the first 24 hours following the regional anesthetic based on numeric rating scale ( NRS). The scale is from 0 - 10, where 0 is no pain and 10 is the worst pain possible.</description>

    <measure>Quality of recovery (QoR) score</measure>
    <time_frame>one week, measurements are obtained at 24 hours, 48 hours, and one week</time_frame>
    <description>Score of QoR-15 survey to determine recovery status. the questionnaire is a 15 item questionnaire and each question has a score possible from 0-10. It has two parts.Part 1 includes questions from 1-10. the scale on this question ranges from 0=none of the time ( poor) to 10=all the time ( excellent). the second part include questions from 11-15 where the scale goes from 10 to 0, where 10=none of the time ( excellent) and 0=all the time (poor). the total score is obtained by adding the scores of all the 15 questions</description>
