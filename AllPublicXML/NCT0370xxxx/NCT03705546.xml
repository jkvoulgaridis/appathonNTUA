    <measure>The change of quality of life: (EORTC QLQ) core30 (C30)</measure>
    <time_frame>Before surgery (baseline), and 1, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The change of quality of life is measured using the European Organization for Research Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ) core30 (C30). The scale for quality of life is transformed into a score from 0 to 100, derived by 4-point Likert scale. A higher score represents a higher level of quality of life.</description>

    <description>The change of symptom is measured using the European Organization for Research Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ) lung cancer module 13 (LC13). The scale for symptom is transformed into a score from 0 to 100, derived by 4-point Likert scale. A higher score represents a higher level of symptom.</description>
