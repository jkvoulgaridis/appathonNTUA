  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research aims to evaluate the absorption and elimination profile of a bioactive compound
      PEITC in the matrix of Nutri-jelly - a novel edible nutritious gel. Thus, the investigators
      conducted a pharmacokinetic study in 12 head and neck cancer survivors. After consumed a
      serving of Nutri-jelly containing 20 mg PEITC, plasma levels of PEITC at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8,
      12 and 24 hours were specifically measured by ammonia derivatization and analyzed by liquid
      chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Non-compartmental pharmacokinetic analysis was
      performed.

      Î²-phenylethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC) is a phytochemical found in cruciferous vegetables with
      anti-cancer properties in vitro and in vivo. However, its pharmacokinetic profile in cancer
      survivors were unknown. A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in head and neck cancer
      survivors to evaluate the absorption and elimination profile of PEITC in the matrix of
      Nutri-jelly - a novel edible nutritious gel. Twelve head and neck cancer survivors consumed a
      serving of Nutri-jelly containing 20 mg PEITC. Plasma levels of PEITC at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8,
      12 and 24 hours were specifically measured by ammonia derivatization and analyzed by
      LC-MS/MS. Non-compartmental pharmacokinetic analysis was performed. Pharmacokinetic
      parameters including Cmax, Tmax, half-life, clearance were analyzed.
