  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date, no pharmacological agents are proven efficacious in treating perioperative AKI.
      There is a strong biological rationale for the administration of amino acid in the management
      of patients at risk of AKI with increases in renal blood flow and GFR of 25 to 60% for
      several hours after the administration of amino acids (Woods LL 1993) mediated by a afferent
      arteriolar dilation.(Meyer TW 1983) Moreover, animal models have demonstrated that an
      increase in renal blood flow in response to a short-term amino acid infusion can protect the
      kidney from acute ischemic insults. Finally, these nephro-protective effects are preserved in
      critical illness. Cardiac surgery appears to be the best setting to test the likely
      beneficial renal effects of amino acid because of pathophysiological principles and the
      ability to intervene before the injury has begun. Although the etiology of AKI in cardiac
      surgery is multifactorial, renal hypoperfusion is believed to play a major role in this
      development by decreasing renal perfusion through a reduction in renal blood flow and through
      the activation of the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin system with
      afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction. In this setting, a global increase in renal blood flow
      by means of Amino Acid therapy appears a logical and promising intervention.

      The primary aim of the study is to determine whether providing continuous infusion of a
      balanced mixture of amino acids, compared to placebo (balanced crystalloid solution), reduces
      the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients scheduled for cardiac surgery defined
      as KDIGO stage 1 or greater during hospital stay.
