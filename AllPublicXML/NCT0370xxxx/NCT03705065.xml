      This is a Phase 4, randomized, open-label study of bupivacaine HCl administered either by
      instillation into the surgical site or by injection into the surgical site in subjects
      undergoing bilateral submuscular augmentation mammoplasty under general anesthesia.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Is scheduled to undergo primary bilateral submuscular augmentation mammoplasty with
             saline or silicone smooth implants with a volume of 300 to 500 mL, inclusive.

          -  Has an American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status of I, II, or III.

          -  Female subjects are eligible only if not pregnant, not lactating, not planning to
             become pregnant during the study, sterile; or using acceptable contraceptives.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has a planned concurrent surgical procedure (eg, mastopexy).

          -  Has a planned concurrent reconstructive procedure status post breast cancer therapy.

          -  Has a pre-existing concurrent acute or chronic painful physical/restrictive condition
             expected to require analgesic treatment in the postoperative period for pain that is
             not strictly related to the augmentation mammoplasty.

          -  Has a contraindication or a known or suspected history of hypersensitivity or
             clinically significant idiosyncratic reaction to required study medications.

          -  Has been administered bupivacaine within 5 days prior to the scheduled surgery.

          -  Has been administered any local anesthetic within 72 hours prior to the scheduled
             surgery.

          -  Has a medical condition such that, in the opinion of the Investigator, participating
             in the study would pose a health risk to the subject or confound the postoperative
             assessments.

          -  As per subject history and/or medical records, has active infection or is currently
             undergoing treatment for Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, or human immunodeficiency virus
             (HIV).

          -  Has uncontrolled anxiety, psychiatric, or neurological disorder.

          -  Had a malignancy in the last year, with the exception of nonmetastatic basal cell or
             squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or localized carcinoma in situ of the cervix.

          -  Has a known or suspected history of drug abuse, a positive drug screen on the day of
             surgery, or a recent history of alcohol abuse. Note: Subjects with a positive drug
             screen who are taking an allowed, prescribed medication that is known to result in a
             positive drug test (eg, amphetamine and dextroamphetamine for
             attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, benzodiazepine for anxiety disorder) may be
             eligible for participation in the study at the discretion of the Sponsor. Subjects
             taking any marijuana (medical or recreational) are not allowed to participate in the
             study.

          -  Received an investigational product or device in a clinical trial within 30 days or
             within 5 elimination half-lives.

          -  Has undergone 3 or more surgeries within 12 months.

          -  Has a body mass index (BMI) &gt;35 kg/m2.
