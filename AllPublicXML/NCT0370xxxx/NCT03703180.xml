  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Victor2 is an observational cohort study over two years and is designed to investigate
      longitudinal changes of visual impairment in multiple sclerosis (MS). The investigators aim
      to recruit patients in the relapsing-remitting phase of the disease (n=50) as well as
      progressive MS patients (n=50). Both cohorts will be compared with age and gender matched
      healthy controls (HC). All participants undergo yearly clinical assessments including
      standard charts for visual acuity (Sloan, Snellen), a new computer adaptive test measuring
      the complete contrast sensitive function (CSF), optical coherence tomography and a vision
      related quality of life questionnaire (NEI-VFQ). The study aims to validate and extend
      previous finding from a cross-sectional study which found a better association between CSF
      and NEI-VFQ than for standard charts. Moreover, the study is designed to proof also a better
      association with anterior visual system integrity as assessed with OCT.
