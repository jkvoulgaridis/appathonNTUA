               2. Patient with an indication for PCI including angina (stable or unstable), silent
                  ischemia (in absence of symptoms a visually estimated target lesion diameter
                  stenosis of ≥70%, a positive non-invasive stress test, or FFR ≤0.80 must be
                  present), NSTEMI, or recent STEMI. For STEMI the time of presentation to the
                  first treating hospital, whether a transfer facility or the study hospital, must
                  be &gt;24 hours prior to enrollment and enzyme levels (CK-MB or Troponin)
                  demonstrating that either or both enzyme levels have peaked.

               3. An attempt (whether successful or not) was made to implant a 38 mm EluNIR stent
                  (Stent was advanced beyond the guiding catheter).

               4. Non-target vessel PCI are allowed prior to the screening for eligibility
                  depending on the time interval and conditions as follows:

                    1. During Baseline Procedure:

                       PCI of non-target vessels performed during the baseline procedure itself

                       uncomplicated defined as: &lt;50% visually estimated residual diameter
                       stenosis, TIMI Grade 3 flow, no dissection ≥ NHLBI type C, no perforation,
                       no persistent ST segment changes, no prolonged chest pain, no TIMI major or

                  ii. In addition, in cases where non-target lesion PCI has occurred 24-72 hours
                  prior to the baseline procedure, at least 2 sets of cardiac biomarkers must have
                  been drawn at least 6 and 12 hours after the non-target vessel PCI.

                  iii. If cardiac biomarkers are initially elevated above the local laboratory
                  upper limit of normal, serial measurements must demonstrate that the biomarkers
                  are falling.
