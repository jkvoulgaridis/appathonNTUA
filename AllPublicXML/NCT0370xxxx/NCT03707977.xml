      This study will evaluate the impact of two broadly neutralizing antibodies, VRC01LS and
      10-1074, on the maintenance of HIV suppression in a cohort of early-treated children in
      Botswana.

      The primary objectives are as follows:

        1. To conduct an interventional clinical trial to determine the safety, pharmacokinetics,
           dosing and antiviral efficacy of up to 24 weeks of maintenance VRC01LS and 10-1074
           immunotherapy in early-treated HIV-1 infected children in Botswana.

        2. To evaluate effects of treatment with VRC01LS and 10-1074 on the size and cellular
           composition of residual viral reservoirs.

        3. To investigate the influence of VRC01LS and 10-1074 treatment on the magnitude and
           quality of antiviral innate and adaptive immune responses.

      The study includes 4 steps: the pharmacokinetics (PK) Step, Step 1, Step 2, and Step 3. In
      the PK Step, antiretroviral treatment (ART) is continued and 12 study participants will
      undergo safety and PK testing, 6 for each bNAb used in the study (10-1074 and VRC01LS). In
      Step 1, ART is continued and dual bNAb treatment occurs, with PK confirmation of dual bNAb
      dosing for the first 6 participants in Step 1. In Step 2, ART is withdrawn and dual bNAb
      maintenance treatment occurs. In Step 3, dual bNAbs will be discontinued and participants
      will be re-started on ART.

      Participants will be in the study for a minimum of 56 weeks, and a maximum of 98 weeks for
      those who start in the PK step and continue through the study.

    <description>In Step 1, eligible participants will continue to receive ART and will receive both 10-1074 and VRC01LS at Weeks 0, 4, and 8. Following a recommendation from the study team and Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) to increase the maintenance dosing based on the PK Step, a VRC01LS loading dose of 30 mg/kg will be given at the start of Step 1, followed by 15 mg/kg dosing at each 4-weekly visit, and 10-1074 dosing will be at 30 mg/kg at each 4-weekly visit. In Step 2, participants with ongoing viral suppression throughout Step 1 will undergo withdrawal of ART and will continue maintenance 10-1074 (30 mg/kg) and VRC01LS (15 mg/kg) treatment for up to 24 weeks. In Step 3, both 10-1074 and VRC01LS will be discontinued and ART will be re-started.</description>
