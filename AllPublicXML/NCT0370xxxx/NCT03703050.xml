        cohort-specific criteria

        I-1. Histologically confirmed evidence of relapsed/refractory ALK+ ALCL. If biopsy could
        not be performed, relapsed/refractory status should be confirmed by molecular analysis
        whenever possible (increase of MRD quantitative PCR at 2 consecutive measures qualifying
        for a significant increase according to the same reference laboratory, with clinical signs
        and symptoms suggestive of progressing disease). In this case, relapsed/refractory status
        must be reviewed and confirmed by the international coordinating investigator.

        I-2. Age at inclusion &gt; 6 months I-3. No washout needed, but patients must have recovered
        from acute toxic effects of all prior therapy before enrollment into the study. A short
        course of steroids is allowed at the beginning of Nivolumab if it is clinical indicated

        I-4. Adequate organ function:

          -  Peripheral absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥750/μL in patients without bone marrow

          -  Total bilirubin ≤1.5 x ULN in patients without liver involvement and &lt; 2.5 ULN in
             patients with liver involvement

          -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) ≤3 x ULN in
             patients without liver involvement and &lt; 5 ULN in patients with liver involvement

          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase/SGOT ≤3 x ULN
             in patients without liver involvement and &lt; 5 ULN in patients with liver involvement
             I-5. Performance status: Karnofsky performance status (for patients &gt;12 years of age)
             or Lansky Play score (for patients ≤12 years of age) ≥ 40%.

        I-6. Able to comply with the scheduled disease management (treatment and follow-up), and
        with the management of toxicity I-7. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative
        serum β-HCG pregnancy test within 24 hours prior to initiation of treatment. Sexually
        active women of childbearing potential must agree to use acceptable and appropriate
        contraception during the study and for at least 5 months after the last study treatment
        administration. Sexually active males patients must agree to use condom during the study
        and for at least 7 months after the last study treatment administration. I-8. Written
        informed consent from parents/legal representative, patient, and age-appropriate assent
        before any study-specific screening procedures are conducted according to local, regional
        or national guidelines.

        I-9. Patient affiliated to a social security regimen or beneficiary of the same according
        to local requirements.

        I-10. Patients will prior allogeneic HSCT may be included if clinically indicated (see
        non-inclusion criteria regarding prior allogeneic HSCT). In this case, study inclusion must
        be confirmed by the international coordinating investigator.
