  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to test the effect of an interactive e-health intervention for
      people with chronic pain.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain conditions are common and difficult to cure. As much as 30% of adults in Norway
      experience moderate-to-severe chronic pain, i.e., pain having lasted more than 3 months.
      Chronic pain is also the most common cause of sick leave and disability pension in Norway.
      Despite a clear request from the authorities, e-health interventions for chronic pain has not
      yet been tested and implemented.

      The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of an interactive e-health intervention
      for people living with chronic pain, using outcome measures such as pain intensity, pain
      acceptance, anxiety/depression and quality of life.

      The e-health intervention will first be tested in a pilot study with 50 patients with
      different pain diagnoses and eventually in a randomized controlled trial with a sample of 240
      patients with different pain diagnoses. The intervention will consist of one face-to-face
      introductory group followed by 9 app-based modules containing cognitive behavioral pain
      self-management material. The 9 modules will be distributed over minimum 27 days (minimum 3
      days per module). The participants in the randomized controlled trial will be randomly
      assigned to use the e-health intervention or to a treatment as usual control group. . Both
      groups will receive outcome measures at baseline, immediately post intervention (or maximum 8
      weeks), at 6 months and at 12 months.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) (Short Form) - Assessing change</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediately post intervention (immediately post intervention or max 8 weeks), follow up at 6, and 12 months.</time_frame>
    <description>9 item scale measuring pain interference on function. Using this measure, respondents rate their worst, least, average, and current pain intensity and also rate the degree to which pain interferes with 7 domains of functioning (general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other persons, sleep, and enjoyment of life) on a scale of 0 to 10.
There is no scoring algorithm, but &quot;worst pain&quot; or the arithmetic mean of the four severity items can be used as measures of pain severity; the arithmetic mean of the seven interference items can be used as a measure of pain interference.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>RAND Health Related Quality of Life - Assessing change</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediately post intervention (immediately post intervention or max 8 weeks), follow up at 6, and 12 months.</time_frame>
    <description>36 item scale measuring health related quality of life. The RAND-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) - Assessing change</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediately post intervention (immediately post intervention or max 8 weeks), follow up at 6, and 12 months.</time_frame>
    <description>13 item scale measuring helplessness, magnification and rumination. Patients rate items on a scale from 0 (not at all) to 4 (all the time). The total score range for the PCS is 0 to 52, with higher scores reflecting higher degrees of catastrophizing.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Chronic Pain Acceptance Questionnaire (CPAQ) - Assessing change</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediately post intervention (immediately post intervention or max 8 weeks), follow up at 6, and 12 months.</time_frame>
    <description>8 item scale measuring pain acceptance. It is scored on a 7-point Likert scale (0 = never true; 6 = always true). Higher scores reflect higher acceptance of pain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-Regulatory Fatigue 18 (SRF-18) - Assessing change</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediately post intervention (immediately post intervention or max 8 weeks), follow up at 6, and 12 months.</time_frame>
    <description>18 item scale measuring self-regulatory capacity with cognitive, emotional, and behavioral components. Items are scored on a 5-point Likert scale (1 to 5). The obtainable score range is 18 to 90, with higher numbers reï¬‚ecting higher SRF.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) - Assessing change</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediately post intervention (immediately post intervention or max 8 weeks), follow up at 6, and 12 months.</time_frame>
    <description>14 item scale measuring anxiety and depression. Respondents are asked to indicate which of 4 response options (rated from 0-3; score range, 0-42) comes closest to describing how they have been feeling in the previous week for each item. Scores from 0-7 on the subscales are regarded as being in the normal range; a score of 11 or higher indicates a probable presence of a mood disorder, and a score of 8-10 is suggestive of the presence of the state.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>System Usability Scale (SUS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately post intervention or max 8 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>1o item scale measuring usability, with five response options for respondents; from Strongly agree to Strongly disagree. The obtainable score range is 25 to 100. A SUS score above a 68 would be considered above average and anything below 68 is below average.</description>
