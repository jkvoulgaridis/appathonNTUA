  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Accumulating evidence supports that more pain, whether measured by number of pain sites or
      pain severity, is associated with poorer cognitive function and mobility, and fall risk in
      older persons. Tai Chi which holistically integrates physical and cognitive functions offers
      the possibility not only of alleviating pain but also improving attention and mobility in the
      many older adults who have chronic multisite pain. This proposed full-size randomized
      controlled Tai Chi trial is a direct extension of our previous work examining chronic pain,
      attention demands, mobility and falls in the older population, and is built on the
      investigators' NIA-supported Tai Chi feasibility and acceptability pilot study among older
      adults with multisite pain and risk for falls. The goal of this single-blinded randomized
      controlled trial is to examine the effects of a 24-week Tai Chi intervention on chronic pain,
      cognition, mobility, fear of falling, and rates of total and injurious falls in older adults
      with multisite pain and at risk for falls. The results of this study will provide a
      foundation to establish the clinical significance of Tai Chi in the management of chronic
      multisite pain and to explore the mechanisms through which Tai Chi improves chronic pain
      symptoms and lowers rates of total and injurious falls in at-risk older adults.

      The investigators will measure pain severity, pain interference, pain-related biomarkers,
      cognition, physical function, single-task and dual-task gait, and fear of falling pre- and
      post-intervention in 200 older adults (Tai Chi: N=100, and exercise control: N=100). The
      investigators will also measure rates of total and injurious falls in the 12 months during
      and following the intervention. The primary aims are: 1. to examine the effects of Tai Chi on
      pain symptoms in older adults with multisite pain. It is hypothesized that older adults in
      the Tai Chi intervention will have less pain, measured as pain severity and interference,
      than those in the light physical exercise control group; 2. to examine the effects of Tai Chi
      on fear of falling and rates of total and injurious falls in older adults with multisite
      pain. It is hypothesized that older adults in the Tai Chi intervention will have greater
      improvements in fear of falling scores and fewer total and injurious falls than those in the
      light exercise control group in the 48 weeks during and after the Tai Chi intervention. The
      secondary/exploratory aims are: 3. to examine the effects of Tai Chi on pain-related
      biomarkers in older adults with multisite pain. It is hypothesized that older adults in the
      Tai Chi intervention will have lower levels of pain-related biomarkers, than those in the
      light physical exercise control group; 4. to examine the role of improvement in chronic pain
      in the reduction of fall rates by Tai Chi in older adults with multisite pain. It is
      hypothesized that the reductions in fall rates are dependent on the improvement in pain
      symptoms in older adults with chronic multisite pain; 5. to examine the roles of improvements
      in cognition and mobility in the reduction of fall rates by Tai Chi in older adults with
      multisite pain. It is hypothesized that the reductions in chronic pain and in fall rates are
      mediated by the changes in cognition and mobility in older adults with chronic multisite
      pain.

The mat measures location and timing of individual steps, which then can be used to calculate spatio-temporal gait parameters including our outcome measures of stride time, stride length, and swing time. During the dual task walking, the participants will perform 2 sets of cognitive challenges in random order: serial subtractions 3 and 5 from 100. Dual task performance and number of errors on the serial subtractions will be recorded. Coefficient of variation will be used as a measure of gait variability (SD/mean x 100). The dual task decrement, the difference between single task and dual task gait variability will be measured.</description>
