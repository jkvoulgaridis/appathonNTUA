    <textblock>
      This pilot intervention trial will assess the feasibility of a live consultation between
      community hospital providers and tertiary care providers employing a novel teleconsult
      platform, Maine Neonatal Encephalopathy Teleconsult (Maine NET), on the time to initiation of
      therapeutic hypothermia (TH) for 10 infants born in community hospitals in Maine compared
      with matched historical controls. Community hospital providers and tertiary care center
      provider satisfaction with the Maine NET platform will also be assessed. We hypothesize that
      immediately available expert assessment via a teleconsult platform will promote earlier
      implementation of TH and be associated with high levels of provider satisfaction.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Infants included in this study will be born at a community hospital, will be in either high
        or moderate risk, will be younger than 6 hours of age at the time of the consultation and
        the decision will have been made to treat with TH. High risk infants will be defined as an
        umbilical cord pH of less than or equal to 7.0 or 5 minute APGAR score of less than or
        equal to 5 or a need for resuscitation (including respiratory support or chest
        compressions) or an abnormal exam (which may include flaccid tone, poor suck reflex or poor
        response to stimulation) or seizures at less than 6 hours of life. Moderate risk infants
        will be defined as an umbilical cord pH of less than or equal to 7.2 but greater than 7.0
        or 5 minute APGAR score of less than 7 but greater than 5 or a perinatal event (such as
        placental abruption, uterine rupture, cord prolapse, or fetal-maternal hemorrhage) or an
        abnormal exam (which may include a hyper-alert state).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Infants older than 6 hours at the time Maine NET is requested and infants for whom TH is
        not an appropriate therapy (e.g. due to premature birth or moribund status) will be
        excluded.
