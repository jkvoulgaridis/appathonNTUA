    <textblock>
      ORION-4 is a research study coordinated by the University of Oxford and co-sponsored by The
      University of Oxford and The Medicines Company. The study aims to find out if a new
      cholesterol-lowering injection (inclisiran) safely lowers the risk of heart attacks and
      strokes in people who have already had one of these conditions, or who have had an operation
      or procedure to treat blocked arteries.

      The ORION-4 study aims to provide evidence about both the efficacy and safety of inclisiran.
      Inclisiran is a PCKS9 synthesis inhibitor which has been found to reduce LDL-cholesterol by
      about 50-60%. ORION-4 will investigate the effects of inclisiran on major adverse
      cardiovascular events.

      The study is intended to be conducted at approximately 180 clinical sites in the UK and the
      USA. Approximately 15,000 participants aged 55 years or older with pre-existing
      atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease will be randomized between inclisiran sodium 300 mg
      and matching placebo (given by subcutaneous injection on the day of randomization, at 3
      months and then every 6-months) in a 1:1 ratio for a planned median duration of about 5
      years.

        Inclusion Criteria

        History or evidence of at least one of the following:

          -  Prior MI; or

          -  Prior ischemic stroke; or

          -  Peripheral artery disease as evident by prior lower extremity artery revascularization
             or aortic aneurysm repair.

        Exclusion Criteria

        None of the following must be satisfied (based on self-reported medical history):

          -  Acute coronary syndrome or stroke less than 4 weeks before the Screening visit or
             during the Run-in period;

          -  Coronary revascularization procedure planned within the next 6 months;

          -  Known chronic liver disease;

          -  Current or planned renal dialysis or transplantation;

          -  Previous exposure to inclisiran or participation in a randomized trial of inclisiran;

          -  Previous (within about 3 months), current or planned treatment with a monoclonal
             antibody targeting PCSK9, or with a drug known to be contra-indicated with inclisiran
             (none currently known);

          -  Known to be poorly compliant with clinic visits or prescribed medication;

          -  Medical history that might limit the individual's ability to take trial treatments for
             the duration of the study (e.g. severe respiratory disease; cancer or evidence of
             spread within approximately the last 5 years, other than non-melanoma skin cancer; or
             history of alcohol or substance misuse) or may put the individual at significant risk
             in the opinion of the investigator (or their authorised deputy) if he/she were to
             participate in the trial;

          -  Women of child-bearing potential, current pregnancy, or lactation;

          -  Current participation in a clinical trial with an unlicensed drug or device; or

          -  Staff personnel directly involved with the study and any family member of the
             investigational study staff.
