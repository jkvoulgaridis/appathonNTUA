  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD) is the most common cause of ischemical
      cerebrovascular events. The risk of stroke recurrence or death of ICAD patients remains very
      high. Even with aggressive medical management including dual antiplatelet therapy and strict
      management of risk factors, 12.2 percent of patients with 70-99 percent stenosis of
      intracranial artery had stroke or death during 1 year follow-up. In the real world, the
      30-day risk of recurrent stroke of patients with aggressive medical management was as high as
      20.2 percent. Balloon angioplasty and stent for intracranial artery have become important
      alternative treatments to prevent recurrent stroke for patients with severe intracranial
      atherosclerotic stenosis. Nevertheless, the SAMMPRIS trial has suggested intracranial
      stenting has higher stroke and death rate than aggressive medication with high peri-procedure
      complication rate. Previous nonrandomized studies have showed that stroke and death rate of
      angioplasty for ICAD patients with severe stenosis of intracranial artery is lower than that
      of aggressive medication. The primary purpose of this trial is to compare intracranial
      angioplasty plus aggressive medical care with aggressive medical care alone for the treatment
      of patients with 70-99 percent intracranial artery stenosis because of ICAD and to clarify
      the efficacy and safety of intracranial angioplasty through a multicenter，prospective,
      randomized, parallel controlled trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial is a multicenter，prospective, randomized, parallel controlled trial. A total of
      approximately 802 patients (Age≥18years) who suffered from TIA/nondisabled stroke due to
      70-99% of the stenosis of one major intracranial artery (including anterior circulation and
      posterior circulation) during more than 21 days before the screening period will be enrolled.
      Patients fulfilling all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be
      randomized into two groups according to the 1:1 ratio after offering informed content: 1)
      Experimental group will receive intracranial angioplasty plus aggressive medical care which
      is the same as the control group; 2) Control group will receive aggressive medical care only.
      Aggressive medical care includes 100 mg/day of aspirin during the follow-up period; 75 mg/day
      of clopidogrel within 90 days after enrollment, and whether clopidogrel should continue to be
      used depends on the actual situation of the subjects; 20mg/day of atorvastatin should be used
      during the year after enrollment, and whether it should continue to be used depends on the
      actual situation of the subjects. Both groups will receive risk factors management including
      blood pressure to maintain 130-140/90-100 mmHg and LDL lower than 70 mg/dl. The primary
      objective is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intracranial angioplasty combined with
      aggressive medical care for symptomatic intracranial artery stenosis. The study consists of
      11 visits including the day of screening and randomization, the day when the subject receive
      intracranial angioplasty and/or aggressive medical care, the day before the subject is
      discharged from hospital, 30, 90,180 days and 1 year after enrollment, and every half a year
      after then until the third year. Demographic information, symptoms and signs, laboratory
      test, neuro-imaging assessment neurological function rating scale will be recorded during the
      program. The trial is anticipated to last from October 2018 to December 2023 with 802
      subjects recruited from 30 centers in China. All the related investigative organization and
      individuals will obey the Declaration of Helsinki and Chinese Good Clinical Practice
      standard. A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will regularly monitor safety during the
      study. The trial has been approved by Institutional Review Board (IRB) and Ethics
      Committee(EC) in Being Tiantan hospital, Capital Medical University.
