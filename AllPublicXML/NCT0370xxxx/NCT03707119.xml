      Objective. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of an educational program,
      based on Students 4 Best Evidence (S4BE) Blog, on Evidence-Based Practice (EBP) competencies
      (attitudes, knowledge and skills) through an EBP laboratory, in undergraduate students of
      Physiotherapy.

      Design. An observational perspective study. Setting. Physiotherapy School of Italian
      University. Participants. 70 undergraduate physiotherapist students of the first year, of
      both genders, were included. Mean age was 20.48+/-3.20 years and 66% were male and 34% were
      female.

      Interventions. The intervention consisted of the use of S4BE to teach EBP competence. The
      section S4BE &quot;about&quot; has been used to teach the EBP principles and their key steps and the
      section S4BE &quot;topics&quot; has been used to teach critical thinking and the clinical practice in
      rehabilitation for a total of 24 training hours.

      Main Outcome Measure. The evidence-based practice questionnaire (EBP2Q) has been used to
      evaluate EBP attitude, knowledge and skills, at the start of laboratory (T0), after 24
      training hours (T1) and after 3 months of clinical practice training (follow-up). Statistical
      analysis was performed with SPSS 17.0 An intra-group analysis has been conducted to verify
      the improvement during the time. Statistically significant was set at p&lt;0.05.
