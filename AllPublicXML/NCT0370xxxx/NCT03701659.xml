  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most frequently diagnosed cancer in men worldwide,
      accounting for 15% of all male cancers. In 2015, there were 220,800 estimated new cases of
      prostate cancer and 27,540 deaths by PCa, making this disease the second leading cause of
      cancer-related death for North American men.

      Men with PCa may develop lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) when prostate tumors invade or
      compress the prostatic urethra, the bladder or the neurovascular bundles, or when the
      prostate is enlarged. It has been estimated that over 40% of men with PCa experience moderate
      or severe LUTS. LUTS can impact profoundly on a man's quality of life (QoL); an effect that
      increases with increasing LUTS severity.

      Transurethral resection of prostate (TURP) can offer immediate relief of the obstruction in
      patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). In contrast, palliative TURP (p-TURP) (the
      so-called &quot;channel&quot; TURP), is transurethral resection of prostate tissue in a patient with
      metastatic or locally advanced and/or previously treated PCa to alleviate obstructive voiding
      symptoms.

      Al¬though TURP is commonly performed to relieve bladder outlet ob¬struction (BOO) symptoms in
      patients with BPH, little known about the outcome of palliative transurethral plasma kinetic
      resection of prostate (p-TUPKRP) in patients with ad-vanced PCa.

      Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists as androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) are the
      standard treatment for many patients with PCa, particularly those with advanced or metastatic
      disease. The impact of ADT on tumor control and achieving the reduction in prostate specific
      antigen (PSA) is well established. But there is less information available on the effects on
      LUTSs in men with PCa. Some short-term studies of ADT with the GnRH antagonist or with ADT in
      the neoadjuvant setting have demonstrated reductions in LUTSs, measured by the International
      Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS). There are few published data on the longer-term effects of ADT
      on LUTSs, apart from an earlier interim analysis of data from the current study.

      In this study, p-TUPKRP combined with ADT will perform for 50 patients with advanced PCa
      complicated with severe LUTS. As a control, other 50 advanced PCa patients with same symptoms
      will be treated with ADT only. Some clinical data, including PSA, IPSS, QoL, Urinary flow
      rate (UFR), ECOG Score, Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), will be
      analyzed. It is expected to explore the efficacy and safety of the combination therapy to
      advanced PCa with severe LUTS.

    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Prostate specific antigen, or PSA, is a protein produced by normal, as well as malignant, cells of the prostate gland. The PSA test measures the level of PSA in a man's blood. For this test, a blood sample is sent to a laboratory for analysis. The results are usually reported as nanograms of PSA per milliliter (ng/mL) of blood. The blood level of PSA is often elevated in men with prostate cancer. PSA will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of tumor therapy</description>

    <measure>Maximum flow rate</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Uronary flow rate is the volumetric flow rate of urine during urination. It is a measure of the quantity of urine excreted in a specified period of time (per second or per minute). It is measured with uroflowmetry, a type of flowmetry. The &quot;Q&quot; (a conventional symbol for flow rate) is used as a symbol for urine flow rate. Qmax indicates the maximum flow rate. Qmax is used as an indicator for the diagnosis of enlarged prostate. A lower Qmax may indicate that the enlarged prostate puts pressure on the urethra,</description>

    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>International prostate symptom score(IPSS) is based on the answers to seven questions concerning urinary symptoms and one question concerning quality of life. Each question concerning urinary symptoms allows the patient to choose one out of six answers indicating increasing severity of the particular symptom. The answers are assigned points from 0 to 5. The total score can therefore range from 0 to 35. The first seven questions of the I-PSS are identical to the questions appearing on the American Urological Association (AUA) Symptom Index which currently categorizes symptoms as follows: Mild (symptom score less than of equal to 7); Moderate (symptom score range 8-19); Severe (symptom score range 20-35).</description>

    <measure>QoL</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life due to urinary symptoms is base on the question, If you were to spend the rest of your life with your urinary condition just the way it is now, how would you feel about that? The International Scientific Committee (SCI), under the patronage of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Union Against Cancer (UICC), recommends the use of only a single question to assess the quality of life. The answers to this question range from &quot;delighted&quot; to &quot;terrible&quot; or 0 to 6. Although this single question may or may not capture the global impact of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) Symptoms or quality of life, it may serve as a valuable starting point for a doctor-patient conversation.</description>

    <description>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the prostate uses a powerful magnetic field, radio waves and a computer to produce detailed pictures of the structures within a man's prostate gland. It is primarily used to evaluate the extent of prostate cancer and determine whether it has spread. MRI of the prostate can be used to determine the efficacy of therapy and imaging progression-free survival.</description>
