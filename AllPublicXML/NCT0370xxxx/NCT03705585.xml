  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-randomized study. The purpose of this study is to better
      understand how vaccines against typhoid fever and cholera affect the normal immune system and
      bacteria in the intestine. Patients having standard-of-care endoscopies (colonoscopy and/or
      esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD)) will be divided into 3 groups:

      Group 1: Vivotif typhoid vaccination and/or Vaxchora cholera vaccination then endoscopy Group
      2: Endoscopy, then Vivotif typhoid vaccination and/or Vaxchora cholera vaccination, then
      follow-up endoscopy Group 3: Endoscopy without vaccination.

      Both vaccines used in this study are licensed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for
      travelers to developing countries. Volunteers will be asked to donate tissue, blood, saliva
      and stool samples for studying how the body responds to the typhoid and/or cholera vaccine.

    <description>One dose. Approximately 100 mL of cool or room temperature purified bottled water is placed into a clean disposable cup. The contents of the buffer sachet are added to the water and stirred. Then the contents of the active (lyophilized vaccine) sachet are added to the water and stirred for approximately 30 seconds. The reconstituted mixture should be completely ingested within 15 minutes.</description>
