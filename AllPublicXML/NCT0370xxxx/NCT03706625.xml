  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The explosion of novel therapies targeting tumor mutations or immune molecules requests to
      define or better characterize the mutational profiles of tumors that are none or
      insufficiently explored so far. This is particularly the case for tumors arising in
      immune-suppressed individuals or environments which have been poorly, if any, analyzed so far
      with modern molecular methods. The goal of the translational research program, Ideation, is
      to define novel biomarkers such as the tumor mutational profiling and immunomutanome in such
      contexts and to compare the results obtained to those observed in immune competent
      individuals. In addition, this approach will allow to characterize novel key non-invasive
      diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers such as circulating tumoral DNA and cells. Altogether
      results will provide novel biomarkers to better adapt therapeutic strategies in these
      cancers, to monitor response to treatment as well as to define new molecular targets of
      potential therapeutic strategies.

      The main objective is to discover novel invasive and non-invasive immuno-molecular actionable
      biomarkers in rare but severe tumors arising in immune-suppressed compared for some tumors in
      immune-competent patients. Indeed, this tumors present a deficient immune environment, either
      due to the host acquired immune deficiency, i.e. transplantations or HIV infection, or
      because the diseased tissue belongs in an immune sanctuary as the brain. The primary
      hypothesis, in this context, is that these tumor mutational profiles and their changes during
      drug therapy must be influenced by the immune environment and response. This must lead to
      differences from similar tumors observed in immune-competent environments (immunocompetent
      individuals or tissues expressing immunity), responsible for: modification in the molecular
      targets for appropriate drugs ; alteration of tumor immunogenicity and of future immune-based
      therapies ; specific biomarkers for monitoring the response to drug therapy. The objectives
      of this program are to carry on invasive and non-invasive investigations in order to define
      the mutational profile of these free types of severe tumors, non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), lung
      cancers and gliomas arising in hosts or tissues with altered immunity. These investigations
      will lead to : identify novel invasive and non-invasive biomarkers for predicting and
      evaluating efficacy of future personalized and immune-based therapies; compare tumors from
      immune-suppressed and immune-competent hosts; discover hot spots of tumoral mutations as
      mechanisms of tumors resistance, new molecular targets for future molecular and immune-bases
      therapeutic strategies; define the tumor immunomutanome as a score of neo-epitopes
      predicting: tumor immunogenicity, disease outcome and efficacy of immunotherapies; detect
      non-invasive tumoral biomarkers from liquid biopsies based on Circulating tumoral DNA and
      Circulating tumoral Cells to facilitate future diagnosis and monitoring of such tumors;
      identify biomarkers of tumor escape or resistance to treatments.

    <description>The analysis of circulating DNA (ctDNA) will be performed from plasma collected from the prospective cohort of the patients for the three types of cancer (NHL, lung cancer and glioma). DNA will be extracted and amplified followed by Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) and Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) analysis for the identification of new biomarkers and/or for the follow up of mutations previously identified on tumor DNA. Results will be compared to tissue results in each group and to CTCs results in the Lung cancer group and prognostic values of these biomarkers will be assessed from clinical datas.</description>

    <description>The analysis of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) will be performed from whole peripheral blood collected from the prospective cohort of patients with lung cancer infected or not with HIV. CTC fraction will be prepared from a cell size-based enrichment protocol. NextThen, DNA and RNA will be extracted and amplified followed by Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) and RNA sequencing for the identification of new biomarkers. Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) analysis will also be performed for validation and patient follow-up. Mutations and expression data in CTC will be compared to tissue and ctDNA in the two groups and prognostic values of these biomarkers will be assessed from clinical datas.</description>
