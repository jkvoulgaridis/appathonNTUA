  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sexual assault victimization is a common and particularly harmful form of trauma that is
      associated with increased risk for high-risk drinking and other conditions of public health
      concern, such as PTSD. Given evidence that sexual assault survivors who have low social
      support or receive negative social reactions to sexual assault disclosure are more likely to
      experience PTSD and drinking problems, improving social support is a novel target for
      intervention. The proposed study will attempt to prevent the onset of high-risk drinking and
      PTSD in sexual assault survivors by developing a web-based early intervention aimed at
      increasing contact with social supporters and mitigating the harm of negative social
      reactions; ultimately, results will contribute to advancing the field's understanding of the
      potential for social support to mitigate the harm of trauma.

      This study involves developing, modifying, and preliminarily testing an intervention to
      prevent high-risk drinking and PTSD in women who have experienced sexual assault (SA) in the
      past 8 weeks. The intervention will be developed using user-centered design principles that
      attempt to maximize usability and satisfaction, and then preliminarily tested in a small open
      trial. In phase 1 (focus groups), a preliminary prototype intervention will be developed
      based on qualitative focus groups with N = 10 stakeholders (one-on-one interviews will be
      scheduled if necessary due to scheduling concerns) and a review of the existing clinical
      manuals from which the principles of the intervention are drawn. In phase 2 (usability
      testing), we will conduct iterative prototyping and usability testing with N = 10 survivors
      of SA to refine the intervention. This will involve in-person sessions in which participants
      complete intervention tasks while providing verbal feedback, with researcher monitoring of
      interactions with the website. Participants will also complete a usability survey and provide
      qualitative feedback. In phase 3 (open trial), after incorporating changes based on feedback,
      intervention feasibility will be tested in an open trial with N = 40 women with past-8-week
      SA histories, active drinking, and elevated distress. Participants will complete surveys at
      baseline, termination, and 6-month follow-up. Participants will be randomized to either the
      intervention (N = 20) or assessment-only control (N = 20). We hypothesize that (H1) most
      participants will respond positively on items assessing satisfaction with the intervention,
      (H2) participants will report above-average usability on a standardized measure, (H3)
      completion rates for daily activities will be similar to previous web-based interventions,
      (H4) participants will show significant learning as evidenced by increases in correct
      responses to knowledge questions from baseline to post, and (H5) participants in the
      intervention condition will evidence less high-risk drinking and PTSD at 6-month follow-up
      than participants in the assessment-only condition.
