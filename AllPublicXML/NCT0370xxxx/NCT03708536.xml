  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bevacizumab plus capecitabin is a standard maintenance treatment following first-line
      chemotherapy in the patients with advanced colorectal adenocarcinoma. However, hand-foot
      syndrome induced by capecitabin will bother the patient to decrease the quality of life. S-1,
      an alternative of fluoropyrimidine, was proved non-inferior efficacy with lower hand-foot
      syndrome as first-line chemotherapy in advanced colorectal adenocarcinoma in the studies. The
      investigators are going to test the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab plus S-1 as
      maintenance treatment compared with bevacizumab plus capecitabin in colorectal adenocarcinoma

        Criteria

        Before the start of induction therapy:

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Histological proof of colorectal cancer (in case of a single metastasis, histological or
        cytological proof of this lesion should be obtained); Distant metastases (patients with
        only local recurrence are not eligible); Unidimensionally measurable disease (&gt; 1 cm on
        spiral CT scan or &gt; 2 cm on chest X-ray; liver ultrasound is not allowed). Serum CEA may
        not be used as a parameter for disease evaluation; In case of previous radiotherapy, at
        least one measurable lesion should be located outside the irradiated field.

        Ongoing or planned first line treatment with 6 cycles of Xeloda, Eloxatin, and Avastin.

        Exclusion criteria Prior adjuvant treatment for stage II/III colorectal cancer ending
        within 6 months before the start of induction treatment Any prior adjuvant treatment after
        resection of distant metastases Previous systemic treatment for advanced disease

        At randomisation:

        Inclusion criteria:

        WHO performance status 0-1 (Karnofsky PS &gt; 70%); Disease evaluation with proven SD, PR or
        CR according to RECIST after 6 cycles of MTD chemotherapy performed in week 3-4 of the 6th
        cycle induction therapy, and randomisation performed in week 3-5 of the 6th cycle (see time
        table); Laboratory values obtained ≤ 2 weeks prior to randomisation: adequate bone marrow

        discontinued; patients with previous dose reductions or delays are eligible; patients with
        grade 2 neurotoxicity after the 6th cycle are eligible, and retreatment with EloxatinR
        after PFS1 should depend on the grade of neurotoxicity at that moment; Known

        metastatic disease; Uncontrolled hypertension, i.e. consistently &gt; 150/100 mmHg; Use of
        more than 3 antihypertensive drugs; Significant cardiovascular disease &lt; 1 yr before

        cerebrovascular event, pulmonary embolism); Any of these significant cardiovascular events
        during previous fluoropyrimidine therapy; Chronic active infection; Any other concurrent
        severe or uncontrolled disease preventing the safe administration of study drugs; Any
        impairment of gastrointestinal function or -disease that may significantly impair the
        absorption of oral drugs (i.e. uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea (defined as &gt;CTC
        grade 2), malabsorption syndrome, bowel obstruction, or inability to swallow tablets);
        Concomitant treatments: concomitant (or within 4 weeks before randomisation) administration
        of any other experimental drug under investigation; concurrent treatment with any other
        anti-cancer therapy; full-dose anticoagulation (is allowed if started during induction
        therapy); Continuous use of immunosuppressive agents (except the use of corticosteroids as
