  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spasticity and pain, particularly int he shoulder region, are the most common impairments
      experienced by subjects who had experienced a stroke. There is preliminary evidence
      supporting the role of dry needling for spasticity in patients who had suffered from a
      stroke. Few data exists on the effects on shoulder pain. In addition, it has been shown that
      application of dry needling induces post-needling soreness in individuals with
      musculoskeletal pain. No previous study has investigated the presence and the duration of
      post-needling soreness in individuals who had experienced a stroke.
