    <textblock>
      People with disabilities experience many barriers in trying to integrate into the competitive
      market. The barriers may be result of the unique characteristics of the individual
      (characteristics of the disability, occupational history, work self-efficacy, etc.), the
      characteristics of the occupation and occupational performance (characteristics of the job
      and the job demands) and environmental barriers (accessibility, discrimination, stigma and
      lack of opportunities, etc.). The main response to the integration problems of people with
      disabilities in the world of work is supported employment service. Supported employment
      focuses primarily on placement of the individual and do not relate to barriers relating to
      the individual's ability to develop a career.

      The present study examines the effectiveness of a new intervention program &quot;The interfaces
      program &quot; aiming to promote career development process among people with disabilities working
      in the competitive market. The program presents an integration of the
      Person-Environment-Occupation-Performance (PEOP) model and lead career development theories.
      The ultimate goal of this study is to examine the effectiveness of the &quot;interfaces program&quot;
      by examining its impact on the promotion of objective and subjective measures among people
      with disabilities who work and receive supported employment services.
