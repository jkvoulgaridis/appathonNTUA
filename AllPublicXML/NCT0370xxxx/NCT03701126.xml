  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of pediatric regional anesthesia has increased because of its effective pain control,
      improved safety profile of local anesthetic agents, in addition to the introduction of
      ultra-sound. At present, caudal block is one of the most common regional anesthetic
      techniques employed in pediatric surgery. In addition to providing postoperative analgesia,
      caudal block significantly reduces intraoperative analgesic requirements and upper airway
      complications. Transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block involves infiltration of local
      anesthetics to the plane between the internal oblique and transversus abdominis muscles.
      Indeed, TAP block offers a hemodynamic stability, appropriate intra-operative analgesia and
      post surgical analgesia of the abdominal wall.

      The use of pediatric regional anesthesia has increased because of its effective pain control,
      improved safety profile of local anesthetic agents, in addition to the introduction of
      ultra-sound.

      At present, caudal block is one of the most common regional anesthetic techniques employed in
      pediatric surgery. In addition to providing postoperative analgesia, caudal block
      significantly reduces intraoperative analgesic requirements and upper airway complications.

      However, in recent days there is a trend toward the use of peripheral nerve blockade wherever
      applicable, given the lower incidences of adverse effects when compared with neuron-axial
      techniques. Furthermore, there may be specific anatomic variations or abnormalities which
      preclude the use of caudal block.

      The abdominal wall consists of three muscular layers, the external oblique abdominis muscle
      (EOAM), the internal oblique abdominis muscle (IOAM), and the tranversus abdominis muscle
      (TAM), and their associated fascial sheaths. The central abdominal wall also includes the
      rectus abdominis muscles and its associated fascial sheath. This muscular wall is innervated
      by nerve afferents that course through the transversus abdominis neuron-fascial plane.

      Transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block involves infiltration of local anesthetics to the
      plane between the internal oblique and transversus abdominis muscles. Indeed, TAP block
      offers a hemodynamic stability, appropriate intra-operative analgesia and post surgical
      analgesia of the abdominal wall.
