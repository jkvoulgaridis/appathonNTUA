    <textblock>
      The study is to assess the safety and efficacy of the immunotherapies using anti-MUC1 CAR T
      cells and /or PD-1 knockout engineered T cells in the treatment of patients with advanced
      esophageal cancer.

    <textblock>
      This is a combined phase 1 and 2 clinical study. The aim of the study is to assess the safety
      and efficacy of the immunotherapies using anti- MUC1 CAR T cells alone, anti- MUC1 CAR T
      combining PD-1 knockout engineered T cells, and PD-1 knockout engineered T cell only in the
      treatment of patients with advanced esophageal cancer. The treatment outcomes from each group
      will be compared.
