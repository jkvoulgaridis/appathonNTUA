  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators want to investigate if the use of conventional in vitro fertilization (IVF)
      can generate more euploid embryos as compared to intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).

      To verify this, the investigators will inject half of the oocytes by ICSI and the other half
      of the oocytes will be inseminated by conventional IVF. The most important aim is to see if
      IVF is able to generate more euploid embryos.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ICSI is commonly used in pre-implantation genetic testing (PGT) cases to eliminate any risk
      of sperm DNA contamination. With the switch from cleavage stage biopsy to biopsy of the full
      (hatching) blastocyst, this potential risk of contamination can be neglected and could allow
      the use of conventional IVF in PGT cases. Especially in cases of non-male factor infertility,
      the use of conventional IVF can be applied as a more 'natural' insemination method.

      The investigators will perform a pilot study on sibling oocytes including participants with
      non-male factor infertility and requesting PGT-A (PGT for aneuploidy). If at least 10 cumulus
      oocyte complexes (COCs) are obtained after oocyte retrieval, half of the oocytes will be
      subjected to ICSI and the other half to conventional IVF. Preimplantation development is
      followed by time lapse imaging and blastocysts (day 5-7) fulfilling the biopsy criteria will
      undergo trophectoderm biopsy to detect the ploidy state and the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)
      copy number.

      The main objective is to analyse if the use a more physiological insemination method (IVF)
      has a beneficial impact on the ploidy state of the blastocyst as compared to ICSI within the
      same participant. As the embryos will be cultured in a time lapse imaging system, annotations
      can be made and the differences in maturation rate, fertilization rate and embryo development
      between both insemination methods can be analysed as secondary outcome parameter. On top of
      this, the PGT-A outcome will also display the mtDNA copy number which can be compared between
      IVF and ICSI biopsied sibling blastocyst. Euploid blastocysts will be transferred in
      subsequent frozen embryo transfer (FET) cycles and give an indication on the clinical outcome
      between IVF and ICSI.

    <measure>Ploidy state: euploid or aneuploid</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>trophectoderm biopsy performed between day 5-7 of preimplantation development. These cells will be genetically tested to see if the correct number of chromosomes are present. Euploid embryos can be used for the patient, aneuploid embryos cannot be used for the patient.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>mitoscore value: ranges from 10-1500</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>the trophectoderm biopsy sample is used to calculate a value indicating the mitochondrial DNA present in the biopt. Lower values are known to be linked to higher implantation rates of the corresponding blastocyst. Higher values have been correlated to aneuploidy.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Maturation rate</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The maturation rate is defined as the number of mature oocytes obtained per cumulus complex retrieved for the participants.A mature oocyte is defined as an oocyte that has extruded his fiist polar body and this mature oocyte is ready to be fertilized by the participants sperm.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Morphokinetic development</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>As embryos are cultured in a time lapse imaging system, pictures will be taken every 20 minutes to follow the development. Each time that the embryos divides, the timing will be registered in the database. Like this, every division made by every embryo is recorded. the time the embryo needs to go from 1 cell to 2 cells, from 2 cells to 3 cells and so on.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fertilization rate</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Fertilization is calculated on all mature oocytes or on all complexes obtained after oocyte retrieval. The fertilization rate is assessed by the presence of a male and a female pronucleus 16-20 hours post fertilization. If the oocyte is fertilized, the outcome is positive, if the oocyte is not fertilized, the outcome is negative.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Embryo development up to day 3</measure>
    <time_frame>3 days</time_frame>
    <description>For all normally fertilized oocytes the further development will be assessed as the embryos are cultured in a time lapse system. This system takes pictures of the embryos every 20 minutes which shows the development of the embryo like a movie: every time that a cell divides, the hour at which it divides will be registered in the time lapse system. For each cell division, specific time frames have been described that link the embryo to develop into a blastocyst or that increases the chance of implantation. The embryo will be evaluated on day 3 and will receive an embryo score that is based on the number of cells, the appearance of the cells, fragmentation and embryo dysmorphisms. These will divide the embryo quality into 4 categories with category 1 being the highest quality and category 4 being the lowest quality. The more fragmentation and the higher the degree of dysmorphisms, the more the quality will shift to category 4.</description>

    <measure>Blastulation rate</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>A blastocyst is an embryo in which a cavity is visible on day 5 of the embryo development. If the cavity is present the outcome is positive, if the cavity is absent, the outcome is negative The complete process in which the development of one embryo is followed from the day of injection up until day 7 is called the preimplantation development</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Embryo development up to day 5</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>On day 5 of development, a score is given to every embryo. This is based on the presence or absence of a cavity, the number of cells and how tight the cells are packed. The more cells, the higher the grade, if less cells are present, the grade is lower. Based on these parameters, a final grade is calculated (3 grades) with grade 1 being the highest score.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pregnancy outcome</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>pregnancy outcomes from the frozen embryo transfers: blood samples will be taken and the level of beta-hCG will be measured to define a pregnancy or no pregnancy. A pregnancy is defined as the best oucome. In case a pregnancy is obtained, the patient will come for an ultrasound scan between week 7-12 to checke the presence of a gestational sac and the presence of a fetal heart beat. The presence of a fetal heart beat is defined as a positive outcome, the absence is defined as a negative outcome.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>sperm concentration</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>concentration will be analysed under a microscope in a Makler or Neubauer counting chamber that allows you to define the concentration of that specific sample: depending on the number of sperm cells counted per row or square in the chamber, the concentration can be calculated.
Concentration will start at 15 million per milliliter in the original sperm and may be as high as 500 million per milliliter.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>sperm motility</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The motility of the sperm will be analysed under a microscope in a Makler or Neubauer counting chamber that allows you to count the four different types of motility present in a sample.
Sperm motility is defined as the number of sperm cells that are able to progress on their own and is expressed as a percentage: the higher the percentage, the better the value is.</description>

  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Controlled ovarian stimulation: days of stimulation</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>In order to stimulate multiple follicular development, patients will be stimulated with fixed doses of hormones.

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Controlled ovarian stimulation: hormonal profile</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>During the stimulation, the hormonal profile of every patient will be measured (estrogens, luteinizing hormone, progesterone): these blood values will be compared to the number of follicles that are measured in the participants and the combination of the three blood values should correspond to the sizes and numbers of follicles measured in the participants,</description>
