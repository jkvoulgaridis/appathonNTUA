  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a physical therapist (PT) led gait training
      intervention for 100 older adults with pre-frailty or frailty. The goals of this study are To
      determine the effect of gait training intensity on frailty, mobility, physical functioning,
      and quality of life, as well as balance and healthcare utilization.

    <textblock>
      Frailty is a leading cause of dependency among older adults, affects up to 60% of older
      adults, and is associated with an increased risk for falls, hospitalizations,
      institutionalization, and death. Exercise is the most widely recommended treatment for
      improving physical function among the frailty, but the optimal type or intensity of exercise
      is unknown. Walking is a preferred physical activity among older adults, however, there are
      no clear guidelines on the best intensity of walking to reduce frailty. The specific goal of
      this project is to compare a high intensity walking (HIW) intervention (70-80% of heart rate
      maximum) to a moderate intensity walking (MIW) intervention (50-60% of heart rate maximum)
      for pre-frail or frail older adults to determine the impact on frailty, mobility, balance,
      quality of life, and healthcare utilization.
