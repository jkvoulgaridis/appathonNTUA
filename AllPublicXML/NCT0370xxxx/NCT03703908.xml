      An Open Label, Intra-Subject Dose Escalation Study of CCX140 B in Subjects with Primary Focal
      Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and Nephrotic Syndrome. The aim of this study is to
      explore the effect of CCX140-B, a selective antagonist of C-C chemokine receptor type 2, on
      proteinuria in subjects with FSGS.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female subjects aged 18 years and older

          2. Primary FSGS based on renal biopsy findings consistent with FSGS and based on
             presentation of histopathology, medical history and clinical course OR subjects with
             genetic risk factors with presentations that are otherwise consistent with primary
             FSGS

          3. Urinary total protein:creatinine ratio (UPCR) ≥ 3.5 g protein/g creatinine at
             screening

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnant or nursing

          2. History of organ transplantation, including renal transplantation

          3. Currently on an organ transplant waiting list or there's a reasonable possibility of
             getting an organ transplant within 6 months of screening

          4. Histological FSGS subtype of collapsing variant

          5. Subjects who initiated, discontinued or changed dose of anti-CD20 monoclonal
             antibodies within 16 weeks (4 months) prior to screening are excluded. Subjects who
             initiated treatment with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies &gt;16 weeks (4 months) prior to
             screening are permitted if deemed safe by the investigator and only if they intend to
             remain on continued, unchanged therapy at a dosing interval that has been documented
             to achieve continuous B cell depletion for the given patient.

          6. Subjects who discontinued Rituximab or other anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies &gt;16 weeks
             (4 months) prior to screening without confirmed recovery of CD20+ B cell population to
             within normal range are excluded. Subjects who discontinued rituximab or other
             anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies &gt;16 weeks (4 months) prior to screening with confirmed
             recovery of CD20+ B cell population to within normal range are permitted in the study.
             UPCR and other urine protein assessments up to 1 year prior to screening (if
             available) that were performed in these patients as part of the clinical routine
             should be recorded in the medical history.

          7. Body Mass Index (BMI) ≥ 40
