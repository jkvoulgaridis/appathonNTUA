  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The health benefits of physical activity (PA) are well documented and include improving in
      cardiovascular, obesity, mental health and all-cause mortality. Although higher levels of
      activity in patients with asthma are also associated with better outcomes, patients still
      avoid physical activity due to concern about exacerbating their asthma symptoms by the
      exercise induced bronchoconstriction (EIB), sustaining a vicious cycle of inactivity and
      worse asthma control. Many studies have reported the benefits of supervised exercise training
      on several asthma outcomes, such as exacerbations, asthma control, cardiopulmonary fitness,
      airway inflammation and psychosocial symptoms; however, the translation of the improvements
      in the exercise capacity into increments in PA levels is less evident and still
      controversial. Therefore, the hypothesis of this study is that behavioural interventions
      using strategies based on well-established psychosocial models are effective in increasing
      physical activity levels and decrease sedentary behaviour in adults with asthma, which will
      be associated with improvements in the asthma control.

      This is prospective and randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 2 arms and blinded outcome
      assessments. Forty-six moderate or severe patients with asthma under optimized medication
      will be randomly assigned (computer-generated) into either Control Group (CG) or Intervention
      Group (IG). Both groups will receive similar educational program. However, only the IG will
      be submitted to the behavioral intervention through physical activity counseling program
      combined with a monitoring-and-feedback tool aiming to increase physical activity levels
      (total of 8 weekly goal-setting consultation, face-to-face, each lasting 40 minutes). Before
      and after the interventions, clinical control of asthma, physical activity levels,
      health-related quality of life, asthma exacerbation, levels of anxiety and depression
      symptoms and anthropometric indices will be assessed. Data about onset of asthma,
      comorbidities, lung function and asthma medication will be collected from the patient's
      medical record. The data normality will be analyzed by Kolmogorov-Smirnov, and a two-way
      ANOVA with repeated measures with appropriate post hoc of Holm-sidak will be used to compare
      inter and intra-groups differences. The significance level will be set to 5% for all tests.

    <masking_description>All the measurements will be performed by a blinded professional, who will be masked from randomization and other results. For each test, the same investigator will be maintained before and after the intervention. The participants will know what treatment they will receive, but they don't will know what intervention belongs to the control group.</masking_description>

    <measure>Change in asthma clinical control</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline asthma clinical control at 8 weeks of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical control will be evaluated by the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ). The ACQ contains 7 items rated on a 7-point scale (0 = without limitation, 6 = maximum limitation), with a higher score indicating worse control. Scores lower than 0.75 are associated with good asthma control, whereas scores greater than 1.5 are indicative of poorly controlled asthma, and a change of at least 0.5 points in the ACQ score is regarded as clinically significant.</description>

    <time_frame>Change from baseline physical activity levels at 8 weeks of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Physical activity and sedentary behaviour will be objectively quantified using a movement sensor (ActiGraph, Pensacola, USA) for 7 consecutive days on the hip using an elastic belt. Sedentary behaviour will be quantify by the time spent sedentary (&lt; 100 counts/min).</description>

    <measure>Change in health related quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline health related quality of life at 8 weeks of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Health related quality of life will be assessed by Asthma Quality Life Questionnaire (AQLQ). The AQLQ consists of 32 items rated on a 7-point scale (1 = great deal, 7 = not at all) divided into the following 4 domains: activity limitations, symptoms, emotional function and environmental stimuli. Higher AQLQ scores indicate a better quality of life, and treatments resulting in a 0.5-point increase in scores following an intervention are considered to be clinically effective.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in asthma exacerbation</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline asthma exacerbation at 8 weeks of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Asthma exacerbation will be assessed by the following criteria: the use of ≥4 puffs of rescue medication per 24 hours during a 48-hour period, a need for systemic corticosteroids, an unscheduled medical appointment, and either a visit to an emergency room or hospitalization</description>

    <description>Symptoms of anxiety and depression symptoms will be assessed by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADs), which consists of 14 items divided into 2 subscales (7 for anxiety and 7 for depression). Each item is scored from 0 to 3, with a maximum score of 21 points for each subscale. A score greater than 8/9 in each subscale suggests a diagnosis of either anxiety and/or depression.</description>

    <description>The educational program will consist of 2 classes held once a week, each lasting 90 minutes. The classes will be based on an education videotape, presentations and group discussions. The first class will address the asthma education, which will include information about the pathophysiology of asthma, medication and peak flow meter instructions, self-monitoring techniques, environmental control techniques and avoidance strategies. The second class will be about the current international physical activity recommendations and the importance and benefits of being physically active and maintain a healthy lifestyle.</description>

    <description>The behavioural intervention will be performed in 8 weekly goal-setting consultation, face-to-face, each lasting 40 minutes. Patients will be offered a commercially-available activity tracker to wear during 3 days prior to each consultation. According to their own PA data and the behavioural change stage, an individual action plan will be established with realistic goals to increase PA. Each participant will receive individual counselling with the goal of increasing participation in PA and reducing their sedentary time. Techniques such as weekly goal-setting, motivational interviewing, activity tracker vibration instructions, self-management, positive reinforcement, relapse prevention and strategies to overcome barriers will be included.</description>
