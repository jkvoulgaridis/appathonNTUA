      The primary objective of this study is to assess the immune response to an influenza vaccine
      in adults with B-cell malignancies who are currently receiving treatment with idelalisib in a
      Gilead-sponsored study (parent study).

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Currently enrolled in a Gilead-sponsored study, receiving or scheduled to initiate
             treatment with idelalisib for at least 7 consecutive days prior to receiving an
             influenza vaccine

          -  Will be receiving an influenza vaccine per standard of care

          -  Willing to comply with scheduled visits, laboratory tests, other study procedures, and
             study restrictions

          -  Signed informed consent form, indicating that the subject has been informed of the
             procedures to be followed, potential risks and discomforts, and other pertinent
             aspects of study participation

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Administration of systemic steroids for more than 2 consecutive weeks within the past
             3 months (i.e., 12 weeks) prior to receiving an influenza vaccination. Up to 3 single
             doses of systemic corticosteroids (e.g., given as a premedication) are permitted
             within 30 days prior to receiving an influenza vaccine, however none of these doses
             may be administered within 7 days prior to influenza vaccination. Topical and inhaled
             steroids are permitted

          -  Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy within the past 3 months (i.e., 12 weeks)
             prior to receiving an influenza vaccination, and/or planned administration during the
             study period

          -  Cytotoxic chemotherapy and chronic administration (more than 14 days) of
             immunosuppressants within 30 days of vaccination

          -  Vaccination against influenza within the last 24 weeks prior to vaccination in this
             study, and/or planned administration of a second dose of influenza vaccine during the
             study period.

          -  Receipt of any vaccine in the 4 weeks preceding the trial vaccination or planned
             receipt of any vaccine in the 4 weeks following trial vaccination

          -  History of severe allergic or hypersensitivity reaction that is likely to be
             exacerbated by any component of an influenza vaccine including egg and chicken
             protein, or history of hypersensitivity to a previous dose of an influenza vaccine

          -  Acute disease and/or fever at the time of baseline blood draw (fever is defined as
             temperature ≥ 38°C in an oral setting)

          -  Presence of any condition that could, in the opinion of the investigator, compromise
             the subject's ability to participate in the study, such as history of substance abuse
             or psychiatric condition

          -  Females who are pregnant or lactating (refer to the Gilead-sponsored parent study's
             definition of 'child-bearing potential' to determine if pregnancy testing is required.
             If a pregnancy test has been performed in the Gilead-sponsored parent study ≤ 6 weeks
             prior to the baseline blood draw, it may be used for eligibility purposes.

        Note: Note: Other protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply.
