  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if it is feasible for women to take both
      Flibanserin and tamoxifen for the duration of the study. This study is also trying to find
      out if Flibanserin improves or has any effect on hyposexual desire disorder/HSDD in women who
      are taking tamoxifen for breast cancer.

        Premenopausal women on Tamoxifen with early stage breast cancer who have completed primary
        treatment with surgery, radiation and chemotherapy and have hypoactive sexual desire
        disorder (HSDD)

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women age 21 and older

          -  Able to swallow tablets

          -  History of stage 0-III breast cancer that is estrogen and/or progesterone receptor
             positive

          -  History of breast cancer with no current evidence of disease and have completed
             primary treatment with any combination of surgery, radiation and/or chemotherapy at
             least 3 months ago and is currently on Tamoxifen, an AI, or ovarian suppression.

          -  Has been taking tamoxifen, an AI, ,or ovarian suppression for at least 3 months.

          -  Has LFTS within 2 times the upper limit of normal proven by a Comprehensive Metabolic
             Panel (CMP) performed within 6 months of protocol enrollment and while the patient was
             on Tamoxifen, an AI, or ovarian suppression

          -  Patients meet criteria for the diagnosis of HSDD as defined by the DSM-IV and ISSWSH
             Consensus paper. The criteria states that there must be a decrease in sexual desire
             and this must be a change for at least 3 months from what it was previously. Personal
             distress resulting from this change must occur. Initial screening will take place with
             The Decreased Sexual Desire Screener, a 5-question screening tool developed and
             validated to aid clinicians in making the diagnosis of HSDD. A &quot;yes&quot; response to the
             first 4 questions on the screener is consistent with HSDD.

          -  Patients must agree to follow the guidelines for alcohol consumption during the 24
             weeks of treatment on study

             or alk phos) proven by Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP) performed within 6 months
             of protocol enrollment and while the patient was on Tamoxifen or an AI
