  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer patients and their caregivers often experience difficulties in coping with the cancer
      diagnosis and the treatment that follows. Creative art therapy could support cancer patients
      and their caregivers in coping with these issues by using their creativity and
      self-expression. The aim of this study for the investigator's research team is to create a
      clear image of what cancer patients and their caregivers expect of supportive care to help
      them coping with cancer diagnosis, cancer therapy and life after cancer. This is a
      prospective, interventional study. Cancer patients and their caregivers will be approached to
      participate in this study. They will be asked to complete a questionnaire about their
      satisfaction with the current support they get to help them coping with cancer diagnosis,
      cancer therapy and life after cancer and whether they would like to participate in an art
      therapy program, which art therapy forms they would like to participate in, how they would
      like them to be organized, etc.
