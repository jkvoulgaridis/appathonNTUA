      This study will objectively evaluate two US lubricant eye drop formulations produced by
      Alcon, INC. Systane® Ultra, a non-emollient eye drop, will be compared to Systane® Complete,
      an emollient eye drop, in subjects with dry eye symptoms and lipid layer thickness &lt; 75 nm at
      baseline in a randomized, cross-over (masked subject) design. We seek to objectively evaluate
      the increase in lipid layer thickness from baseline at 15 minutes and 1, 2, 4 and 6 hours
      after each eye drop has been instilled. Non-invasive measurements of tear break-up time will
      be also conducted at each visit. Subjects will then be dispensed the emollient eye drop
      (Systane® Complete) for use four times daily for one month and return to the study site for
      final measurements of dry eye symptoms, lipid layer thickness, and tear break-up time. The
      Stroboscopic Video Color Microscope of King-Smith is used for non-invasive lipid layer
      thickness measurement, and the Oculus Keratograph (K5M) is used for non-invasive measurements
      of tear break-up time.

    <description>All subjects are randomly assigned to arm one or arm two. Subjects are assigned to be treated with one drop of Systane® Complete, and the tear lipid layer thickness is to be measured at 15 minutes, 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours after instillation of the eye drop. Following a minimum of a 2-day washout, the same subjects will proceed to the second arm.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age - at least 30 years

          -  Good general health (defined by medication use that has not changed within the last
             month and the absence of medical conditions or treatments that are deemed confounding
             to the data as determined by the PI)

          -  Ability to give informed consent

          -  Willing to spend time for the study; approximately one hour for a screening visit and
             two eye drop exposure visits lasting approximately 6 hours each. Part 2 of the study
             will include using an eye drop of Systane® Complete 4x/day for 1 month and returning
             for one visit lasting approximately 1 hour.

          -  Either gender

          -  Any racial or ethnic origin

          -  SVCM tear lipid thickness ≤ 75 nm

          -  Contact lens wearers must refrain from lens wear for two days before the screening
             visit, including the day of the baseline visit, and during the entire study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Use of any ocular prescription medication (such as but not limited to, glaucoma
             medications, anti-inflammatory eye drops and Restasis) used within 14 days of the
             screening visit or started prior to the measurement visit(s).

          -  Currently having punctal plugs inserted in lacrimal puncta

          -  Current eye disease, infection or inflammation that affects the surface of the eye
             such as, but not limited to moderate or greater blepharitis and ocular allergy.
             Clinically significant (active treatment) of blepharitis, Sjogren's disease or other
             systemic disease that could influence MGD, corneal, conjunctival, or eyelid
             abnormalities that could influence lipid layer thickness, conjunctivitis of any cause,
             ocular infection or systemic medication such as diuretics, SSRIs, that could influence
             tear secretion, or sensitivity to any of the ingredient in the eye drop being tested,

          -  Past eye surgery, such as, but not limited to, refractive surgery. Subjects who have
             had cataract removal surgery more than one year ago may be considered as potential
             subjects.

          -  Female subjects may not be pregnant or lactating. (Subject will be asked to self
             report these conditions.)

          -  Infectious diseases (for example, hepatitis, tuberculosis) or an immuno-suppressive
             disease (for example, HIV). (Subjects will be asked to self-report these conditions.)

          -  Inability to complete the screening and examination

          -  Inability to provide analyzable data. For example, subjects who cannot keep their eye
             open during the entire measurement interval (due to early blinking) or provide a
             readable eye image (due to eyelid laxity) or cannot sit still for 1 minute.
