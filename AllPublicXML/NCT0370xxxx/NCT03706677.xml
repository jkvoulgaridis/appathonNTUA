    <textblock>
      The FIRE AND ICE II Trial (Pilot) is the pilot phase of a prospective, randomized,
      single-blinded, multi-center, interventional post-market clinical trial, comparing efficacy
      and safety of isolation of the pulmonary veins (PVI) using a Cryoballoon catheter or
      radiofrequency ablation with a ThermoCool® Smarttouch® catheter in subjects with persistent
      atrial fibrillation (AF).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      60 patients with persistent AF will be randomized 1:1 between Cryoballoon ablation and
      Radiofrequency ablation in the FIRE AND ICE II Trial Pilot at 5 clinical sites in Europe.

      The data collected within the pilot phase will be reviewed and a decision on extending the
      trial with an extended number of patients and sites as main phase will be taken.

    <measure>Primary Efficacy Objective (not powered within pilot) (time to clinical treatment failure)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Month</time_frame>
    <description>To demonstrate that Cryo ablation is non-inferior to radiofrequency (RF) ablation with respect to time to clinical treatment failure, defined as recurrence of atrial arrhythmias or intervention for AF (a blanking period of three months will be maintained after the index procedure). The first documented recurrence of an episode of atrial arrhythmia after the blanking period lasting at least 30 seconds will be counted for the primary efficacy objective, as well as any intervention for AF with initiation after the blanking period.</description>

    <time_frame>12 Month</time_frame>
    <description>To demonstrate that Cryo ablation is non-inferior to RF ablation with respect to freedom from device and procedure related serious adverse events (SAEs). The first device or procedure related serious adverse event with onset after start of the index ablation therapy will be used for the safety objective analysis.</description>

    <measure>Assess acute procedural success (PVI)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 Month</time_frame>
    <description>Acute procedural success is defined as successful electrical isolation of the pulmonary veins after the ablation procedure as assessed via a diagnostic catheter.</description>

    <measure>Assess quality of life: EQ-5D-5L</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Month and 36 Month</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L and AFEQT questionnaires are administered at screening / baseline and at scheduled follow-up (FU) visits. The EQ-5D-5L questionnaire includes 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) assessed with descriptive questions, and a general health score assessed on a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). For the EQ-5D-5L an index will be derived by comparing the responses to a value set. The index and the health score will each be summarized with mean and standard deviation for randomized arms by visit. The AFEQT questionnaire is a 20-item questionnaire that supports a 4-item symptoms score, an 8-item daily activity score, a 6-item treatment concerns score, and a 2-item treatment satisfaction scale. These are combined into a single AFEQT score. The sub-scores and summary score will be summarized by subject visit and post-procedure assessments, as well as compared between randomized arms using a mixed regression model.</description>
