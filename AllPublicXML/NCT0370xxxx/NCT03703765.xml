  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic venous disease encompasses a broad spectrum of clinical presentations and is
      considered the most common vascular disease. Its causes are diverse, including primary
      defects of the wall or valves, chronic venous insufficiency, or lesions secondary to
      thrombosis, a post-thrombotic venous disease, affecting the superficial or deep venous
      network or both. The major symptom of venous disease is the enlargement of the lower limbs,
      which can result in edema. The evaluation of the volume of the lower limbs is very important
      in the diagnosis and follow-up of the venous pathology. There is a great variability of
      clinical pictures making it difficult to choose the therapeutic gesture. Endovascular venous
      interventions and conventional venous surgery are major advances in the treatment of venous
      disease. The variation of lower limb volume in pre and post procedure is a determining
      factor; thus orienting clinicians for post interventional therapeutic monitoring. Indeed the
      management of venous disease is multidisciplinary, it involves the cooperation of several
      specialists as part of its monitoring and its therapeutic management. Our collaborative group
      includes the Adult and Child Vascular Investigations Department, the Vascular Clinic, the
      Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery Department, and the Interventional Radiology Department.
      The evaluation of the variation of the volumes of the lower limbs is a capital data for the
      various specialists for the care in pre and post procedure. A volumetric 3D scanner system
      guarantees a reliable measurement ensuring optimal evolution and therapeutic follow-up.

      At admission eligible patients are proposed to participate. Written consent is signed after
      complete oral and written explanation of the protocol is signed. No register of non-included
      patients will be kept.

      In included patients, in parallel to the routine ultrasound investigation for which the
      patient is referred, the evaluation of the variation of the volumes of the lower limbs with
      the volumetric 3D scanner will be performed as explained later in arm description.

      Usual ongoing treatments are obtained by history and recorded. The end of the visit is the
      end of the participation of the subjects.

    <description>The 3D scanner system is a three-dimensional measurement system.
It allows to evaluate the volume of the lower limbs in order to quantify the evolution of the edema of the lower limbs in the venous pathology in pre and post therapeutic technique.
It is a non-invasive, easily accepted, non-invasive, non-invasive technique that minimizes discomfort.</description>
