  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy(Neo-CRT) plus surgery has been regarded as a standard of care
      for patients with resectable locally advanced esophageal cancer. Many studies suggest that
      definitive Radiochemotherapy(CRT) has similar efficacy as neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy plus
      surgery for esophageal cancers who respond to chemoradiation. Herein, a single center
      prospective randomized phase Ⅲ multicenter clinical trial will be carried out to compare
      efficacy and safety of definitive radiochemotherapy versus neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy plus
      radical resection in patients who achieved clinical complete response (CCR) after neoadjuvant
      radiochemotherapy for resectable locally advanced esophageal cancer.

      1. Compare progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of definitive
           radiochemotherapy versus(VS) neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy plus radical resection for
           esophageal cancer patients who achieved clinical complete response after neoadjuvant
           treatment;

        2. Compare the toxic and side effects of definitive radiochemotherapy versus neoadjuvant
           radiochemotherapy plus radical resection for esophageal cancer patients who achieved
           clinical complete remission after neoadjuvant treatment;

        3. Compare the relationship and consistency between pathological complete response of
           endoscopic biopsy specimens after neoadjuvant treatment and pathological complete
           response of surgical specimens in neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy plus radical resection
           group;

        4. Assess impact of definitive radiochemotherapy versus neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy plus
           radical resection on quality of life of patients.

        5. Clinical Complete Response After Neoadjuvant Treatment: Endoscope biopsy pathologic
           diagnosis indicate pathologic complete response after Neoadjuvant treatment; upper
           gastrointestinal/chest CT and symptom assessment indicate major response after
           Neoadjuvant treatment (Concurrent Radiochemotherapy: Radiotherapy, Intensity Modulation
           Radiation Therapy(IMRT), 40Gy; Chemotherapy, Docetaxel （25mg/m2）+Cisplatin (25mg/m2),
