  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase III, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre study
      assessing the efficacy and safety of durvalumab compared with placebo, as consolidation
      therapy in patients with locally advanced, unresectable, non-small cell lung cancer (Stage
      III), who have not progressed following definitive, platinum-based, chemoradiation therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 360 patients will be randomized in a 2:1 to receive treatment with durvalumab
      or placebo therapy. EGFR or ALK mutation randomised will be capped at approximately 15%. The
      primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of durvalumab treatment compared
      with placebo in terms of PFS(according to Blinded Independent Central Review).

             chemoradiation therapy

          5. World Health Organization (WHO) PS of 0 or 1;

             laboratory, must be known prior to randomization.

         10. Tumour sample requirements are as follows: Provision of a tumour tissue sample (newly
             acquired sample &lt;=3 months old is preferred, but an archived sample &lt;=6 months old is
