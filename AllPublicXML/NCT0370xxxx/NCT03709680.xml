  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate palbociclib in combination with chemotherapy (temozolomide and
      irinotecan) in children, adolescents and young adults with recurrent or refractory solid
      tumors. The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of palbociclib in
      combination with chemotherapy in order to estimate the maximum tolerated dose.
      Pharmacokinetics and efficacy of palbociclib in combination with chemotherapy will be
      evaluated.

             or may interfere with the interpretation of study results, and in the judgment of the
             Investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study.
