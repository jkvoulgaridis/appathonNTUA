  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hybrid ablation, as an emerging strategy for atrial fibrillation (AF) in recent years, shows
      encouraging outcomes in many medical centers. A lot of cases demonstrated hybrid ablation has
      higher success rate than surgical ablation on patients with persistent AF, especially
      long-standing persistent AF (LSPAF). But it is still lack of high level evidence to prove it.

      This study focus on patients with long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation (LSPAF). In
      order to compare the efficacy and safety of hybrid ablation (two-stage) versus thoracoscopic
      surgical ablation, a randomized, controlled clinical trial will be performed in the
      population of LSPAF patients.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, all selected LSPAF patients will receive thoracoscopic surgical ablation.
      After 3 months of blanking-period, patients off antiarrhythmic therapy freedom from atrial
      arrhythmia (including atrial tachycardia, atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation) will be
      divided into Hybrid group and Surgical group randomly and equally. Patients of Hybrid group
      will receive transcatheter endocardial electrophysiological mapping and catheter ablation
      after randomization subsequently. In followed 2 years, cardiovascular risk control will be
      recommended to 2 groups' patients.

      During the 2-year follow-up, 7d-Holter will be used to monitor patients' rhythm and cardiac
      conditions will be confirmed by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). Physical examination
      and examinations mentioned above will be performed in 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18
      months, 24 months and suspected recurrence.
