    <textblock>
      The study will be a prospective, pragmatic, randomized clinical trial of the comparative
      effectiveness of diagnostic evaluation strategies for stable CAD, to be performed in
      outpatient settings, including primary care and cardiology practices.

    <intervention_model_description>Participants who meet all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be randomized in a ratio of 1:1 within a clinical center to either a precision evaluation strategy or usual care using an interactive web or voice-based system (IXRS). Randomization will be stratified by intended first test if randomized to usual care and by classification as minimal vs. elevated risk by the minimal risk model. The randomization scheme within a clinical center will be carried out by the method of random permuted block design with variable block size</intervention_model_description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria (all must be present):

          1. Age ≥18 years

          2. Stable typical or atypical symptoms suggesting possible significant coronary artery
             disease (CAD) with further non-emergent testing or elective catheterization
             recommended to evaluate the presence of suspected significant CAD. Stable chest pain
             (or equivalent) includes those who have fully been ruled out for Acute Coronary
             Syndrome (ACS) and for whom elective testing is recommended, regardless of the venue
             in which they are seen.

          3. If prior CV testing has occurred, it must have been performed greater than one year
             prior to randomization, and the following must be met:

               1. cCTA or invasive coronary angiography (ICA) with stenosis &lt; 50%

               2. Quantified coronary artery calcium (CAC) &lt; 100 AG

          4. Safe performance of cCTA:

               1. Creatinine clearance ≥45 ml/min per most recent measurement within 90 days

               2. For a female participant of childbearing potential (those who have not been
                  surgically sterilized or are not postmenopausal), a pregnancy test must be
                  performed with negative results known within 7 days prior to randomization

          5. Willingness to comply with all aspects of the protocol, including adherence to the
             assigned strategy and follow-up visits

          6. Ability to provide written informed consent

        Exclusion criteria (all must be absent):

          1. Acute chest pain (in patients who have not been ruled out for ACS)

          2. Unstable clinical status

          3. Noninvasive or invasive CV testing for CAD within 1 year. CV testing for CAD refers to
             any stress tests, invasive coronary angiography (ICA) and cCTA (including calcium
             scoring) only.

             a. Resting ECG, resting echocardiogram and resting CMR (MRI) are not exclusionary
             regardless of when were performed

          4. Lifetime history of known obstructive CAD (prior myocardial infarction, CABG or PCI,
             stenosis ≥50%), known EF ≤40% or other moderate to severe valvular or congenital
             cardiac disease

          5. Contraindications to cCTA including but not limited to creatinine clearance (GFR) &lt;45
             ml/min as per most recent measurement taken within 90 days

          6. Exceeds the site's weight or size limit for cCTA or cardiac catheterization

          7. Any condition leading to possible inability to comply with the protocol procedures or
             follow-up

          8. Any condition that might interfere with the study procedures or follow-up

          9. Enrolled in an investigational trial that involves a non-approved cardiac drug or
             device which has not reached its primary endpoint

         10. Life expectancy less than 2 years due to non-cardiovascular comorbidities
