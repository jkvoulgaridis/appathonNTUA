  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The clinical trial is a randomized control trial to compare the efficacy of a combined
      lidocaine and corticosteroid (CS) injection versus a corticosteroid injection (CS) alone on
      pain, range of motion, and patient reported outcomes for the treatment of common upper
      extremity tendinopathies and nerve entrapments that are often treated with a combination of
      these injectates.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A tendon is a type of tissue that connects your muscles to your bones. These tissues help
      control actions such as running, jumping, grasping, and lifting. Without tendons it would be
      difficult to control the movement of your body. A protective layer known as synovium covers
      tendons. This sheath produces fluid, which keeps the tendon lubricated and moving properly.
      Inflammation or swelling of the sheath is known as tendon sheath inflammation or
      tenosynovitis. This condition is often treated with an injection into or around the sheath.
      This injection often consists of a corticosteroid with or without lidocaine.
      Corticosteroid(CS) are drugs that decrease inflammation and are given for a number of
      orthopaedic conditions to decrease symptoms of the underlying disease. Lidocaine is also a
      drug that blocks the pain response, although it only blocks it momentarily. The study aims to
      determine if corticosteroid injection alone is as effective as corticosteroid combined with
      lidocaine for the relief of tenosynovitis of the upper extremity.

      The study plans to enroll 1000 pts with tendinopathies of upper extremities and nerve
      entrapments and will be followed up in clinic 2 weeks and 6 weeks after the injection. During
      the clinic visits the Visual Analog Scale for pain (VAS-pain), range of motion (ROM),
      strength, and patient reported outcome data will be collected and any complications will be
      noted. Patients will also utilize a pain journal to track VAS-pain over the first 7
      post-injection days.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in pain scores from the Visual Analog Pain Scale (VAS-pain) at the time of injection and during follow up in the corticosteroid plus lidocaine group as compared to the corticosteroid alone group</measure>
    <time_frame>Post injection day (1-7), 2 weeks and at 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Pain assessment will be assessed before performing the injection, at the time of injection, and at each subsequent follow up visit using the Visual Analog Pain Scale (VAS-pain). The pain VAS is self‐completed by the respondent. The respondent is asked to place a line perpendicular to the VAS line at the point that represents their pain intensity. Using a ruler, the score is determined by measuring the distance (mm) on the 10‐cm line between the &quot;no pain&quot; anchor and the patient's mark, providing a range of scores from 0-100. Pain will be assessed at rest and active movement of the affected joint. Cut points for VAS have been recommended: no pain (0-4 mm), mild pain(5-44 mm), moderate pain (45-74 mm), and severe pain (75-100 mm). Normative values are not available.</description>

    <time_frame>Post injection day (1-7), 2 weeks and at 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>ROM assessment will take place at each clinic follow up with a hand-held goniometer. This will be done by assessing the total flexion-extension arc of the wrist, elbow, and shoulder, the total pronation-supination arc at the wrist, and the adduction-abduction arc of the wrist and shoulder. ROM will be assessed on the contralateral side prior to injection</description>

    <measure>Change in the Patient-Rated Wrist Evaluation (PRWE) at the time of injection and during follow up in the corticosteroid plus lidocaine group as compared to the corticosteroid alone group</measure>
    <time_frame>Post injection day (1-7), 2 weeks and at 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient-Related Wrist Evaluation is a score for the measurement of pain and function after injury to the wrist. The PRWE is a 15-item questionnaire that allows patients to rate their levels of wrist pain and disability from 0 to 10, and consists of 2 subscales Pain subscale: contains 5 items each of which is further rated from 1-10. The maximum score in this section is 50 and minimum 0 Function subscale: contains total 10 items which are further divided into 2 sections i.e specific activities (having 6 items) and usual activities (having 4 items). The maximum score in this section is 50 and minimum 0. Total Score = Sum of pain+ function scores (Best Score = 0, Worst Score = 100).</description>

    <measure>Change in the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Shoulder Score (ASES) at the time of injection and during follow up in the corticosteroid plus lidocaine group as compared to the corticosteroid alone group</measure>
    <time_frame>Post injection day (1-7), 2 weeks and at 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Shoulder Score (ASES) is a mixed outcome reporting measure, applicable for use in all patients with shoulder pathology for the assessment of shoulder function. The ASES questionnaire is composed of 17 questions. The questions focus on joint pain, instability, and activities of daily living. It is a 100 point scale (Pain scale= 50 points, 10 activities of daily living = 50 points).Score range: Pain subscale 0-50 ASES points; function/disability subscale 0-50 ASES points. Total score 0-100 ASES points (0 = worse pain and functional loss/disability)</description>

    <measure>Change in the Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) scores at the time of injection and during follow up in the corticosteroid plus lidocaine group as compared to the corticosteroid alone group</measure>
    <time_frame>Post injection day (1-7), 2 weeks and at 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-12 is a multipurpose short form survey with 12 questions, all selected from the SF-36 Health Survey. SF-12 is a standardized self-report questionnaire that assesses mental and physical functioning. The SF-12 consists of 12 items with a Likert-type response format that measures quality of life with a Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS). Subscales associated with the PCS include physical functioning, role limitations due to physical problems, bodily pain, and general health perceptions. Subscales associated with the MCS include vitality (energy and fatigue), social functioning, role limitations due to emotional problems, and mental health. A scoring algorithm is used to generate a total score for each component ranging from 0 to 100. Low values represent a poor health state while high values represent a good health state.</description>

    <measure>Change in the Quick Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder and Hand (QuickDASH) scores at the time of injection and during follow up in the corticosteroid plus lidocaine group as compared to the corticosteroid alone group</measure>
    <time_frame>Post injection day (1-7), 2 weeks and at 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The domains explored by the Quick DASH are: (1) physical arm, shoulder or hand activity problems (6 items); (2) severity of pain and tingling (2 items); (3) social activities, work, and sleep (3 items). Each item has five response options, ranging from 1, ''no difficulty or no symptom,'' to 5, ''unable to perform activity or very severe symptom.'' If at least 10 of the 11 items are completed, a score ranging from 0 (no disability) to 100 (most severe disability) can be calculated [(sum of n responses/n) - 1] x 25.the effect size and the percentage of patients reaching Minimal Clinical Important Improvement was determined.</description>

    <measure>Change in 10 point likert scale of pain scores before the injection and after the injection and during follow up in the corticosteroid plus lidocaine group as compared to the corticosteroid alone group</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre Injection; 1 minute after the injection, Post injection day (1-7), 2 weeks and at 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A 10 point likert scale is administered to assess the pain before and after the injection and to assess the complications at the follow up visits. The 10 point likert scale asks the participants to rate the pain from 0 (no pain) 5 (moderate pain) to 10 worst possible pain. Higher scores indicates more pain.</description>
