      The purpose of this study is to compare the curative effect of oral S-1 with Pemetrexed in
      the maintenance treatment of advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and
      initial to explore a new treatment strategy for advanced non-squamous NSCLC.

      S-1 consists of Tegafur,Gimeracil and Oteracil Potassium. Tegafur is metabolize to
      Gimeracilï¼Œand slows down the metabolism of 5-FU in high DPD enzyme expression tumor cell, so
      that 5-FU could bring the antimetabolic fiction more efficiently. Plenty of studies support
      that S-1 shows a desirable effect on advanced non-squamous NSCLC, and S-1 is more convenient
      compare with Pemetrexed. The curative effect of Pemetrexed in the maintenance treatment of
      advanced non-squamous NSCLC has been proved to be valid. The purpose of our study is to
      explore whether S-1 could replace Pemetrexed in the maintenance treatment of advanced
      non-squamous NSCLC.
