      Investigator plan to conduct a multicenter, open-labelled, randomized study to compare the

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although wrist radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula (RCAVF) has been recommended as first
      preferred fistula in many clinical practical guidelines for vascular access, there are no
      randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the recommended anatomic order of
      distal-to-proximal access construction up to now. A modified non-transposed brachiobasilic
      arteriovenous fistula (mNT-BBAVF) that has a long length of suitable superficial vein for
      cannulation and a sufficient blood flow for effective dialysis has been introduced by
      investigator for several years. In addition, mNT-BBAVF has good primary patency and a low
      risk of complication and leave opportunities for further procedures in the event of failure.
      Investigator plan to conduct a multicenter, open-labelled, randomized study to compare the
      primary patency and safety of elbow mNT-BBAVF and wrist RCAVF in hemodialysis patients.
