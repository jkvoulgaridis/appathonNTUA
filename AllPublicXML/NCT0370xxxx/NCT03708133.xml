  <brief_title>Study to Assess Bioequivalence of a New Nifurtimox Oral Tablet Formulation</brief_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the current study is to investigate the bioequivalence of a newly
      developed 120 mg nifurtimox tablet formulation (Test treatment) compared with the 120 mg
      nifurtimox tablet currently used in the Bayer pediatric clinical development program
      (Reference treatment). The new tablet formulation assessed in this study is intended to
      replace the 120 mg nifurtimox tablet formulation currently used in clinical practice. It is
      an immediate-release tablet with an altered composition compared to the reference
      formulation. The new tablet overcomes pharmaceutical quality issues seen for the current
      formulation, e.g. sensitivity to humidity. Due to safety reasons, the study drug will be
      administered under fed conditions to adult male and female patients suffering from Chagas'
      disease and not healthy subjects (see also Benefit-risk assessment below).

      In addition, the PK, safety, and tolerability of nifurtimox will be assessed as secondary
      objectives.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        - Male/female patient diagnosed with chronic Chagas' disease: Previous diagnosis of acute
        or chronic Chagas' disease by a health clinic prior to screening for the study. The
        diagnosis of chronic Chagas' disease may be made by clinical findings, supported by
        antibody titers if available. If there is a known history of acute disease, it is
        preferable to have documentation of parasites on the blood smear, if available.

          -  Women and men of reproductive potential must agree to use adequate contraception when
             sexually active. This applies for the time period between signing of the informed
             consent form and 12 weeks after the last administration of study drug. The definition
             of adequate contraception will be based on the judgment of the investigator and on
             local requirements. Acceptable methods of contraception include, but are not limited
             to: (i) condoms (male or female) with or without a spermicidal agent; (ii) diaphragm
             or cervical cap with spermicide; (iii) intra-uterine device; (iv) hormone-based
             contraception. Subjects must agree to utilize two reliable and acceptable methods of
             contraception simultaneously.

          -  Women of childbearing potential with confirmed last menstrual period by anamnesis and
             negative serum pregnancy test (beta-human chorionic gonadotropin [βhCG]) at screening
             and negative urine pregnancy test (βhCG) at pre-dose of each treatment.

          -  Women of non-childbearing potential, such as surgically sterile women with either
             written documentation of surgical sterility or negative serum pregnancy test (βhCG) at
             screening and negative urine pregnancy test (βhCG) at pre-dose of each treatment.

          -  Male subjects who agree not to act as sperm donors for 12 weeks after last
             administration of study drug.

          -  Age: 18 to 45 years (inclusive) at screening.

          -  Body mass index (BMI): ≥18 and &lt;29.9 kg/m².

          -  At least 3 months since delivery or abortion, or 3 months since cessation of lactation
             before screening.

          -  Ability to understand and follow study-related instructions.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Acute Chagas' disease. (During the acute phase, the parasite on a blood smear may be
             seen under a microscope. Different antibodies are present, depending on the course of
             the disease).

          -  Known hypersensitivity to the study drug (active substance or excipients of the
             preparations)

          -  Suspected or known porphyria.

          -  Clinically significant allergies (e.g. allergies affecting the lower respiratory tract
             such as allergic asthma or allergies requiring therapy with systemic corticosteroids)
             within 1 year.

          -  Clinically significant non-allergic drug reactions, or multiple severe drug allergies
             (e.g. adverse reactions in the form of bronchospasm, asthma, rhinitis or urticaria
             after taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs).

          -  Unstable or uncontrolled medical condition such as hypertension or diabetes,
             decompensated heart failure, GI conditions that would interfere with the absorption of
             the study drug (e.g. GI ulceration, peptic ulceration, GI bleeding, gastroesophageal
             reflux, or other GI disease affecting gastroesophageal junction), conditions that
             could potentially have an impact on drug metabolism or elimination (renal, hepatic
             such as known hepatic or biliary abnormalities), or any clinically relevant active
             infections in the opinion of the investigator within 4 weeks before the screening
             visit, e.g. clinically relevant history or presence of significant respiratory (e.g.
             interstitial lung disease), hematological, lymphatic, neurological, cardiovascular,
             psychiatric, musculoskeletal, genitourinary, immunological, metabolic (e.g. diabetes),
             and dermatological or connective tissue disease.

          -  Incompletely cured pre-existing diseases (except chronic Chagas' disease without
             active GI condition) for which it can be assumed that the absorption, distribution,
             metabolism, elimination, and effects of the study drugs will not be normal.

          -  Febrile illness within 1 week before the first study drug administration.

          -  Systolic blood pressure &lt;100 or &gt;140 mmHg (after resting in supine position for a
             minimum of 15 minutes).

          -  Diastolic blood pressure &lt;50 or &gt;90 mmHg (after resting in supine position for a
             minimum of 15 minutes).

          -  Heart rate &lt;45

          -  Positive pregnancy test.

          -  Positive results for hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis C virus
             antibodies (anti-HCV), or human immunodeficiency virus antibodies (anti-HIV 1+2).

          -  Positive urine drug screening.
