  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immediately following a spinal cord injury (SCI), patients are admitted to inpatient
      rehabilitation where they undergo physical reconditioning in preparation for a return to home
      setting. The current standard of practice for aerobic training is performing arm-ergometry
      for 25 mins at a frequency of three times per week. Given the move towards shortened length
      of stay during inpatient rehabilitation, performing MICT can consume a considerable amount of
      therapy time. Sprint interval training (SIT) has been shown to elicit similar improvements in
      physical capacity, despite a reduced time commitment to MICT. However, there are no
      controlled trials comparing the effects of SIT to MICT in individuals with SCI undergoing
      inpatient rehabilitation. The primary aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of a
      five-week, thrice weekly 10 min SIT program and compare outcome measures to a traditional 25
      minute MICT program on the arm-ergometer in individuals with SCI undergoing inpatient
      clinical rehabilitation. It was hypothesized that five weeks of SIT and MICT would induce
      similar changes in maximal and sub-maximal exercise performance, self-efficacy for exercise,
      and exercise enjoyment, despite large differences in training volume and time commitment. It
      was also hypothesized that SIT would be well tolerated and elicit higher levels of
      cardiovascular strain than MICT.

    <description>Training was performed three times a week for five weeks. Each session began with a 2 minute warm up, and concluded with a 3 minute cool down. Following the warm-up, participants performed 20 minutes of arm cycling at a self-selected cadence at 45-65% of their peak power output. Total training duration was 25 mins.</description>
