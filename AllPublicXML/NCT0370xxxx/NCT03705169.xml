      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and
      antiviral activity of SAR441236, a tri-specific broadly neutralizing antibody against the
      human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and antiviral activity
      of SAR441236, a tri-specific broadly neutralizing antibody against HIV.

      The study includes three arms. In Arm A, three cohorts of antiretroviral-treated,
      virologically suppressed participants will be randomized to receive a single intravenous (IV)
      dose of SAR441236 or placebo on Day 0. After Cohort 1, each subsequent cohort will open for
      enrollment only after an evaluation of safety outcomes for all participants in the previous
      cohort indicates that it is safe to increase the dose of SAR441236. All participants in
      Cohorts 1-3 will be followed for 24 weeks.

      In Arm A, Cohort 4, participants will be randomized to receive an IV infusion of SAR441236 or
      placebo once every 12 weeks beginning at entry, for a total of 4 infusions. Participants in
      this cohort will be followed for 72 weeks.

      Participants in Arm A will continue taking non-study-provided antiretroviral treatment
      throughout the study.

      In Arm B, five cohorts of viremic participants will each receive a single IV dose of
      SAR441236 on Day 0. Each subsequent Arm B cohort will be opened for enrollment only after an
      evaluation of efficacy data from Day 14 for all participants in the previous cohort. All Arm
      B participants will be followed for 24 weeks.

      Participants in Arm B will initiate or re-initiate non-study-provided combination
      antiretroviral therapy (ART) (selected by their primary HIV clinician) on Day 28.

      In Arm C, two cohorts of ART-treated, virologically suppressed participants each will be
      randomized to receive a single subcutaneous (SC) dose of SAR441236 or placebo on Day 0.
      Cohort 11 will open for enrollment only after an evaluation of safety outcomes from Day 14
      for all participants in Cohort 10 and the cumulative data from all the previous cohorts
      indicates it is safe to dose escalate. All Arm C participants will be followed for 24 weeks.

      Participants in Arm C will continue taking non-study-provided ART throughout the study.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria, Arms A, B, and C

          -  HIV-1 infection, documented by any licensed rapid HIV-1 test or HIV-1 enzyme or
             chemiluminescence immunoassay (E/CIA) test kit at any time prior to study entry and
             confirmed by a licensed Western blot, Geenius assay, or a second antibody test by a
             method other than the initial rapid HIV-1 and/or E/CIA, or by HIV-1 antigen, plasma
             HIV-1 RNA viral load.

               -  NOTE: The term &quot;licensed&quot; refers to a US Food and Drug Administration
                  (FDA)-approved kit.

               -  WHO (World Health Organization) and CDC (Centers for Disease Control and
                  Prevention) guidelines mandate that confirmation of the initial test result must
                  use a test that is different from the one used for the initial assessment. A
                  reactive initial rapid test should be confirmed by either another type of rapid
                  assay or an E/CIA that is based on a different antigen preparation and/or
                  different test principle (e.g., indirect versus competitive), or a Western blot,
                  Geenius assay, or a plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load.

          -  The following laboratory values obtained within 45 days prior to entry by any US
             laboratory that has a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certification
             or its equivalent.

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to 1500 cells/mm^3

               -  Hemoglobin greater than or equal to 12.0 g/dL for men and greater than or equal
                  to 11.0 g/dL for women

               -  Platelet count greater than or equal to 120,000/mm^3

             prior to study entry.

               -  NOTE: A negative HCV RNA level may result from either spontaneous clearance or

             CLIA certification or its equivalent, or is using a point of care (POC)/CLIA-waived
             test.

               -  NOTE: Reproductive potential is defined as girls who have reached menarche, and
                  women who have not been post-menopausal for at least 24 consecutive months, i.e.,

          -  All study candidates must agree not to participate in an assisted conception process
             (e.g., sperm donation, intrauterine insemination, in vitro fertilization) from
             screening until 12 weeks after the final study visit.

          -  If participating in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy, all study candidates

             used appropriately:

               -  Condoms (male or female) with or without a spermicidal agent. Condoms are
                  recommended because their appropriate use is the only contraception method

               -  Hormone-based contraceptive.

          -  Study candidates who are not of reproductive potential are eligible without requiring
             the use of a contraceptive method. Acceptable documentation of sterilization,
             menopause, and reproductive potential is specified below.

               -  Written documentation or oral communication from a clinician or clinician's staff

                    -  Operative report or other source documentation in the patient record

                       range as established by the reporting laboratory.

               -  NOTE A: Female reproductive potential is defined in the criteria above.

               -  NOTE B: Male candidates who are not of reproductive potential are defined as
                  having documented azoospermia.

               -  NOTE C: A female study candidate's oral report of her male partner's lack of
                  reproductive potential should be recorded in the source documents if written
                  proof is not available.

          -  Individuals age greater than or equal to 18 years and less than or equal to 70 years
             at study entry.

          -  Ability and willingness of participant to provide informed consent.
