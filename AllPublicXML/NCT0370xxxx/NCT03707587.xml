      Background:

      PD-L1 is a protein on the surface of cells. It regulates if a cell can be killed by immune
      system cells. It is thought to be able to affect the immune system response to diseased cells
      like those infected with a virus. The molecule M7824 interferes with the activity of PD-L1.
      It could help the immune system kill cells infected with a virus . Since recurrent
      respiratory papillomatosis is caused by a virus infection, this molecule could help.

      Objective:

      To see if M7824 works in treating recurrent respiratory papillomatosis.

      Eligibility:

      Adults ages 18 years or older with recurrent respiratory papillomatosis

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with:

      Medical history

      Physical exam

      Blood and pregnancy tests

      Endoscopy procedure in clinic. A small tube with a camera will look at the inside of the
      nose, throat, larynx, and upper windpipe.

      Some participants will also be screened with a chest scan.

      At the start of the study, participants will:

      Have a sedated endoscopy procedure where biopsies will be taken.

      Have blood tests.

      Have apheresis. Blood will be collected by a tube in an arm vein. A machine will remove white
      blood cells. The rest of the blood will be returned into an arm vein.

      Fill out a voice questionnaire.

      Participants will get the study molecule into a vein over about 1 hour. They will get it
      every other week for up to 12 weeks.

      Participants will repeat screening and starting procedures throughout the study. They will
      also review side effects and any medicine they are taking.

      When they are done with the study treatment, participants will be evaluated by repeating the
      study procedures. They may be evaluated periodically until their disease progresses....

      Background

        -  Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) is a rare papillomatous disease of the
           aerodigestive tract that is caused by the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV).

        -  RRP can progress to cause airway compromise, fatal pulmonary lesions, and invasive
           cancers.

        -  There is no effective systemic therapy for RRP. Patients typically require repeated
           interventional procedures for disease control.

        -  A recently completed phase II clinical trial investigating avelumab in subjects with
           aggressive RRP demonstrated an acceptable safety profile from Avelumab and a high rate
           of partial responses.

        -  RRP is characterized by frequent expression of PD-L1 and TGF-beta in the tumor
           microenvironment.

        -  This clinical trial will evaluate the activity of M7824, a novel bifunctional fusion
           protein composed of a fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibody against human PD-L1
           (avelumab) fused, via a flexible glycine-serine linker, to the soluble extracellular
           domain of human TGF- B receptor II (TGF-BRII), which functions as a TGF-B trap. This
           drug was selected for its demonstrated activity in a variety of cancers and for its
           acceptable safety profile.

      Objective

      - Determine the complete response rate for M7824 in the treatment of patients with RRP.

      Eligibility

        -  Histologically confirmed diagnosis of RRP.

        -  One of the following:

             -  A Derkay anatomic score of 10 or greater and a history of two or more endoscopic
                interventions in the last 12 months for control of RRP.

             -  Pulmonary RRP with pulmonary disease that is measurable by computed tomography
                scan.

             -  Tracheal involvement with RRP that has required either two or more endoscopic
                interventions in the last 12 months or a tracheostomy.

        -  Age 18 years or greater.

        -  Eastern Oncology Cooperative Group Performance Score of 0 or 1.

      Design

        -  This is a phase II clinical trial with two cohorts that will enroll simultaneously.

        -  Cohort 1 will consist of subjects who have not been treated previously with an immune
           checkpoint inhibitor. Cohort 2 will consist of subjects whose disease has been treated
           previously with andrefractory to an immune checkpoint inhibitor. Each cohort will have a
           Simon optimal two-stage design with initial enrollment of 12 patients and expans 21
           patients if one or more complete response(s) is/are observed in the initial patients.
           With amendment D, dated 7/24/2019, cohort 2 will be closed to further enrollment.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        RRP criteria:

          -  Histological diagnosis of RRP confirmed by pathology report from a CLIA-certified
             laboratory.

          -  One of the following:

               -  A Derkay anatomic score of 10 or greater and a history of two or more endoscopic
                  interventions in the last 12 months for control of RRP.

               -  Pulmonary RRP with pulmonary disease that is measurable by computed tomography
                  scan and evaluated by RECIST Criteria.

               -  Tracheal involvement with RRP that has required either two or more endoscopic
                  interventions in the last 12 months or a tracheostomy.

          -  Greater than or equal to 18 years of age.

          -  Able to understand and sign the Informed Consent Document.

          -  Clinical performance status of ECOG 0 or1.

          -  Willing to undergo endoscopic evaluation with biopsies in compliance with this
             protocol.

          -  No systemic therapy for RRP for at least 3 half-lives of the prior drug(s).

          -  Screening laboratory values must meet the following criteria and should be obtained
             within 14 days prior to first dose:

               -  WBC &gt; 2000/ microliter

               -  Neutrophils &gt; 1000/ microliter

               -  Platelets &gt; 75 x10(3)/ microliter

               -  Hemoglobin &gt; 9.0 g/dL

               -  Serum Creatinine &lt; 1.5 x ULN OR eGFR &gt; 30 mL/min (measured or calculated using
                  the MDRD equation).

               -  AST/ALTless than or equal to 2.5 x ULN

               -  Total Bilirubin :S 1.5 x ULN

               -  PT/INR and PTT less than or equal to ULN

          -  Sexually active subjects (men and women) of reproductive potential must agree to use
             two methods of contraception: one highly effective and one other effective method
             throughout M7824 treatment and for at least 120 days after M7824 treatment. Highly
             Effective Methods are defined as: Intrauterine device (IUD), hormonal (birth control
             pills, injections, implants), tubal ligation and partner s vasectomy; Other are
             defined as: latex condom, diaphragm and cervical cap.

          -  Seronegative for HIV antibody. The experimental treatment being evaluated in this
             protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who are HIV seropositive can
             have decreased immune function and thus are likely less responsive to the experimental
             treatment.

          -  Seronegative for hepatitis B antigen, positive hepatitis B tests can be further
             evaluated by confirmatory tests (Hep B DNA Quant, HBV Viral Load), and if confirmatory
             tests are negative, the patient can be enrolled.

          -  Seronegative for hepatitis C antibody unless antigen negative. If hepatitis C antibody
             test is positive, then patients must be tested for the presence of antigen by Hep C
             RNA Quant, HCV Viral Load and be HCV RNA negative.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Any severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric conditions including recent (within
             the past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior, liver disease, lung disease
             (with the exception of what is specified in inclusion criteria) , or laboratory
             abnormalities that, in the opinion of the investigators, may increase the risk
             associated with study participation or study drug administration, impair the ability
             of the subject to receive protocol therapy, or interfere with the interpretation of
             study results and in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient
             inappropriate for entry into this study. Patients with mild to moderate asthma or
             chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) well controlled with oral or inhaled
             medications are permitted to enroll.

          -  Subjects with active, known or suspected autoimmune disease. Subjects with vitiligo,
             residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune condition only requiring hormone
             replacement, or psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment, are permitted to enroll.

          -  Subjects with a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (&gt;
             10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14
             days of study drug administration. Inhaled, topical intranasal or intro-ocular
             steroids, and adrenal replacement doses &lt;10 mg daily prednisone equivalents are
             permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease.

          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents

          -  Pregnant or breast feeding. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative
             pregnancy test at screening. Women of childbearing potential include women who have
             experienced menarche and who have not undergone successful surgical sterilization
             (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or are not
             postmenopausal. Post-menopause is defined as amenorrhea greater than or equal to 12
             consecutive months. Note: women who have been amenorrheic for 12 or more months are
             still considered to be of childbearing potential if the amenorrhea is possibly due to
             prior chemotherapy, anti- estrogens, ovarian suppression or any other reversible
             reason.

          -  History of allergy to study drug components.

             requiring medication.

          -  Persisting toxicity related to prior therapy of Grade &gt;1 NCI-CTCAE v 5.0; however,
             alopecia, sensory neuropathy Grade less than or equal to 2 or other Grade less than or
             equal to 2 AEs not constituting a safety risk based on investigator's judgment are
             acceptable.

          -  Known alcohol or drug abuse.

          -  Vaccination within 4 weeks of the first dose of M7824 and 4 weeks after the last dose
             of M7824 are prohibited.
