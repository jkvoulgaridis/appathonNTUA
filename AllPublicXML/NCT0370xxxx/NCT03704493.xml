    <textblock>
      Exercise stress testing is the most frequently used clinical tool for assessment of coronary
      artery disease. To ensure a high validity of the results, a good Patient compliance is
      crucial. The aim of this study is to examine the effects of a virtually presented exercise
      group on the perceived comfort and the exercise capacity of patients during classical
      treadmill exercise testing. The investigators hypothesis is, that a virtually presented
      running group will increase the comfort of patients and their exercise capacity.

      108 Patients were randomized in an open label trial 1:1 to either exercise treadmill testing
      while watching a static image of a flower (image group) or to exercise treadmill testing
      while watching a video of 5 amateur runners, running across and fields, giving the patient
      the impression of running within the group (video group). After the exercise test patients
      were asked to score their perceived comfort level and achieved level of their subjective
      physical limit on a 10 point scale.

      Standard exercise treadmill parameters, as well as baseline demographic data were recorded of
      each patient. Patients with missing data was excluded of the analysis.

      Statistic analysis was performed with t-test for normally distributed data and
      Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney-Test for non-normal data.
