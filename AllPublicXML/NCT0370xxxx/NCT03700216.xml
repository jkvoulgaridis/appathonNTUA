  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is aimed to construct a multi-parameter early-warning model based on usage of
      mannitol, using multi-factor regression and combining with previous clinical experience,
      literature, expert opinions. The investigators will evaluate the predictive value of the
      model for mannitol usage and gypsum cutting open through cohort study verification.

      The investigator will retrospect the data of operative patients with limb fracture in
      Pediatric Orthopedics Unit of Shanghai Xinhua Hospital in 2016 to collect the basic
      information about this kind of patient, including age, gender, kind of fracture, temperature
      and color of skin, swell, artery pulse, laboratory test indicators, method of fixation, and
      the usage of mannitol. Then, combining the professionals' suggestions, the investigator will
      use multi-factor regression to identify the independent risk factors of blood circulation
      disorder. According to the independent risk factors, the early-warning model of blood
      circulation disorder will be built, and the rating scale as well. Finally, the critical value
      of blood circulation disorder after limb fracture will be set by receiver operating
      characteristic curve.

    <description>Oxygen saturation is the fraction of oxygen-saturated hemoglobin relative to total hemoglobin (unsaturated + saturated) in the blood, which can reflect the status of blood circulation. Blood oxygen saturation can be get by using percutaneous oxygen saturation monitor.</description>
