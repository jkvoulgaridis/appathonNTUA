  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective study evaluating the feasibility and safety of remote hypertension
      management using a central telemonitoring program among patients with elevated blood pressure
      (BP) at the University of Mississippi Medical Center (UMMC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with elevated BP, identified by the electronic medical record, will be recruited for
      study enrollment. Patients will be mailed a telemonitoring kit including an electronic tablet
      equipped with a wireless BP cuff that transmits measurements directly to the UMMC electronic
      medical record and monitored by the UMMC Center for Telehealth. Patients will participate in
      a 6 month intervention period during which they will transmit daily BP recordings with
      regular contact by a Telehealth nurse coordinator who will provide education and encourage
      healthy lifestyle habits. Every 2 weeks BP medications will be adjusted according to an
      evidence-based treatment algorithm managed by the Center for Telehealth pharmacist using a
      standardized physician-approved protocol. Data analysis will track metrics of study
      enrollment, study completion, safety, therapeutic intensification, and BP change from
      baseline.

    <description>Adverse event data will primarily be collected through self-report during each nursing coordinator contact with the patient. Participants will report any hospitalization longer than 12 hours, emergency room visits, or some-day clinic visits and reasons for those visits since the prior nurse coordinator encounter. Study staff will obtain and review medical records related to all adverse events including: deaths, hospitalizations, major cardiac events, incident kidney failure, and urgent evaluations for hypertension, hypotension, loss of consciousness or fainting, allergic reactions, hives, and angioedema. These events are evaluated for severity, expectedness, and potential relatedness to the intervention and study participation.</description>

    <description>Using the telemedicine kit, participants will record a daily health session including 2 BP measurements obtained one minute apart. Participants are encouraged to record a health session every day, with a minimum of 5 days per week. Participants are also encouraged to equally divide health session recordings between the mornings and evenings. Every 2 weeks BP measurements will be assessed. If less than 75% of measurements are at goal &lt;130/80 mmHg, the central Telehealth pharmacist will designate drug-therapy intensification according to an evidence-based treatment algorithm that is physician approved. Regardless of BP control, participants will be contacted by their nurse coordinator every 2 weeks. During all telephone visits nurse coordinators emphasize healthy lifestyle habits. Safety protocols are in place for dangerously high or low BP recordings.</description>
