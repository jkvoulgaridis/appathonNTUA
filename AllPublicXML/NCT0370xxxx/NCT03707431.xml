  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Abdominal pain is common in children with chronic and acute recurring pancreatitis (CP, ARP),
      and as they continue into adulthood, the disease progresses with increased pain and greater
      exposure to opioids. Despite the relevancy of early pain self-management for childhood
      pancreatitis, there have been no studies of non-pharmacological pain intervention in this
      population. The proposed project will evaluate a web-based cognitive behavioral pain
      management program delivered to a cohort of well-phenotyped children with CP/ARP and some
      community participants to reduce pain, pain-related disability and enhance HRQOL; it will
      also identify genetic risk factors and clinical and behavioral phenotypic factors associated
      with treatment response to enable precision medicine approaches.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Abdominal pain is present in 81% of children and adolescents with CP and ARP. Effective
      treatments that target pain in these children will lessen the risk of opioid exposure and
      continued pain and disability into adulthood. We plan to recruit a large multicenter sample
      of 260 children and adolescents (ages 10-17 years) with CP/ARP and their parents from
      INSPPIRE 2 (INSPPIRE:INternational Study Group of Pediatric Pancreatitis: In search for a
      cuRE) centers and pancreatitis community groups (e.g. NPF) to evaluate the efficacy of
      WebMAP, a web-based cognitive behavioral pain management program (CBT). The study design is a
      two (group) x three (time point) randomized, controlled, double-blinded trial. Participants
      will be randomly assigned to receive online access to either pain education (WebED) or CBT
      (WebMAP) over an 8-10 week treatment period. The primary study outcome is abdominal pain
      symptoms measured at pre-treatment, immediately post-treatment, and at 6-month follow-up.
      Secondary outcomes include pain-related disability, health-related quality of life,
      depression and anxiety symptoms, and medication use. This project represents a significant
      advance in pain management for children with CP/ARP by evaluating the first ever
      nonpharmacologic pain intervention in these patients, which may guide future developments in
      the management of chronic pain associated with CP/ARP.

    <measure>Change in abdominal pain severity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Abdominal Pain Index (API) assesses characteristics of abdominal pain during the previous 2 weeks including the number of days with pain, number of pain episodes per day, typical pain episode duration, and typical pain intensity. An index is computed with higher scores indicating greater abdominal pain severity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in pain-related disability</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Child Activity Limitations Interview (CALI-9) is a daily diary validated to assess perceived difficulty in completing 9 daily activities as a measure of pain-related disability. Responses are rated on a 5-point scale (0-4) with higher scores indicating greater perceived difficulty with activities. Youth will provide ratings daily for 7 days on their online diaries at each assessment period. Mean total activity limitations across the reporting period is used in analyses, with higher scores indicating greater disability.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in health-related quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (Peds-QL) assesses several domains of functioning, including physical, social, emotional, and academic functioning. The PedsQL is widely used as it demonstrates good reliability for both the parent and child self-report measures. Higher scores indicate fewer difficulties (better) health-related quality of life. Sub scales of physical and psychosocial health will be used in analyses.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in emotional distress</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Pediatric Emotional Distress Scales include an 8-item scale of anxiety that assesses fear (e.g., fearfulness), anxious misery (e.g., worry) and hyperarousal (e.g., nervousness) and 8-item scale of depressive symptoms that evaluates negative mood, view of self and social cognitions. Raw scores and T-scores are computed with T-scores above 60 indicating clinically elevated symptoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in opioid use</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Youth and parents will report on over the counter and prescription (opioid and non-opioid) medication use in the preceding 7 days.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in pain self-efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Pain Self-Efficacy Scale is a 7-item measure that assesses the child's beliefs in carrying out activities when in pain. The scale has demonstrated good internal consistency, cross-informant reliability with parent report, and strong construct validity. Higher scores indicate higher self-efficacy.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in parent impact of pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Parents will complete the Bath Adolescent Pain Questionnaire-Parent Impact Questionnaire (BAPQ-PIQ), a measure of the impact of parenting an adolescent with chronic pain. The BAPQ-PIQ is a 62-item questionnaire with 8 scales including: depressive symptoms, anxiety, pain catastrophizing, self-blame, partner relationship, social functioning, parental behavior, and parental role strain. Items are rated on a 5-point frequency response scale (0 = never, 4 = always) with higher scores indicating more impaired functioning for all subscales. The BAPQ-PIQ has demonstrated good reliability and validity among parents of youth with chronic pain. Sub scales will be analyzed separately.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in pain interference</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS Pain Interference - Pediatric Short Form includes 8 items to assess consequences of pain on relevant aspects of one's life. This includes the extent to which pain hinders engagement with social, cognitive, emotional, physical, and recreational activities. The scale has been validated in pediatric patients with chronic pain. Raw scores and T-scores are computed with T-scores above 60 indicating clinically elevated symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in health service utilization</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Parents will complete the Client Service Receipt Inventory-Pain version, a measure of service use, out-of-pocket expenses, and lost work time incurred by families for the evaluation or management of the child's chronic pain. Questions pertain to hospital admissions, outpatient services, community services (e.g., tutor, lawyer), medications, lost work time, paid help, and other costs. We will compute the following variables: total number of services used by category, number of lost parental work days, and number of out-of-pocket expenses.
visits, medications, other treatments, and indirect costs as reported by the parent.</description>
