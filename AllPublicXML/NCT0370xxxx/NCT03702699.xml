      The present study is a pilot diagnostic accuracy study conducted to assess the diagnostic
      ability of a novel APD for auricular point detection among patients with knee osteoarthritis,
      as compared with an already commercialized device. The investigators will test if the novel
      APD could provide a more reliable and quantifiable diagnosis than traditional devices
      currently available in the market; They will also use the APD device to test whether the
      cutaneous electrical impedance detected from the corresponding auricular points by the novel
      device is the lowest in the knee and lower limb area in the KOA population. As a pilot study,
      12 patients with KOA will be recruited from the Department of Anesthesiology, Queen Mary
      Hospital, the University of Hong Kong. 12 healthy subjects will be recruited from the
      university community. Auricular acupoint detection will be accomplished with the new device
      and a control device. The electrical impedance will be measured and recorded. Patient's
      condition will also be evaluated by the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS)
      and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC). The
      specificity and sensitivity of the auricular point detection by the APD device will be
      calculated. Cohen's kappa coefficient (Îº) will be used to test the inter-methods reliability,
      test-retest reliability, and inter-tester reliability. Moreover, the Pearson Correlation
      Coefficient will be used to test the correlation between the electrical impedance of the
      auricular point of knee and the KOOS score and WOMAC score.

    <description>The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) is a 24-item instrument used to measure pain and joint function among patients with osteoarthritis. For each item, there is a Likert 5-point scale (ranging from 0 to 4), where 0 = none and 4 = extremely. It includes three major domains, including pain, stiffness, and physical function. The total score is calculated as the sum of the items chosen divided by 96.</description>

    <description>Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) is a validated 42-item global knee score suitable for comparison of patients with knee complaints attributable to different causes. A Likert scale is used and all items have five possible answer options scored from 0 (No Problems) to 4 (Extreme Problems) and each of the five scores is calculated as the sum of the items included. Scores are transformed to a 0-100 scale, with zero representing extreme knee problems and 100 representing no knee problems as is common in orthopaedic assessment scales and generic measures. Scores between 0 and 100 represent the percentage of total possible score achieved.</description>
