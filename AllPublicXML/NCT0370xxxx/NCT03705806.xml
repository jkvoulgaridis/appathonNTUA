    <textblock>
      The trial is designed as a prospective observational single arm study investigating stage IV
      non-small cell lung cancer patients who are routinely treated with a PD-1 inhibitor for
      indications approved by Health Canada. All patients who are selected will be referred for
      palliative thoracic radiotherapy and treated with a standard dose prescription of 30 Gy in 10
      fractions.

    <description>Patients will be followed for up to two years following the completion of their radiotherapy. They will undergo CT surveillance imaging as standard by routine immunotherapy protocol with a minimum of 3 scans at the 3, 6 and 12 month mark. Local and distant recurrence will be determined primarily by CTCAE with CT scans as per ir-RECIST v1.0 criteria.</description>
