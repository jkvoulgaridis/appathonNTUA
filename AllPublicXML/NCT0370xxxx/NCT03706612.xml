  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Identify the unique associations of body shape to body composition and bone density indices
      in a pediatric population that represents the variance of sex, age, BMI-Z, and ethnicity
      found in the US population.

      Describe the precision and accuracy of optical scans to monitor change in body composition,
      bone density and metabolic health interventions.

      Estimate the level of association of optical to common health indicators including metabolic
      risk factors (glucose, triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol, blood pressure, VAT, WC and strength)
      by gender, race, age, and BMI-Z.

      Investigate holistic, high-resolution descriptors of 3D body shape as direct predictors of
      body composition and metabolic risk using statistical shape models and Latent Class Analysis.

        The investigator will recruit a stratified sample of 720 participants, approximately 360
        from each site, using the following equally-weighed stratifications: sex, age (5-10, 11-14,
        15-17 years), BMI-Z score (less than -2, -2 to 1, 1 to 2, and greater than 2) and ethnicity
        (White, Black, Mexican-American, Asian and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander).

        Within this sample, the investigator will include up to 36 participants with very low and
        high BMI by special recruitments from the facilities. The remainder of the participants
        will be recruited as a sample of convenience using local advertisements around the
        specified facilities.

               -  perform activities of daily living (ADLs) without difficulty, and

               -  have no life-threatening conditions or diseases that would alter body composition
                  from what is typical for age, sex, ethnicity, and BMI.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  any internal metal artifact (e.g. pacemakers, internal fixation, arthroplasty),
             amputation, physical impairment or previous fracture that would alter body composition
             assessment

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding. (All premenopausal females will be asked for a spot urine
             sample for pregnancy test prior to participation. Those unwilling to comply with this
             will not be included.
