    <textblock>
      This is a post-market, prospective, randomized, multi-center, bilateral, open-label,
      cross-over, comparative clinical study. Study group will undergo preoperative LipiFlow
      treatment and Control group will not receive preoperative LipiFlow treatment. Three months
      postoperatively, both groups will be evaluated for clinical outcomes and the Control group
      will receive LipiFlow treatment as the cross-over group. The Control group will be evaluated
      at 4 months postoperative for clinical outcomes.

        Inclusion Criteria (all criteria apply to each study eye):

          -  Minimum 22 years of age.

          -  Bilateral cataracts for which phacoemulsification extraction and implantation with
             Symfony IOLs have been planned.

          -  Evidence of Meibomian Gland Dysfunction (MGD) in both eyes based on assessment of
             meibomian glands of the lower eyelid

          -  None to moderate dry eye symptoms with questionnaire

          -  Clear intraocular media other than cataract in each eye.

          -  Availability, willingness, ability and sufficient cognitive awareness to comply with
             the study protocol including: randomization; examination procedures; completion of
             planned bilateral cataract surgeries; compliance with no use of other MGD or dry eye
             treatments.

          -  Ability to understand, read and write English to consent to study participation and
             complete study questionnaires.

          -  Willingness to sign informed consent and HIPAA authorization or equivalent
             documentation necessary to comply with applicable privacy laws pertaining to medical
             treatment in the governing country.

        Exclusion Criteria (all criteria apply to each study eye):

          -  Any medical finding that would predictably result in a postoperative best corrected
             distance visual acuity worse than 20/30 in either eye.

          -  Use of systemic or ocular medications that, in the opinion of the investigator, may
             affect vision or impact pupil dilation or iris structure.

          -  Irregular corneal astigmatism.

          -  Any clinically-significant corneal pathology / abnormality other than regular corneal
             astigmatism.

          -  Any clinically-significant pupil abnormalities.

          -  Subjects with conditions associated with increased risk of zonular rupture.

          -  Unwillingness or inability to stop wearing contact lens at least two weeks prior to

          -  Known ocular disease or pathology that, in the opinion of the investigator, may affect
             visual acuity or require surgical intervention during the study.

          -  Systemic disease condition that causes dry eye.

          -  Unwillingness or inability to abstain from the use of systemic medications known to

             medications for MGD or dry eye at least 1 month prior to baseline preoperative visit
             #1 measurements.

          -  Any of the following ocular (eye or eyelid) conditions in either eye within 3 months

               -  Ocular trauma.

               -  Ocular Herpes simplex or Herpes zoster (eye or eyelid) infection.

               -  History of recurrent ocular inflammation.

               -  Punctal plug insertion or punctal occlusion.

          -  Any of the following active ocular (eye or eyelid) conditions in either eye at the

               -  Ocular infection.

               -  Ocular inflammation.

               -  Moderate to severe (Grade 2-4) allergic, vernal or giant papillary conjunctivitis

               -  Severe (Grade 3 or 4) inflammation of the eyelid.

               -  Eyelid abnormalities that affect lid function.

               -  Ocular surface abnormality that may compromise corneal integrity.

          -  Concurrent participation or participation within 30 days prior to study visit in any
             other clinical trial.

          -  Planned monovision correction.

          -  Patient is pregnant, plans to become pregnant, is lactating or has another condition
