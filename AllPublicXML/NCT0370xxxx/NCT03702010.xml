  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traditionally, pain relief through spinal cord stimulation has been associated with the
      appearance of paresthesia in the affected area. Several parameters are set to maximize the
      overexposure zone, such as frequency,and pulse width. Although this technique has improved
      pain in many patients, paresthesia itself can be uncomfortable. Traditionally, the occurrence
      of paresthesias has been considered to be a predictor of success in pain elimination, while
      the non-occurrence of paresthesias would indicate failure. So far, few studies have reported
      pain relief below the threshold of onset of paresthesia. Some clinical trials for pathologies
      other than the one considered in this study have achieved relief below the threshold by
      reducing the amplitude of the stimulus. Recently, however, it has been observed in a pilot
      study that, by increasing the frequency of spinal cord stimulation to 1 kilohertz, it is
      possible to significantly improve pain relief compared to less frequent conventional
      stimulation based on the occurrence of paresthesias.

      A recent review by the Cochrane Library concluded that conventional spinal cord stimulation
      for pain relief of Failed Back Surgery Syndrome (or FBSS) requires further clinical studies
      and better designs to demonstrate its superiority over other therapeutic options. Therefore,
      although spinal cord stimulation is accepted by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and
      the European Medicines Agency (EMA), new techniques are being introduced that offer better
      results in terms of pain relief. Among these techniques, there is the high frequency mode,
      which allows avoiding the annoying sensation of paresthesia that substitutes pain with the
      conventional technique. In order to provide greater rigour and scientific quality, the
      present study is proposed, in which the conventional spinal cord stimulation (CME) technique
      (control branch or CME) is compared with paresthesias and a standard frequency (60 hertz)
      with a high frequency (1000 hertz) EVOLVE system (Evolve workflow - standardized guidance to
      simplify the trial and implant experience and optimize patient outcomes) (experimental branch
      or EME) by means of a design with a high degree of scientific evidence, randomising the
      global sample of patients to each of the two branches of stimulation in the study (blind to
      the patient) and crossing the branches after a period of washing

    <description>Visual analogue scale (VAS) at the end of each test phase(either with conventional spinal cord stimulation or with EVOLVE). VAS consists of a 10 centimeter (cm) line, whose ends are defined as the extreme limits of pain (left end corresponds with the absence of pain and the right end with the maximum amount of pain).
The patient is asked to point out in the line the place that better correspond to his/her pain.</description>
