  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative pain is a frequent complication associated with root canal treatment. The
      apical extrusion of irrigant and debris, including bacteria and necrotic tissue, may lead to
      postoperative pain, periapical inflammation, and flare-ups. The instrumentation technique and
      the file design may affect the amount of debris extrusion.

      The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of instrumentation techniques on the
      incidence and intensity of postoperative pain after single-visit root canal treatment.

      Sixty patients having root canal treatment indication and a single root canal were included
      in the study. The patients were randomly assigned into 2 groups according to root canal
      instrumentation technique used. In group 1; ProTaper Next (Dentsply Maillefer, Ballaigues,
      Switzerland) instruments with rotational motion, in group 2 TF Adaptive (SybronEndo, Orange,
      CA) instruments with adaptive motion were used for root canal treatments. Root canal
      treatment was carried out in a single visit and the severity of postoperative pain was
      assessed via a four-point pain intensity scale. All the participants were called through the
      phone at 12, 24 and 48h to obtain the pain scores. Data were analyzed using the Mann
      Whitney-U, Friedman and Wilcoxon tests.

    <description>Postoperative pain which occurs after root canal instrumentation and measured with a commonly used scale named 'four-point pain intensity scale' for pain intensity. Patients were instructed postoperatively to express their pain according to the staed scale ranging between no pain and severe pain.
The scale consists of 4 scores ranging between 1-4. The pain categories were as follows;
no pain;
mild pain (slight discomfort, no need for treatment);
moderate pain (pain relieved by medication);
severe pain (pain and/or swelling not relieved by simple analgesic medication and unscheduled visit required). For patients having no pain score 1, for patients having slight pain in case of no medication score 2 , and score 3 in case of any requirement of medication due to moderate pain, and score 4 for patients having severe pain with the requirement of an unscheduled visit were accepted.
The higher values represent more pain intensity.</description>
