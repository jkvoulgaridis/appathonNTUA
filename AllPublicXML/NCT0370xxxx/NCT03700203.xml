      Identification of Causes and Risk Factors for Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest through
      Development of Prediction Model and Novel Biomarkers

      Study Objectives:

        1. To identify causes and risk factors of OHCA incidence that are associated with chronic
           diseases and health behaviors

        2. To identify high risk population for OHCA incidence through development of a prediction
           model

        3. To develop novel biomarkers associated with OHCA incidence, survival, and disabilities

      Study design: Multicenter case-control study, 14 tertiary teaching hospital emergency
      departments in Korea

      Study period: September 2017 to August 2020 (36 months)

      Study population: Early cardiac arrest patients aged between 19 and 79 (600 cases) and their
      age-, gender-, and urban/rural area-matched community controls (2400 cases).

        -  Cases will be consecutive adult patients with EMS-treated OHCA and transport to the 14
           emergency departments of participating hospitals. A prospective OHCA patient cohort will
           be developed and all survived OHCA cases will be followed at 1-month and 6-month after
           ED discharge by telephone. During the study period, the investigators aim to recruit a
           total 600 cases (200 cases per year for 3 years).

        -  matched community-based controls (4:1 matching) will be selected from two health
           screening centers. Controls are those who visit the participating health screening
           centers for their annual routine physical examinations. During the study period, the
           investigators aim to recruit a total 2,400 controls (800 controls per year for 3 years).

      Data collection: Following data will be collected for both cases and controls.

        -  Clinical data: Basic demographic and clinical outcomes will be retrieved from medical
           records.

        -  Survey data: Comorbidity, family history of selected diseases, lifestyle behaviors
           (including smoking, alcohol, physical activity, sleeping, nutrition, marital status,
           occupation), and history of selected chronic diseases data will be collected.

        -  Blood samples: The investigators aim to develop both clinical and behavioral (including
           nutrition, alcohol, and smoking) biomarkers of OHCA. The investigators also plan to
           further develop OHCA biomarkers using proteomics, genomics, and metabolomics.

        -  Follow-ups: All survived OHCA cases will be followed-up at 1-month and 6-month after ED
           discharge and their survival, disability, and quality of life outcomes will be collected
           by telephone.
