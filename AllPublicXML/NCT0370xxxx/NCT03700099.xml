    <textblock>
      This is a prospective biomarker study of patients with metastatic castration-resistant
      prostate cancer (mCRPC) undergoing sequential treatment with docetaxel and enzalutamide. The
      participants will undergo serial pre- and post-therapy blood collection for biomarker
      analysis as part of the primary objective of the study. The primary goal of this study is to
      evaluate the association of the AR-V7 status and androgen receptor (AR) gene alterations with
      PSA response to docetaxel and enzalutamide.

      This study is a prospective biomarker study of patients with metastatic castration-resistant
      prostate cancer (mCRPC) undergoing sequential treatment with docetaxel followed by
      enzalutamide. In this study, all participants will receive standard of care treatment with
      docetaxel 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks up to 10 cycles and after progression, patients will receive
      enzalutamide 160 mg daily until limiting toxicity or disease progression. The participants
      will undergo serial pre- and post-therapy blood collection for biomarker analysis as part of
      the primary objective of the study.

          -  Any condition or reason that, in the opinion of the Investigator, interferes with the
             ability of the patient to participate in the trial, which places the patient at undue
