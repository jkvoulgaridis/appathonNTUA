  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn if conversion from immediate release tacrolimus to
      Envarsus improves cerebral blood flow, brain blood flow response to exercise, and cognition.

      Each patient will have two study assessments: one at baseline and another one at 12 weeks
      after the baseline assessment. Each assessment may be divided into 2 visits to accommodate
      the MRI and TCD (Transcranial Doppler ultrasound). Detailed medical history will be extracted
      from the patients' medical records, interviews and questionnaires. We will obtain brain MRI
      (without gadolinium contrast) in enrolled patients. Neuropsychological test (NP) tests will
      include a standard battery to detect subclinical changes in cognition which can be missed by
      screening tests like the mini mental state exam.
