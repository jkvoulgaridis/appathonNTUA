  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ischemic stroke is the main cause of disability in the world. More than 70% of stroke
      patients show various degrees of neural function impairment. Motor rehabilitation in acute
      phase is beneficial for improving patient's structure and function of corticospinal tract.
      However, it is difficult to obtain effective rehabilitation during the acute phase of stroke
      because of the insufficiency of professional rehabilitation therapists in stroke wards in
      China.The present study is to verify that nursing-directed rehabilitation can compensate for
      the shortage of professional rehabilitation therapists. Our previous study indicated that
      nursing-directed motor function rehabilitation provided more obvious effect on stroke
      patients with a weighted corticospinal tract lesion load (wCST-LL) smaller than 2ml. We
      assume that implementing rehabilitation nursing based on the wCST-LL can realize
      nursing-directed, wCST-LL-based precision motor rehabilitation during acute phase of ischemic
      stroke.The present study is to conduct randomized clinical trial to confirm the effect of
      nursing-directed precision rehabilitation for motor function in acute stroke patients grouped
      by wCST-LL, and to evaluate the effect of this precision rehabilitation by using functional
      scale, and to explore the histopathologic mechanism of the precision rehabilitation nursing
      by mean of neuroelectrophysiology and neuroimaging examination. This study might provide
      theoretical support for motor rehabilitation in patients during acute phase of stroke.
