  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a normal spine, the sagittal plane has four curvatures that balance each other. The
      cervical and lumbar spine is lordotic, the thoracic spine and sacral region are kyphotic. In
      the sagittal plane, there is an average of 40 kyphosis angles between the T1 vertebrae upper
      end plate and the T12 vertebra lower end plate. Thoracic kyphosis is defined as an increase
      in the normal thoracic curvature (above 40) of the spine. Postural kyphosis usually occurs
      when individuals with weak muscle strength exert excessive external loads on their vertebrae.
      In rapidly growing young people, the abnormal flexion of the spine prevents the development
      of internal organs and excess thoracic kyphosis causes changes in respiratory functions, as
      well as postural disorders negatively affect the standing balance. In addition, the posture
      and appearance of young people with postural kyphosis are affected, which can affect their
      physical and psychological health.The incidence of hyper-kyphosis abnormality was reported to
      be 15.3% in 11 year-old children, 38% in 20 to 50 years old adults and 35% in 20 to 64 years
      old adults. This abnormality is managed by various methods including manual therapy, postural
      retraining, taping, orthoses and corrective exercises.

      When a literature review was conducted, it was observed that no balance evaluation was
      performed in individuals between 18 and 25 years of age who had postural kyphosis. Therefore,
      the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of Schroth-based functional exercise and
      postural exercise on balance, respiratory functions and thoracic angle, who has with postural
      kyphosis and 18-25 years of age.

      Participants will be randomly allocate 40 participants with kyphosis to two groups; Group I
      (n=20), Group II (n=20). The Group I, will receive postural exercise for 60 min/day 2
      times/week for 8 weeks, while the Group II receive Schroth three-dimensional exercise therapy
      program for 60 min/day 2 times/week for 8 weeks. Assessment procedure will be held at the
      beginning and 9th week of study. All subjects will be assessed by each angle of thoracic
      kyphosis, forward head and forward shoulder angles were measured by using the lateral
      photographic method, trunk flexibility (lateral and hyperextension), balance (BİODEX balance
      system) , respiratory function test (measurement of pulmonary function and respiratory muscle
      strength) , Quality of life SRS-22 and Numeric Rating Scale for pain.

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Spinal alignment was evaluated using a Spinal Mouse (ValedoShape-Hocoma), a computer-assisted noninvasive device. The method has no medical risk or danger. The spinal processes of the vertebra from C7 to S3 were marked. The Spinal Mouse device was slid along the spine from top to bottom to complete the measurement. The evaluation was administered while the subjects were standing in upright position.</description>

    <measure>Balance Assessment (postural stability test)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 9 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>BIODEX balance systems use any of four test protocols including fall risk, athletic single leg stability, limits of stability and postural stability. With the Biodex Balance System, the balance of all participants will be evaluated by postural stability test. The Postural Stability test emphasizes a patient's ability to maintain a center of balance. The patient's score, or &quot;Stability Index&quot;, on this test assesses deviations from center, thus a lower score is more desirable than a higher score.</description>

    <measure>Numeric Rating Scale for Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 9 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) for pain is a unidimensional measure of pain intensity in adults. The NRS is a segmented numeric version of the visual analog scale (VAS) in which a respondent selects a whole number (0-10 integers) that best reflects the intensity of their pain. The common format is a horizontal bar or line. The pain NRS is a single 11‐point numeric scale, an 11‐point numeric scale (NRS 11) with 0 representing one pain extreme (&quot;no pain&quot;) and 10 representing the other pain extreme (&quot;pain as bad as you can imagine&quot; and &quot;worst pain imaginable&quot;).The NRS will be used for pain assessment of the thoracic region.</description>

    <description>The desktop spirometer (Cosmed-Pony FX®) is a hand-held instrument for assessment, will be used for pulmonary function test including forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and ratio of FEV1/FVC. Pulmonary function will test following the guidelines recommended by the American Thoracic Society (ATS).Participant, sitting in an upright position comfortably on a chair with nose clip attached and head slightly elevated. They will perform each test for three trials. The best value of each parameter will record. The values express as both an absolute value in liters and a percentage of the predicted normal value.</description>

    <description>The desktop spirometer (Cosmed-Pony FX®) is a hand-held instrument for assessment respiratory muscles strength both inspiratory and expiratory muscles. Inspiratory and expiratory muscles strength is expressed in term of Maximal Inspiratory Pressure (MIP) and Maximal Expiratory Pressure (MEP), respectively. MIP and MEP are readily and digitally monitored in units of cmH2O ( pressure range ± 200 cmH2O).</description>

    <description>The Group II Schroth method corrects the kyphotic posture, with the help of proprioceptive and exteroceptive stimulation and mirror control in the sagittal plane, using specific corrective breathing patterns. The Schroth method three-dimensional exercise therapy program adapted for the specific posture will be exercised in four specific positions (sitting, supine, standing, prone) under the supervision of a physiotherapist. Exercise include, trunk elongation, symmetrical sagittal straightening, shoulder traction, corrective breathing and muscle activation by increasing tension (isometric tension). The Group II will receive Schroth's three-dimensional exercise therapy program for 60 min/day 2 times/week for 8 weeks.</description>
