  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study employs tau positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in a well-characterized
      multi-racial/ethnic cohort to examine the extent to which tau pathology is associated with
      cognition, differences in tau pathology across racial/ethnic groups, and the relationship
      between MRI markers of small-vessel cerebrovascular disease and tau pathology. The study also
      investigates amyloid-dependent tau spreading.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Deposition of hyperphosphorylated tau protein is observed in several neurodegenerative
      diseases including Alzheimer's Disease (AD), progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal
      degeneration, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, and frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Tau is
      a microtubular protein and its native function is to provide structural support to neurons.
      Paired helical filaments composed of dysfunctional tau protein are found in several
      neurodegenerative diseases. In AD, the clinical progression of dementia has been shown to
      correlate with the amount and topographical spread of tau throughout the brain. Therefore,
      detecting and quantifying tau aggregate load in brain would have diagnostic and prognostic
      potential in clinical management of several neurological diseases. As disease modifying drugs
      that target tau are being developed, there is a critical need for a reliable method of
      detecting tau aggregates to confirm pathology in patients entering clinical trials.
