      This prospective, randomized, active-controlled, parallel arm study compares the safety and
      financial benefits of arterial thromboembolism prophylaxis with Warfarin vs. Rivaroxaban (A
      novel oral anticoagulant) in patients with new onset atrial fibrillation after sternotomy for
      cardiac operations.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      New onset atrial fibrillation (NOAF) is a common occurrence following cardiac surgery,
      occurring in 20-30% of patients post-operatively. Historically, Vitamin K antagonist therapy
      with Warfarin has been the treatment of choice for prophylaxis against stroke and systemic
      arterial thromboembolism in NOAF. Warfarin inhibits the Vitamin K dependent factors involved
      in both the intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation cascades, thus decreasing systemic clotting.
      However, Warfarin therapy comes with many challenges including prolonged titration, tedious
      monitoring requirements and in some cases, increased bleeding risk.

      The limitations associated with Warfarin may be mitigated by using new oral anticoagulants
      (NOACs) like Rivaroxaban which have no routine monitoring requirements. Rivaroxaban is a
      direct inhibitor of Factor Xa, a central reactant in both the intrinsic and extrinsic
      coagulation cascades. Studies in non-operative patients with atrial fibrillation have shown
      that Rivaroxaban is non-inferior to Warfarin for stroke prophylaxis with similar risk
      profiles. This study aims to compare the efficacy, safety and financial cost of these two
      drugs when used for the management of new onset atrial fibrillation that occurs after cardiac
      operations.

    <description>Participants will be administered the EUROQOL-5D-3L (5 dimensions, 3 levels) questionnaire to derive an estimate of the health state. This is comprised of a 5 questions survey and a single visual analog scale highlighting perceived health levels
For the 5 questions survey, each question related to mobility, selfcare, mood, pain and/or functionality is answered on a three point scale with higher number representing worse outcomes. The entire dataset is used to generate a health state based on the unique pattern of answers. These health states are then compared against standardized country-based value sets which provide an assessment of quality of life based on societal preferences.
The visual analog scale is single answer between 0 and 100 representing the patient's perception of their health state. 0 represents the worst health imaginable and 100 represents the best.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 30 days after discharge from the initial postoperative hospitalization</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be administered the PACT-Q2 questionnaire which is comprised of a convenience subscale and a satisfaction subscale.
For the convenience subscale, each of 13 questions is answered on a 1-5 rating scale with higher numbers representing worse outcomes. A sub-scale score is generated by inverting the score from each element and calculating the sum. Range on the inverted scale is 13 - 65. Higher scores represent better outcomes.
For the satisfaction subscale, each of 7 questions is answered on a 1-5 rating scale with higher numbers representing better outcomes. The total score on this subscale is generated by adding up scores from all elements. Range on this subscale is 7-35. Higher scores represent better outcomes.
A composite score is generated by adding up scores from both subscales and recalibrating on a 0-100 scale by adding the scores together and applying the formula: COMPOSITE SCORE=100×(Sum−20)/80. Higher scores represent more favorable outcomes.</description>
