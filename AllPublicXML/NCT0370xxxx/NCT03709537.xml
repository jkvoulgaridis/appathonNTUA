  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Emotional Health Association will engage Los Angeles County Department of Mental Health
      providers that employ peer workers in a training and technical assistance intervention
      designed to support, increase, and retain an effective peer workforce. This intervention
      consists of a Co-Learning Collaborative, several training sessions, and the creation of
      Implementation Teams. Peer workers will also be encouraged to attend Recovery International,
      an established network of self-help support groups for mental health. Dr. Louis Brown will
      lead an evaluation of the efficacy of the intervention. This study will inform the use of
      peer workers as a component of the mental health workforce.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Evaluation of the the intervention with the peer workforce will be conducted through
      administration of web-based surveys of peer workers and peer supervisors at baseline and
      follow-up (10 months post-baseline). These two surveys will be administered to peer workers
      and peer supervisors at sites enrolled in the study. A letter of informational detailing the
      risks of participation will accompany the survey. Individuals who do not complete the
      web-based survey will be invited to complete a telephone interview with the same questions.
      Sites (where one or more peer supervisors and peer workers are located) will be randomized to
      either the intervention group or standard practice control group. The intervention group will
      engage in Co-Learning Collaborative, several training sessions, and the creation of
      Implementation Teams. Peer workers from the intervention group will also be encouraged to
      attend Recovery International, an established network of self-help support groups for mental
      health. Analysis of the surveys collected from both study groups will be conducted to assess
      the efficacy of the intervention and provide Emotional Health Association with a final
      report.

    <description>Supervisors and peer workers will participate in trainings covering effective peer services, trauma-informed effective peer supervision, and responsibilities of peer workers in a supervising relationship. A monthly Supervisors of Peer Workers meeting will support site change efforts. Sites will create an implementation team to work within their site to implement the training received.
Peer Workers will enroll in a peer mentoring program, where they serve as peer mentors matched with fellow peer mentors. Recovery International and the Los Angeles Department of Mental Health will encourage peer workers to attend Recovery International meetings. Emotional Health Association will refer Peer Workers and their Supervisors in the intervention group to self-help support groups that reduce stress and increase resiliency.</description>
