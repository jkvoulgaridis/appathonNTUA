  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Helping babies breathe (HBB) is a neonatal resuscitation training program for low-resource
      settings to health care workers to provide prompt respiratory support to save babies at
      birth. Despite massive roll-out, new-born mortality reduction has stagnated over the years.
      Innovative teaching methods with existing technology such as video-debriefing needs to be
      tested to promote competence (skills and knowledge) attainment and retention.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study we will randomize both public and private delivery facilities in Lira district
      northern Uganda to receive either standard HBB with video-debriefing (intervention) or
      standard training alone (control). We hope video-debriefing will improve competence among the
      health workers and promote skills and knowledge retention over time, hence reduction in
      neonatal mortality.

      The result of the study may also contribute to shaping refresher training program policy in
      low-resource settings.

    <intervention_model_description>The AAP HBB curriculum will be used to train participants. Lectures will be delivered by the PI (Master Trainers), followed by demonstration of HBB skills using NeoNatali Mannequin. The participants will then be divided into two groups. One group for practical sessions with master trainers and the other group video-debriefing. The video-debriefing group will have their practical sessions filmed and then the film used for debriefing feedback. First the experiences of the team performing resuscitation will be obtained then positive feedback and learning points from other learners will be given in a respectful safe environment. All participants will be encouraged to contribute in the discussion. Pre- and Post-Test knowledge and skills will be assessed will be done using MCQs, and bag mask ventilation, OSCE A and B checklists from 2nd edition AAP HBB training manual.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Cluster randomization was done by an independent statistician from the University of Bergen who is not part of the study. The health workers from randomised facilities were randomly assigned to two groups of 24 participants, each to be trained for two days. The participants and the assessors did not know the intervention groups which they belonged to until the day of training. During follow-up the assessors and the PI will not know which intervention arms the participants are in.</masking_description>

    <description>Health workers are given standard HBB training according to American Association of Pediatrics (AAP) plus video-debriefing. Filming of the simulated case scenarios will be done and after which the films will be used for debriefing or feedback. Participants will be encouraged to give feedback with the guidance of master trainer and the PI. Teams of three participants(birth attendant, mother and helper) will perform the HBB simulation or scenarios. After each scenario, debriefing is done until all participants have had the opportunity to participate in the simulation exercise. All the participants in this arm will undergo HBB practical sessions such as bag mask ventilation skills sessions, care of the health new-born and sick newborn baby who needs resuscitation care. Pre and post-tests will be done to assess performance of all participants.</description>

    <description>Health workers are given standard HBB training according to AAP without video-debriefing. All the participants in this arm, like in intervention arm, will also undergo HBB practical sessions such as bag mask ventilation skills sessions, care of the health new-born and sick new-born baby who needs resuscitation care only. Pre-and post-tests will be done to assess performance of all participants.</description>

    <description>We will use the AAP training curriculum for the HBB 2nd edition through out the training and course assessments pre-and post- training and during follow-up period.
Both intervention arms will a 2 days training consisting of: lectures, neonatal resuscitation demonstrations using NeoNatali mannequin, and practical skills s sessions. Pre- and post-tests knowledge (MCQs) and skills (bag mask ventilation, OSCE A, &amp; OSCE B) will be given to all participants.
In the intervention arm, in addition to standard training, participants will work in teams of three (birth attendant, mother, and an assistant) to perform different HBB case scenarios. These will be filmed and used for subsequent debriefing after each case scenarios. After all participants in the intervention have had the opportunity to participate in the debriefing, then a post test is done to assess performance.
Analysis is done to compare the intervention and control arms performances.</description>
