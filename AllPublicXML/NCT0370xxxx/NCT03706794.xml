  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Little is known about who adheres to migraine management strategies, and circumstances that
      enhance adherence. This knowledge is required to develop patient-level interventions to
      improve adherence to migraine management strategies. The proposed project will pilot the
      first patient level intervention designed to improve adherence to preventive and acute
      migraine management strategies. The study will identify people most at risk for non-adherence
      to migraine management strategies. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive a
      tailored clinical decision support tool or education intervention.

      Participants with a diagnosis with migraine who currently meet criteria for episodic migraine
      (migraine with headaches that occur on fewer than 15 days per month) will be recruited from
      local providers. After an initial screening, eligible participants will complete 30 days of
      monitoring 3 times daily on an electronic headache diary (a smartphone app) to confirm study
      eligibility. Participants whose eligibility is confirmed will complete an additional 2 months
      (60 days) of monitoring headache activity and adherence to acute and preventive (medication
      and behavioral) strategies recommended for people with migraine. Participants who show
      suboptimal adherence during the first 3 months of monitoring (&lt;50% of eligible days) will be
      eligible to continue to the intervention component of the study. Participants who choose to
      continue in the study will be randomized to receive a tailored clinical decision support tool
      or education intervention, both delivered through the smartphone app. Participants will
      continue to self-monitor, with the intervention components active, for 3 months.

    <measure>Adherence to Acute Migraine Management Strategies: Treat Early</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 6 of the Treatment</time_frame>
    <description>When participants record headache activity they are asked about the type of headache and the level of pain they were experiencing when they took their Migraine Specific Medication (MSM). A headache episode is coded as &quot;Treat Early&quot; if a participant took their MSM when the pain is mild (as opposed to moderate or severe). Number of Treat Early is reported.</description>

    <description>Number of days per month that Migraine Specific Medication is used is taken directly from diary recordings. Overuse is considered taking MSM more than 10 times in a month. Total overuse is reported.</description>
