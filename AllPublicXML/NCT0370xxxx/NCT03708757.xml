  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral Palsy is a disorder of movement and posture due to deficit or lesion of immature
      brain. Out of all types of cerebral palsy 77.4% is spastic cerebral palsy. Spasticity is
      resistance to externally imposed movement increases with increasing speed of stretch and
      varies with the direction of joint movement. In this research the aim of our study is to
      measure the effects of post isometric relaxation and eccentric muscle energy technique of
      spasticity of hamstring muscle in cerebral palsy children in randomized controlled study.
      Study duration is of six months. Sampling will be lottery method. Inclusion criteria will
      include individuals having age between five to fifteen with diplegic cerebal palsy, well
      oriented and spastic hamstrings with Ashworth score +2 or +3.Exclusion criteria includes
      children with flaccid and mixed cerebral palsy, quadriplegic and hemiplegic cerebral palsy
      and mentally retarded. Data will be collected on structured questionnaire. those individuals
      who fulfill inclusion criteria will be divided into two groups .both groups will be treated
      with hot packs for ten minutes and static stretching. Group 1 will be given post isometric
      relaxation technique and group 2 will be given eccentric muscle energy technique. Post
      interventional analysis will be done at sixth week. Data will be analysed with SPSS 21.

      The primary purpose of this study is to investigate effects of eccentric isotonic contraction
      on on hamstring flexibility of cerebral palsy children,and to investigate effects of post
      isometric relaxation on on hamstring flexibility of cerebral palsy children.It is a
      randomized control trial. this study will be conducted in PAF School for PSN Norkhan base
      Rawalpindi. Data collection time is from Oct 2018- March 2019. Sample size is 30 CP child,15
      in each group calculated by Open Epi Tool.

      Ap per Inclusion criteria only those participants will be included with age bracket 5-15
      years,spastic diplegic , well oriented and on modified Ashworth scale their score is +2 or
      +3. Children with flaccid and mixed cerebral palsy,Quadriplegic and hemiplegic cerebral palsy
      or Mentally retarded will not be part of study. Those patients who fulfill inclusion criteria
      are divided in to two groups. Intervention will be provided and Assessments should be done on
      1st on baseline and then after 6 weeks.Data Collection Tools will be Gross Motor Functional
      scale,Goniometry for measuring joint ranges and Motor Assessment Scale for measuring their
      functional status.

The Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) for cerebral palsy is based on self-initiated movement, with emphasis on sitting, transfers, and mobility. It gives information about levels of limitations.
