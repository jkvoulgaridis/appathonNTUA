  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human, open-label, multicenter, Phase I multiple-ascending dose (MAD)
      study of single agent RO7121661, an anti PD-1 (programmed death-1) and TIM-3 (T-cell
      immunoglobulin and mucin domain 3) bispecific antibody, for participants with advanced and/or
      metastatic solid tumors. The study consists of 2 parts: Dose Escalation (Part A) and
      Expansion (Parts B1, B2, B3, B4, and B5). The Dose Escalation part will be conducted first to
      determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended dose for expansion (RDE) based
      on safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic, and/or the pharmacodynamic profile of escalating
      doses of RO7121661. The Expansion part will enroll tumor-specific cohorts to evaluate
      anti-tumor activity of the MTD and/or RDE of RO7121661 from Part A (Q2W) and to confirm
      safety and tolerability in participants with selected tumor types.

      Recruitment into the Expansion Part B4: SCLC Cohort is now closed.
