  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the Twine / University of Michigan Diabetes Quality Improvement Initiative is to
      improve diabetes care quality using real time feedback with continuous glucose monitoring
      (CGM) and dietary coaching for lower carbohydrate consumption in a high-risk sub-cohort of
      outpatients with type 2 diabetes (T2D).
