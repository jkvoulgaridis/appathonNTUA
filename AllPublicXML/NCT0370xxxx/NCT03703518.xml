  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study design is a cross-over pilot study with 15 asymptomatic subjects. There will be 2
      groups, mixed reality group and conventional cervical exercise program. Both groups received
      2 sessions per week with an interval of 48 hours between them during 3 consecutive weeks.

      The study design is a cross-over pilot study. The study was approved by the ethical committee
      of the Centro Superior de Estudios Universitarios La Salle. People were recruited by referral
      from different places of the local community of Madrid according to the CONSORT statement
      (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials). Three assessors were trained during 300 minutes
      about how to perform the measurements (Investigator A) and the concerned intervention to each
      group (Investigator B and C). The whole procedure was conducted in the Centro Superior de
      Estudios Universitarios La Salle. After meeting the eligibility criteria for the study,
      participants were randomly allocated by an external investigator to one of the two groups:

        -  Mixed reality group

        -  Conventional Exercise group

    <measure>Resistance test of the neck flexor muscles</measure>
    <time_frame>change measures (Baseline, 3 weeks, 7 weeks, 10 weeks and 14 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>To perform this test that will give us the resistance in seconds, the therapist lifts the patient's head and neck until the occipital bone is approximately 2.5 cm from the table, keeping the chin tucked into the chest.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cervical Joint Position Error Test</measure>
    <time_frame>change measures (Baseline, 3 weeks, 7 weeks, 10 weeks and 14 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The aim of this test is to assess the subject's ability to return to the starting position after a cervical rotation movement has been performed. The patient will remain seated in a chair with a backrest. You will be given a headband with a laser pointer. At 90 cm, a stitch (a kind of target) will be placed. With the eyes closed, the participant will be asked to perform a cervical rotation and return to the starting position, as precisely as possible and without any feedback.</description>

    <measure>Evaluation of User Satisfaction with Auxiliary Device Technology (QUEST 2.0)</measure>
    <time_frame>change measures (Baseline, 3 weeks, 7 weeks, 10 weeks and 14 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>This consists of 12 questions, each one of which the participant should circle with a circle the number that best describes his or her degree of satisfaction from 1 to 5 (1 being unsatisfied and 5 very satisfied)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>System Usability Scale (SUS):</measure>
    <time_frame>change measures (Baseline, 3 weeks, 7 weeks, 10 weeks and 14 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>It consists of 10 questions and the participant should dial the number that best describes their degree of satisfaction from 1 to 5 (1 being unsatisfied and 5 very satisfied)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Suitability Evaluation Questionnaire (SEQ):</measure>
    <time_frame>change measures (Baseline, 3 weeks, 7 weeks, 10 weeks and 14 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Made up of 14 questions, one of which is an open-ended question. For the remaining questions, the participant must select the number that best fits his or her answer, from 1 to 5, range 13 to 65 points. Higher values represent more dificulty using the device. This questionnaire assesses the subject's satisfaction and also the difficulty of its use.</description>

    <measure>Q-Sense (Thermotest)</measure>
    <time_frame>change measures (Baseline, 3 weeks, 7 weeks, 10 weeks and 14 weeks)</time_frame>
