    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-site, group sequential, adaptive, randomized, double-masked, 2Ã—2
      crossover design, 1-week dispensing study. Subjects will wear bilaterally both Test and
      Control lenses in a random order for 1-week each as a daily disposable modality with a
      wash-out period of 1 week between the wearing periods.

    <measure>CLUE Comfort</measure>
    <time_frame>at 1-week follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective assessment of comfort will be performed using the Contact Lens User ExperienceTM (CLUE) questionnaire. CLUE is a validated patient reported outcomes (PRO) questionnaire used to assess patient experience attributes of soft contact lenses (comfort, vision, handling, and packaging) in a US contact-lens wearing population between 18 and 65 years of age. CLUE composite scores are derived using Item Response Theory (IRT) and follow a normal distribution with a population average score of 60 (Standard Deviation (SD) 20), where higher scores indicate a more favorable/positive response. A 5-point increase in an average CLUE score translates into 10% shift in the distribution of scores for the population of soft disposable contact lens wearers.</description>

    <description>Subjective assessment of vision will be performed using the Contact Lens User ExperienceTM (CLUE) questionnaire.

    <measure>Average daily wear time (in hours)</measure>
    <time_frame>at 1-week follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Average daily wear time will be calculated as the number of hours between subjects reported time of insertion and time of removal of the study lenses, on an average day.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Performance</measure>
    <time_frame>at 1-week follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Visual performance will be calculated as monocular contact lens-corrected distance visual acuity using a logMAR (Logarithm of Minimal Angle of Resolution) visual acuity scale. This will be evaluated under high luminance and low contrast conditions and low luminance and high contrast conditions at 4 meters from Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) charts.</description>

             study:

               1. The subject must read, understand, and sign the STATEMENT OF INFORMED CONSENT and
                  receive a fully executed copy of the form.

               2. Appear able and willing to adhere to the instructions set forth in this clinical
                  protocol.

               3. Must be at least 18 and not more than 70 years of age (including 70) at the time
                  of screening.

               4. The subject must be a habitual and adapted wearer of hydrogel daily disposable
                  brand contact lens in both eyes (at least 1 month of daily wear).

               5. The subject must have normal eyes (i.e., no ocular medications or infections of
                  any type).

               6. The subject's required spherical contact lens prescription must be in the range
                  of -1.00 to -4.50 D in each eye.

               7. The subject's refractive cylinder must be &lt; 0.75 D in each eye.

               8. The subject must have best corrected visual acuity of 20/25 or better in each
                  eye.
