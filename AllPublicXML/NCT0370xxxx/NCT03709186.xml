      The study aims to evaluate radiomic markers in breast tumors to evaluate metastatic risk
      based on radiomic features following primary therapy. The investigators aim to analyze images
      at various time intervals before, during and after primary treatments using two advanced
      imaging techniques (DCE-MRI &amp; DWI-MRI).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects must give appropriate written informed consent prior to participation in the
             study;

          2. Subjects must be able and willing to comply with the safety procedures during the
             scanning period;

          3. Subjects must be men and women age 18+

          4. Biopsy-confirmed diagnosis of invasive breast cancer; (ER+/-, PR+/-, HER2+/-).

          5. Stage I-III disease according to the AJCC v7 criteria.

          6. Patients with sufficient renal function (creatinine clearance, i.e., &gt;=30 mL/min/1.73
             m2).

          7. Primary treatments can include neoadjuvant chemotherapy or surgery

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Subjects with a past medical history of abnormalities, significant injury, or
             medical or surgical procedures (e.g. Silicone/saline implants) involving either
             breast, exclusive of the lesion at issue.

             2. Subjects with any dermatologic abnormalities (including tattoos, open sores, or
             breached skin) involving either breast 3. Subjects with a current or past medical
             history of connective tissue disease 4. Subjects who are pregnant or lactating 5.
             Subjects with an implanted electronic device such as a cardiac pacemaker,
             defibrillator, or neurological stimulator 6. Subjects, who, in the opinion of the
             investigator or clinical research coordinator, may not otherwise be appropriate for
             inclusion into the study, such as significant anxiety, history of musculoskeletal
             disease which may predispose them to discomfort during the imaging/scanning period.

             7. Allergies to any contrast agent administered to this study.
