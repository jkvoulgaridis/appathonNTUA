  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with uncontrolled vascular disease are at risk for an insidious progression of
      brain injury starting in early to midlife and ultimately culminating in a vascular dementia,
      robbing them of activities of daily living independence. Successful containment of this
      progression requires rigorous vascular risk factor management - the control of blood
      pressure, blood sugars, weight, and alcohol consumption; the cessation of smoking, and an
      increase in aerobic activity. SymTrend's mobile and web system for managing vascular risk
      factors will help improve adherence to health and lifestyle strategies, will stem cognitive
      decline, and will preserve independence in the community for older adults.

      Neurologists from Massachusetts General Hospital will refer 10 adults with vascular mild
      cognitive impairment for participation in this project. The patients will be given Bluetooth
      devices appropriate for their condition and will be trained to use SymTrend and Apple Health
      software. They will use the software and devices for three months; will receive messages
      throughout from the system and/or a research coordinator about their progress, with
      encouragement and strategies to fully manage their symptoms; and their neurologist will be in
      communication with them about the progress charts and will adjust their care on the basis of
      this real-time data.
