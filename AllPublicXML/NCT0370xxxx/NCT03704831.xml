  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this retrospective study is to compare the analgesic efficiency of IPACK block
      (Interspace between the Popliteal Artery and the Capsule of the posterior Knee) with surgical
      infiltration after total knee arthroplasty. The main objective is to compare cumulative
      morphine consumption the first 24 hours after surgery. The secondary objectives are to
      compare pain scores, types and amounts of other analgesics needed during the first 24 hours
      after surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After patient agreement, data will be collected on patient records and will be compared into
      2 groups.

      Data will be :

        -  cumulative consumption of morphine during the first 24 hours after surgery

        -  pain scores during the first 24 hours after surgery

        -  amount of analgesics during the first 24 hours after surgery

        -  maximal pain score during the first 24 hours after surgery
