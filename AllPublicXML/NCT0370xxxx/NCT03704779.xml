  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to develop and assess a multimodal mindfulness activity
      program for physical and occupational therapy students intended to teach management of
      stressors impacting educational performance. This study will use a two group, randomized
      controlled design in which approximately 25 students will be randomized to an intervention
      group and 25 to a control group. Intervention will be implemented in an 8-week period with
      pre- and post-study measures administered at 1-week prior to and 1-week following
      intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      College students have reported increasing stress levels in the last 5 years with 1 in 6
      students experiencing anxiety levels that adversely impact school function. This study's
      intervention uses a variety of media and both online and in-person delivery strategies. For
      example, students will have the opportunity to participate in yoga, Tai Chi, guided imagery
      meditation, creative arts, journaling, and pet therapy. Students will additionally have the
      opportunity to participate in activities delivered through online media and accessible at all
      times throughout the study. Approximately 50 occupational and physical therapy students will
      be recruited to participate in this study. Half will be selected by chance to participate in
      the 8-week program; the remaining half will be selected by chance to participate in a
      non-intervention group in which they do not receive the program but are still assessed at
      pre- and post-program to measure perceived stress levels. It is anticipated that study
      results will provide information to educational institutions to help students better manage
      stress levels.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived Stress Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) is a 10-item, 5-point, self-report Likert scale (0 = no stress, 5 = high stress) that requires 5 minutes to complete. The scale yields a total score ranging from 0 (no stress) to 50 (highest stress) with scores 25+ indicating a possible stress disorder. The PSS measures stress level in the last month and was intended for use by community-dwelling adults.</description>

    <measure>Student Stress Management Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Student Stress Management Questionnaire (SSMQ) is a 12-item, 5-point Likert scale (0 = no stress, 5 = high stress) that requires 5 minutes to complete. The scale yields a total score ranging from 0 (no stress) to 60 (highest stress) with scores 40+ indicating a possible stress disorder. The SSMQ measures stress level in the last month and was intended for use by college students.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Daily Log</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The daily log is a 6-item questionnaire that allows students to record the number and length of mindfulness activities in which they participated that day. Students also report their level of stress before and after participation using a 5-point Likert scale (0 = no stress, 5 = high stress). Scores of 15+ indicate higher stress levels.</description>
