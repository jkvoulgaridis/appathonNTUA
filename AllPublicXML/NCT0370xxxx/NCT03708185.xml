  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study will seek to quantify whether a period of HIIT alongside β-alanine
      supplementation will improve the adaptation to training, and therefore performance, more than
      a period of HIIT alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Whilst high-intensity interval training (HIIT) is a powerful stimulus to increase endurance
      exercise performance, there are potential nutritional interventions that can be put in place
      to further increase performance gains.

      Energy for the contraction of muscles is created in the mitochondria. HIIT can improve the
      function of mitochondria, therefore improving performance.

      Β-alanine is a commonly used supplement that can improve exercise performance by increasing
      the amount of carnosine in muscle. Carnosine has many functions that may help improve
      exercise capacity.

      The present study will seek to quantify whether a period of HIIT alongside β-alanine
      supplementation will improve the adaptation to training, and therefore performance, more than
      a period of HIIT alone.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline work done on a cycle ergometer in a cycling capacity test at 110%VO2max following a period of 4 weeks of beta-alanine supplementation and then 8 weeks of beta-alanine supplementation and high intensity interval training</measure>
    <time_frame>At weeks 0, 4 and 12 of study.</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will have previously performed an incremental test to exhaustion (VO2max test). A work-load that corresponds to 110 % of the peak power output (Wmax) will be calculated, and participants will be asked to cycle at this power output until volitional exhaustion. This test will be preceded but a bout of 90-minute cycling at 65%VO2max. Tests will be performed on a Lode Excalibur Sport, and software linked to the bike will record data.</description>

    <time_frame>At weeks 0, 4, 8 and 12 of study.</time_frame>
    <description>VO2max will be determined from data collected through a metabolic cart. It will be measured during an incremental test to exhaustion performed on a cycle ergometer.</description>

    <measure>Substrate utilisation</measure>
    <time_frame>At weeks 0, 4 and 12 of study.</time_frame>
    <description>Substrate utilisation will be calculated from data collected through a metabolic cart and its software. It will be measured during the 90-minute steady-state cycle for 4 periods of 3 minutes. Carbohydrate and lipid oxidation rates will be calculated using equations by Jeukendrup &amp; Wallis (2005).</description>
