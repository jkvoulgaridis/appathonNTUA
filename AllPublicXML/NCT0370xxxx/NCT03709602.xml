    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to find out which factors influence parents' ability to
      complete the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine series for their child. The information
      learned from this study may help the investigators develop programs to improve HPV vaccine
      completion rates among adolescents and reduce barriers to receiving the second shot of the
      vaccine series.
