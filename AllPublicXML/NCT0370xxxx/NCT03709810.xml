      The purpose of this study is to determine the ability of a marketed denture adhesive to
      restrict food ingress underneath dentures during eating.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, controlled, single-blind, randomized, two-treatment, two-period,
      cross-over design in participants with full upper and lower dentures. The study hypothesis is
      that this methodology will enable comparisons between denture adhesives and no adhesive to
      demonstrate the effectiveness of denture adhesives in restricting food ingress under dentures
      during eating. This study will consist of three visits: Visit 1 - Screening Visit; Visit 2 -
      Treatment 1 Visit; Visit 3 - Treatment 2 Visit. Participants will use test product which is a
      marketed denture adhesive (Super Poligrip Max Seal [SPMS]) (application will be controlled by
      weight) to the dentures in a pattern of continuous strips which will be applied to upper and
      lower denture and will be then placed in mouth and participants will also use no adhesive as
      a control. Participants will cross-over between treatments so that all participants will
      participate in all 2 treatment arms. An hour after the participant has worn their denture,
      they will chew a portion of peanuts in a controlled manner. After a rinsing procedure with
      water, the dentures will be removed, and any peanuts that have been migrated under each
      denture will be collected and weighed after a drying process. Participants will also answer a
      short questionnaire on the procedure and record the number of times their denture dislodged
      during the chewing procedure. The number of denture dislodgments reported by the participants
      during the chewing of the peanuts will also be collected and analyzed and this, and the
      questionnaire data, will be used to support the findings of the peanuts mass measure.

    <time_frame>Upto 16 days</time_frame>
    <description>On each test day (Visit 2,3) participants had an OST exam and their dentures were cleaned before study product was applied to the dentures. 1g (+/-) was applied to the upper denture and 0.6g (+/-) was applied to the lower dentures by dispensing staff. After insertion of the dentures into participants mouths, they were required to wait 60 mins (+/- 5mins) after which they were required to chew 30-32g of non-salted peanuts, divided into smaller portions of approximately 8 nut halves. Participants were required to chew each portion of peanuts for approximately 20 secs. Whilst consuming the peanuts, participants were required to tick a box every time they felt their denture dislodge. The total number of dislodgments were recorded by study site staff.</description>

        <description>On each test day(Visit2,3)participants underwent an Oral Soft Tissue (OST) exam,dentures cleaned using denture cleanser.Product application controlled by weight:1g(+/-0.1g)to upper denture ,0.6g (+/-0.1g)to lower denture by dispensing staff. After60+/-5minutes(min) of replacing denture in the mouth,participants consumed 30-32g of non-salted peanuts, divided into smaller portions of approximately(app) 8nut halves. Each portion was chewed for app20 seconds(sec). After which mouth rinsed with water for app10sec. Both upper and lower dentures were removed,any nuts remaining in mouth were collected using gauze.Dentures and gauzes placed in beaker with warm de-ionized water and sonicated for 30min,water was strained by sieve.Collected nuts washed,air-dried and transferred to pre-weighed aluminium weighing pans,dried at 40-degree Celsius (deg C)for 5 hours(h).

        <title>Number of Denture Dislodgements During Chewing as Reported by Participants</title>
        <description>On each test day (Visit 2,3) participants had an OST exam and their dentures were cleaned before study product was applied to the dentures. 1g (+/-) was applied to the upper denture and 0.6g (+/-) was applied to the lower dentures by dispensing staff. After insertion of the dentures into participants mouths, they were required to wait 60 mins (+/- 5mins) after which they were required to chew 30-32g of non-salted peanuts, divided into smaller portions of approximately 8 nut halves. Participants were required to chew each portion of peanuts for approximately 20 secs. Whilst consuming the peanuts, participants were required to tick a box every time they felt their denture dislodge. The total number of dislodgments were recorded by study site staff.</description>
        <time_frame>Upto 16 days</time_frame>
        <population>Efficacy analysis was performed on mITT population [N=48] included all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of the study product and had at least 1 on-therapy assessment of efficacy.</population>

        <description>On each test day(Visit 2,3)participants underwent an OST exam,dentures cleaned using denture cleanser. Product application controlled by weight:1g(+/-0.1g)to upper denture,0.6g (+/-0.1g)to lower denture by dispensing staff. After 60+/-5min of replacing denture in the mouth, participants consumed 30-32g of non-salted peanuts, divided into smaller portions of app8nut halves. Each portion chewed for app20 sec. After eating all,participants answered a questionnaire for chewing experience by questions (Q):Q1,were you aware of nuts pieces under your denture:yes/no.Participants answered no to Q1 were not required to answerQ2,3;they were automatically assigned 0 score for Q2,3. Participants who answered yes to Q1 were asked Q2,3;Q2,rate amount of nuts pieces under your denture on0-10scale;Q3,how bothered were you by nuts pieces went under your denture on0-10scale.Q2score:0=none,10=lots of nuts pieces;Q3score:0=not at all bothered,10=extremely bothered.
