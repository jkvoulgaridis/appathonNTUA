      The study aims to investigate the role of candidate biomarkers in the prognosis of Essential
      Hypertension. In the prognosis part of the study, patients with confirmed hypertension are
      enrolled. The outcome is unstable angina, coronary revascularization, acute myocardial
      infarction, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, ischemic cerebral infarction, hemorrhagic
      cerebral infarction, transient ischemic attack, doubling of serum creatinine or end-stage
      renal disease (defi ned as eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1·73 m² or need for chronic dialysis) and
      all-cause mortality.
