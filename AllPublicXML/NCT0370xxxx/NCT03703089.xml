  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Using gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel, the investigators hope to establish the differential
      ability of local and cytologically positive disease to respond to this regimen, and in
      particular, the frequency of cytologic conversion from positive to negative in such patients.
      The investigators also can begin to assess the value of maximum local therapy, including
      surgery, in patients who cytologically convert from positive to negative.

      This research study is a Phase Ib clinical trial. It will assess the frequency of cytological
      conversion in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma and positive peritoneal cytology as a
      sole metastatic site following gemcitabine nab-paclitaxel.

      Subjects must have a newly diagnosed stage 4 untreated metastatic pancreatic ductal cancer
      with positive peritoneal cytology as a sole metastatic site and meet all inclusion/exclusion
      criteria.

      Treatment consists of 4 week treatment cycles. Nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine will be
      administered on days 1,8, and 15.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male, or a non-pregnant and non-lactating female.

          2. Age ≥ 18 years.

          3. Histologically proven diagnosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).

          4. Radiographic and pathologic staging (including staging laparoscopy with peritoneal
             wash) consistent with pancreatic cancer, resectable, borderline resectable, or locally
             advanced or unresectable as defined by NCCN guidelines
             (http://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/f_guidelines.asp).

          5. Laparoscopic confirmation that the PDAC is localized except for positive peritoneal
             cytology. Biliary stents are permitted.

          6. Elevated CA19-9.

          7. Measurable disease as defined by RECIST 1.1.

          8. ECOG performance status of ≤ 1 (see Appendix A).

          9. Adequate bone marrow reserves as evidenced by:

               -  ANC ≥1,500 cells/μl; and

               -  Platelet count ≥100,000 cells/μl; and

               -  Hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL

         10. Adequate hepatic function as evidenced by:

             undergone hysterectomy [the surgical removal of the uterus] or bilateral oophorectomy
             [the surgical removal of both ovaries] or (2) has not been naturally postmenopausal
             for at least 24 consecutive months [i.e., has had menses at any time during the
             preceding 24 consecutive months]) must:

               1. Either commit to true abstinence from heterosexual contact (which must be
                  reviewed on a monthly basis), or agree to use, and be able to comply with,
                  effective contraception without interruption for 28 days prior to starting
                  gemcitabine/nab- paclitaxel (including dose interruptions) and for 3 months after
                  last dose of gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel and

             contact with a female of childbearing potential or a pregnant female while on
             treatment (including during dose interruptions) with gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel and
             for 3 months following the last dose of gemcitabine/nab- paclitaxel, even if he has

          8. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             systemic infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris,
             clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations
             that would limit compliance with study requirements.

         10. Any medical condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may pose a safety risk
