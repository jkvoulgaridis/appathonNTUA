  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: There are no existing data available to guide clinicians in the appropriate
      rehabilitation progression of patients who have undergone knee arthroscopy. The investigator
      intends to fill this void by establishing normative recovery curves for patients undergoing
      knee arthroscopy.

      Research Design: Prospective Observational Design Procedures: Patients 10-70 years old will
      be screened for &quot;standard of care&quot; clinical and functional outcomes to occur at standardized
      time-points (post-op weeks 1-4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and return to sport/activity) following
      arthroscopic knee surgery. Recovery curves will be plotted for all outcome variables of
      interest including; (1) International knee Disability Committee (IKDC) survey, (2) Tampa
      Kinesiophobia scale, (3) Tegner activity scale, (4) Marx activity scale, (5) Passive knee
      range of motion/heel-height difference, (6) Balance Error Scoring System (BESS), (7)
      Quad/Hamstring strength ratios, (8) Y-Balance, (9) Functional Movement Screening, (10)
      Vail-Sport Test, (11) Landing Error Scoring System (LESS), (12) Hop Testing, and the (13)
      Sports Metrics Test. Polynomial lines-of-best-fit and 95% confidence intervals will be
      plotted to provide objective recovery curves for clinical utilization and stratification of
      patient recovery.

      Risks: There are no additional risks to &quot;standard physical therapy practice&quot; for
      post-surgical patients participating in this study. The investigator will not be using
      invasive procedures or testing modalities that emit radiation.

      Benefits &amp; Clinical Relevance: This information may offer valuable information to clinicians
      treating patients following knee arthroscopy by providing objective data for each phase of
      post-operative recovery. Identifying key landmarks and functional milestones may allow the
      ability to identify patients who are not meeting clinical expectations and subsequently
      tailor rehabilitation programs to improve recovery trajectories.
