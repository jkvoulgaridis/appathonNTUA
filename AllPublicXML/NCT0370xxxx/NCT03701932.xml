  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the effects of different types of mental activity
      performed while receiving transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) for the treatment of major
      depressive disorder. Our primary aim for this study is to assess the feasibility of combining
      TMS and computer based cognitive exercise in patients with major depressive disorder who may
      also have some degree of cognitive dysfunction, and to formally measure changes in mood and
      cognition over the course of the study.

      Patients will receive TMS treatment daily for 6 weeks as part of their standard care. They
      will complete clinical assessments and participate in cognitive retraining through completion
      of 15 hours of Lumosity gaming cognitive exercises while simultaneously receiving active TMS
      stimulation. Those participants in the control group will complete 15 hours of computer
      gaming activity during the administration of active stimulation. Computer games in the
      control group exercises are elected by the patient from a library of intellectually and
      motivationally engaging games drawn from several gaming software compilations that includes
      Play 101 Games and Hoyle Puzzle and Board Games.
