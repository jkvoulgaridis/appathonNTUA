  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intermittent exotropia is the most common type of exotropia in children. Treatment options
      are surgical and non surgical. Nonsurgical management include Correction of refractive
      errors, Active orthoptic treatments, Prisms and Occlusion therapy. Benefits of patch therapy
      are limiting suppression, reducing the frequency and amplitude of the deviation, changing the
      nature of the deviation (from constant to intermittent exotropia or from intermittent
      exotropia to exophoria), however, there is a concern that occlusion of the eyes may cause
      fusion failure and worsen deviation control. According to a few number of studies and
      controversy among the results of investigations, the investigators designed this randomized
      clinical trial study to determine the effect of partial patch therapy on the deviation
      control of children with intermittent exotropia.

    <measure>3-point scale Deviation Control</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>the ability of the child to control his/her deviation at far and near was assessed based on an office control 3-point scale : Children are categorized according to the office control 3-point scale into three control groups: good, fair, and poor.
Good control: deviation occurs only during covering the eye and fusion is quickly established after removing the cover without blinking and re-fixation.
Fair control: deviation occurs only during covering the eye and fusion is established after removing cover by blinking or re-fixation does happen.
Poor control: deviation occurs spontaneously without covering and fusion hardly happens with too much effort and after a long time.</description>

    <measure>6-point scale Deviation Control</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>the ability of the child to control his/her deviation at far and near was assessed based on the office control 6-point scale: Children are classified according to the office control 6-point scale into six groups of 0 to 5.
In this classification, exotropia is ranked after 30 seconds of observation: constant exotropia is ranked 5th, exotropia in more than 50% of the observing time is ranked 4th, and exotropia in less than 50% of the observing time is ranked 3rd. If exotropia is not seen in 30 seconds, the classification is made based on the speed of deviation control and fusion return 10 seconds after covering the eyes: back of fusion in more than 5 seconds is ranked 2nd, fusion return between 1 and 5 seconds ranked 1st, and fusion return in less than 1 second is ranked 0.</description>
