      This study evaluates a second review of ultrasound images of breast lesions using an
      interactive &quot;deep learning&quot; (or artificial intelligence) program developed by Samsung Medical
      Imaging, to see if this artificial intelligence will help the Radiologist make more accurate
      diagnoses.

      Using ultrasound images prospectively acquired, the purpose of this study entails a second
      review of ultrasound images with suspicious breast lesions using an interactive &quot;deep
      learning&quot; (or artificial intelligence) program developed by SamsungMedison Co.,Ltd.

      The images will be reviewed by the radiologists twice: first without, and then with
      assistance of artificial intelligence program by SamsungMedison Co., Ltd.

      BIRADS system will be used in this study.

      The objectives of the study are twofold: to quantify the statistical equivalence of
      radiologists' opinion and AI's output (CADe), and to check BIRADS score-based diagnostic
      accuracy (CADx) that is gained by the Radiologists' use of this interactive tool

    <masking_description>The study consisted of 10 readers with varying levels of training and experience providing analysis on a randomized set of 300 patients' breast ultrasound data with and without S-Detect for Breast. Two reading periods separated by at least 3-week washout, totaling 600 cases analyzed per reader. PI and her associate have knowledge about patients diagnosis and other information. So, they are exclueded in readers for &quot;reviewing&quot;. And all breast US images are de-indentified.</masking_description>

These decisions will be compared with the ground truths generated from the biopsy results or a 24-month follow-up (CADx).</description>

    <description>This software is a computer-aided detection (CADe) software application, designed to assist radiologist to analyze breast ultrasound images. S-Detect automatically segments and classifies shape, orientation, margin, lesion boundary, echo pattern, and posterior feature characteristics of user-selected region of interest. The device uses deep learning methods to perform tissue segmentation and classification of images.</description>

    <description>Suspicious lesions found on breast ultrasound are then followed either by ultrasound guided biopsy or ultrasound imaging every 6 months for two years. For those who undergo biopsy, ultrasound provides images which are used to localize the lesion and guide the placement of the biopsy needle. The sample is sent to pathology for diagnosis, while the ultrasound guidance images are stored. For those who have imaging follow-up, ultrasound images of the breast mass are obtained, digitally stored and interpreted by the radiologist typically using BIRADS scheme.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        1. Inclusion Criteria:

               -  Adult females or males recommended for ultrasound-guided breast lesion biopsy or
                  ultrasound follow-up with at least one suspicious lesion

               -  Age &gt; 18 years

               -  Able to provide informed consent

          2. Exclusion Criteria:

               -  Unable to read and understand English

               -  Unable or unwilling to provide informed consent

               -  A patient with current or previous diagnosis of breast cancer in the same
                  quadrant

               -  Unable or unwilling to undergo study procedures

          3. Subject Characteristics

               1. Number of Subjects: 300 subjects from 300 separate breast lesions can be
                  acquired. If a subject has more than 1 suspicious lesion, each may be chosen by
                  the radiologist attending as suitable for &quot;second review&quot;.

               2. Gender and Age of Subjects: Adult females or males aged 18 years or older who
                  meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be
                  considered for enrollment. Minors are excluded as breast cancer is very rare in
                  this age group.

               3. Racial and Ethnic Origin: There are no enrollment exclusions based on economic
                  status, race, or ethnicity. Based on local and United States census data, the
                  expected ethnic distribution will be approximately 26 Hispanic (approx. 16%) and
                  134 non-Hispanic people. Furthermore, the expected racial distribution is
                  expected to be approximately 126 White (approx. 79% of the whole study), 21 Black
                  or African America (13%), 8 Asian (5%), and 5 of other categories (3%).

               4. Vulnerable Subjects: It is unlikely that any UR students or employees will be
                  enrolled unless their primary physician refers them to UR Medicine Breast Imaging
                  at Red Creek for breast ultrasound and a suspicious lesion is found. We do not
                  expect any of these referrals to be from staffs who work directly with the PIs.
