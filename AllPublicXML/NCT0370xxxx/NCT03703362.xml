  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether targeted progressive resistance training
      is safe and feasible for patients with external snapping hip. Dropout rates, adverse events
      and training adherence are investigated. The secondary purpose is to investigate whether it
      is possible through targeted progressive resistance training to improve participants' muscle
      strength, functional status and hip-related quality of life.

      Snapping hip (coxa saltans) is a disorder where the hip tends to make an audible
      click-through movement, often but not necessarily associated with pain. A prevalence of 5-10%
      of the general population has been reported. Snapping hip is divided into three forms of
      snapping hip; intraarticular, internal and external snapping hip. External snapping hip (coxa
      saltans external) is the most common form, and patients may experience pain when the
      iliotibial band or anterior part of the gluteus maximus slides over the greater trochanter at
      femur. Patients with external snapping hip are typically between 15 and 40 years, and
      physically active.

    <measure>Adverse events.</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at each training session during the 12 week intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>A muscle or joint injury caused by the training program reported by a patient, or a canceled training session due to pain associated with exercise, or other harmful incidents associated with the training program.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain during exercise.</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured for each exercise performed during the 12 week intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Pain during the exercises, measured by the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). The score range from 0-10, where 0 means no pain and 10 means maximum pain</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Adherence to the training.</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured during the 12 week intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by how many of the training sessions the participants completed. High adherence defined &gt;80% of completed sessions. Drop out is defined as a person included in the study who chooses to leave before the final test.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in muscle strength measured by dynamometer.</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at inclusion, two weeks after inclusion, and when the 12 week intervention has ended.</time_frame>
    <description>Muscle strength in hip-abduction and hip-extension is measured isometrically, eccentrically and concentrically with a dynamometer (model Humac Norm).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in hip function.</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at inclusion, two weeks after inclusion, and when the 12 week intervention has ended.</time_frame>
    <description>Hip function is measured with the questionnaire the Copenhagen Hip and Groin Outcome Score (HAGOS). HAGOS consists of 37 items in 6 subscales: 7 items to cover symptoms, 10 items to cover pain, 5 items to cover physical function in daily living, 8 items to cover physical function in sport and recreation, 2 items to cover participation in physical activities and 5 items to cover hip and groin related quality of life. There is no total score. Each subscale has a range from 0-100. A high score indicates no problem and a low score indicates severe problems.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hypermobility status.</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at inclusion, two weeks after inclusion and when the 12 week intervention has ended.</time_frame>
    <description>Hypermobility status is measured with the Beighton Score. The test consists of 9 activities and each of the 9 tests can result in a score of 0 or 1 depending on whether the patient can perform the test or not. A total score is summed and has a range of 0-9. Hypermobility is defined by a score of 5 or higher.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in one repetition muscle strength.</measure>
    <time_frame>At the start of the intervention and 12 weeks later at the end of the intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Muscle strength is measured with the One-Repetition-Max test for hip-abduction and leg press.</description>

    <measure>Change in hip function.</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at inclusion, two weeks after inclusion and when the 12 week intervention has ended.</time_frame>
    <description>Change in hip function is measured with a Loaded stair test.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hip awareness.</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at inclusion, two weeks after inclusion and when the 12 week intervention has ended.</time_frame>
    <description>Hip awareness is measured with the Forgotten Joint Score questionnaire (FJS), where each patient completes the 12 questions regarding awareness of their affected hip. Each question is answered with one of the following options; never, almost never, seldom, sometimes and mostly, corresponding to a score of 1-5. The sum of the scores will be converted into a score between 0-100. A high score will indicate lack of awareness and a low score will indicate great awareness of the affected hip.</description>
