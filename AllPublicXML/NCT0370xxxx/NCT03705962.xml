  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of local antibiotic
      versus placebo in the prevention of infections in open fractures. The study will assess
      whether local treatment of open fractures with the antibiotic tobramycin (in addition to
      standard systemic antibiotics) will decrease the risk and rate of infection, and rate of
      re-operation. This will be studied using a randomized controlled clinical trial design in
      adult population of age 18-70 years who present with open fractures. About 133 subjects will
      be recruited in this study at UVA.
