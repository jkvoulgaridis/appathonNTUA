      This phase I trial aims at investigating a new combinatorial immunotherapy regimen using
      intratumoral injection of autologous CD1c (BDCA-1)+ myeloid dendritic cells in combination
      with intratumoral injection of the CTLA-4 blocking monoclonal antibody (mAb) ipilimumab and
      the PD-L1 blocking mAb avelumab. Concomitantly, nivolumab (a PD-1 blocking mAb) will be
      administered intravenously.

      This phase I trial aims at investigating a new combinatorial immunotherapy regimen using
      intratumoral injection of autologous CD1c (BDCA-1)+ myeloid dendritic cells in combination
      with intratumoral injection of the CTLA-4 blocking monoclonal antibody (mAb) ipilimumab and
      the PD-L1 blocking mAb avelumab. Concomitantly, nivolumab (a PD-1 blocking mAb) will be
      administered intravenously.

      CD1c (BDCA-1)+ myeloid dendritic (myDC) cells will be obtained by immunomagnetic isolation
      from PBMC obtained by leukapheresis. The CD1c (BDCA-1)+ myDC will not be substantially
      manipulated prior to autologous intratumoral injection, immediately following the isolation
      and concentration (isolation and administration will be performed in the same procedure). The
      investigators consider that the isolation represents a non-substantial manipulation of this
      somatic cell therapy product. The intended use of CD1c (BDCA-1)+ myDC in this clinical
      protocol is to enrich their presence within the injected metastasis where they should execute
      their physiological role of coordinating the anti-tumor immune response. Based on recent
      preclinical data, absence of myeloid dendritic cells in the tumor microenvironment is an
      important immune escape mechanism of malignant tumors.

             study treatment, including oral steroid doses &gt; 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent
             except for management of adverse events and central nervous system (CNS) metastases
             during the course of the study. Subjects that require intermittent use of

             postmenopausal (defined as at least 12 months with no menses without an alternative
             medical cause; in women &lt; 45 years of age a high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)
             level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a post-menopausal state in
             women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy. In the absence
             of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient.) OR have had a

             significant disorder, condition or disease (with the exception of those outlined
             above) that, in the opinion of the investigator physician, if consulted, would pose a
             risk to subject safety or interfere with the study evaluation, procedures or
             completion

          -  Is or has an immediate family member (eg, spouse, parent/legal guardian, sibling, or
