  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antibiotic resistance is becoming a bigger problem. If the problem remains unsolved, the WHO
      predicts a return to the pre-antibiotic era. Overtreatment with antibiotics drives
      development of resistant bacteria and adverse events in patients, thus identification and
      rectifying factors leading to unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions are a public health
      problem.

      Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) are the most commonly diagnosed infection in nursing homes
      (NH). A prevalence study showed that in up to 76% of all antibiotic prescriptions in Danish
      NHs the indication was UTI. In this particular group of patients with suspected UTI, the
      literature has repeatedly shown that a vast amount of these antibiotic courses are
      inappropriate.

      As people age, the prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria increases significantly.
      Asymptomatic bacteriuria is a condition that should not be treated with antibiotics. Thus,
      the treatment decision in this group should not rely on the result of urinary testing and
      should only commence, when classical urinary symptoms are present. Urinary testing of NH
      residents is one of the drivers of overtreatment. Therefore, a recent Danish guideline from
      Institute of Rational Pharmacology (IRF) on elderly with suspected UTI suggest that urine
      culture should only be performed when typical urinary symptoms are present and that
      antibiotic prescribing should be delayed until the result of the culture is available
      whenever possible. It is unknown to what extent Danish GPs follows these guidelines.

      NH residents are often immobile, therefore; the diagnostic process of UTI in NH residents
      differs from the norm, which could also explain some part of the inappropriate prescribing.
      Immobility introduces physical distance between patient and GP because the patient is unable
      to visit the General Practitioners office. Because home visits are rare, when a UTI is
      suspected, NH staff usually contacts the GP in writing, over the phone and occasionally in
      person to relate the patient history and physical findings.

      When another link in the communication chain between patient and GP is added, clinical
      information passes through additional health professionals and the risk of communication
      error and misunderstanding increases. Some forms of communications may be more suited to fit
      this setting than others. When communicating in person, it is possible to take non-verbal
      cues into account and immediately clear up insecurities. Communication by phone eliminates
      non-verbal cues, but a dialog about unclarified aspects is still attainable. Written
      communication, however, has none of the clarifying traits of the former, and to elaborate on
      the content the GP will have to contact the NH, which takes time in an already packed
      schedule.

      The investigators hypothesize that the more direct the contact form, the better the quality
      of clinical information, which leads to increased compliance with guidelines. Thus by proxy,
      our hypothesis becomes that compliance to guidelines increases with directness of contact
      form. The aim of this study is to investigate to which degree the guidelines on antibiotic
      prescribing for NH residents with suspected UTI are followed and how the communication form
      affects adherence to guidelines.

    <description>For each suspected UTI, it must be determined if the GP handles the patient according to guidelines. The answer to this question will be in percent of all suspected UTIs with a subanalysis of why the reason why they are not treated in accordance (e.g. no urinary symptoms)</description>

    <time_frame>3rd of april - 30th of june</time_frame>
    <description>A logistic regression model will be developed, where the outcome variable states if the suspected UTI is treated according to the guideline or not. The dependent variables are contact form from nursing home to GP and contact form from GP to nursing home.</description>
