    <textblock>
      The Alexa+ Study will compare the use of the Amazon Echo Dot with Alexa voice technology in
      patients with chronic heart failure to those receiving standard of care heart failure
      management on changes in health and patient-centered outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Integrating data from virtual voice activated assistants (Amazon Echo Dot with Alexa voice
      technology), with the rich medical history available in Electronic Health Records (EHR) will
      allow a truly customized, interactive, and automated personal healthcare assistant. This
      technology will be validated in patients who have chronic heart failure (HF). Half of the
      study patients will receive an Amazon Echo Dot (Alexa) enhanced with a HF Care custom Alexa
      Skill that is patient-specific, or Alexa+. Data on patient interactions with the device will
      be followed for three months. The control groups will receive standard of care (SOC) HF
      management. Both study and control groups will receive regular follow up from the HF nurse
      and data from all hospital or clinic visits will be captured from the EHR.

    <description>Patients will receive the Amazon Echo Dot with Alexa voice technology (Alexa+) and will be asked to interact with the device for 3 months. Alexa+ will ask a series of questions. Based on the answers to these questions, it will either contact a study coordinator or will ask patients to take a specific action (such as weighing themselves). Data from this simple intervention will be merged with data extracted from the patient's health record and analyzed for clinical variables and demographics that are most predictive for success in use of these technologies.</description>
