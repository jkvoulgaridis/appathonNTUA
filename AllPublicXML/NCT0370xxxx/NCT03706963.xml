  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is data confirming that simple tests of physical capability, such as the timed
      &quot;get-up-and-go&quot; test and the 6-minute walk test, correlate with surgical outcomes. It is
      reasonable to assume that preoperative telemonitoring, which allows for the tracking of more
      variables over a wider range of activities, could provide a significantly more accurate
      picture of a patient's physical fitness than a short one-time test performed in the clinic
      setting.

      Almost half of the patients who are readmitted at Washington University are readmitted for
      less than 4 days. The readmitted patients usually present with sepsis, are treated with
      antibiotics and percutaneous drainage, and are discharged home relatively quickly. Earlier
      identification of these patients, prior to the development of sepsis, would reduce the risks
      to the patient and allow for outpatient management.

    <description>Patients will be provided with a Fitbit Charge HR &amp; assistance to set up on smart phone
Preoperative baseline data (activity, sleep, heartrate) will be collected for 14 days until the day prior to surgery
The group will receive a phone call 7 days into their preoperative period to identify barriers, provide available resources, &amp; encourage continuation of prehabilitation activities
The physician extender will talk with the patient to identify barriers to prehabilitation activities that the patient may have experienced during the first 7 days of activity tracking &amp; provide recommendations &amp; resources to overcome those barriers when possible. The physician extender will encourage the patient to continue prehabilitation activities until the day of operation to meet goals. Following surgery, we will analyze Fitbit data to determine if the intervention had an impact on the patient's prehabilitation activity with the non-intervened patient group used as a control</description>
