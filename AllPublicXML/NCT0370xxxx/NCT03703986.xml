  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study set out to explore the risk factors of early neurological deterioration (END)
      occurred in patients with acute ischemic stroke and to investigate the corresponding
      predictors.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      END refers to the illness aggravation occurred in the early stage of stroke and often
      indicates a poor outcome. Some clinical scales may play an important role in its diagnoses
      and treatments. Across the reviewed studies, the risk factors of END, which included
      biochemical parameters, neuroimaging, ect. were explored incompletely and the effective
      predictors of END is unknown. We aimed to explore the risk factors of END and investigate the
      predictive value of certain scales.

    <description>National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) can assess the severity of stroke. The total score of NIHSS ranges from 0 to 42, with higher scores indicating better neurological function.</description>

    <description>Canadian Neurological Scale (CNS) can assess the severity of stroke as well. The total score of CNS ranges from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating worse neurological function.</description>

    <description>The blood parameters included total cholesterol, triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein and high-density lipoprotein. The normal range of them were 3 mmol·L-1 to 5.7 mmol·L-1, 0 mmol·L-1 to 2.25 mmol·L-1, 2.6 mmol·L-1 to 4.1 mmol·L-1, 1.03 mmol·L-1 to 1.55 mmol·L-1, respectively.</description>
