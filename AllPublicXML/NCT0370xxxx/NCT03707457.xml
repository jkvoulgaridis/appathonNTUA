  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to test if it is safe to give nivolumab with targeted
      immunotherapy drugs for recurrent glioblastoma (GBM), a type of brain tumor. The study
      doctors believe that giving immunotherapy drugs that match the biomarkers in a tumor will
      help the immune system fight the tumor. Tumor tissue collected during surgery will be tested
      for certain biomarkers to determine which immunotherapy might best target the tumor.

      The combination immunotherapy arms include:

      Arm A: Nivolumab + anti-GITR Arm B: Nivolumab + IDO1 inhibitor Arm C: Nivolumab + Ipilimumab

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE

      1. To determine safety of each of the following study agents, anti-GITR, IDO1 inhibitor, and
      ipilimumab, in combination with nivolumab (BMS-936558) flat dose in patients with first
      recurrence of GBM.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES

        1. To estimate toxicity

        2. To estimate progression-free survival

        3. To estimate overall survival

        4. To evaluate pain for patients undergoing the treatment of anti-GITR, IDO1 inhibitor, and
           ipilimumab, in combination with nivolumab.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES

        1. To characterize the immune response during and after treatment as measured by
           immunohistochemistry, and other T cells etc. in peripheral blood

        2. To characterize the pharmacodynamic and genomic activity in tumor tissue as target
           inhibition

        3. To characterize radiographic response

        4. Genetic characterization of correlative samples
