  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be recruited from the community and attend a screening clinic and undergo
      the following screening tests:

        1. Bi-parametric MRI - reported by a radiologist and CAD-AI system

        2. Multiparametric ultrasound - including shearwave elastography

        3. A standard-of-care PSA test

      A systematic +/- targeted biopsy will be performed if any tests are positive, independent of
      the other tests.
