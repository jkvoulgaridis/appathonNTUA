    <textblock>
      The current study is a randomized intervention trial that tests the efficacy of a
      family-focused sibling relationship promotion program. The study includes a treatment group
      and a contact-equivalent attention control condition with 288 sibling dyads and data
      collection with target parents, target sibling dyads, and teachers at three time points
      (pre-test, post-test, and 18-month follow-up). Data will be collected using a three-cohort
      design with 96 families in each of the three cohorts.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed project tests the efficacy of a family-focused program. This innovative program
      is focused on sibling relationships and parenting of siblings as synergistic targets of
      change to promote positive interpersonal family dynamics and parent and youth psychosocial
      and behavioral health and well-being. This translational effort builds on strong theoretical
      and empirical premises including a successful pilot study (ASU SIBS Program). Using a
      rigorous design and measurement, aims are to: (a) test the efficacy of SIBS, delivered via 12
      weekly afterschool sibling sessions and 3 family nights in the familiar elementary school
      setting, versus a contact-equivalent attention control condition. Mexican-origin sibling
      dyads (5th graders and younger siblings; N = 288 dyads) and their parents will be recruited
      from economically disadvantaged elementary schools and randomly assigned within school to
      intervention or contact-equivalent attention control conditions. Assessments will be
      conducted at pre-test, post-test, and 18-month follow-up. Program effects will be tested on
      primary and secondary outcomes, including sibling relationship quality (i.e., warmth and
      negativity), sibling relationship skills, children's efficacy (social, emotional), children's
      internalizing symptoms, parents' stress and depressive symptoms, parent-child warmth and
      conflict, and family cohesion. Findings will advance prevention science by identifying an
      efficacious program that capitalizes on cultural assets to promote positive family dynamics
      and psychosocial well-being among Latinos, including by incorporating daily measurements of
      intervention targets (sibling relationship skills) to identify mechanisms underlying program
      effects.

    <measure>Parenting of Siblings Measure</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The measure assesses parents' perceptions of three constructs: Parents' positive guidance, authoritarian control, and involvement (McHale et al., 2000; Updegraff et al., 2016). For each subscale, scores range from 1 to 5. Higher subscale scores indicate more positive guidance (i.e., better outcome), higher involvement (i.e., better outcome), and higher authoritarian control (i.e., worse outcome). Subscales are not combined into a total score.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Sibling Prosocial Behavior</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The measure assesses parents' perceptions of one construct: Parents' ratings of children's supportive and prosocial behaviors (Stormshak, Bellanti, &amp; Bierman, 1996; Updegraff et al., 2016).
Scores range from 1 to 6. Higher scores indicate parents' perceptions of target child's more prosocial behaviors toward their sibling (i.e., better outcome).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Sibling Intimacy</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The measure assesses siblings' ratings of intimacy/emotional support (Blyth &amp; Foster-Clark, 1987). Scores range from 1 to 5. Higher scores indicate target child's perceptions of higher sibling intimacy and closeness (i.e., better outcome).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Sibling Relationship Inventory: Negativity Subscale</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The measure assesses parents' ratings of sibling conflict and negativity (Stocker &amp; McHale, 1992). Scores range from 1 to 5. Higher scores indicate parents' perceptions of target child's greater negativity toward their sibling (i.e., worse outcome).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Sibling Relationship Inventory: Negativity Subscale</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The measure assesses children's ratings of sibling conflict and negativity (Furman &amp; Buhrmester, 1985). Scores range from 1 to 5. Higher scores indicate target child's perceptions of higher sibling conflict and negativity (i.e., worse outcome).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-efficacy Measure</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This measure assesses children's ratings of two constructs: social self-efficacy and emotional self-efficacy (Muris, 2001). For each subscale, scores range from 1 to 5. Higher subscale scores indicate greater social self-efficacy (i.e., better outcome) and greater emotional self-efficacy (i.e., better outcome). Subscales are not combined into a total score.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Children's Depression Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This measure assesses children's ratings of their depressive symptoms (Kovacs, 1985). Items are scored on a scale from 0 to 2, and higher scores indicate greater depressive symptoms (i.e., worse outcome). If mean scores are used, scores range from 0 to 2. If sum scores are used, scores range from 0 to 52.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Behavior Problem Index</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This measure assesses parents' perceptions of children's social emotional functioning in 6 domains (i.e., antisocial, anxious/depressed, headstrong, hyperactive, dependency, peer conflict; Peterson &amp; Zill, 1986). For all scales, items are scored on a scale from 1 to 3. For each subcale, higher scores indicate higher problem behavior in the domain (i.e., worse outcome). Mean scores are created for each subscale, and a total mean score is created across all domains - in all cases, higher scores indicate worse outcomes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The program condition includes 12 weekly 90-minute afterschool group sessions for siblings. Sessions are structured as psycho-educational groups and include social interactional activities, role-playing, discussion, and didactic presentation. The focus is on sibling relationship skills, cognitions, and activities. During a total of 3 family nights, parents attend with their children. Part of the family night session involves parents and children together. Another part of the session involves parents being separated from children. Family Nights promote parents' understanding of sibling relationships, review concepts, provide strategies for parental support of siblings, and teach parents skills for dealing with sibling problems. Family Nights include dinner and last 2 hours.</description>
