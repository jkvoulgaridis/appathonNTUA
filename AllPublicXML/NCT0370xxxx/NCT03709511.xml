  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of adult rheumatic valvular heart disease is 2.34% to 2.72% in China. Although
      guidelines or consensus recommendations recommend rehabilitation after valve surgery,
      clinical studies are still lacking, especially for Chinese patients. Current limited clinical
      studies focus mainly on physical capacity and self-assessed mental health. The investigators
      hope to find out whether a comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation program can improve the
      postoperative mortality and complications, besides physical capacity and healthcare costs
      after heart valve surgery. A multicenter, randomized clinical trial, PORT study, aims to
      investigate whether cardiac rehabilitation in addition to usual care is superior to treatment
      as usual after heart valve surgery. The trial will randomly allocate 1000 patients after
      inclusion screening, 1:1 intervention to control group, using central randomization, and
      blinded outcome assessment and statistical analyses. The intervention consists of
      rehabilitation education, daily exercise management before surgery, 1 year of physical
      exercise, and a psycho-educational intervention comprising five consultations. The primary
      outcome is the composite endpoint of in-hospital adverse event and length of stays. Secondary
      outcomes are the composite endpoint of complications, Short Form 36 living quality score,
      peak oxygen consumption at cardiopulmonary exercise test, six-minute walk test at 3-month and
      1-year follow-up. The investigators also record the time to resumption of work.
      Echocardiography and cost-benefit will be assessed. A mixed-method design is used to evaluate
      qualitative and quantitative findings encompassing a survey-based study before the trial and
      a qualitative pre- and post-intervention study.

      The PORT study is a randomized, open-label, controlled trial using assessor blinding and
      intention-to-treat analysis. To date, no high-quality study has prospectively examined the
      impact of post-operative CR in the Chinese population undergoing cardiac surgery. Thus, the
      PORT trial has been designed to address a cardiac rehabilitation study in line with the
      actual situation in China. The investigators have used the Standard Protocol Items:
      Recommendations for Intervention Trials (SPIRIT) guidelines in reporting this clinical trial.

      Eligible patients are invited by a nurse or a medical doctor to a short consultation on the
      second or third day after surgery, including distribution of written participant information.
      Patients needing time to consider trial participation 3 days before surgery. At enrolment, on
      average 3 to 5 days before surgery, baseline data are collected. The CPET and 6-minute walk
      test are performed as close to discharge as possible, using standard guidelines. In case of
      postoperative complications after enrolment, such as pericardial exudate and atrial
      fibrillation, the patient's case will be handled individually, and the intervention will be
      postponed according to recovery status. Participation in the trial will never delay usual
      medical follow-up. After collection of baseline data, central randomization is conducted by
      telephoning the Copenhagen Trial Unit. The randomization is stratified for age (&lt;60y,
      60-75y，≥75y); left ventricular ejection fraction (&lt;30%, 30%-50%, &gt;50%); eGFR
      (&gt;60ml/min/1.73m2, 30-59ml/min/1.73m2, &lt;30ml/min/1.73m2). Randomization is conducted
      according to a computer-generated allocation sequence with a varying block size, concealed
      from the investigators to avoid selection bias. Thus, neither investigators and patients nor
      relatives can influence to which group the patients are allocated. Personal information about
      potential and enrolled patients will be collected electronically and shared in a database
      accessible only within the project group for those responsible for patient inclusion, in
      order to protect confidentiality before, during and after the trial.

      The investigators are performing a randomized trial stating that the mean in the intervention
      and the control groups are the same as a power of 95%, and a type I error probability of 5%.
      The investigators are assuming the data mentioned above function well with less than 10%
      percent of lost data mostly from follow-up. The inclusion of 500 participants is needed in
      the experimental intervention group, and 500 in the control group (a total of 1000
      participants) to be able to reject the null hypothesis The trial will randomly allocate1000
      patients, 1:1 intervention to control group, using central randomization, and blinded outcome
      assessment and statistical analyses. The intervention consists of 48 weeks of physical
      exercise, and a psycho-educational intervention comprising five consultations, intervention
      versus treatment as usual, with blinded outcome assessment.

    <description>This arm will receive usual care. In accordance with current guidelines a cardiologist sees all patients 4 to 6 weeks after heart valve surgery. At the follow-up visit a clinical examination, biochemistry and echocardiography are performed. All patients are given general information on anticoagulation and endocarditis prophylaxis. During the trial period the patients will be seen by a physician at The Guangdong General Hospital, for the follow-up visit, after 1 and 12 months. All patients are instructed to initiate their usual activities of daily living. Patients in the control group have accepted not to receive local rehabilitation at the hospital or community setting in their written consent.</description>

    <description>Rehabilitation starts preoperatively with education and exercise management.After screening with cardiopulmonary exercise test,the participant will receive daily preoperative exercise rehabilitation till surgery.It lasts for 20 minutes per day, starting with a 40-60% anaerobic threshold and gradually advancing to 80%.Each patient was motivated to adhere to the basic protocol, but individual adjustments were allowed in case of slower progress. Physical exercise starts 1 month postoperative after the first cardiopulmonary exercise testing, and comprises the following three elements: individual planning of the physical exercise, a specially trained physiotherapist conduction, and integrating detailed information concerning medical treatment and diet.The exercise diary and the heart rate monitor recordings are essential in monitoring during the whole intervention.</description>
