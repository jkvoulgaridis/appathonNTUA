  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the role of 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) on the course of recovery after peripheral
      nerve traction and/or crush injury. This study aims to test the hypothesis that
      4-aminopyridine speeds the often slow and unpredictable recovery after peripheral nerve
      traction and/or crush injuries.

    <description>4-Aminopyridine (FDA-approved drug)
Subjects will not take more than 2 tablets in a 24-hour period
Subjects will take the tablets whole. They will not break, crush, chew, or dissolve tablets before swallowing.
The subjects will be told that the medication is released slowly over time and if the tablet is broken, the medicine may be released too fast which can raise the chance of having a seizure.
Study drug can be taken with or without food.
If a dose is missed they should not make up the missed dose. They will be told not to take two doses at the same time but to take the next dose at the regular scheduled time.
Subjects will be reminded not to take study drug together with other aminopyridine medications, including compounded 4-AP (sometimes called 4-aminopyridine or fampridine).</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Group B: Placebo</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Placebo Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Subjects will receive an oral dose of placebo treatment the day after surgery, continuing daily for 3 months (90 days) following the same administration instructions as the investigational treatment. The placebo tablets will be manufactured by The University of Iowa Pharmaceuticals, 115 South Grand Avenue G-20, Iowa City, IA 52242. The Investigational Drug Service at the University of Rochester will manage the placebos.
Placebo composition will include:
97% Microcrystalline Cellulose, NF (Avicel Ph 102) 2% Sodium Starch Glycolate, NF
1% Magnesium Stearate, NF
The placebo will be covered in White Opadry, formulation OY-S-9603 and tooled to look similar to the investigational treatment.</description>
