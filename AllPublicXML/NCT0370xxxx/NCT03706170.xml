  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After a coma, one important challenge is the detection of awareness with patients with
      disorders of consciousness. For some patients, the only behavioral manifestation indicative
      of awareness is an appropriate emotional response. Studies show that the use of a particular
      conditioning - with delay - appears to be an objective solution to study the conscious
      perception of an emotion in none-communicating people. Until now, emotions of patients
      suffering disorder of consciousness (DOC) have been scarcely studied. It has been proved that
      some awakening patients have vegetative reactions following an emotional stimulus, but the
      investigator can't confirm whether or not the emotional experience of the patient is
      conscious.

      The investigator's main purpose is to study emotional reactions from patients suffering a
      disorder of consciousness.

      The investigator hypothesize that some patients have preserved reflexes reaction to the
      emotional stimuli while others could demonstrate a conscious emotional experience.

      In order to answer these questions, the study is designed to record in a single session: (i)
      physiological vegetative reactions (electrodermal, pupillary responses and heart rate) to
      emotional stimuli both in DOC patients and healthy controls; (ii) a neurophysiological marker
      of consciousness; and (iii) physiological parameters during a trace conditioning experiment
      using auditory stimuli with and without emotional valence. The investigator plan to include
      patients vegetative patients (n=15); minimally conscious patients (n=15); acquired brain
      injured patients without conscious disorder (n=15) and healthy participants (n=15).

    <description>electroencephalography (EEG) The investigator will study how the intensity of different Event Related Potentials varies with different levels of sound around the auditory threshold: this will be assessed specifically for early cortical components of the auditory response such as the N1 around 100 ms after the stimulus, and for late components around 300-500 ms after the stimulus, particularly the P300.</description>
