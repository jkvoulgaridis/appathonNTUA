  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rosacea is a frequent dermatological condition, with a chronic and disturbing evolution that
      is characterized by redness, permanent erythema associated with telangiectasia (visible and
      permanent dilatation of the small vessels). It frequently affects men and women with fair
      skin and can have significant psycho-emotional consequences.

      To counteract the unaesthetic appearance of redness and eliminate telangiectasia, the use of
      the laser is proposed to the patient.

      This study is a single center prospective, randomized, controlled split face study to compare
      532nm KTP laser versus 585 nm PLV Laser in terms of improvement of the symptoms in the
      treatment of Erythematotelangiectatic Rosacea 20 subjects will receive up to 3 laser
      treatments at day 0, month 2 and 4 and will be followed at month 6 and 12.

      Adult male and female subjects 18 years of age or older will participate in the study after
      the objectives, methods, and potential risks of the study have been explained, and after they
      have signed the informed consent form.

      Patients will come to the investigation center for a maximum of 6 visits.
