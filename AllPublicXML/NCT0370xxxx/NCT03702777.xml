      The study objectives of this study are to evaluate the efficacy of ASP8302 compared with
      placebo in participants with underactive bladder (UAB), to investigate the safety and
      tolerability of ASP8302 compared with placebo in participants with UAB, to investigate the
      pharmacokinetics of ASP8302 in participants with UAB and to support the development of the
      UAB - Patient Reported Outcome (PRO).

      The study will comprise a screening visit, followed by a treatment period and a 2-week
      follow-up period, in total 8 weeks. Participants will visit the clinic at screening (visit 1)
      and every 2 weeks (visit 2, 3, 4, and 5). During the course of the study assessments will be
      performed at the visits.

    <description>VVst is thought to increase as the bladder emptying is improved. Standardizing the bladder filling is thought to increase accuracy in comparison with normal spontaneous bladder filling which will differ between time points.
No multiplicity correction will be performed.</description>

    <measure>Bladder voiding efficiency calculated with PVRc2 and VVst (BVEc2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to week 6</time_frame>
    <description>BVEc2 is a measure of voiding efficiency, i.e. the percentage of the voided volume of the total bladder capacity: (VV/[VV+PVR]) times 100. It will be calculated with PVRc2 and VVst, as that is thought to represent the most accurate measurement.</description>
