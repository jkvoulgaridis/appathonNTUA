  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to refine and test the efficacy of a computer assisted culturally
      informed and flexible/adaptive intervention for Latino adolescents for whom self-harm
      behaviors are a health disparityâ€”specifically, Latinas and sexual/gender minority youth.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study enhances an original Computer Assisted Culturally Informed and Flexible
      Family-Based Treatment for Adolescents (CA CIFFTA) to directly address key targets related to
      self-harm behavior (e.g., depression, emotion dysregulation, LGBT, culture-related stressors,
      and trauma-related stressors); (b) refines the technological aspects of CA CIFFTA for
      web-based delivery; and (c) tests the preliminary efficacy of the new intervention and its
      delivery system in a randomized trial of 100 Hispanic adolescents and their parents. The
      investigators seek to reduce risk for repeated self-harm by showing treatment effects on
      depression, emotion regulation, substance use, and family functioning. Participants are
      randomly assigned to CA CIFFTA or Treatment-As-Usual and treatment covers a four month
      period.

    <intervention_model_description>Randomization will be stratified by gender, type of self-harm, trauma exposure and LGBT status. The investigators will attempt to match overall contact hours (in the experimental condition some of these hours will be with technology). During the &quot;continuing care&quot; phase the CIFFTA families will interact with the therapist via the website for a period of 8 additional weeks. To match dosage time during aftercare, Treatment As Usual (TAU) will receive &quot;check-in&quot; telephone calls with the therapist.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Using the Family Environment Scale (FES) we will measure conflict and cohesion in family functioning. The Cohesion subscale measures how well the family gets along. It is scored from 0 -9 (9 items scored 0 or 1) with a score of 9 reflecting better cohesion and relationships. The Conflict subscale measures conflict in the family. It is score from 0 - 9 with a score of 9 reflecting a high degree of conflict.</description>

    <description>Difficulties with Emotion Regulation Scale -Short form (DERS), is designed to assess emotional dysregulation using a 5-point Likert Scale. The total score is calculated from the sum of all items, with higher scores indicating greater problems with emotion regulation (Total possible range: 36-180).</description>

    <measure>Risky Sexual Behavior</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 months post baseline, 12 months post baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Using the Risky Sexual Behavior Questionnaire and a gated procedure that asks specificity of behaviors only to youth who are active, we will ask about sexual behavior, protection, and risky contexts.There are no subscale scores, only individual items reporting frequency of sexual contact, risky sexual contact, unprotected contact. Higher scores equal more frequency of events.</description>

    <description>CA CIFFTA (Computer Assisted Culturally Informed and Flexible Family Based Treatment for Adolescents) consists of a hybrid intervention utilizing office-based CIFFTA and technology-delivered material. Over 16 weeks CIFFTA participants receive 45 minutes of face-to-face sessions plus approximately 45 minutes of web-based intervention. During the continuing care phase participants access website resources and receive targeted messages (e.g., handling family conflicts). CA CIFFTA will: 1) deliver psycho-educational modules (e.g., depression, emotion regulation), 2) collect diary-card information, and 3) provide additional resources. During videos parents and adolescents can report symptoms and information that is automatically transmitted to therapists and used in the next session</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to Treatment-As-Usual (TAU) work over a 16-week period with their community agency. They may receive individual or family treatment. The team coordinates with the TAU agencies to minimize the overlap of data collected. The team will refer out to service locations that are most convenient for the participant. A great deal of thought has gone into the selection of the Treatment as Usual condition. The investigators wanted to compare CA CIFFTA's ability to retain and bring about change in participants with what is typically done in the community. Although running an in-house comparison condition gives more control of the delivery of services and tracking of clients, it is difficult to know how that compared to the services that are typically provided in the community</description>
