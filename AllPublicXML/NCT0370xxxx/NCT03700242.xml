    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate that a short intramuscular (IM)
      pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) regimen is non-inferior to the reference IM PrEP regimen in
      terms of seroconversion rate.

      The secondary objectives of the study are:

        -  To describe the immunogenicity of the PrEP regimen in each group

        -  To describe the antibody persistence in each group 6 months and 1 year after the last
           PrEP vaccination

        -  To describe the immunogenicity of the simulated post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) regimen
           in each group

        -  To describe the safety profile of study vaccines administered as PrEP regimen and as a
           simulated PEP regimen in each group

             day of vaccination or febrile illness (temperature ≥ 38.0 C). A prospective subject

             event has subsided

          -  Identified as an Investigator or employee of the Investigator or study center with
             direct involvement in the proposed study, or identified as an immediate family member
             (i.e., parent, spouse, natural or adopted child) of the Investigator or employee with
             direct involvement in the proposed study

          -  History of Guillain-Barré syndrome

          -  Receipt of chloroquine or other medications used for malaria chemoprophylaxis, with or
             without other anti-malarial treatment, for more than 4 weeks (duration of
