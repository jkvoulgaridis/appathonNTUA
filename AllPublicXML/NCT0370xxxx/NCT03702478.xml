    <textblock>
      It is not well-established whether a parastomal bulge impacts stoma patients HRQoL or if
      HRQOL differs according to the underlying disease or type of stoma. In this large
      cross-sectinal study stoma patients with and without a parastomal bulge are asked about their
      health-related quality of life and stomarelated quality of life. Stoma patients are
      identified in the danish stoma database and contacted two times by email. Non-responders are
      sent a paper booklet.

      A cross-sectional study of patients registered in the Danish Stoma Database Capital Region
      (DSDCR), with permanent or temporary enterostoma after surgery performed between 2011 and
      2016. Via a unique personal identification number registered in DSDCR patients will be
      contacted by e-mail using the e-Boks system, an official electronic distribution system
      covering around 80% of the Danish adult population. The e-mail will contain information about
      the study and a personal link to SurveyXact, an online survey program allowing for direct
      electronic data entry by patients. First reminder will be sent after one week and a second
      reminder again one week later. If necessary, a third reminder additionally three weeks later
      will be sent to patients by post, including a paper booklet of the questionnaires as
      described below.

      For patients without e-Boks, DSDCR will be linked to the Danish Civil Registration System via
      the unique personal identification number, providing information on patient's addresses.
      Information on the study and a paper booklet of questionnaires will be sent to patients by
      post. A reminder will be sent by post after three weeks if necessary. Hereafter, no further
      attempts will be made to contact the patients. To include other relevant variables in the
      analysis of data, data from the Danish Anaesthesia Database (DAD) and the Danish Colorectal
      Cancer Database will be linked. Quality of life will be assessed using StomaQol and SF-36.
      Colostomy Impact score will also be obtained. Patients will self-report a parastomal bulge
      and information such as education, alcohol consumption, physical activity and civil status.

High intensity physical activity as for example running, playing football or tennis, measured in minutes (min.) pr week. Scale: 0 min, &lt;30 min., 30-59 min., 60-120 min. and &gt;120 min. Values &lt;30 min. or 0 min. is considered low physical activity of high-intensity. 30-59 min. is considered medium physical activity of high intensity. Values &gt; 60 min ia considered high physical activity level of high intensity.
Low intensity physical activity as for example walking, doing the garden or cleaning the house, measured in minutes pr week. Scale: 0 min., &lt;30 min., 30-60 min., 61-90 min., 91-150 min., 151-300 min. and &gt;300 min. Values &lt;60 min is considered low physical activity of low intensity. Values from 61-150 is considered medium physical activity of low intensity. Values from 151 or more is considered high physical activity level of low intensity.</description>
