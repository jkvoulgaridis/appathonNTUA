  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Percutaneous Microelectrolysis ® (MEP®) is a technique that employs a galvanic current up
      to 990 uA, which is applied percutaneously with an acupuncture needle connected to the
      cathode. Although it is used in tendinopathies, trigger points and muscle injuries, among
      other conditions, its bases are mostly empirical and there is lack of evidence.

      Ischemic compression is a manual therapy that is usually applied in muscle pain.

      Myofascial Pain Syndrome (MPS) usually presents painful myofascial trigger points (MTrPs).
      One methodology used to quantify the pain in MPS is the algometry, which measures the
      pressure pain threshold (PPT).

      The aim of this study was to compare the effects of MEP® with ischemic compression on MTrPs
      with algometry.

    <description>Algometry is used to measure the Preasure Pain Threshold (PPT). PPT is defined as the minimum force applied which induces pain. It was applied in the Miofascial Trigger points.</description>

    <description>Principal MTrP will be detected by digital palpation in the upper trapezius. Algometry will be used to determine if the Pain Pressure Threshold (PPT) is equal or less than 3 KgF/cm2. If not, the patient will be not included. A mark will be done in the MTrP.
MEP® will be applied with a 0,30 x 25 mm acupuncture needle. The needle will be introduced perpendicularly to the MTrP with 100 uA and then increased up to 600 uA. The current will be paused if the patient feels a burning sensation, pain or oppression, waiting up to the patient feels no discomfort. The procedure will be repeated as many times is necessary until the patient do not feel any discomfort for more than 1 minute.
Algometry will be done immediately finished the intervention, after 10 minutes and at 24 hs.</description>

Ischemic compression will be applied perpendicularly to the MTrP, increasing gradually the pression until the patient refers the maximum tolerable pain. This pressure will be applied for 1 minute.
