  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite of preventive measures, the incidence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in ICU patients
      is estimated to range from 5-31%. While clinical diagnostics is unreliable, ultrasound
      compression test (UCT) has proven to be a highly sensitive and specific modality for the
      recognition of lower extremity DVT. Delegating this competence to ICU nurses can increase UCT
      availability and enable preventive DVT screening. Therefore, the investigators decided to
      conduct a clinical study to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of UCT performed by
      general ICU nurse in ICU patients compared to an investigation by ICU physician certified in
      ultrasound. Prior to the study, each nurse-investigator participating in the study undergo
      one-hour training in UCT and examine 5 patients under supervision. Then, ICU patients without
      known DVT will be investigated by UCT in the femoral and popliteal region of both lower
      extremities by trained general ICU nurse-investigators. On the same day, the examination will
      be repeated by an ICU physician-investigator. The results of the examinations of each patient
      will be blinded to each other for both investigators until both tests are performed. The
      sensitivity and specificity of the test performed by general nurse will be calculated in
      comparison with the examination by a specialist.
