  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter phase III clinical
      study. Target population is patients with recurrent/metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma who
      had not received systemic chemotherapy. Study objective is to compare the efficacy and safety
      of camrelizumab in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin with placebo in combination
      with gemcitabine and cisplatin in study population in China. camrelizumab is a humanized
      anti-PD1 IgG4 monoclonal antibody.

      In this study, eligible subject will be randomized into study arm or control arm to accept
      study treatment. Treatment cycles of chemotherapy will be at most 6 weeks which will be
      decided by investigators. Progression-free survival (PFS) determined by the Independent
      Review Committee (IRC) will be the primary outcome measures.
