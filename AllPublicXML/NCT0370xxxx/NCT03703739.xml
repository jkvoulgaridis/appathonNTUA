  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Food fortification is regarded as a safe and cost-effective approach to counteract and
      prevent iron deficiency. Rice is a staple food for millions of people living in regions where
      iron-deficiency anaemia is a significant public health problem. Therefore, rice may be a
      promising fortification vehicle. Ferric pyrophosphate (FePP) is an acceptable iron compound
      for rice fortification, due to its white colour and low reactivity with the rice matrix.
      However, iron from FePP generally has a low bioavailability. To increase the low iron
      bioavailability of FePP in fortified rice, ligands acting as solubilizing agents have been
      suggested, such as citric acid/trisodium citrate (CA/TSC), ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid
      (EDTA) and sodium pyrophosphate (NaPP).

      It is however unclear to which extent CA/TSC would enhance iron bioavailability in presence
      of phytic acid, a common inhibitor of iron absorption found in whole grains and legumes. Zinc
      oxide reduces iron bioavailability from FePP with and without CA/TSC, in contrast to Zinc
      sulphate. It is however unclear if this decrease would be also expected in presence of EDTA
      as solubilizing agent. Further, NaPP has been suggested as a solubilizing agent, enhancing
      the bioavailability from FePP in bouillon cubes. This study aim to test its effect in rice.
      Meals containing a high (bean sauce) and low (mixed vegetable) phytic acid level sauce will
      be used to simulated varying dietary backgrounds, allowing to answer the question which
      solubilizing agent is viable in enhancing iron bioavailability.
