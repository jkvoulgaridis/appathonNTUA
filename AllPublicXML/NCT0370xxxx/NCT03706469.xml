  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the oral BA of TAK-831 T3 tablet formulation relative
      to TAK-831 T2 tablet formulation under fasting conditions and to assess the effect of food on
      the pharmacokinetics (PK) of TAK-831 T3 tablet formulation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-831. TAK-831 is being tested in healthy
      participants to evaluate the relative BA and effect of food on the PK of TAK-831 tablet
      formulation.

      The study will enroll approximately 16 participants. Participants will be randomly assigned
      (by chance, like flipping a coin) to TAK-831 in 1 of the 4 treatment sequences as following:

        -  T2 50 mg Fasted + T3 50 mg Fasted + T3 600 mg Fasted + T2 600 mg Fasted + T3 600 mg Fed

        -  T3 50 mg Fasted + T2 600 mg Fasted + T2 50 mg Fasted + T3 600 mg Fasted + T3 600 mg Fed

        -  T2 600 mg Fasted + T3 600 mg Fasted + T3 50 mg Fasted + T2 50 mg Fasted + T3 600 mg Fed

        -  T3 600 mg Fasted + T2 50 mg Fasted + T2 600 mg Fasted + T3 50 mg Fasted + T3 600 mg Fed

      All participants will be asked to take tablet of assigned TAK-831 on Day 1 of each treatment
      period.

      This single center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to
      participate in this study is approximately 70 days. Participants will make multiple visits to
      the clinic and will be contacted by clinic approximately 14 days after the last dose of study
      drug for a follow-up assessment.

    <ipd_description>Takeda makes patient-level, de-identified data sets and associated documents available for all interventional studies after applicable marketing approvals and commercial availability have been received (or program is completely terminated), an opportunity for the primary publication of the research and final report development has been allowed, and other criteria have been met as set forth in Takeda's Data Sharing Policy (see www.TakedaClinicalTrials.com for details). To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias. Once approved, qualified researchers who sign a data sharing agreement are provided access to these data in a secure research environment</ipd_description>
