  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effect of cold exposure on an individual's
      glucose tolerance. Previous research has already shown that 10 days acclimation to a mild
      cold environment (14-15°C) can enhance insulin sensitivity. However, the duration in the cold
      environment was 6 hours per day which may not be practical for everyone. Therefore, the
      present study will investigate the effect of a shorter, and more intense cold exposure on an
      individual's glucose tolerance. It is hypothesised that cold exposure before consuming a
      glucose drink will enhance glucose clearance.

    <intervention_model_description>It is anticipated that 32 participants will enrol in the study. Specifically, 16 participants will be healthy individuals and the other 16 will be individuals with impaired fasting glucose (5.6 mM to 6.9 mM) and/or blood glucose values 7.8-11.0 mM 2h after glucose drink consumption during the OGTT in screening. Initially, the study will investigate the effect of the cold exposure on healthy individuals, and then depending on the results in these individuals, the intervention may be tested on participants with impaired glucose metabolism.</intervention_model_description>
