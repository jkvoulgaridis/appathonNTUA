  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is a multicenter, non-interventional, registered real-world clinical study. Based
      on available evidence and recommendations of guidelines, tumor patients with high risk of FN
      and eligible for all enrollment criteria were recruited into primary prophylaxis of
      PEG-rhG-CSF or secondary prophylaxis of PEG-rhG-CSF according to the real-world clinical
      pathway without randomization. All patients need to receive at least 2 cycles of PEG-rhG-CSF
      prophylaxis. Researchers will record the incidence of FN, RDI, FN-related hospitalization,
      antibiotic use, direct medical care and indirect medical care cost under the real clinical
      conditions, and assess the efficacy, safety and cost-effectiveness of PEG-rhG-CSF primary
      prophylaxis versus secondary prophylaxis through sub-group analysis and exploratory research.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with cancer planning for chemotherapy assessed with high risk of febrile neutropenia
      (FN) according to NCCN and ASCO guidelines are recruited, receiving primary or secondary
      prophylaxis of PEG-rhG-CSF according to real-world clinical pathway in local cancer center
      for at least 4 cycles of chemotherapy. The primary outcome is the incidence of FN rate and
      proportion of patients completing chemotherapy on schedule, the second outcomes are the
      incidence of 3-4 grade of neutropenia, FN-related hospitalization and antibiotic use,
      incidence of reduction and delay of chemotherapy dose, safety and pharmacoeconomics of
      PEG-rhG-CSF.
