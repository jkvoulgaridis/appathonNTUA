    <textblock>
      A cross sectional observation study of body composition in COPD patients consecutively
      hospitalized with acute exacerbation.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Skeletal muscle dysfunction and changes in body composition are important extra-pulmonary
      manifestations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) that occur in all stages of
      disease and are associated with poor outcome. In patients with COPD, bioelectrical impedance
      analysis (BIA) has usually been used to estimate fat-free mass (FFM) and body composition
      through predictive equations. Very few studies had focused on raw BIA data. The aim of this
      study is first describe the measurement of phase angle in patients with with acute
      exacerbation and second to determine the validity of phase angle in this group by assessing
      its relationship with established markers of function, disease severity and prognosis.

    <description>The evaluation of the phase angle will be performed by means of the electric bioimpedance apparatus. The measurements will be obtained with the patient in dorsal decubitus, barefoot, with the lower limbs slightly apart and without metal objects attached to the body, with electrodes placed on the right hand and foot.</description>

    <measure>Body Composition</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month.</time_frame>
    <description>Body composition will be assessed using bioelectrical impedance analysis (In Body 720, Biospace) at a standardized time after breakfast. Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is a simple, safe, non-invasive method to measure assess lean (e.g., muscle) vs. fat body compartments. Fat-free mass will be calculated by using disease-specific equations as described by Schols. Fat mass will then be calculated as total body weight minus fat-free mass. Such BIA measurements are accurate, comparable to other techniques used to assess body composition, and have been validated in patients with acute excerbation of COPD</description>
