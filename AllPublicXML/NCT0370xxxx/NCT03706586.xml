    <textblock>
      Preterm birth, or birth before 37 weeks' gestation, is increasingly common, occurring in 8%
      of pregnancies in Canada. Preterm birth is associated with many health complications,
      particularly when the birth happens before 29 weeks' gestation. At this gestational age, the
      lungs are not fully developed and it is not uncommon for infants to have problems breathing
      at the time of birth. One complication that can arise is when an infant stops breathing and
      needs to be resuscitated. When preterm babies need to be resuscitated doctors must take
      special care because of the small infant size and the immaturity of the brain and lungs.
      Oxygen is used to resuscitate babies who need it, but unfortunately there is disagreement
      about the best oxygen concentration to use. Oxygen concentration is important because both
      too much and too little oxygen can cause brain injury. Our research aims to fill this
      knowledge gap by participating in an international clinical trial to compare the effects of
      resuscitating babies less than 29 weeks' gestational age with either a low oxygen
      concentration or a high oxygen concentration. The oxygen concentrations have been selected
      using the best available knowledge. During the first 2 months of the clinical trial we will
      treat all babies less than 29 weeks' gestation who need resuscitation with the oxygen
      concentration we are randomly assigned. Then in the next 2 months, we will treat babies using
      the other oxygen concentration. After the trial, we will determine whether the babies
      resuscitated with low oxygen or those resuscitated with high oxygen have better survival and
      long-term health outcomes. Our research fills a critical knowledge gap in the care of
      extremely preterm babies and will impact their survival both here in Canada and
      internationally.

      Purpose: Over the last 10 years, recommendations regarding the ideal level of oxygen for
      resuscitation in preterm infants have changed from 100%, down to low levels of oxygen (&lt;30%),
      up to moderate concentration (30-65%). In addition, in 2010, oxygen saturation targeting was
      recommended as standard of care and this contributed to a change in clinical practice as
      clinicians were more likely and comfortable to start resuscitation at either 21% (room air)
      or titrated levels of oxygen such as 30-40%. When the guidelines were again revised in 2015,
      the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) acknowledged that a critical
      knowledge gap continued to exist for the resuscitation of the preterm infants &lt;37 weeks,
      highlighting the need to provide more concrete guidelines. This leaves clinicians in a
      challenging position. Despite the advances that have been achieved in perinatal and neonatal
      care, neonates are still vulnerable to the consequences of the oxidative effects from
      hyperoxia as well as the deleterious effects from hypoxia. A large, multi-centre
      international trial of sufficient sample size that is powered to look at safety outcomes such
      as mortality and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes is required to provide the necessary
      evidenced to guide clinical practice with confidence.

      Hypothesis: the null hypothesis for this study is that the incidence of mortality or abnormal
      neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18-24 months corrected age will be no different by using
      either higher initial oxygen concentration of 60% compared to using lower initial oxygen
      concentration of 30% for resuscitation of preterm infants of 23 0/7- 28 6/7 weeks gestation.

      Justification:

      The use of supplementary oxygen may be crucial, but also potentially detrimental to premature
      infants at birth. High oxygen levels may lead to organ damage through oxidative stress, while
      low oxygen levels may lead to increased mortality. Excess oxygen exposure during the early
      post-birth period is associated with many complications and morbidities of preterm birth.
      Preterm infants have lower levels of anti-oxidant pathways consistent with their expected
      fetal environment of low oxygen exposure. Excess of oxygen free-radicals in infants
      intrinsically deficient in enzymatic antioxidants and non-enzymatic antioxidants may
      contribute to these morbidities. Pulmonary oxygen toxicity, through the generation of
      reactive oxygen and nitrogen species in excess of antioxidant defenses, is believed to be a
      major contributor to the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Using lower oxygen
      concentrations at birth results in decreased oxidative stress markers and a decrease risk of
      developing BPD compared to higher oxygen concentrations. Other organs that may be damaged by
      such oxidative stress include kidneys, myocardium and the retina.

      There is equally growing evidence that using lower oxygen concentrations will lead to lower
      oxygen saturation levels and bradycardia, which may lead to increased rates of mortality in
      this vulnerable group of infants. An individual patient analysis of clinical trials reported
      that 46% of preterm infants resuscitated with initial low oxygen concentration did not reach
      SpO2 of 80% at 5 min. This was associated with increased risk of major intraventricular
      hemorrhage (IVH), and an almost five times higher risk of death in this vulnerable group of
      infants. These data provide a warning note for the use of higher vs. lower initial oxygen
      concentration during delivery room resuscitation. As we proceed in determining a safe range
      for resuscitation of ELBW/ELGA infants, it is highly likely that the optimum level of oxygen
      concentration is likely between the two extremes of 21% and 100%.

      Objectives: To determine whether initial resuscitation of preterm neonates with 60% versus
      30% oxygen results in better neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18-24 months.

      Research Method/Procedures: This will be a cluster crossover design, unmasked randomized
      controlled trial (RCT) comparing two oxygen concentrations at initiation of resuscitation.
      Infants will be placed on the resuscitation table with the initial steps of resuscitation
      carried out as per standard of care at each centre which usually follows current
      resuscitation guidelines. All centres will make every effort to establish adequate lung
      expansion using CPAP or positive pressure ventilation as needed. Enrolled infants will have a
      pulse oximeter sensor placed on the right arm in the first minute of life. Their
      resuscitation will be initiated with an oxygen concentration of 30% or 60% depending on the
      randomization sequence at the centre at the given time. Infants in the 30 % group will remain
      in 30% oxygen until 5 min of age unless the infant's heart rate (HR) remains 100/min or less
      and does not show a tendency towards progressive increase before reaching 5 min of age or
      infant needs chest compression and/or epinephrine. No alteration in oxygen concentration will
      be made for an infant who is responding to resuscitation efforts with HR progressively
      increasing as minutes go by. At 5 min of age, the clinical team will assess oxygen
      saturation. If the saturation is less than 85%, oxygen should be increased by 10-20% every 60
      sec to achieve saturations of 85% or greater or a saturation of 90-95% at 10 min of age. If
      saturations are greater than 95% at or before 5 min of age, oxygen should be decreased
      stepwise (every 60 sec) with an aim to maintain saturations of 85% or greater during 5-10 min
      of age or 90-95% at and beyond 10 min of age. The procedure for infants in the 60% group will
      be identical. The intervention duration for the trial will be the first 5 min after birth
      followed by initial monitoring/action for the next 5 min where titration in oxygen
      concentration will be made to achieve stability making a total of 10 min for study
      intervention. Titration of oxygen before 5 min after birth will only be made if the infant
      remains bradycardic (HR less than 100) and does not show a tendency towards a sustained
      increase in HR or if the oxygen saturation exceeds 95%. If the infant does not respond to
      ventilation with increasing HR in the first 5 min after birth, steps to ensure effective
      ventilation should be done before oxygen is titrated.

      Plan for Data Analysis: Generalized linear mixed model with binary outcome and maximum
      likelihood estimate will be used to evaluate the effect of an oxygen concentration on the
      primary outcome (as a composite between 18 and 24 months corrected age of all-cause mortality
      or the presence of a major neurodevelopmental outcome). To account for cluster crossover
      design of the study, effects of centers (clusters) and a period (oxygen concentration) within
      center will be considered random, and effects of a period (oxygen concentration) will be
      entered as a fixed effect. This hierarchical model allows for the correlation of patients
      within periods and within clusters. The model will be adjusted for gestational age and
      whether or not infant required mask ventilation as potential confounding variables. Similar
      generalized linear mixed models will be performed to evaluate the effect of group on
      secondary outcomes. In addition, three subgroup analysis will be performed: i) Gestational
      age will be categorized into 2 categories: 23+0- 25+6 vs. 26+0-28+6 weeks; ii) Breathing
      support will be categorized by infants supported only with CPAP vs. received mask
      ventilation; iii) Sex/Gender will be categorized into 2 categories: female vs. male. For
      subgroup analysis baseline characteristics will be compared using linear and generalized
      linear mixed models. Sensitivity analysis will be performed to analyze the missing data;
      however, a very low number of missing values are expected due to the design of the study.

    <description>At 18-24 months corrected age, the infants will be assessed using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development-3rd edition (Bayley-III). The Bayley-III has five scales: i) Cognition Scale (e.g., attention to familiar and unfamiliar objects); ii) Language Scale (e.g., understanding and expression of language); iii) Motor Scale (e.g., gross and fine motor skills); iv) Social-Emotional Scale; and v) the Adaptive Behavior Scale. A score 85-114 will be classified as normal, and scores &lt;70 (2 SD below the mean of 100) will define severe cognitive delay. Audiometry will be performed to assess the presence or absence of severe hearing loss. Blindness will be defined as a corrected visual acuity of &lt;20/200.</description>
