      This post-registration observational study is designed to monitor the safety parameters and
      efficacy of Elpida® in actual practice in the first-line treatment of HIV-1 infected patients
      on the background of the standard baseline ART.

      This study is a multicenter, open-label, post-registration observational non-interventional
      study of the use of Elpida® in the first line of therapy for HIV-1 infected patients against
      a background of standard baseline ART (NNRTIs + 2 NRTIs). The study is scheduled to be
      conducted approximately in 20 centers for the prevention and control of AIDS in Russia.

      In total, 2000 HIV-1-infected patients who are prescribed therapy with Elpida® (20 mg
      capsules) against the background of standard baseline ART are planned to be included in the
      study.

      The observational study will collect data from patients who signed informed consent and meet
      all inclusion/non-inclusion criteria from the time that precedes the therapy by Elpida® up to
      96 weeks of treatment or until early elimination. The data will be obtained through routine
      visits and procedures, including demographics and history, height, body weight, body mass
      index (BMI), laboratory data (viral load of HIV-1, CD4+-T-lymphocytes, resistance mutations
      in HIV-1, screening for hepatitis B and C, syphilis, general and biochemical blood analysis,
      general urine analysis) and instrumental examinations (electrocardiography (ECG), chest
      X-ray/fluorography). Throughout the study, patients will keep observation diaries for
      recording AEs and concomitant therapy. Data on the intake of ART drugs and AE related to
      their use will also be collected.
