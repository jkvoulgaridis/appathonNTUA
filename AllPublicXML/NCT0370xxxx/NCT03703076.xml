      Post-authorisation non-interventional observational study of patients with Primary Biliary
      Cholangitis who started Ocaliva® treatment between October 1st, 2016 and December 31, 2017.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-interventional, multi-site, ambispective, national follow-up study of patients
      with Primary Biliary Cholangitis who started Ocaliva® treatment between October 1st, 2016 and
      December 31, 2017. This represents approximately 150 patients to date, who are therefore the
      first patients to have received treatment with Ocaliva® in France outside of pre-approval
      clinical trials.

      All patients who received treatment within the context of the ATU (conditional marketing
      authorization in France) or after EU marketing authorization approval for the product will be
      followed up for 18 months (this follow-up will be partly retrospective and partly
      prospective). The study therefore involves retrospective recruitment with retrospective and
      prospective data collection.
