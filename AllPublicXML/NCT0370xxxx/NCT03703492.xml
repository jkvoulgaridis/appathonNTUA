      This prospective, one-arm study which will enroll participants with biopsy-proven DCIS
      scheduled for diagnostic breast MRI for preoperative staging/extent of disease evaluation as
      part of standard of care. Eligible participants will be consented for participation in the
      research study which includes a directed breast PET/MRI with 18F-FES. 18F-FES uptake of the
      known malignancy will be measured on the PET/MRI examination using standardized uptake values
      (SUV) and tumor-to-normal tissue ratios.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Integrated whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-positron emission tomography (PET)
      scanners have recently been introduced for clinical use. This technology combines the
      anatomic and perfusion data obtained with Dynamic Contrast Enhanced (DCE) MRI with functional
      imaging data obtained from PET. For breast imaging, the combination of MRI and PET has
      important potential to improve diagnostic accuracy and provide molecular characterization of
      breast cancer. The overall purpose of this research is to assess the analytic validity of
      simultaneous breast DCE MRI with 18F-FES PET for measuring estrogen receptor (ER) in patients
      with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and identifying patients with low-risk of disease
      recurrence. The hypothesis is that quantitative 18F-FES uptake parameters from PET/MRI will
      correlate well with the ER immunohistochemistry score and with low-risk recurrence scores.

      Primary Objective

      1) To compare quantitative 18F-FES uptake of biopsy-proven DCIS measured using PET/MRI with
      ER protein levels determined by immunohistochemistry.

      Secondary Objectives

        1. To determine the optimal cut-point 18F-FES uptake value for distinguishing between ER+
           and ER-negative DCIS

        2. To determine the test-retest reproducibility of quantitative assessment of tumor 18F-FES
           uptake

        3. To determine the optimal cut-point 18F-FES uptake value for distinguishing between
           low-risk DCIS and intermediate/high-risk DCIS

        4. To estimate the association of quantitative 18F-FES uptake (continuous SUVmax) with
           research-based Oncotype DX DCIS scores (0-100)

        5. To measure the upgrade rate to invasive cancer at surgical excision

        6. To correlate tumor 18F-FES uptake with serum estradiol and sex hormone binding globulin
           levels.

    <measure>ER immunohistochemistry score</measure>
    <time_frame>36 months</time_frame>
    <description>The reference standard ER expression will be measured with immunohistochemistry per standard of care and calculated using Allred scoring methods.
The Allred score is the sum of the proportion of positive staining tumor cells (scored 0-5 for no stain, &lt;1%, 1-10%, 10-33%, 33-66%, 66-100%, respectively) and the intensity of staining (scored 0-3 for no stain, weak, intermediate, strong, respectively). ER-negative cancers can have either an Allred score of 0 or 2 (1+1). ER-positive cancers can have an Allred score of 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8. An Allred score of 1 does not exist.</description>

    <description>Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis will be performed to determine the optimal cut-point for 18F-FES uptake to distinguish ER+ from ER-negative DCIS, as defined by the clinical pathology report. The area under the curve (AUC) for the ROCs and their respective two-sided 95% confidence intervals will be calculated using logistic regression. The optimal cut-off point will be determined by considering the 18F-FES uptake value with the maximum sensitivity and specificity.</description>

    <description>The reproducibility of the two measurements (test-retest) of 18F-FES uptake in the 5 subjects who elect to undergo a second imaging session will be assessed by intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) and its 95% confidence interval. Additionally, the coefficient of repeatability (CR) and the Bland-Altman plot will be used.</description>

    <measure>Optimal cut-point 18F-FES uptake value for distinguishing between low-risk DCIS and intermediate/high-risk DCIS</measure>
    <time_frame>36 months</time_frame>
    <description>ROC curve analysis will be performed to determine the optimal cut-point for 18F-FES SUVmax to distinguish low-risk DCIS and intermediate/high-risk DCIS. Risk categories will be determined using the Van Nuys Prognostic Index, the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center Nomogram, and the research-based Oncotype DX DCIS score. Sensitivity and specificity will be determined with two-sided 95% confidence intervals. The AUCs for the ROCs and their respective two-sided 95% confidence intervals will be calculated using logistic regression.
The optimal cut-off point will be determined by considering the 18F-FES uptake value with the maximum sensitivity and specificity.
This analysis will be done separately for each risk assessment model.</description>

    <time_frame>36 months</time_frame>
    <description>To estimate the association of quantitative 18F-FES uptake (continuous SUVmax) with research-based Oncotype DX DCIS scores (0-100), scatter plots of continuous quantitative 18F-FES uptake (SUVmax) on the y-axis and research-based Oncotype DX DCIS scores (unitless) on the x-axis will be created to explore the distribution of the measurements. Pearson's or Spearman's rank correlation will be used to evaluate the association between quantitative 18F-FES uptake and research-based Oncotype DX DCIS score. The correlation coefficient (rho) and 95% confidence interval will be reported.</description>
