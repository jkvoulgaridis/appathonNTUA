      ADCT-601 in patients with advanced solid tumors.

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 open-label, multicenter single-arm study with a dose-escalation phase (Part
      1) followed by a dose-expansion phase (Part 2). The study will enroll approximately 75
      patients. A standard 3+3 dose-escalation design will be used for Part 1 in order to determine
      the MTD and/or recommended dose for expansion (RDE).

      Part 2 will consist of 3 cohorts from one or more selected tumor types. Each cohort will
      enroll 15 patients.

      The study will include a Screening Period (of up to 28 days), a Treatment Period (cycles of
      3-6 weeks), and a Follow-up Period (visits approximately every 12 weeks for up to 2 years
      after treatment discontinuation).

         13. Failure to recover to Grade ≤1 (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE]
             version 4.0) from acute non-hematologic toxicity (Grade ≤ 2 neuropathy or alopecia)
             due to previous therapy prior to screening.

         14. Congenital long QT syndrome or a corrected QTcF interval of &gt; 480 ms at screening
             (unless secondary to pacemaker or bundle branch block).

         15. Any other significant medical illness, abnormality, or condition that would, in the
             Investigator's judgment, make the patient inappropriate for study participation or put
