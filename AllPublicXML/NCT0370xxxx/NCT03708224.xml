      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the effect of neoadjuvant atezolizumab alone or in combination with other
      immune modulating agents on T-cell infiltration in advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the
      head and neck (SCCHN). (Translational) II. To determine the impact of neo-adjuvant
      immunotherapy on surgical outcomes. (Clinical)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To associate changes in cluster of differentiation 3 (CD3) infiltration with radiographic
      response in the surgical window. (Translational) II. To describe the changes in T-cell
      subtypes and other mediators of anti-tumor immune response induced by neoadjuvant
      atezolizumab alone or in combination with other immune-modulating agents in advanced SCCHN
      patients. (Translational) III. To describe the impact of neoadjuvant, surgical, and adjuvant
      therapy on peripheral immune responses. (Translational) IV. To determine whether combined
      neo-adjuvant and adjuvant immune therapy improves 2-year relapse-free survival (RFS) in
      patients with SCCHN. (Clinical) V. To establish the safety/toxicity profile of each regimen
      in the perioperative and postoperative settings for patients with advanced SCCHN. (Clinical)

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To establish immune-competent tumor xenograft models for future research. II. To
      characterize changes in the gut microbiome associated with each therapeutic combination.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase II, multi-arm, open-label trial of perioperative atezolizumab alone
      or in combination with other immune-modulating agents in advanced SCCHN. Based on the results
      of these initial cohorts, the trial will be amended to explore other novel atezolizumab-based
      combinations (such as atezolizumab in combination with another immuno-oncology (IO) agent,
      chemotherapeutics, or a molecularly targeted agent that could potentiate the activity of
      atezolizumab). Each of these new cohorts will be tested and enrolled to in sequential,
      non-randomized fashion.

      Arm I: Patients receive atezolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes every 3 weeks for
      up to 2 courses prior to standard surgery and radiation. 16 weeks post-surgery, patients
      receive atezolizumab IV over 30-60 minutes every 3 weeks for up to 12 courses in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Arm II: Patients receive atezolizumab IV over 30-60 minutes and another immune-modulating
      agent yet to be determined, for up to 2 courses prior to standard surgery and radiation. 16
      weeks post-surgery, patients receive atezolizumab IV over 30-60 minutes every 3 weeks for up
      to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 28 days and then
      periodically for up to 2 years.
