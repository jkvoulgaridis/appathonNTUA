    <textblock>
      The goal of the project is to conduct a feasibility pilot randomized trial comparing delivery
      of a post-partum weight loss intervention via Facebook versus via in-person group sessions.
      The project will provide preliminary data needed to finalize the design of a large randomized
      trial to compare the non-inferiority and cost-effectiveness of the post-partum weight loss
      intervention delivered via Facebook versus in-person group sessions. If efficacious and
      cost-effective, the Facebook-delivered intervention leads naturally to strategies for scaling
      up for widespread impact.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Post-partum weight retention contributes to obesity for many women, increasing risk for
      cardiovascular disease and other chronic diseases and complicating future pregnancies.
      Lifestyle interventions have shown to be modestly efficacious for post-partum weight loss in
      randomized controlled trials, yet interventions with numerous visits are logistically
      challenging for many post-partum women. Innovative and efficacious treatment models for
      post-partum weight loss that fit into the busy lives of new moms are needed, and
      cost-effectiveness is critical for adoption. Facebook may be an efficient platform for
      delivering evidence-based weight loss programming to post-partum women. Delivering
      interventions via Facebook allows us to connect with post-partum women where they are, more
      fully integrating into their lives and daily routines. Investigators have developed a
      post-partum weight loss intervention based on the Diabetes Prevention Program, tailored to
      needs of post-partum women and for delivery via Facebook. Investigators will conduct a
      feasibility pilot randomized trial comparing delivery of a post-partum weight loss
      intervention via Facebook to in-person group sessions. Primary outcomes are the feasibility
      of recruitment, sustained participation, contamination, retention, and feasibility of
      assessment procedures in both treatment conditions. Weight loss will be described as an
      exploratory outcome. The project will provide preliminary data needed to finalize the design
      of a large randomized trial to compare the non-inferiority and cost-effectiveness of the
      post-partum weight loss intervention delivered via Facebook versus in-person group sessions.
      Demonstrating cost-effectiveness in addition to efficacy of our Facebook-delivered
      post-partum weight loss intervention is critical to support widespread implementation.

    <description>Women will receive the Healthy Moms intervention, a 6-month behavioral weight loss intervention, via a private (&quot;secret&quot;) Facebook group. The weight loss intervention is based on the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), an evidence-based lifestyle intervention. A study counselor will facilitate discussions about the topics posted in the Facebook group. Each participant will get an individualized calorie and physical activity goal to help them achieve a healthy weight loss of 1-2 pounds per week. Participants will be encouraged to increase physical activity to 150 minutes per week of moderate intensity activity. Participants will also be encouraged to download the MyFitnessPal app to track daily diet.</description>

    <description>Women will receive the Healthy Moms intervention, a 6-month behavioral weight loss intervention, via in-person 90-minute group sessions (weekly in months 1-4, every other week in months 5-6). The weight loss intervention is based on the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), an evidence-based lifestyle intervention. Intervention components will be introduced in the format of handouts, group discussions, and lists of existing resources. Each participant will get an individualized calorie and physical activity goal to help them achieve a healthy weight loss of 1-2 pounds per week. Participants will be encouraged to increase physical activity to 150 minutes per week of moderate intensity activity. Participants will also be encouraged to use an app such as MyFitnessPal to track daily diet.</description>

    <description>The 6-month intervention will include dietary and exercise counseling and tips to help participants meet their healthy lifestyle goals. Participants will receive personalized calorie and physical activity goals to help them achieve a healthy weight loss of 1-2 pounds per week. Participants will be encouraged to increase physical activity to 150 minutes per week of moderate intensity activity. Counselors will encourage and support participants to make a plan for incorporating regular physical activity into their lives in a way (i.e., duration per session, frequency per week) that works for that individual woman. We will encourage participants to track their diet and exercise daily. We will encourage participants to use My Fitness Pal to track their diet and activity.</description>
