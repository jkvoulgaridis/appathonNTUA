  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The NIRS sensor will be applied to the abdomen of the study population. To ensure good skin
      contact the sensor will be placed underneath the diaper. If that should not provide enough
      measurement stability, additional fixation will be given by employing aforementioned flexible
      bandage routinely employed in neonatal care. Once good skin contact is ensured, the sensor
      will measure aStO2 for up to seventy-two hours. The presence of this sensor will not disturb
      daily clinical activities or medical treatment in any way. Should good skin contact be
      endangered by movements, clinical interactions or such, the sensor will be removed and
      re-attached to the infants' abdomen as a consequence.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Preterm infants with GA less than 35 0/7 weeks

          -  Start of measurement earliest at day of life 2 for preterm infants with GA &gt;=30 0/7
             weeks and day of life 4 otherwise. The measurement will not start after day of life 5
             for all GA.

          -  Signed Informed consent of the legal representative(s) is received after being
             informed. It is sufficient, if the consent form is signed by one legal representative,
             which is in majority of cases either the mother or the father.

          -  Clinically stable condition. The clinical stability is to be reconfirmed before the
             start and checked during the measurement.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Injured, hypersensitive or bruised skin present on the belly,

          -  Existence of clinical instability at any time during the investigation leads to
             exclusion, if ordered so by the physician entrusted with the investigation,

          -  Any medical care equipment, e.g. patches, dressing, umbilical arterial or venous
             catheter, blood supply, etc., prohibiting correct placement of the sensors,

          -  Dark skin pigmentation or dense hairiness on the belly absorbing too much light in the
             near infrared region to allow for NIRS,

          -  Congenital malformations,

          -  Severe metabolic disorders,

          -  Early onset sepsis,

          -  Inability of legal representatives to understand the purpose of the clinical trial due
             to language barriers such as the insufficient ability to understand the spoken or
             written language,

          -  The treatment of newborn jaundice with light during the intended measurement time,

          -  Previous enrolment into the current study,

          -  Family members, employees and other dependent persons of the investigator,

          -  Participation in another study with investigational drug/device within the preceding
             days and during the present study which may influence aStO2.
