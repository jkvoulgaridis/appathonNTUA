    <textblock>
      Comparing time to recurrence of macular edema after an initial loading dose of at least three
      monthly anti VEGF injections (aflibercept or ranibizumab) for macular edema in BRVO.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One hundred and ten patients with macular edema (ME) secondary to BRVO are randomized (1:1)
      to treatment with intravitreal injections of aflibercept or ranibizumab. An initial loading
      dose of at least three monthly injections is given in the study eye until the ME is resolved.
      Then patients are observed at regular intervals, initially every four weeks until study
      completion. Total follow-up time is nine months from baseline to completion. If ME recurs,
      patients are treated according to a treat-and-extend algorithm.

      At every visit, visual acuity (VA) is measured with an ETDRS chart at 4 m. The fundus is
      examined by indirect ophthalmoscopy and by optical coherence tomography (OCT). Macular
      ischemia is evaluated with OCT angiography (OCT-A), visual field status with computerised
      perimetry and retinal sensitivity with microperimetry. Choroidal thickness is evaluated with
      enhanced depth imaging (EDI) OCT. Vision related quality of life (QoL) with NEI VFQ25.
