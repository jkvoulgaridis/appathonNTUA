  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT), is a non invasive wound management tool which
      develops from negative pressure being applied to the wound. This promotes healing through the
      removal of infectious materials and enhancing granulation tissue formation. NPWT eases
      debridement as well as promoting healing of different types of wounds.

    <textblock>
      Assessment of wound surface area was done by a graded plastic sheet and a metric graph paper,
      by counting the complete squares of the metric graph paper, while the wound size was done by
      using a 10 cm syringe filled with dermazin cream and filling the wound with it.

      Negative pressure device: VAC system 125mmhg (KCI negative pressure equipment).

      Wound surface area tracing tools:

        -  Sterilized transparent film.

        -  Fine tipped transparent marker.

        -  Carbon and a white A4 papers.

        -  Metric graph paper (1mmÂ²).

      Wound volume assessment procedure:

        -  Using a syringe of ten cubic centimeters filled with dermazin cream.

        -  The wound is filled with the cream

        -  The amount of cream injected into the wound was detected in cubic centimeters.
