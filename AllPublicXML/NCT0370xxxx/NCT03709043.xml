  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Drinking multiple alcoholic drinks on a single occasion (binge drinking), has many negative
      health risks but interventions to address this behavior remain limited. This double-blind,
      placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial will test whether kudzu, an herbal supplement,
      can reduce heavy alcohol use and alcohol-associated sexual behaviors among sexually-active,
      binge-drinking individuals at high risk for HIV infection.
