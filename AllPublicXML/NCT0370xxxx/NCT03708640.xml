  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will examine the effect of a mobile health text messaging platform linked to
      a digital physical activity tracker on physical activity among persons living with HIV and
      frailty.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HIV is associated with frailty, an important aging-related phenotype associated with adverse
      clinical outcomes. The investigators propose that personalized health coaching using a
      digital activity tracker with mobile health text messaging can increase physical activity in
      this population. The total duration of the intervention will be 12 weeks.

    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Medical Outcomes Study HIV Health Survey (MOS-HIV) is a brief, comprehensive measure of health-related quality of life. The 35-item questionnaire includes 10 dimensions (pain, physical, role, health perceptions, social and cognitive functioning, energy, mental health, health distress and quality of life). Each dimension is scored on a 0-100 scale (a higher score indicates better health related quality of life). An overall score is obtained through a summation of z scores from each domain.</description>
