  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a single, cross-sectional cognitive interview of FuRST 2.0, functional rating
      scale, administered to forty Huntington's Disease Gene Expansion Carriers (HDGECs) and
      potentially, their companions (the companion's participation is optional in this study). The
      scale will be tested as a patient reported outcome (PRO) in that the information will come
      directly from the HDGEC participant or the HDGEC participant together with his/her companion
      through self-report. The purpose is to identify real or potential comprehension or usage
      problems with scale items, response options, instructions and disclaimer statement, which are
      all components of the FuRST 2.0 scale. Through a structured cognitive interview with the
      HDGEC participants or the HDGEC participants together with their companions, followed by
      qualitative analysis, the final phrasing of the individual scale items, response options,
      instructions and disclaimer statement for the scale will be generated. Depending on the
      results of this study, an additional round of cognitive pre-testing may be required in a
      separate study.

        An HDGEC: Premanifest and early-manifest HDGEC who is also a participant in Enroll-HD and
        meets the protocol selection criteria for the HDGEC. HDGEC participants will be recruited
        from English speaking Enroll-HD sites.

        A Companion: A person who, in his/her opinion, has sufficient interaction and knowledge of
        the HDGEC participant's capabilities and daily activities, is acceptable to the HDGEC
        participant and the site principal investigator (site PI) or site PI's designee and meets
        the protocol selection criteria for the companion. The companion's participation is
        optional in this study.
