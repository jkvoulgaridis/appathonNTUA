  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the well-documented benefits of hydroxyurea (HU) therapy in decreasing morbidity and
      mortality in youth with Sickle cell disease (SCD), pediatric HU adherence rates range as low
      as 49% and lead to discontinuation of HU regimens in 8-20%. In addition, treatment
      non-adherence may lead to unnecessary increases in medication dosage resulting from erroneous
      assumption that a patient is non-responsive to treatment (versus non-adherent to the regimen
      as prescribed). Given the detrimental effects of non-adherence, assessment of and
      intervention for HU non-adherence is essential to improving health outcomes in the pediatric
      SCD population.

      Electronic adherence monitoring is widely considered the &quot;gold standard&quot; in objective
      adherence measurement. These monitors provide continuous, real- time records of medication
      adherence and reveal problematic behavior patterns, including underdosing, overdosing,
      delayed dosing, &quot;drug holidays,&quot; and &quot;white coat&quot; adherence. Overall, electronic adherence
      measures are considered valid, reliable, and accurate, with clear advantages over pharmacy
      refill records, physician estimates and self-report measures.

      The primary purpose of this pilot study is to determine the use of the AdhereTech as a
      feasible and valid measure of HU adherence in pediatric SCD.

      Primary Objective Estimate the association between HU adherence as measured by the AdhereTech
      device to a) caregiver-report, b) youth-report, c) lab values, d) pill- count, and e)
      Medication Possession Ratio (MPR) adherence measures Secondary Objectives Estimate the rate
      of consent to the study, the rate of AdhereTech device use, the rate of AdhereTech device
      failure, and the perceived acceptability of using the AdhereTech device, as reported by
      caregivers and youth

      The AdhereTech smart bottle is an electronic medicine dispenser with a tracking and reminder
      system connected wirelessly. The device provides real time adherence aids to the patient and
      this information is relayed to the provider. The device can sense the amount of pills
      remaining inside the bottle. This information is measured periodically and concurrently sent
      to a secure database using cellular data technology. Thus, AdhereTech bottles can be used to
      determine whether medication was removed from the bottle, the amount of medication removed,
      and the timing of removal.

      Participants ages 12.0-17.99 who are receiving HU prescribed in pill form will use the
      AdhereTech smart bottle for a two-month period. Participants and their caregivers will
      complete self-report measures of adherence at the baseline, 1 month and 2 month clinic
      visits, a Demographic questionnaire at the baseline clinic visit and an Acceptability
      questionnaire at the 1 month and 2 month clinic visits using Audio Computer-Assisted
      Self-Interviews (ACASI) on a password protected laptop.

      Lab values and clinical information will be obtained through medical records review and
      adherence information from pill counts and pharmacy records.

    <time_frame>Continuous over two months, baseline to off study</time_frame>
    <description>For each subject, we will calculate the proportion of days of opening the AdhereTech device across the two month study period (days with missing information will not be counted). Caregiver-report of their child's HU adherence will be assessed by the Medical Adherence Measure (MAM), a measure of 7-day self-reported adherence. Each subject's caregiver-reported adherence will be calculated as: [(medication reported taken [(medication reported taken ÷ medication prescribed) x 100]. We will estimate the Spearman's rank-based correlation, with 95% confidence interval, of the AdhereTech device adherence with the caregiver-report of their child's adherence.</description>
