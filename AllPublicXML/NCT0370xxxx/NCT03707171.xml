  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) can impaire cognitive function,the prevalence of Alzheimer's
      Disease(AD) in T2DM patients is 1.5 to 2.5 times higher than the general population.Cognitive
      impairment seriously affects the health and quality of life of the elderly. Prevention and
      treatment measures for cognitive decline in persons with T2DM has not been well studied.

      Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is a member of an endogenous class of incretin hormones
      synthesized in intestinal epithelial L-cells.GLP-1 enhances glucose-dependent secretion of
      insulin,inhibits glucagon secretion, slows gastric emptying and reduces food intake.
      Liraglutide is a glucagon-like peptide type 1 (GLP-1) analogue. It has been proved that
      Liraglutide can improve insulin resistance and cognitive function in AD animals. Therefore,
      it is speculated that Liraglutide may interfere with the occurrence and development of
      cognitive dysfunction in patients with T2DM. In order to confirm the effects, the
      investigators conduct an open, prospective, positive controlled study in patients with T2DM.
      The effect on BMI,waist circumference, hip circumference, waist-to-hip ratio,fasting plasma
      glucose，glycosylated hemoglobin,blood lipids and cognitive function were measured to explore
      the effects of liraglutide in patients with T2DM.

      The overall goal of this study is to explore the effects of liraglutide on the cognitive
      function in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and make further contribution to the
      improvement of cognitive function.
