  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multicentric, open-label, randomized phase 3 trial. The study will be
      conducted in select countries in Europe and South Korea sponsored by LYSARC and in Japan
      sponsored by Celgene. There will be a combined enrollment target of 86 randomized patients,
      with approximately 14 randomized patients from Japan.

      The enrollment to the randomized study will start at European sites in parallel to a safety
      run-in part in Japan. A safety run-in will be conducted to confirm the tolerability of oral
      azacitidine at doses of 100 mg and 200 mg QD in Asian patients. Once oral azacitidine at 200
      mg QD is confirmed as tolerable, Asian patients from Japan and South Korea will start to be
      randomized into the main study. Additional patients (non-randomized) are anticipated to
      enroll to the safety run-in.

             requirements

          4. Patient had local diagnosed peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTCL) with T-follicular helper
             (TFH) phenotype according to the criteria of the latest WHO classification based on a

                  PD1, ICOS and BCL6 by the tumoral cells by immunohistochemistry. Biopsy at
                  relapse or progression is not mandatory, but highly encouraged on a surgical or
                  needle core biopsy, and diagnostic tissue should be available for central
                  pathology review and for ancillary molecular studies.

             Local pathology report should be reviewed by the sponsor's medical monitor prior to
             enrollment.

          5. ECOG performance status 0 to 3

          6. Relapsed (after partial or complete response) or refractory AITL after at least one
             line of systemic therapy (there is no mandatory resting period after the previous
             treatment as long as the biochemistry and hematology labs meet the inclusion criteria
             as below.)

          7. Meet the following lab criteria:

               -  ANC ≥ 1,5 x 109/L (≥ 1 x 109/L if BM involvement by lymphoma)

               -  Platelet ≥ 75 x 109/L (≥ 50 x 109/L if BM involvement by lymphoma)

             diameter for nodal lesions and greater than 1.0 cm in the longest diameter for
             extranodal lesions. The lesion must be measurable in two perpendicular dimensions.
             Patients with only cutaneous disease will be excluded.

         10. Female patient of childbearing potential (FCBP) may participate, providing she meets
             the following conditions:

             Have two negative pregnancy tests as verified by the investigator prior to starting
             study treatment: serum pregnancy test at Screening and negative serum or urine
             pregnancy test (investigator's discretion) within 72 hours prior to starting treatment
             with study treatment (Cycle 1 Day 1). She must agree to ongoing pregnancy testing
             during the study (before beginning each subsequent cycle of treatment), and 28 days
             after the last study drug administration. This applies even if the patient practices
             complete abstinence from heterosexual contact.

             Agrees to practice true abstinence (which must be reviewed monthly and source
             documented) or agrees to the use of highly effective methods of contraception from 28
             days prior to starting study treatment, and must agree to continue using such
             precautions during study treatment (including dose interruptions) and for up to 6
             months after the last study drug administration. True abstinence is acceptable when
             this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic
             abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptomthermal, post ovulation methods) and
             withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. Cessation of contraception
             after this point should be discussed with a responsible physician.

             Agrees to abstain from breastfeeding during study participation and for at least 6
             months after the last study drug administration.

             A female of childbearing potential (FCBP) is a female who: 1) has achieved menarche at
             some point, 2) has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or 3) has
             not been naturally postmenopausal (amenorrhea following cancer therapy does not rule
             out childbearing potential) for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses
             at any time during the preceding 24 consecutive months).

         11. Male patient must either practice true abstinence from heterosexual contact (which
             must be reviewed on a monthly basis and source documented) or agrees to avoid
             fathering a child, to use highly effective methods of contraception, male condom plus
             spermicide during sexual contact with a pregnant female or a female of childbearing
             potential (even if he has undergone a successful vasectomy), from starting dose of IP
             (cycle 1 Day 1), including dose interruptions through 6 months after receipt of the
             last study drug administration.

             Furthermore, male patient must agree to not give semen or sperm during study drug
             therapy and for a period of 1 year after end of study drug therapy.

         12. For EU countries, patient covered by a social security system

        Exclusion Criteria:
