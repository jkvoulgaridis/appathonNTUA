  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aimed to investigate the effects of bimodal anodal transcranial direct current
      stimulation (tDCS) over bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) on
      psychopathological symptoms, insight, psychosocial functioning, neurocognitive function and
      heart rate variability (HRV) in schizophrenia patients
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transcranial direct current stimulation encompasses the induction of a relatively weak
      constant current flow through the cerebral cortex via scalp electrodes . Dependent on
      stimulation polarity, this results in a modulation of cortical excitability and spontaneous
      neural activity.The technique was established in the 1950s and 1960s primarily in animals. In
      these early studies it was shown that subthreshold DC stimulation increases spontaneous
      neuronal activity if the anode is placed above or within the cortex, while exposure to
      cathodal polarity results in reduced activity. This is caused by a subthreshold membrane
      depolarization by anodal and a hyperpolarization by cathodal stimulation. It was demonstrated
      in humans that the after-effects of tDCS depend on modifications of N-methyl-D-aspartate
      (NMDA) receptor-efficacy. The after-effects of tDCS are blocked by the NMDA receptor
      antagonist dextromethorphan, and prolonged by the partial NMDA receptor-agonist
      D-cycloserine. This tDCS polarity-dependent alteration of NMDA receptor function seems to be
      initiated by the respective membrane potential shift and probably by the accompanying
      cortical activity modification,because it is prevented by the sodium channel blocker
      carbamazepine. Intraneuronal calcium concentration also contributes, because calcium channel
      antagonists eliminate the excitability-enhancing after-effects of anodal tDCS. Recently,
      unimodal anodal tDCS over left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) has been found to
      improve psychopathological symptoms, cognitive deficits and insight of schizophrenia and also
      strengthen cardiac autonomic function in healthy subjects. Further studies using bimodal
      anodal tDCS over bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and prefrontal cortex are
      needed.

      Study design: randomized double-blind, sham-controlled study design.

      Participants: 60 patients having a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective were
      randomly allocated to receive 20 minutes of active 2-mA tDCS or sham stimulation twice a day
      on 5 consecutive weekdays. These participants were assessed at baseline, after intervention
      and in a three-months follow-up.

      Active or sham stimulation: The present study used bimodal anodal tDCS over bilateral
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and prefrontal cortex. One anode was placed with the
      middle of the electrode over a point midway between International 10-20 electrode positions
      F3 and Fp1 (left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and left prefrontal cortex). The other was
      located over a point midway between F4 and Fp2 (right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and left
      prefrontal cortex). An extracephalic positions were used for the reference electrodes
      (cathodes) in order to avoid confounding effects from inhibitory cathodal effects at other
      cortical sites. The reference electrodes were placed on bilateral forearms.

    <intervention_model_description>Direct current (DC) generated by a Eldith DC stimulator was bilaterally delivered through a pair of saline-soaked surface sponge electrodes (35 square centimeter). One anode was placed with the middle of the electrode over a point midway between International 10-20 electrode positions F3 and Fp1 (left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and left prefrontal cortex). The other was located over a point midway between F4 and Fp2 (right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and left prefrontal cortex). An extracephalic positions were used for the reference electrodes (cathodes) in order to avoid confounding effects from inhibitory cathodal effects at other cortical sites. The reference electrodes were placed on bilateral forearms. Stimulation was applied at an intensity of 2 milliampere (mA) (current density=1.14 A/square meter) for 20 min, twice-daily on 5 consecutive weekdays (total charge density=2736 C/square meter).</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Changes from baseline scores of Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) at the timepoint immediately after tDCS, at one month and three months after tDCS.</measure>
    <time_frame>Three months</time_frame>
    <description>A clinician-administered rating scale to measure the severity of psychopathological symptoms of the patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorder. The patient is rated from 1 to 7 on 30 different symptom items. All items scores are summed up to yield a total PANSS score, which ranges from 30 to 210. A higher score indicates greater psychopathological symptom severity. Then, five main symptom dimension subscales of PANSS can be calculated from 26 of 30 items of PANSS: positive (5 items, score 5-35) , negative (8 items, score 8-56), grandiosity/excitement (4 items, score 4-28), disorganization (5 items, score 5-35), and depression (4 items, score 4-28).</description>

    <measure>Changes from baseline scores at Personal and Social Performance scale (PSP) at the timepoint immediately after tDCS, at one month and three months after tDCS.</measure>
    <time_frame>Three months</time_frame>
    <description>A clinician-administered rating scale to measure the psychosocial functioning of the patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorder. The PSP scale measures psychosocial functioning within four domains: socially useful activities, personal and social relationships, self-care, and disturbing and aggressive behavior.The patient is rated from 1 to 6 on each item of the four domains. A higher score indicates greater psychosocial functioning in any of the four domains. The final global score is defined according to a summary instruction table. This scale provides a single, overall rating from 1 to 100, where a higher score represents better personal and social function.</description>

    <measure>Changes from baseline scores of the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) Scale of the DSM-IV at the timepoint immediately after tDCS, at one month and three months after tDCS.</measure>
    <time_frame>Three months.</time_frame>
    <description>GAF is a numeric scale used by mental health clinicians and physicians to rate subjectively the social, occupational, and psychological functioning of an individual, e.g., how well one is meeting various problems-in-living. Scores range from 100 (extremely high functioning) to 1 (severely impaired). GAF serves as a valid tool of assessing global psychosocial and occupational functioning for schizophrenia patients.</description>

    <measure>Changes from baseline scores of the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) rating scales at the timepoint immediately after tDCS, at one month and three months after tDCS.</measure>
    <time_frame>Three months.</time_frame>
    <description>Illness severity was assessed with the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) rating scales. The Clinical Global Impression - Severity scale (CGI-S) is a 7-point scale that requires the clinician to rate the severity of the patient's illness at the time of assessment, relative to the clinician's past experience with patients who have the same diagnosis. The patient is rated from 1 to 7 and a higher score indicates greater illness severity.</description>

    <measure>Changes from baseline scores of the abbreviated version of the Scale to Assess Unawareness in Mental Disorder in schizophrenia (SUMD) at the timepoint immediately after tDCS, at one month and three months after tDCS.</measure>
    <time_frame>Three months.</time_frame>
    <description>An expert-rating scale based on a patient interview to measure patients' clinical insight. The abbreviated version of SUMD comprises 9 items measuring current states of awareness as follows: (1) a mental disorder, (2) consequences of a mental disorder, (3) effects of drugs, (4) hallucinatory experiences, (5) delusional ideas, (6) disorganized thoughts, (7) blunted affect, (8) anhedonia, and (9) lack of sociability. Scores on each item range from 0 to 3. A score of 0 indicates 'not applicable'; 1, 'aware'; 2, 'somewhat aware/unaware' and 3, 'severely unaware.' Based on the 3 dimensions approach of the abbreviated version of SUMD, the scores on the items 1-3, 4-6 and 7-9 were averaged to obtain the dimension score of 'awareness of the disease', 'awareness of positive symptoms', and 'awareness of negative symptoms', respectively. All dimension scores were linearized on a 0-100 scale, with 0 and 100 indicating the lowest and highest level of unawareness, respectively.</description>

    <measure>Changes from baseline scores of the Taiwanese version of the Beck Cognitive Insight Scale (BCIS) at the timepoint immediately after tDCS and at one month after tDCS.</measure>
    <time_frame>One month.</time_frame>
    <description>Cognitive insight was measured by the Taiwanese version of the Beck Cognitive Insight Scale (BCIS), a self-reported instrument comprising 15 items.The Taiwanese BCIS is composed of 2 subscales including reflective attitude (9 items) and certain attitude (6 items). We obtained a R-C (reflective attitude minus certain attitude) index of the Taiwanese BCIS, representing the measurement of cognitive insight by subtracting the score of the certain attitude subscale from that of the reflective attitude subscale. Lower R-C index scores indicate poorer cognitive insight.</description>

    <measure>Changes from baseline scores of the Taiwanese version of the Self-Appraisal of Illness Questionnaire (SAIQ) at the timepoint immediately after tDCS and at one month after tDCS.</measure>
    <time_frame>One month.</time_frame>
    <description>The Taiwanese version of the Self-Appraisal of Illness Questionnaire (SAIQ) was used to assess attitudes toward mental illness and experience of psychiatric treatment.This self-administered tool was composed of 17 items. The patients rated the extent to which they agreed with each statement of the item by using a four-point Likert scale, ranging from 1, ''do not agree at all'', to 4, ''completely agree''. Whether the scale score is in order from least to most or from the most to least depends on the content of the item statement. The total score of SAIQ ranges from 17 to 68. This translated SAIQ comprises a three-factor explanation. The three factors correspond to worry (score 7-28), the need for treatment (score 5-20), and presence/outcome (score 5-20) subscales. Higher SAIQ subscale scores indicate more awareness of mental illness.</description>
