  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to evaluate the impact of medical yoga remotely at home with regard to
      physical function, quality of life, symptoms of anxiety and depression, biomarkers, sleep and
      cognition in people with long-term conditions. The investigators will also measure health
      care utilisation as well as satisfaction and experiences with the exercise form and
      technology used. The evaluation will be conducted in 150 people with long-term illness
      randomised to either tele-yoga or a control group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Long-term illness is common in the Swedish population, especially among older people. These
      conditions are often associated with impaired quality of life due to high physical and
      psychological symptom-burden. The investigators have in a previous study demonstrated that
      medical yoga could improve quality of life and physical function as well as reduce symptoms
      of anxiety and depression in people with heart failure. Medical Yoga is a therapeutic form of
      Kundalini Yoga with simple movements, breathing exercises and meditation. For people with
      serious long-term illness, it can be difficult to attend regular yoga-classes. In this study,
      the investigators therefore set out to develop a tele-yoga intervention and evaluate the
      impact of medical yoga remotely at home with regard to physical function, quality of life,
      symptoms of anxiety and depression, biomarkers, sleep and cognition in people with long-term
      conditions. Health care utilisation as well as satisfaction and experiences with the exercise
      form and technology used will also be assessed. The evaluation will be conducted in 150
      people with long-term illness recruited from three hospitals (one university hospital and two
      county hospital) randomised to receive either an intervention with medical yoga remotely at
      home (tele-yoga) for 12 weeks or a control group receiving individualised training to the
      same extent. The tele-yoga intervention will be provided remotely in the home via a
      videotransferred yogainstructor twice a week using a tablet and an app for individual daily
      exercise. Data will be collected at baseline, after 3 and 6 months.

      Despite evidence that physical activity improves quality of life and functional capacity and
      probably survival, it is difficult to motivate and enable elderly people with long-term
      conditions to engage in physical and menta rehabilitation. In this study, we will test
      whether a new method conveyed through a technical solution remotely can increase patients'
      activity and well-being through allowing tele-yoga at home. Can health care resources be
      reduced, financial gains can also be made.

    <intervention_model_description>The study is a single-blind parallel two-arm randomized controlled study with 1:1 distribution to intervention and control group. In total 150 persons with long-term conditions will be recruited from three hospitals and randomized to an intervention of medical yoga at home (tele-yoga) using a live videoconference link and a yoga-app on the participants tablet for 12 weeks or a control group receiving individual advice of physical activity. Data will be collected at baseline measurement, after 3 and 6 months.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Composite end-point including physical fuction, health-related quality of life and symptoms of anxiety and depression.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The composite weighed score consists of physical ability (6 min walking test), Health-realted quality of Life (EQ-5D) and symptom of anxiety and depression (HADS). Based on the change in these 3 variables, a patient can get a score between -3 and + 3 based on the increase, decrease or no change in 6 min walk test, HADS, and EQ5D. The weighted variable will be categorised as improved, deteriorated or unchanged after 3 months.</description>

    <description>The EQ-5D comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The responses generate ordinal data from 1-5 for each dimension. The EQ VAS records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale 0-100 mm, where the endpoints are labelled 'The best health you can imagine' and 'The worst health you can imagine'.</description>
