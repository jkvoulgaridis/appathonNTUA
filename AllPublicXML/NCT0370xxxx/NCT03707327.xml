      Introduction: Little is known about the effects of different cryotherapy techniques for pain
      and skin surface temperature in patients with anterior knee pain. Objective: To analyze the
      best technique of cryotherapy intervention to reduce the superficial temperature of the skin
      and pain of women with anterior pain in the knee. Methodology: The sample will be composed of
      12 participants, of the female gender, aged between 18 and 25 years old and complaint of
      anterior pain in the knee, distributed in cryotherapy groups by ice pack (CPG) (n = 6) and
      cryotherapy + compression group byGame Ready (CCGR) (n = 6). All will complete the consent
      form, the sample characterization form, the Visual Analog Pain Scale (EVA) and the
      Patellofemoral Disorders Scale (AKPS). They will then have the basal temperature of the
      anterior knee region recorded by thermographic camera and perform five repetitions of the sit
      and stand test in 30 seconds. The EVA will again respond and the temperature of the anterior
      knee region will be collected after the test. Subsequently, CPG or CCGR (randomly) will be
      applied to the anterior region of the knee for 20 minutes. Immediately after the application
      of cryotherapy, EVA will be applied and will have the skin surface temperature recorded
      immediately after, and at 10, 20, 30 and 60 minutes. Expected results: It is expected to
      establish if there is difference in pain, surface temperature and skin reheating of women
      submitted to cryotherapy by ice pack and Game Ready.

      After the contact, explanation of the study procedures and acceptance of the participants,
      the data collection will be started and performed in the teaching laboratory of the
      Physiotherapy course of the State University of Londrina.

      Initially, the demographic data of the sample (age, height, weight, limb and time of pain)
      and signature of the consent term will be collected.

      After this step, the participants should point to the Visual Analogue Scale (EVA) and the
      Patellofemoral Disorders Scale (AKPS). Before performing the cryotherapy technique, the basal
      skin temperature in the anterior region of the knee will be recorded by means of a
      thermographic camera, and the participants will be submitted to five sets of the sit and
      stand test in 30 ', with rest of one minute between them. They will then re-signal the EVA
      and the skin temperature will be retained by the camera. Finally, they will undergo the
      application of cryotherapy according to the category which has been &quot;randomized&quot;.

      The two different intervention techniques will be:

        -  Ice pack group (CPG): where the participant will have a plastic bag containing 500 grams
           of crushed ice over the anterior region of the knee, and lie flat with the lower limb
           extended and supported on the ground for 20 minutes;

        -  Group Cryotherapy + Compression by Game ReadyÂ® (CCGR): where the participant will have
           the knee joint wrapped and compressed by the equipment where temperature, compression
           and time will be controlled, maximum compression, for 20 minutes by the equipment
           itself; lie in the same manner as for the other intervention.

      Immediately thereafter, the EVA will be applied and the skin surface temperature recorded in
      the knee region, as well as 10, 20, 30 and 60 minutes thereafter.
