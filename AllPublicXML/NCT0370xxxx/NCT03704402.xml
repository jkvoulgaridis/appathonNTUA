  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In August 2017, 13 high schools in Zealand and all of Funen's 11 high schools and 6 high
      schools in Ringk√∏bing introduced new mutual alcohol policy for alcohol on study trips,
      parties, cafes and other social events.

      The background for the introduction of the alcohol policies was the aim of reducing alcohol
      intake among students and that alcohol should have a less dominant role. By setting the same
      framework, the alcohol policies aims at promoting community, responsibility and respect.

      The aim of the project is to evaluate the effects of the introduction of new mutual alcohol
      policies on students binge drinking.

      The analysis is a natural experiment that compare binge drinking among students at schools
      after the introduction of the policy with binge drinking among students a schools that did
      not introduce the policy.
