      In this study, patients of advanced gastric adenocarcinoma with failed first-line
      chemotherapy-line or advanced mismatched repair deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite
      instability-high (MSI-H) advanced solid carcinoma will be treated with HX008 combined with
      irinotecan and HX008 monotherapy There will be two cohorts in this study: Cohort 1 and Cohort
      2. For Cohort 1, advanced gastric adenocarcinoma with failed first-line chemotherapy-line
      cancer participants, who had failed or were unable to tolerate first line chemotherapy with
      platinum-based or fluorouracil regimens. For Cohort 2, advanced solid tumor participants, who
      are required to have been previously treated with at least one line of systemic standard of
      care therapy.

      Cohort 1:

      Currently, no PD-1 antibody against gastric cancer have been approved in China, and there are
      many patients with gastric cancer in China, so effective, low-toxicity and affordable
      treatment is urgently needed. This study aims to investigate the efficacy of combined
      application of recombinant human anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody (HX008) and irinotecan in
      patients with locally advanced or metastatic gastric cancer (including gastric esophageal
      junction cancer) ,thus providing a better treatment for Chinese patients with gastric
      cancer.Advanced gastric adenocarcinoma with failed first-line chemotherapy-line cancer
      participants, who had failed or were unable to tolerate first line chemotherapy with
      platinum-based or fluorouracil regimens are needed.

      Cohort 2:

      Later-line therapies after failure of standard treatments for advanced solid cancer patients
      are limited. Mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H)
      played a role of positive predictive factor, which had been documented after the
      pembrolizumab and nivolumab trial were reported, for PD-1 blockade monotherapy in patients
      with advanced solid carcinomas.

      In this study, patients with previously-treated locally-advanced or metastatic mismatched
      repair deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) advanced solid tumors will
      be treated with HX008 monotherapy.Advanced solid tumor participants, who are required to have
      been previously treated with at least one line of systemic standard of care therapy are
      needed.
