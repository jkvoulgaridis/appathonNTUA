      Phase of Investigation: First-in-human feasibility study

      Objectives: Primary objective: Demonstration that TIPS microspheres do not compromise the
      clinical condition or safety of the patient.

      Secondary objective: To demonstrate that TIPS microspheres facilitate natural healing in the
      context of perianal fistula.

      Type of Investigation: First-in-human single site, open label, feasibility study to assess
      the safety of TIPS microspheres in perianal fistulas and indicative functionality.

      Investigation design and methods: First-in-human single delivery of a bioabsorbable device to
      treat perianal fistula. A standard of care internal flap procedure performed to close the
      internal fistula opening and up to 300 mg of TIPS microspheres will be inserted into each
      perianal fistula. Participants will be assessed for healing, inflammation, abscess, sepsis,
      pain and continence by clinical assessments, blood tests, MRI and questionnaires.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TIPS microspheres are manufactured from GMP grade poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) under
      Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) conditions.

      Microspheres will be delivered into the fistula tract using the following procedure:

      i) Tract identification with special emphasis on locating the internal and external openings
      using a fistula probe.

      ii) Curettage to remove epithelium lining the tract and cleaning by irrigation with hydrogen
      peroxide and saline.

      iii) Closure of the internal opening by means of a rectoanal advancement flap. iv) Following
      device kit instructions, prepare a paste of TIPS microspheres with GranuGel.

      v) Introduction of TIPS microsphere paste by back-filling. vi) Retention of the microsphere
      paste using Comfeel adhesive hydrocolloid dressing designed to remain in place for 1 - 14
      days.

      Each subject will receive a single administration of up to 300 mg of TIPS microspheres
      implanted into the fistula tract.
