  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized by a repeated partial or complete obstruction
      of the airway that results in a intermittent hypoxia and sleep disturbance.

      A complex and reciprocal link between obesity and OSA exists. On the one hand, obesity is one
      of the main risk factors for OSA. On the other hand, OSA seems to promote obesity. The
      changes in sleep patterns that characterize OSA alter energy metabolism and promote weight
      gain. In particular, OSA is associated with metabolic disturbances, decreased physical
      activity and changes in energy expenditure resulting in weight gain. OSA is characterized by
      resistance to leptin which reduces the feeling of satiety and an increase in ghrelin levels
      which increases the feeling of hunger.

      There may be an increase in food intake, but very few studies have looked at this aspect. Our
      current knowledge is based on simple patient reports of the amount of food consumed per 24
      hours.

      First-line treatment of OSA is based on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) but this
      approach is not curative and weight loss is encouraged. CAPP could facilitate weight loss by
      restoring sleep quality. Paradoxically, recent studies show weight gain proportional to the
      duration of use of CPP. Randomized controlled trials offering apneic patients a return to
      physical activity and hygiene-dietary rules have shown an improvement in OSA after weight
      loss.

      A better understanding of the influence of OSA and its treatment on the energy balance
      through food preferences and olfacto-gustatory sensoriality is an essential prerequisite for
      personalized nutritional management. In the face of unexpected weight gain under CPP, this
      type of intervention would be all the more beneficial as OSA and obesity are public health
      problems representing two independent risk factors for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality
      with increasing incidence.

      We hypothesize that the treatment of OSA with CPAP changes food preferences in favour of
      fatty and sugary high-calorie foods.
