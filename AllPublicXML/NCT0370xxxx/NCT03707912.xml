      Purpose of the study:

      • To assess additional data of efficacy and safety of Anaferon in the treatment of acute
      respiratory viral infections.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Design: a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group randomized trial.

      The study will enroll patients of both sexes aged 18-70 years old with clinical signs of ARVI
      during the first days from the onset of the disease. After signing the patient information
      sheet and informed consent form for participation in the clinical trial, an anamnesis,
      thermometry, an objective examination are collected, the severity of symptoms of ARVI is
      assessed, concomitant therapy is recorded.

      Prior to therapy, nasopharyngeal swabs will be collected from patients for a PCR assay to
      confirm viral etiology of ARVI and to verify respiratory viruses.

      If a patient meets all inclusion criteria and does not meet any of the exclusion criteria at
      Visit 1 (Day 1), he/she will be randomized to either of the study groups: group 1 patients
      will receive Anaferon according to the scheme until the end of the study; group 2 patients
      will receive Placebo using Anaferon regimen until the end of the study.

      The study uses a patient diary (paper or electronic) where the subject should make daily
      records of axillary body temperature (using a Geratherm Classic thermometer) and symptom
      severity (Symptom Severity Score) in the morning and in the evening. Besides, antipyretic
      dosing (if applicable) and any aggravation in a patient's condition (if applicable, for
      safety evaluation/AE documentation) will also be recorded in a patient diary. An investigator
      provided instructions on filling out the diary and will help the patient to make first
      records of ARVI symptom severity and body temperature in the diary.

      A subject will be been monitored for 7 days (screening, randomization - 1 day, study therapy
      - 5 days, follow-up period - 2 days). During treatment and follow-up period two visits are
      scheduled (at home or at the study site) on days 5 (Visit 2) and day 7 (Visit 3). At Visits 2
      and 3, the investigator will perform an objective examination, document changes in the
      symptoms and concomitant medications and to check patient diaries. Treatment compliance will
      be evaluated at Visit 3.

      Subjects are allowed to take symptomatic therapy and medications for their co-morbidities in
      the course of the study, except for the medicines listed in &quot;Forbidden concomitant
      treatment&quot;.

    <description>Disease is clinically diagnosed and/or PCR confirmed. Severity of the Disease will be assessed using the &quot;Area under the curve&quot; for the Total Symptom Score (TSS). will be calculated from the rating scores obtained for each of the symptoms of ARVI (body temperature, general symptoms, and nasal/throat and chest symptoms); the subsequent data analysis will be performed by Materia Medica Holding. For the total severity index, absolute body temperatures (in degrees Celsius) will be converted to arbitrary units (or scores) using the following scale: ≤37.30С=0 points; 37.4-38.00С=1 point; 38.1-39.00С=2 points; ≥39.10С=3 points.</description>
