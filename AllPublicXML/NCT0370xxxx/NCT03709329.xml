  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Restoration of gait independence in stroke patients is one of the most important goals of
      rehabilitation therapy, and gait rehabilitation is one of the most important treatments in
      the treatment of stroke because it is a major factor affecting rehabilitation after stroke.
      In the rehabilitation of patients with post - stroke walking disorders, previous physical
      therapy was mainly manual therapy using therapist 's physical effort and walking training
      with walking aids. In recent years, however, emphasis has been placed on therapies based on
      motor learning concepts, which allow the patient to intensively train the exercise as closely
      as possible to the ultimate goal.

      The robot used for walking rehabilitation includes exoskeleton walking robot such as Lokomat速
      (Hocoma AG, Switzerland), Walkbot-G速 (P &amp; S Mechanics, Korea), MorningWalk速 (Curexo, Korea)
      According to the Systematic Review, which compares two types of robot-assisted gait treatment
      divided into end-effector type, which is not an exoskeletal type such as System速 (Rehatech,
      Switzerland) It has been reported that the percentage of patients who were able to walk
      independently when treated with a robot was higher than that of an exoskeleton-type robot.

      In this regard, in terms of acquisition of independent gait, studies on the therapeutic
      effect of the exoskeleton-type robot and the end-effector-type robot before and after the
      gait therapy were continuously performed, but 80% of the patients obtained independent gait,
      Despite the fact that many of these patients have abnormal walking, research has not yet been
      conducted. In previous studies, there was a statistically significant improvement in
      parameters of Gait speed, Cadence, and step length when compared with spatiotemporal
      parameters in training using exoskeleton robots for stroke patients. In another study, Gait
      speed and Cadence did not show a statistically significant improvement, and the effect on
      Gait speed and Cadence is still unknown. However, unlike exoskeletal robots, end-effector
      robotic gait training has been reported to improve Gait speed in most studies compared to
      conventional gait training. In addition, Cadence, Temporal symmetry ratio, Single, an
      improved side stride length, an improvement in the symmetry index of stance phase, and an
      improvement in Gait endurance.

      In this way, the end effector type robot walking training is more likely to improve walking
      quality than the exoskeleton type robot. The end-effector type robot, which is different from
      the exoskeleton type, reproduces the gait using the ankle joint to induce the movement of the
      knee joint and the hip joint. Therefore, it is possible to control the ankle joint, which is
      essential for improving the gait pattern. It is considered that the end effector type robot
      which can control the ankle joint is more likely to induce the improvement of the gait
      pattern than the existing exoskeleton type robot because it shows limitations in reproducing
      the ankle rocker motion.

      There are few studies on kinematic, kinematic, and energy consumption after robot training,
      so it is urgent to study this part. In a small retrospective open-label study, the results of
      spatiotemporal parameters and kinetic and kinematic analyzes of patients with chronic stroke
      in patients who underwent gait using an end-effector robot were compared with those of Gait
      speed, Cadence , Stride time, and stride speed, improvement of hip extension in kinematic
      analysis as a whole, and reduction of anterior tilting in pelvis. This suggests that
      robot-assisted gait training may improve the kinematic index Randomized Controlled Trial
      design is a systematic study.

      In addition, it is important to evaluate the energy expenditure and cardiorespiratory load of
      robot-assisted walking therapy for the rehabilitation of patients at risk of cardiovascular
      disease and stroke patients with impaired cardiopulmonary function. The purpose of gait
      therapy in stroke patients is to improve the efficiency of energy consumption by calibrating
      patterns of gait and asymmetry of gait movements. This is also an important issue for gait
      researchers.

      The authors reported that when using an end-effector type robot, the oxygen consumption was
      statistically significantly lower during the robot-assisted walking compared to when the
      robot was not assisted by the robot. During the walking with the exoskeleton type robot, and
      when compared to OTW (Overground treadmill walking) during ATW, there was a statistically
      significant decrease in mean oxygen consumption There was a report. However, previous
      researches did not compare the pre - treatment and post - treatment, but there is no report
      on the possibility of improvement of oxygen consumption after robot - assisted gait training.

      In this study, we divided the patients into two groups. One group was treated with 6-week
      gait training using an end-effector type robot-assisted walking device and the other group
      was treated with gait therapy for the same period of time. Six weeks after the end of the
      treatment, three-dimensional motion analysis, foot pressure analysis and energy consumption
      analysis were performed to obtain robot assisted training in terms of space time index,
      kinematics, kinematic index, dynamic EMG activation pattern, The purpose of this study was to
      investigate whether the improvement in walking performance and the energy consumption
      efficiency of walkers are more effective than the conventional walking training group.

      the three most natural walking cycles Calculate kinematical index and spatio-temporal index
      according to each gait cycle

      Dynamic EMG analysis Dynamic EMG was performed by attaching surface EMG to the skin using
      Medial GCM, Tibialis Anterior, Vastus Medialis, Rectus Femoris, Medial Hamstring, and Gluteus
      Maximus of both lower limbs using a wireless Delsys Trigno Sensor System (Delsys Inc, USA)
      Measure the signal and convert it to Root mean square (RMS). (Figure 5) EMG signal sampling
      rate: 2000 samples / sec Filter: EMG signal bandwidth 20- 450 Hz Surface electrode: Parallel
      bar electrode

      The measured EMG signals are obtained by measuring the duration and the period of activity
      according to the walking cycle and analyzing the degree of activation.

      (Fig. 6) Measure O2 cost [ml / (m / kg)] and O2 rate (ml / min / kg) The walking distance was
      measured by walking with the self-selected gait velocity while wearing K4b2 (COSMED, Italy)
      for 5 minutes in total. The walking distance was measured for 3 minutes except the first 1
      minute and the last 1 minute of oxygen consumption data for 5 minutes Using O2 rate and O2
      cost

      2-3. Foot pressure analysis The foot pressure was measured using a F-Scan system (Tekscan,
      USA) with a 0.16-mm thick, 980 force-sensing resistors (3.88 sensors per centimeter square)
      After inserting the pressure insoles, calibrate them according to the Tekscan user manual
      (Tekscan Research Software User Manual version 6.7 Rev. D, 2003) and measure them and analyze
      them as follows.
