      Evaluation of the overlap between tinnitus-related distress and symptoms of Post Traumatic
      Stress Disorder (PTSD), to identify functional covariance among resting-state networks among
      individuals with tinnitus and PTSD
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize tinnitus and PTSD symptomatically,
      neurobiologically, and causally, applying causal modeling to psychometric and neurofunctional
      data. We will enroll 30 individuals with both tinnitus and PTSD. Participants will be asked
      to complete baseline assessments of subjective tinnitus distress, PTSD, depression, and
      resting-state fMRI at baseline. Individuals with comorbid tinnitus and PTSD who are eligible
      for the study will receive 12 sessions of Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) over a 6- to
      15-week period. CPT is a trauma-focused treatment for PTSD that guides individuals on how to
      recognize and challenge thoughts that are erroneous and dysfunctional. One-month follow-up
      assessments of tinnitus-related distress, PTSD, depression, and anxiety will be conducted,
      along with resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Score on Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for the DSM-5 (CAPS-5)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Week 15</time_frame>
    <description>The CAPS-5 is structured interview that assesses the DSM-5 criteria for PTSD (Weathers et al., 2013). Each item is rated on a severity scale ranging from 0 (Absent) to 4 (Extreme/incapacitating) and combines information about frequency and intensity for each of the 20 symptoms.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Score on the PTSD Check List-5 (PCL-5)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Week 15</time_frame>
    <description>The PCL-5 (Weathers, et al., 2010) is a 20-item self-report measure update of the PCL designed to assess PTSD symptoms as defined by the DSM-5 (The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders). The PCL-5 evaluates how much participants have been bothered by PTSD symptoms in the past month (for baseline and follow up assessments) as a result of a specific life event. Each item of the PCL-5 is scored on a five point scale ranging from 0 (&quot;not at all&quot;) to 4 (&quot;extremely).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Score on the Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Week 15</time_frame>
    <description>The TFI (Henry et al., 2014) has eight subscales that address the intrusiveness of tinnitus, the sense of control the patient has, cognitive interference, sleep disturbance, auditory issues, relaxation issues, quality of life, and emotional distress related to tinnitus.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Tinnitus Acceptance Questionnaire (TAQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Week 15</time_frame>
    <description>The TAQ (Westin et al., 2008) captures the extent to which individuals accept their tinnitus, and attempts to avoid or control tinnitus, as well as a patient's ability to pursue valued life activities and meaningful goals regardless of tinnitus.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Depression Symptom Index Suicide Subscale (DSI-SS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Week 15</time_frame>
    <description>The DSI-SS (Metalsky &amp; Joiner, 1997) will be used to assess current suicidal ideation. The DSI-SS is a 4-item self-report measure of suicidal ideation that focuses on ideation, plans, perceived control over ideation, and impulses for suicide.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Week 15</time_frame>
    <description>The PHQ-9 (Kroenke, Spitzer, &amp; Williams, 2001) is a widely used and well-validated instrument for measuring the severity of depressive symptoms. It consists of 9 items that assess both affective and somatic symptoms related to depression and depressive disorders that correspond to the diagnostic criteria for Major Depressive Disorder, outlined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders- 5th Edition (DSM-V, 2013).</description>
