  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Selective cannulation is considered the most challenging step for most of endoscopic
      retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Wire-guided cannulation is the standard technique
      for initial cannulation. When meeting difficulty, double wire technique (DWT) is widely used.
      With one guidewire occupying pancreatic duct(PD) , the following cannulation of CBD with a
      sphincterome preloaded with another guidewire often becomes feasible.

      When performing DWT, a sphincterotome should enter the common duct of papilla through a small
      orifice and be placed in the left and upper direction of PD guidewire. Then another guidewire
      can be advanced into bile duct. As an advanced cannulation technique, DWT can be successfully
      performed in up to 80% of difficult patients. However, it can be technically difficult,
      especially for trainees or endoscopists without adequate experience.

      Here we planned to prospectively record the procedures of double-wire cannulation by two
      trainees without prior experience of DWT. This study aims to delinate the learning curve of
      DWT and its safety by trainees.

    <description>Initial cannulation is performed with a wire-guided sphincterotome by a trainee. If the cannulation proves difficult (cannulation time &gt;10min, cannulation attemtps &gt;5 or inadvertent PD cannulation &gt;1) and PD is inadvertently entered, DWT will be performed by one of the two trainees. If DWT fails within 5min or 5 attempts, a trainer will take over and continue the cannulation. To prevent PEP, all patients receive prophylactic PD stent and post-ERCP rectal indomethacin. Aggressive hydartion will be administrated at the discretion of endoscopists.</description>
