  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The experimental group received 15 minutes of lateral stair walking exercise and 30 minutes
      of traditional physiotherapy (strengthening exercise, balance training and gait training)
      each time.

      The measures were done by one experience physical therapist (not involve in the intervention)
      before receiving the intervention and at weeks four, eight, and twelve. It took 45 minutes
      for each subject to complete all measures each time.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For lateral stair walking training, the dynamic stair trainer features four steps. The height
      can be adjusted from 0 to 16.5 centimeters, the stair was 0.74 m in width, with each step
      being 16 cm deep and 10 cm long. The experimental group received different heights of lateral
      stair walking training according to the patients' ability. The patients went up the stairs
      with the affected leg up first and they went down stairs with the sound leg leading first.
      For safety, the subjects held a handrail during the lateral stair walking exercise. The
      control group received traditional physiotherapy (strengthening exercise, balance training
      and gait training) for 30 minutes. Both the experimental group and control group received the
      intervention once a week for 12 weeks. All the interventions were done by the same physical
      therapist.

    <description>Mycroft 3 hand-held dynamometer18: It has good reliability. Muscle strength can be measured in Newton's. It is applied in assessing the muscle strength of subjects.</description>

    <measure>The postural assessment scale for stroke patients (PASS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Both the experimental group and control group received the intervention once a week for 12 weeks.The measures were done by one experience physical therapist before receiving the intervention and at weeks four, eight, and twelve.</time_frame>
    <description>The PASS assesses balance in lying, sitting and standing positions. It was designed specifically for patients with stroke and is suitable for all individuals regardless of postural performance. Its advantage lies in the lack of ceiling effect and floor effect, and the static and dynamic balance of stroke patients can be assessed. It is rated on a scale from 0 to 3, (total score of = 36) The Higher scores indicate better balance in stroke patients.</description>

    <time_frame>Both the experimental group and control group received the intervention once a week for 12 weeks.The measures were done by one experience physical therapist before receiving the intervention and at weeks four, eight, and twelve.</time_frame>
    <description>It is an assessment scale developed from Brunnstrom stage-L/E specifically dedicated to stroke patients. It is rated on a scale from 0 to 2. It has good reliability and validity.</description>

    <measure>Barthel index for Activities of Daily Living (ADL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Both the experimental group and control group received the intervention once a week for 12 weeks.The measures were done by one experience physical therapist before receiving the intervention and at weeks four, eight, and twelve.</time_frame>
    <description>It is a basic scale for functional independence with reliability and validity, covering 10 items such as eating, transposition, personal hygiene, using the bathroom, showering, walking on flat ground, stair climbing, putting on clothes, controlling excretion, etc. The total score ranges from 0 to 100, which is the progressive scope for activities of daily living .</description>

    <measure>Timed up and go test (TUG)</measure>
    <time_frame>Both the experimental group and control group received the intervention once a week for 12 weeks.The measures were done by one experience physical therapist before receiving the intervention and at weeks four, eight, and twelve.</time_frame>
    <description>In the Timed Up and Go Test time is recorded when rising from a chair, walking three metres, turning, and walking back. It has good sensitivity and specificity (sensitivity=87%, specificity=87%), and can assess balance and motor ability. The measured time can predict the fall of stroke patients.</description>

    <time_frame>Both the experimental group and control group received the intervention once a week for 12 weeks.The measures were done by one experience physical therapist before receiving the intervention and at weeks four, eight, and twelve.</time_frame>
    <description>It has high reliability. By wearing the three-axis gyro sensor on the shoes, gait data can be collected and analyzed with a microcomputer via Bluetooth.</description>

    <measure>The Brunnstrom motor recovery stage of Lower extremity (LE):</measure>
    <time_frame>Both the experimental group and control group received the intervention once a week for 12 weeks.The measures were done by one experience physical therapist before receiving the intervention and at weeks four, eight, and twelve.</time_frame>
    <description>The motor recovery was assessed using Brunnstrom motor recovery stage tool (Brunnstrom, 1970) that classifies it into 6 stages; 1) flaccidity; 2) spasticity is developing; 3) spasticity is maximum; 4) spasticity begins to decrease and some movement combinations become available; 5) spasticity is diminishing and more difficult movement combinations can be accomplish; 6) normal. It has good reliability and validity, and can assess the motor recovery of stroke patients. It is rated on a scale from 1 to 6.</description>
