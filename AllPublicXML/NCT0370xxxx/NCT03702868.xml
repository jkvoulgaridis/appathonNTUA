    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most common cause of cancer death in women. Adjuvant chemotherapy
      significantly reduces the risk of recurrence of high-risk breast cancer. However, about 30%
      of patients still have distant metastasis or local recurrence after chemotherapy. Moreover,
      60% of patients had 3-4 degrees of adverse drug reactions during chemotherapy.

      The purpose of the study is to investigate relationship between gut microbiome and adjuvant
      chemotherapy in early breast cancer patients.

      Breast cancer is the most common cause of cancer death in women. Adjuvant chemotherapy
      significantly reduces the risk of recurrence of high-risk breast cancer. However, about 30%
      of patients still have distant metastasis or local recurrence after chemotherapy. Moreover,
      60% of patients had 3-4 degrees of adverse drug reactions during chemotherapy.

      The human gut microbiota have been considered the most important microecosystem living in
      symbiosis with the body. It is identified as a crucial determinant in cancer occurrence and
      development . Besides, Gut microbial alterations may influence the therapy efficacy and
      adverse drug event.

      We collect the fresh tail stool sample 24h before adjuvant chemotherapy and 24h after
      adjuvant chemotherapy then the composition of intestinal microbiota and subsequent short-term
      alterations are analysed by 16srRNA sequencing.The purpose of the study is to investigate
      relationship between gut microbiome and adjuvant chemotherapy in early breast cancer
      patients.
