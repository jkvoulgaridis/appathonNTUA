  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to the World Health Organization (WHO), it is estimated that by 2025 the number of
      older people in Brazil will be approximately 33.4 million and it will be the sixth population
      in absolute numbers of the elderly in the world. The aging process is often associated with
      natural health debilitation, impairment of cognitive abilities, depression, loneliness and
      decreased daily life activity. Therefore, by increasing the number of older people also
      increase the needs and demands of health systems to serve this population. Government
      programs and projects that promote health and quality of life for this group must be
      developed and researched, so that the population aging happens in a satisfactory way and with
      physical and mental health. Several researches have been done on interventions that prevent
      the symptoms of memory impairment in elderly and on delaying symptoms of Mild Cognitive
      Impairment. Studies indicate that Mindfulness-Based Interventions (IBMs) are effective in the
      treatment of depression, anxiety, stress, chronic pain and in promoting well-being to young
      people and adults, yet the field of study of these interventions with the elderly is still a
      field to be explored and deepened. This project will focus on the discussion about the
      effectiveness of the Mindfulness-Based Health Promotion Program (MBHP) in the cognitive
      functions and quality of life of the elderly, based on quantitative and qualitative analysis.
      It will be used neuropsychological test and scales to assess the level of consciousness in
      the present moment, acceptance, self-compassion, quality of life and daily life activity, as
      well as a qualitative analysis through a structured script using the word evocation method
      and interviews through focus group.

      The MBHP-elderly study is a randomized and controlled trial of older people with 3 assessment
      point (baseline, post-intervention and six-months follow up) made with a cohort study whose
      participants will be older adults patients assisted in Primary Health Care of the Center for
      Aging Studies of the Federal University of SÃ£o Paulo.

      152 Participants will be recruited from the cohort and then randomized into the following
      groups: (I) MBHP intervention group (76 participants) in which the elderly will have a weekly
      meeting of an hour and thirty minutes for eight weeks to perform the mindfulness-based
      interventions accompanied by plus four one-hour meetings through a maintenance group after
      conclusion of the program, totaling 16 hours; (II) TAU control group (76 participants) of
      elderly who will take a cognitive simulation through computers for four months, a week
      meeting, totaling 16 hours. In both groups will be applied the same assessment for data
      collection and they will be applied in the baseline, post-intervention and six-month follow
      up. The steps of the study will be conducted based on Consolidated Standards of Reporting
      Trials (CONSORT) guidelines to report clinical studies in a clear, transparent and
      comprehensive manner. The protocol is reported according to the Standard Protocol Items:
      Recommendations for Intervention Trials (SPIRIT) statement.

    <measure>World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF)</measure>
    <time_frame>51 months</time_frame>
    <description>It was developed by the World Health Organization, the instrument is a short version of WHOQOL-100 and it comprises 26 items in which two are general about quality of life and the other 24 grouped into four domains related to quality of life and general health: physical health, psychological health, social relationships and environment. It presents Likert scale answer (1 to 5 points) and it is evaluated the mean of each subscale</description>

    <measure>Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)</measure>
    <time_frame>51 months</time_frame>
    <description>It assess the cognitive function. It is a 12-items test that measure eight cognitive domains: short-term memory (delayed drawing); visuospatial abilities (cube drawing, clock drawing); executive function (trail-making test; phonemic verbal fluency; verbal abstraction); attention, concentration, working memory; language; orientation to time. The test total score is 30 points where a score greater than or equal to 26 indicates normality and less than 25 points indicates Mild Cognitive Impairment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-Compassion Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>51 months</time_frame>
    <description>To measure the level of self-compassion of the individual. The Self-Compassion Scale consists of 26 items divided into 6 subscales for self-kindness; self-judgment; mindfulness; common humanity; and isolation. The answers are given in 5 points of the Likert scale which (1) is almost never and (5) is almost always.</description>

    <measure>Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>51 months</time_frame>
    <description>it comprises 14 items that aim to identify through self-assessment the individual's perception of the frequency that the one experiences behaviors related to mindfulness (awareness to the present moment). The answers are marked on a Likert scale of 4 frequency levels: (1) Rarely; (2) Occasionally; (3) Fairly often; (4) Almost always. The total score ranges from 14 to 56 points and the higher the score the greater the mindfulness perception of the individual.</description>
