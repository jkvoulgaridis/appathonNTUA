      Study is designed to assess the efficacy and safety of memantine XR and pregabalin in
      reducing neuropathic pain in patients with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN)
      caused by prior treatment with any chemotherapy as measured by the Brief Pain Inventory-
      Short Form (BPI-SF). It will also determine the influence of these drugs on peripheral
      neuropathy-related functional status and quality of life (QOL) as measured by the EORTC
      QLQ-C30.

      Using an observational, case-only, prospective design, potential subjects will be identified
      from patients with chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) that are planning to be
      treated with memantine XR-pregabalin combination therapy. The primary objective is to assess
      the efficacy of memantine XR and pregabalin in reducing neuropathic pain as measured by the
      Brief Pain Inventory- Short Form (BPI-SF). Patients who agree to participate will be asked to
      complete study questionnaires prior to the start of their CIPN treatment and once per week
      for six weeks during their treatment. After this period, patients will be contacted once per
      month for three months to assess interval medical history, concomitant medications, and
      adverse events.

    <measure>Change in average daily pain intensity as measured by the Brief Pain Inventory- Short Form (BPI-SF)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Absolute change in the average daily pain intensity as measured by the Brief Pain Inventory- Short Form (BPI-SF) from baseline to the end of 6 weeks measured by item # 5 of Brief Pain Inventory Score (BPI-SF). The BPI assesses pain at its &quot;worst,&quot; &quot;least,&quot; &quot;average,&quot; and &quot;now&quot; (current pain). In clinical trials, the items &quot;worst&quot; and &quot;average&quot; have each been used singly to represent pain severity. A composite of the four pain items (a mean severity score) is sometimes presented as supplemental information.</description>

    <measure>Change in quality of life (QOL) as measured by European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Absolute change in the QoL measured by European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) after 6 weeks of treatment compared to baseline. The QLQ-C30 is composed of both multi-item scales and single-item measures. These include five functional scales, three symptom scales, a global health status / QoL scale, and six single items. Each of the multi-item scales includes a different set of items - no item occurs in more than one scale. All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level.</description>

    <measure>Change in the intensity of mechanical allodynia measured using qualitative sensory testing</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Absolute change in mechanical allodynia intensity after 6 weeks of treatment compared to baseline. Testing is done by touching the sensitive (neuropathic) area with a foam brush 3 times in 5 secs and asking the patient about their pain score before and after the procedure.</description>

    <measure>Change in neuropathic symptoms as measured by Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (NPSI)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Absolute change in neuropathic symptoms measured by Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (NPSI) scores after 6 weeks of treatment compared to baseline. A total intensity score can be calculated as the sum of the scores of the 10 descriptors ranging from 0 to 100. Five subscores corresponding to the mean scores of the items belonging to each of the five dimensions ranging from 0 to 10. ) is &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 is &quot;the most intense pain imaginable&quot;.</description>
