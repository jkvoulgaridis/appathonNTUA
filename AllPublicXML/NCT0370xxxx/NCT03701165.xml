      The primary outcome of this study is to aid in the final design of the DryMouth Shield and to
      assess the effect of the DryMouth Shield on snoring frequency. To accomplish this we will
      compare the frequency of snores during 1) overnight polysomnography without using the
      DryMouth Shield and 2) overnight polysomnography using the DryMouth Shield. Secondary
      outcomes of the study will include: 1) compare the difference in the volume of snores without
      and with the use of the DryMouth Shield; 2) estimate the changes in apnea hypopnea index
      without and with the use of the DryMouth Shield; 3) describe symptoms of dry mouth without
      and with the use of the DryMouth Shield 4) describe symptoms of bruxism without and with the
      use of the dry mouth shield and 5) gather patient feedback about the user experience with the
      dry mouth shield.

    <description>The DryMouth Shield provides an elastomeric, one-piece design with breath-actuated, one-way valves configured to create an air-tight seal between the teeth and lips, which effectively reduces oral venting and air leakage while also allowing air flow into the mouth by generating a high-volume, low resistance airflow during inhalation while sealing when the user exhales.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. reports of snoring that disturbed a bed partner or housemate and

          2. an objective measure of snoring such as a previous home sleep study, lab based
             polysomnography, or smart phone application with a snoring index of at least 20%

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient's with a body mass index of greater than 35 kilogram/meter squared.

          2. A history of chronic lung disease with permanently impaired lung function testing.

          3. A history of cardiovascular disease including but not limited to coronary artery
             disease or cerebrovascular disease.

          4. Current smokers.

          5. Patient's with a comorbid sleep disorder including but not limited to severe sleep
             apnea with an apnea hypopnea index of 30 events per hour, nocturnal hypoxia
             necessitating oxygen, current positive airway pressure use or restless legs syndrome

          6. Poor nasal patency in the judgment of the investigator

          7. Use of narcotics, benzodiazepines or other respiratory suppressing medication

          8. Females who are pregnant.
