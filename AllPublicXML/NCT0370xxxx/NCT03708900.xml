        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Cushing's disease of endogenous origin: Who have failed surgery (or) who are awaiting
             surgery (or) for whom surgery is not an immediate option.

          -  The diagnosis of Cushing's disease must be confirmed by each of the following:

               -  The clinical criterion of decreasing growth percentiles with increasing weight
                  (as evidenced by the presence of a contrast in height and BMI standard deviation
                  (SD) scores, defined as height standard deviation score (SDS) &lt; 0 and BMI SDS &gt;
                  0, and a strong clinical suspicion of Cushing's disease, such as photographic
                  evidence of a change in facial appearance);

               -  Abnormal low-dose (0.5 mg Q6h x 48 hours) dexamethasone suppression test, defined
                  as plasma cortisol levels &gt; 1.8 mcg/dl, at time point 48 hours after the first
                  dose of dexamethasone;

               -  Measurable morning ACTH levels, assessed before 10 am;

               -  Two 24-hour urinary free cortisol values &gt; 1.3 x ULN

               -  If the dexamethasone suppression test does not meet the above mentioned criteria,
                  the diagnosis of Cushing's disease may be confirmed by the following: Midnight
                  serum cortisol levels &gt; upper limit of normal (ULN), assessed while the patient
                  is sleeping and after pre-cannulation (OR) two samples of late night salivary
                  cortisol greater than ULN for the assay

          -  Able to swallow study drug tablets (not crushed or split)

          -  Parents or legal guardians able to provide consent/assent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with macroadenoma complicated by compressive symptoms (requiring urgent
             surgical intervention) or at high risk for compressive symptoms due to mass effect of
             tumor (concern of corticotroph tumor progression)

          -  Hypercortisolism not due to Cushing's disease

          -  Insufficient washout period from any other medication used to lower cortisol levels (5
             half-lives of any drug)

          -  Use of other investigational drugs at the time of enrollment, or within 30 days, or
             prior to completion of a wash-out duration that is at least 5 half- lives of the drug,
             at the time of enrollment, whichever is longer. Local regulations may require a longer
             wash-out period or specify other limitations for participation in an investigational
             trial, in which case they will be applicable as well.

          -  Body weight &lt;30kg

        Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion may apply.
