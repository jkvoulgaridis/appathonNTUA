    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine the safety and tolerability of single doses of
      PvP001 and PvP002, in healthy volunteers and participants with CeD in Part 1, to evaluate the
      ability of PvP001 and PvP002 to degrade gluten in healthy volunteers and to determine the
      effect of standard dose proton pump inhibitor (PPI) pretreatment on the ability of PvP001 to
      degrade gluten in healthy volunteers in Part 2, to evaluate the ability of PvP003 to degrade
      gluten in healthy volunteers in Part 3, and to determine the safety and tolerability of
      multiple doses of PvP003 600 milligram (mg), in healthy volunteers in Part 4.

      This study has four parts. Each part of the study begins with a Screening Period of up to 4
      weeks to allow for completion of screening procedures and subject scheduling. Each
      participant will be screened by means of medical history, medication review, Gastrointestinal
      Symptoms Questionnaire (GSQ), physical examination, vital signs, weight, height, laboratory
      tests, and ECG. The GSQ is being used as a separate safety monitoring tool in this study to
      ensure that all gastrointestinal complaints are reported by the participant.

      Following completion of all screening procedures, eligible participants will be enrolled in
      the study.

      Part 1 of the study in healthy participants will be completed prior to enrollment of any
      subject in Part 2 of the study. A participant enrolled in Part 1 of the study will
      participate in one of five dose Cohorts. Enrollment of healthy participants and participants
      with CeD in each of the five dose Cohorts will occur sequentially, but each of these dose
      Cohorts will be open to enrollment only after demonstration of the safety and tolerability of
      the same dose level in healthy participants. A healthy participant enrolled in Part 2 of the
      study will participate in one of three groups; within Groups 1, 2 and 3 enrollment may occur
      in parallel. A healthy participant enrolled in Part 3 of the study will participate in one of
      four groups; within Groups 1 to 4 enrollment will occur sequentially. A healthy participant
      enrolled in Part 4 of the study will participate in two cohorts; enrollment in Part 4 may
      occur in parallel with enrollment in Part 3. Each participant will be randomized to the
      treatment order. A participant may participate in only one part/group of the study.

    <ipd_description>Takeda makes patient-level, de-identified data sets and associated documents available for all interventional studies after applicable marketing approvals and commercial availability have been received (or program is completely terminated), an opportunity for the primary publication of the research and final report development has been allowed, and other criteria have been met as set forth in Takeda's Data Sharing Policy (see www.TakedaClinicalTrials.com for details). To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias. Once approved, qualified researchers who sign a data sharing agreement are provided access to these data in a secure research environment.</ipd_description>
