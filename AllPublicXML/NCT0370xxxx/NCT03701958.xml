    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, multi-center case series of per standard of care ERCP procedures
      using a nonsignificant risk single-use duodenoscope. 35-70 cases will be included at up to 10
      clinical sites. Patients who meet all eligibility criteria will be included and will have a
      clinically indicated ERCP procedure performed using the study device. Enrolled subjects will
      be followed for 7 days after their procedure.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Successful ERCP procedure</measure>
    <time_frame>Procedure success is assessed at the end of the procedure (within 24 hours on study day 1).</time_frame>
    <description>The ability to complete the ERCP procedure for the intended indication(s); outcome reported as &quot;success&quot; or &quot;failure&quot;. Examples include but are not limited to: biliary stent placement, pancreatic stent placement, sphincterotomy, and clearance of bile duct stones.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Endoscopist qualitative rating</measure>
    <time_frame>Endoscopists will rate their experience with the Exalt single-use duodenoscope immediately following the completion of the study procedure (within 24 hours on study day 1).</time_frame>
    <description>Endoscopist rating of the Exalt single-use duodenoscope compared to their past experience with marketed reusable duodenoscopes as it pertains to various design and performance related attributes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of crossover from Exalt single-use duodenoscope to reusable duodenoscope</measure>
    <time_frame>Incidence of crossover is monitored throughout the procedure (within 24 hours on study day 1).</time_frame>
    <description>The need to use a reusable duodenoscope for any task which cannot be adequately performed with the Exalt single-use duodenoscope is considered a crossover.</description>

    <measure>Evaluation of adverse events (SAEs) related to the device and/or the procedure</measure>
    <time_frame>SAEs are assessed through 7 days after the procedure.</time_frame>
