      A Randomized Study Comparing Nicotine Pharmacokinetics of Seven Electronic Cigarette Products
      and One Traditional Cigarette Across Two Delivery (10 puff and ad- libitum) Conditions, in
      Healthy Adult Smokers

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      E- cigarettes may be an acceptable alternative to traditional cigarette smoking. By utilizing
      vaporization rather than combustion, the generation and inhalation of HPHCs, smoke, and
      carbon monoxide (CO) may be reduced or avoided. This study will provide an understanding of
      the in vitro levels of nicotine obtained with use of the company's ENDS products compared to
      competitor products marketed in the United States of America (USA), and to a popular brand of
      combustible cigarette smoked in the USA.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female aged 18 to 60 years of age inclusive.

          2. BMI between 18 to 35 kg / m2 inclusive.

          3. Healthy based on medical history and screening assessments, in the opinion of the
             Investigator.

          4. Current smoker of at least 8 cigarettes per day on average.

          5. Has been smoking for at least 12 months prior to screening. Brief periods of
             non-smoking (e.g., up to ~7 consecutive days due to illness, trying to quit,
             participation in a study where smoking was prohibited) are permitted at the discretion
             of the Investigator.

          6. Able to participate, and willing to give written informed consent and comply with
             study restrictions.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Clinically relevant medical or psychiatric disorder, in the opinion of the
             Investigator.

          2. Clinically significant abnormality on screening ECG.

          3. Sustained blood pressure recordings at screening of &lt; 90 mmHg or &gt; 150 mmHg for
             systolic blood pressure, or &lt; 50 mmHg or &gt; 90 mmHg for diastolic blood pressure.

          4. Sustained resting heart rate of &gt; 100 or &lt; 40 beats per minute at screening.

          5. Positive result for urine drugs of abuse test or alcohol breath test at screening. If
             a positive urine drug test is observed, and it is believed the positive urine test is
             due to prescription drugs, the PI should obtain documentation that a) confirms the
             subject's use of the prescribed medication, and b) the prescribed medication will
             cause a false positive drug test.

          6. Clinically significant abnormality in laboratory test results at screening, in the
             opinion of the Investigator.

          7. Exposure to an investigational drug in a clinical trial within 1 month prior
             toAssessment Day 1.

          8. Blood or plasma donation of &gt; 500 mL within 1 month prior to Assessment Day 1.

          9. Positive urine pregnancy test at screening or Assessment Day 1 in female subject.

         10. Any clinically significant concomitant disease or condition that could interfere with,
             or for which the treatment of might interfere with, the conduct of the study, or that
             would, in the opinion of the investigator, pose an unacceptable risk to the subject in
             this study.
