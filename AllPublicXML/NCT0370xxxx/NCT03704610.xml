      The present study was designed to assess the efficacy of infliximab in a 2-period study :

        -  An initial period with comparison of infliximab versus placebo and allowing the
           determination of the primary criteria

        -  Then an extension period in which the 2 arms will receive infliximab (in the placebo
           group : 5 perfusions and in the experimental group 3 supplemental perfusions). Finally,
           the 2 groups will receive 5 injections of infliximab There is little evidence in the
           literature of when and how infliximab should be administered in sarcoidosis. We
           hypothesized, from our personal experience in 30 cases (18 of which were reported in a
           retrospective trial (14), that infliximab would have a very quick activity. So it
           appeared reasonable to evaluate the primary criterion at 6 weeks after initiation of the
           treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sarcoidosis is a multisystemic granulomatous disease of unknown cause . Sarcoidosis is
      chronic and progressive in 25 % of the patients. Although mediastinal lymph nodes and lung
      are the most frequently sites affected, extrathoracic localizations may occur. In particular,
      cardiac or neurological localizations are frequently associated with a chronic disease, with
      subsequent morbidity and mortality. Such patients require long term therapy to avoid organ
      dysfunction which may occur with fibrosis.

      If cyclophosphamide remains the &quot;historical&quot; treatment to treat resistant sarcoidosis, it can
      present serious adverse effects such as infections and gonadic toxicity which may be a
      problem in young people. As infliximab has demonstrated a real efficacy in resistant
      sarcoidosis, we challenged that it could be a valuable option for resistant extra-thoracic
      sarcoidosis.

      The population studied will be the patients with clinical and radiological presentation
      concordant with sarcoidosis

      This study is a phase 3, randomized, controlled, parallel group trial, designed to assess the
      efficacy of infliximab in a 2-period study :

      In the first part, patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either
      infliximab or placebo. Both patients and investigators will be blind regarding study
      treatment. Concomitantly, patients will be treated with usual care (i.e. steroids at the dose
      of 0.5 mg/kg/d with a program of tapering dose).

      In the second open-labelled part, all the patients will receive infliximab treatment,
      steroids tapering regimen and low-dose methotrexate left to the investigator choice or, in
      case of contra-indication, azathioprine.

      Finally, the 2 groups will receive 5 injections of infliximab

      Infliximab will be used at a dose of 5 mg/kg at D1,D15 then every 4 weeks because in our
      experience, extrathoracic severe localization require such dosage and may be resistant to the
      low dosage (3 mg/kg). This dosage is also the dose usually recommended for extra-thoracic
      localizations.

      Disease activity and ePOST score will be evaluated at the inclusion, W6 and after 5
      injections (2 weeks after W20 for placebo group or W14 for experimental group). Severity
      assessment score (ePOST score) will be assessed by the physician in charge of the patient.
      This score reflects the sarcoidosis activity in 17 organs and has been validated in previous
      studies.

      Remission at week 6 will be defined as: Percentage of patients who have a severity assessment
      score (ePOST score) inferior to 1 in all organs and absence of hypercalcemia at W6, whatever
      the corticosteroid dosage received.

    <masking_description>Only the two first infusions will be blinded. Treatment will be prepared by local pharmacies. The pharmacist will receive a fax with the treatment to prepare (infliximab or placebo). The placebo will be an injectable solution of 0.9% sodium chloride equivalent to the one used for infliximab reconstitution. Both treatments will be presented in an infusion bag. After reconstitution and dilution, infliximab solution is clear and limpid, similar to 0.9% sodium chloride solution.
At week 6, after evaluation of ePOST score, unblinding process will be done. All the patients will receive infliximab treatment.</masking_description>
