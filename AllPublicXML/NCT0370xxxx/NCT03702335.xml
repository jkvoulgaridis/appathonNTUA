  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As a person ages, an incidence of mental distress such as depression and anxiety increases
      while the quality of life decreases. Singapore's population is aging rapidly and older adults
      may suffer from mental distress and deteriorated quality of life. Recent evidence suggests
      that good nutrition is essential for mental health and quality of life in older adults.

      Previous research reported that provision of nutrition education and cooking workshops to
      people with mental illness for 3 months achieved healthy dietary change and improved mental
      health. This proposed study aims to further assess the effect of comprehensive dietary
      counselling on dietary quality, cardio-metabolic, mental health, sleep quality, and quality
      of life through a 24-wk parallel intervention study in Singapore older adults.

      The investigators hypothesised that older adults who receive comprehensive dietary
      counselling will improve dietary quality, cardio-metabolic health, mental health, sleep
      quality, and quality of life when compared to older adults who do not receive comprehensive
      dietary counselling.

      Fifty female Chinese older adults (aged 60+y) will be recruited with the expectation that â‰¥
      40 subjects will complete the study. This is a 24-wk parallel, single-bind, prospective study
      design with subjects randomly assigned to either receiving comprehensive dietary counselling
      (intervention group) or not receiving comprehensive dietary counselling (control group).
      Subjects in the intervention group will only receive comprehensive dietary counselling for
      first 12-wk and then they will be followed for another 12-wk without comprehensive dietary
      counselling. Subjects in the control group will be followed for 24-wk without any
      intervention. Dietary quality, mental health, sleep quality, daily physical activity and
      quality of life will be assessed and blood lipid-lipoproteins, glucose and insulin
      concentrations will be measured from the collected blood samples.
