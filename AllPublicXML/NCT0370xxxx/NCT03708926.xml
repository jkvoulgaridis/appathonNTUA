  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain is a major public health issue as the leading cause of disability globally.
      Degeneration of intervertebral disc (IVD) disorder is once source of low back pain. Current
      treatment options for low back pain secondary to degeneration of intervertebral disc include
      conservative care, steroid injections, prescription pain medications, physical therapy, or
      surgery, such as discectomy or laminectomy. Treatments focus on addressing manifested
      symptoms rather than functional causes, and symptomatic treatment of discogenic low back pain
      is less than ideal. The investigators have recently found that parathyroid hormone (PTH)
      effectively attenuates disc degeneration in aged mice. This clinical trial will test if
      3-months of daily PTH-related protein (PTHrP), abaloparatide will improve pain, function, and
      disc health in people with low back pain secondary to lumbar disc degeneration.

      The investigators will perform a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled
      proof-of-concept Phase 2 clinical trial of the effect of abaloparatide for the treatment of
      lumbar degenerative disc disease. Adults with clinically significant lumbar degenerative disc
      disease who meet inclusion and exclusion criteria and sign informed consent with be
      randomized in a 2:1 ratio to study drug:placebo.

      The study team physicians will review pertinent laboratory data, medication history, and
      problem lists in the potential research participant's medical record to ensure eligibility
      for the study. The investigators will also contact the potential research participants by
      telephone to explain the study in further detail and elicit information not available in the
      medical record that would affect the potential participant's eligibility to participate in
      the study.

      Potential research participants who meet the study criteria and are interested in
      participating in the study will have an appointment arranged at the Johns Hopkins Orthopedic
      Clinic. At the study visit, a study team physician and research coordinator will review the
      study and consent the research participants.

      Research participants who provide informed consent will have age, sex, and ethnicity
      recorded, undergo a focused history and physical exam, and have any necessary blood samples
      collected for inclusion/exclusion criteria. The focused history will include the age of onset
      of symptoms, age at diagnosis of degenerative disc disease, mechanism of injury, treatments
      utilized, and the research participant's current perception of his or her disease control.
      The focused physical exam will include inspection and palpation of the affected sites to
      assess for pain and mobility of the spine. Research participants will be asked to rate
      current pain attributed to degenerative disc disease on a Likert scale pain level and asked
      to fill out the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement
      Information System (PROMIS-29) and have spinal x-rays and an MRI of the lumbar spine
      obtained.

      One hundred nine people who meet the study criteria and provide informed consent will be
      randomly assigned to 2 groups (abaloparatide:placebo) in a 2:1 fashion (n=73 abaloparatide;
      36 placebo).

      Participants will be taught how to self-administer a injection of the study drug.
      Participants and the study doctor will not know if the participant is receiving abaloparatide
      or placebo as the study drug. Participants will inject the study drug daily for 3 months.

      Blood and urine samples will be collected 2 weeks after study initiation to evaluate clinical
      safety.

      Physical exams, health questionnaires, and MRI scans will be performed at 3-, 6-, and
      12-month follow-up visits.

      The trial will be blinded for all the investigators acquiring and analyzing the data.

    <measure>Percentage of participants with improvement in symptomatic or radiographic symptoms as indicated by composite score aggregated from the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and Pfirrmann grading system</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Composite score will be graded as a score of 0, 1 or 2, whereas:
0 (no improvement) = less than 15 point score improvement on Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and less than 1 grade improvement on Pfirrmann grading system.
1 (some improvement - symptomatic or radiographic) = 15 point or greater improvement on ODI score OR at least 1 grade improvement on Pfirrmann grading system.
2 (definite improvement) = 15 point or greater improvement on ODI score AND 1 grade or greater improvement on Pfirrmann grading system.
ODI is scored on a scale of 0-100 with higher scores indicating worse disability. A decrease in ODI of 15 points is considered a clinically (symptomatic) meaningful improvement by the FDA. The modified Pfirrmann Grading system is an MRI based score (radiographic) of disc degeneration on a scale of 1-8, with higher scores indicating more severe degeneration, such that improvement is by decreasing score.</description>
