  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the benefits of using the iSage app for basal
      insulin titration and support. By doing this study the investigators hope to learn whether
      the app improves the participant's ability to follow his/her healthcare provider's
      instructions to adjust his/her insulin doses.

    <measure>Diabetes Quality of Life Survey (DQOL)</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will compare DQOL scores from baseline to day 90. The 15-item DQOL Brief Clinical Inventory provides a total health-related quality of life score that predicts self-reported diabetes care behaviors and satisfaction with diabetes control as effectively as the full version of the instrument. Items are scored on a 5-point Likert scale and are of two general formats. One format asks about the frequency of negative impact of diabetes itself or of the diabetes treatment (i.e., &quot;How often do you worry about whether you will pass out?&quot;) and provides response options from 1 (never) to 5 (all the time). The second format asks about satisfaction with treatment and quality of life (i.e., &quot;How satisfied are you with the time you spend exercising?&quot;) and is scored from 1 (very satisfied) to 5 (very dissatisfied). Higher scores are negatively valanced, indicating problem frequency or dissatisfaction.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Insulin Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (ITSQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will compare ITSQ scores from baseline to day 90. The 22-item ITSQ is applicable to a wide variety of insulin therapies, and measures insulin treatment satisfaction assessing regimen inconvenience, lifestyle flexibility, glycemic control, hypoglycemic control, and satisfaction with the insulin delivery device. The response scale is ordinal, ranging from 1 (extremely satisfied) to 6 (extremely dissatisfied). The ITSQ is scored among 5 content clusters, forming a total ITSQ score between 0% to 100%, where 100% indicates complete satisfaction with insulin treatment.</description>

    <measure>iSage Product Satisfaction Survey (iSage group only)</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will assess iSage app ease of use and satisfaction. Survey consists of 3 items. Answer choices range from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).</description>
