  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-blinded randomized controlled non-inferiority trial designed to assess the
      efficacy and role of teledermatology visits in the treatment of patients with severe acne
      starting isotretinoin. Males and females 16 years or older will be randomized to either the
      control arm (monthly office visits during treatment weeks 8-20) or treatment arm
      (teledermatology visits during treatment weeks 8-20). The primary outcome is the change in
      total inflammatory lesion count. Secondary outcomes include changes in acne severity based on
      the Leeds scale, patient satisfaction, acne severity as perceived by the patient, cost and
      time-lost to patients and families, need for interim and unexpected urgent appointments,
      adverse medication effects. The investigators are hypothesizing that patients randomized to
      the treatment arm will have no statistically significant difference in total inflammatory
      lesion count or acne severity than the control arm. The investigators also hypothesize that
      adverse events will be equivalent in both groups and the treatment arm will report less cost
      associated with visits.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The role of telemedicine in dermatology is ever-expanding. Currently, teledermatology has
      been shown to be advantageous in disease processes that require frequent office follow-up
      visits such as psoriasis. In 2010, Watkins et al. demonstrated that teledermatology was
      effective in treating patients 16 years and older with moderate acne and demonstrated
      equivocal clinical outcomes as traditional office visits along with equivocal patient and
      provider satisfaction scores. More recently, Fruhauf et al. conducted a small study examining
      patients with severe acne on isotretinoin and found similar results in terms of safety and
      efficacy. Patients with severe acne on isotretinoin therapy currently are scheduled for
      monthly office visits in the dermatology clinic for at least six consecutive months during
      which time the severity of their acne is assessed by a dermatologist and dose adjustments are
      made accordingly. Patients are also required to get monthly laboratory studies immediately
      before, during, or after their visit, and this must be reviewed by the provider prior to
      prescription renewal according to iPledge guidelines. Given the fact that this medication is
      typically prescribed to teenagers or young adults, the high frequency of office visits put a
      significant burden on both patients and their families and results in unnecessary time missed
      from work or school.

    <description>Lesion counting involves counting the number of inflammatory lesions on the face, chest, or back. This excludes comedonal acne.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in acne severity</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Leeds scale will be used to assess patients' acne, which examines the extent of inflammation, range and size of inflamed lesions, and associated erythema. The Leeds technique is a counting system for detailed work in therapeutic trials. A scale of 0 (no acne) to 10 (most severe) is used for grading.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This will be assessed by having the patient fill out a survey about how much time they missed and costs they may have incurred to go to the appointment. They will also be asked questions about how they feel their acne has affected their lives.</description>

    <description>Patients in the treatment arm will have monthly office visits for weeks 0-4 and then have monthly teledermatology visits during weeks 8-20 with a final office visit at week 24. Standardized baseline photographs including 3 facial images (front, left, and right) as well as 2 truncal images of the chest and back (if affected) will be taken in the office at treatment week 0 and 24 for all patients. All patients will be required to take photos in front of a white wall to facilitate blinding.</description>

    <description>Patients in the control arm will have the same series of photographs taken at each monthly visit. These patients will also be required to fill out a monthly survey assessing acne severity, quality of life, cost of attending appointment, time missed from school/work, satisfaction with treatment (only to be reviewed by study staff) and will be screened for adverse events by their provider. Every patient will be counseled about isotretinoin and contraception (if applicable) by their provider in order to adhere with iPledge requirements. All photographs will be uploaded into the patient's medical record. The physician will be required to document a progress note in the electronic medical record after each visit as per standard hospital protocol.</description>

  <intervention>

    <intervention_name>Teledermatology visits</intervention_name>
    <description>Patients in the treatment arm will be taught by study staff how to take the standardized photos of themselves at treatment week 4 (prior to initiation of teledermatology visits). For patients in the treatment arm, the teledermatology visits will be managed by the study staff. A monthly teledermatology visit will consist of sending facial and truncal (if affected) clinical images to a the study staff using Patient Gateway. Once this is completed, the patient and a member of the study staff will have a scheduled telephone appointment during which the provider will screen for any adverse events and will provide counseling as outlined in iPledge guidelines. The patient will also be asked to verbally complete a monthly survey assessing acne severity, quality of life, cost attributable to the appointment, time missed from school/work, satisfaction with treatment. All photographs will be uploaded in LMR/EPIC in the patient's medical record.</description>
