      This pilot study is designed to evaluate the diagnostic ability of a novel APD for auricular
      point detection among patients with menstrual migraine (MMG), as compared with an already
      commercialized device. The investigators will test if the novel APD could provide a more
      reliable and quantifiable diagnosis of MMG-related auricular point than traditional devices
      currently available in the market; The study will also use the APD device to test whether the
      cutaneous electrical impedance detected from the corresponding auricular points by the novel
      device is the lowest in the reproductive organ and facial area in the MMG population. As a
      pilot study, 12 patients with MMG will be recruited from the School of Chinese Medicine, the
      University of Hong Kong. 12 healthy subjects will be recruited from the university community.
      Auricular acupoint detection will be accomplished with the new device and a control device.
      The electrical impedance will be measured and recorded. Patient's condition will also be
      evaluated by the visual analogue scale (VAS) and the Modified New England Center of Headache
      (NECH) headache calendar. The specificity and sensitivity of the auricular point detection by
      the APD device will be calculated. Cohen's kappa coefficient (Îº) will be used to test the
      inter-methods reliability, test-retest reliability, and inter-tester reliability. Moreover,
      the Pearson Correlation Coefficient will be used to test the correlation between the
      electrical impedance of the auricular point and the pain intensity score.

    <description>The Modified New England Center of Headache (NECH) headache calendar is a pain diary that can be used to record the time, frequency, intensity and relief of migraine attacks in a month. It employs a 0-10 numeric rating scale (NRS) to quantify the pain intensity of migraine. The frequency and the average pain intensity of menstrual migraine is calculated.</description>
