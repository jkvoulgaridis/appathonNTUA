  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized pilot study of a device (smartphone app) that poses non-significant risk to
      participants and is exempt from Investigational Device Exemption regulations [21 Code of
      Federal Regulations 812.2(c)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To test the feasibility/acceptability and efficacy of a minimum viable product (MVP) of a
      smartphone app for patients with alcohol use disorder who are in active treatment and
      recovery to perform self-tracking of their recovery behavior (e.g., abstinence) and focus on
      their motivation to maintain their desired health behaviors (i.e., abstinence).

    <description>The pilot efficacy study will utilize alcohol abstinence at each assessment time point as the primary outcome.

    <description>The study will test the feasibility/acceptability and efficacy of DynamiCare Rewards™. DynamiCare Rewards is an iOS/Android app which automates Contingency Management (CM) to help the patient self-monitor and focus attention on his/her behavioral goals (i.e., abstinence) for alcohol or other substance use disorders.</description>

    <description>Participants assigned to the DynamiCare Rewards group will receive the following:
App on their smartphone
Substance Testing Devices: BACTrack Mobile Pro - submits BAC results directly to smartphone via Bluetooth and Saliva Test Kits.
Next Step debit card to receive financial incentives
Participant will be prompted via the app to conduct breathalyzer/saliva tests, using the devices camera to take &quot;selfie&quot; photo/videos to prevent cheating.
Negative tests result in participant receiving electronic virtual &quot;coins&quot;, which can be transferred from reserve account (reserve account inaccessible to participant) to the spendable Next Step debit card.
The amount of coins and funds are available on a progressive variable reward schedule.</description>
