  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study the effects of different exercise modes on total and regional adiposity variation in
      subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue (VAT and SAT). The investigators hypothesize that
      total abdominal will improve for all the exercise groups compared to the control group. When
      comparing intervention groups: 1) no differences on the degree of improvement in total
      abdominal fat depots (VAT and SAT) 2) different degree of change when comparing specific
      sections at VAT and SAT are expected.

    <description>Resistance training will consist of 3 whole body circuits per week for 3 weeks lasting approximately 1 hour per session. All major muscle groups will be involved (leg press, bent-over-row, bench press, back squat, dumbbell jump squats, dead-lifts, and weighted abdominal crunches). Each participant will go through each circuit three times with 30 seconds between each exercise and 2 minutes between each set.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Aerobic interval training will consist of 3 sessions/week for 3 weeks for approximately 45-50 minutes per session depending on exercise energy expenditure. There will be two periods of intervals. The first period will be 3 minutes of high-intensity activity and the second period will be reduced to moderate-intensity for 2 minutes. The speed/incline will change depending on the participants perception or Borg's rating of perceived exertion. Intensity will be measured using Lactate levels after each session.</description>
