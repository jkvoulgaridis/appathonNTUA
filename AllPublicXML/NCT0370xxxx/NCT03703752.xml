      Researchers retrospectively reviewed patients with internal hernia that confirmed by surgical
      exploration between Feb. 2012 and Feb. 2018. and analysis the Medical records and MDCT images
      to investigate the clinical and radiological features of internal hernia.

      51 Patients with definite diagnosis of IH during surgical exploration from Feb. 2012 to Feb.
      2018 in our hospital were included in this research. Medical records including MDCT images
      and intra-operative findings were collected retrospectively. The CT features of different
      subgroups were also evaluated.

    <description>MDCT features of IH were assessed for the following findings: (1) Demonstration of bowels dislocation in IH: dislocated cluster of the intestinal segments; crowding or convergence of mesenteric vessels; (2) Demonstration of obstruction or ischemia: bowel wall thickening or abnormal enhancement; dilated bowels with abnormal free fluid; twisted bowels with swirl sign of vessels. (3) Demonstration of specific signs: hernial orifice and closed-loop of intestine; fat notch sign.</description>
