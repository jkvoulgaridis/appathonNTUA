  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung adenocarcinoma with inactive LKB1 has emerged as a particularly aggressive form of lung
      cancer, with poor response to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Recent preclinical evidences have
      demonstrated that LKB1-inactive lung adenocarcinoma is characterized by specific metabolic
      vulnerabilities, which make it hypersensitive to energetic crisis. For instance, by
      inhibiting mitochondrial metabolism and reducing ATP availability to cancer cells, the
      antidiabetic compound metformin has anticancer activity and prevents acquired resistance to
      cisplatin in lung adenocarcinoma with inactive LKB1. Similarly to metformin, glucose
      starvation, which can be recapitulated in vivo by cyclic fasting or fasting-mimicking diet
      (FMD), can cause metabolic crisis in these neoplasms. In this trial, the investigators will
      assess for the first time the efficacy of combining standard-of-care platinum-based
      chemotherapy with metformin plus/minus FMD in patients with LKB1-inactive, advanced lung
      adenocarcinoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is one of the most common malignancies and tumor-related causes of death
      worldwide. In the last years, significant advances have occurred in the treatment of non
      small cell lung cancer, in particular for the population of patients with a driver genetic
      mutation like EGFR, ALK or ROS1. For the remaining cases, the main novelty has been
      represented by immunotherapy, with anti-PD1/PDL1 agents having demonstrated a benefit over
      previous standard of care treatments, consisting platinum-based chemotherapy in first line
      and docetaxel in second line. Nonetheless, not all these patients are amenable to first-line
      immunotherapy, as only tumors expressing high PD-L1 levels seem to respond to these
      treatments. Lung adenocarcinoma with LKB1 mutations or macro/micro deletions has a
      particularly aggressive behavior and seems to be resistant to the effects of immunotherapy.
      Indeed, such a population appears to be disadvantaged as regards therapeutic options and
      requires the development of different approaches. LKB1 is involved in intracellular pathways
      that are crucial in the regulation of cancer cell metabolism. Metabolic reprogramming is a
      key step in tumorigenesis and several metabolic pathways, including glucose uptake and
      utilization, or lipid biosynthesis and utilization, are deregulated in cancer cells compared
      to their normal counterpart. Cells with hypo-active or inactive LKB1 are peculiar in that
      they show an exquisite vulnerability to energetic deprivation. Indeed, they are unable to
      survive when exposed to nutrient deprivation or drugs that affect cancer cell bioenergetics
      or specific metabolic processes. In particular, the class of drugs known as biguanides, which
      include the antidiabetic compound metformin, are able to inhibit mitochondrial metabolism and
      to reduce the intracellular concentration of ATP. Based on the well known effects of
      metformin on cancer cell metabolism, as well as of preclinical evidence that demonstrate a
      synergism between cisplatin and metformin in lung cancer cell lines and animal models with
      LKB1 inactivation, the investigators hypothesize that combining standard platinum-based
      chemotherapy with metformin, with or without a low-calorie, low-carbohydrate, low-protein
      diet, also known as Fasting Mimicking Diet (FMD), may improve the efficacy of chemotherapy
      alone for the treatment of patients with LKB1-inactive lung adenocarcinoma.

      To test this hypothesis, the investigators will perform an open label, randomized, phase II
      trial in which patients with advanced LKB1-inactive NSCLC will be randomized in a 1:1 way to
      receive standard-of-care platinum-pemetrexed chemotherapy plus metformin without (arm A) or
      with (Arm B) cyclic FMD, The primary study objective is to demonstrate that the experimental
      treatment (armA plus arm B) improves median PFS from 7.6 months (historical control) to 12
      months. Secondary study objectives will be to investigate the impact of the experimental
      treatment on overall survival, objective response rate, adverse events, systemic metabolic
      parameters (plasma glucose, amino acids, lipid profile).
