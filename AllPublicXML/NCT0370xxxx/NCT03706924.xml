    <textblock>
      Open-label, randomized, parallel-group, comparative study of pharmacokinetics and
      bioequivalence of VM-1500FDC (elsulfavirine/emtricitabine/tenofovir fixed-dose combination)
      and Elpida® with Truvada® (emtricitabine/tenofovir) co-administered by healthy male subjects.
      The study will also assess safety profile of study drugs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study assesses PK and bioequivalence of the developed new drug VM-1500FDC - a fixed
      combination of three active substances: elsulfavirine (NNRTI), emtricitabine (NRTI) and
      tenofovir (NRTI) to Elpida® and Truvada® co-administered. The combination is intended for
      once daily administration (1 tablet) for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adult patients.
      Thus, the purpose of this combination is to simplify the dosage regimen and improve patient
      compliance
