  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a global, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, stratified, vehicle-controlled study
      of the efficacy and safety of Patidegib Topical Gel, 2%, applied topically twice daily to the
      face of adult participants with Gorlin syndrome. Participants will be required to apply the
      investigational product for 12 months. The primary endpoint is a comparison between the two
      treatment arms of the number of new surgically eligible BCCs (nSEBs) that develop over the 12
      month period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An open-label, extension safety and tolerability study is planned for at least 12 months
      duration following the end of this study. All participants who complete the Month 12 Exit
      Visit having demonstrated adequate compliance with application of the Investigational Product
      (IP) without major Protocol Deviations (PDs) during the study will be eligible for
      participation in the extension study.

      All participants will be contacted by phone approximately 30 days following the Exit or
      Discontinuation Visit to determine if the participant has experienced any new adverse events
      (AEs)/serious AEs (SAEs) since discontinuation/completion of study treatment.

             allowed. Participant will be encouraged to use their preferred sunscreen with a sun

             to use complete abstinence from sexual intercourse and/or she and her partner must be

          8. If the participant is a male with a female sex partner who is a WOCBP, the participant
             must be willing to use condoms, even after a vasectomy, starting prior to Baseline,

             recommendations made only by the Investigator.

         10. The participant is willing to forego treatment of facial BCCs with anything other than
             the study IP except when the Investigator believes that delay of treatment of a facial
             BCC potentially might compromise the health of the subject. During the trial the only
             allowed form of treatment is surgical. Non-facial BCCs may be removed at the
             discretion of the Investigator or Primary Skin Care Physician (PSCP).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject has previously participated in a clinical trial evaluating patidegib
             topical gel.

          2. The participant has used topical treatment to the face or systemic therapies that
             might interfere with the evaluation of the study IP. Among these are use of the
             following:

               1. 5-fluorouracil, imiquimod, diclofenac, or Ingenol mebutate (except as topical
                  treatment to discrete non-facial BCCs) systemically or topically to the skin
                  within the 2 months prior to the Screening Visit.

               2. Systemic chemotherapy within 1 year prior to the Screening Visit.

               3. Known inhibitors of the Hedgehog signaling pathway (such as vismodegib,
                  sonidegib, itraconazole) topically or systemically within 3 months prior to the
                  Screening Visit.

               4. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) except to localized non-facial, individual BCCs within
                  2 months prior to the Screening Visit.

          3. The participant is known to have a hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients in the
             study medication formulation.

          4. The participant is unable or unwilling to make a good faith effort to return to the
             study site for all study visits and tests.

          5. The participant has uncontrolled systemic disease.

          6. The participant has been treated for invasive cancer within the past 5 years excluding
             non-melanoma skin cancer, Stage I cervical cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ of the
             breast, or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) Stage 0.

          7. The participant has current, recent (within five half-lives of the experimental drug
             or if half-life not known, within the past 6 months prior to the Screening Visit), or
             planned participation in an experimental drug study while enrolled in this study.

          8. The participant is a WOCBP who is unwilling or unable to comply with pregnancy
             prevention measures.

          9. The participant is pregnant or breastfeeding.

         10. The participant has any condition or situation which, in the Investigator's opinion,
             may put the subject at significant risk, could confound the study results, or could
             interfere significantly with the subject's participation in the study. This may
             include a history of other skin conditions (such as severe facial eczema) or diseases,
             metabolic dysfunction, physical examination findings, or clinical laboratory findings
             giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that contraindicates use of an
             investigational drug or that might affect interpretation of the results of the study
             or render the participant at high risk from treatment complications.
