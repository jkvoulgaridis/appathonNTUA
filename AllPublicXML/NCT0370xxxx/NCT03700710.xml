  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) hypertension
      guidelines recommend lifestyle modification for patients with blood pressure &gt;= 130/80 mmHg.
      While eating a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-type diet, increasing physical
      activity, and weight loss have been shown to reduce blood pressure, limited resources are
      available in the primary care setting to help patients make these changes.

      In this study, the investigators will compare the efficacy of a self-guided vs. dietitian-led
      approach using web-based lifestyle modification tools to reduce weight, improve dietary
      quality, and lower blood pressure in overweight/obese adults with elevated blood pressure on
      0 or 1 blood pressure medication.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Goals that all participants will be instructed to target include: 1) weight loss &gt;=3% at 3
      months; 2) consume a healthier dietary pattern (high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains,
      low-fat dairy, vegetable/fish/poultry sources of protein, healthier sources of fat, and avoid
      sugar and salt); 3) reduce sodium intake to &lt;2300 mg/d; 4) at least 180 min/wk of
      moderate-intensity physical activity.
