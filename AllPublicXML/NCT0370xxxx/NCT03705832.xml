  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study to study whether there are
      potential benefits of consuming ginger by individuals with asthma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Presently an estimated 25.9 million Americans suffer from asthma and over half have at least
      one asthma attack per year. Recent studies found that 60% of moderate asthmatics and 70% of
      severe asthmatics report using complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) to self-treat
      their asthma symptoms.The exact mechanism of action of these agents is unclear but may
      involve attenuation of allergic response, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, and/or
      direct effects on airway smooth muscle which are responsible for airway narrowing in asthma.

      Studies done in mouse models of asthma and directly on airway smooth muscle cells demonstrate
      that ginger blocks one of the critical inflammatory pathways in asthma and thus leads to
      reduced airway inflammation and relaxation of airway smooth muscle. Clinical trials with
      chronic oral ginger therapy in humans have demonstrated safe consumption of 2 grams per day
      for 28 days with demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects in colon cancer and inflammatory
      bowel diseases. Thus, the investigators hypothesize that oral ginger at a dose of 2 grams per
      day will reduce airway inflammation and will reduce serum levels of asthma related
      inflammatory markers.

    <description>A methacholine challenge test is a medical test used to assist in the diagnosis of asthma. The patient breathes in nebulized methacholine at gradually increasing doubling doses, starting with diluent only. Methacholine provokes bronchoconstriction, or narrowing of the airways via M3 receptors. The degree of narrowing can then be quantified by spirometry which is performed after inhalation of each dose. Methacholine provocation concentration (PC)20 values will be used to measure any change in airway hyperresponsiveness.</description>

    <description>Asthma symptom score will be measured with the Asthma Control Test at Visit 1, 2 and 5.This instrument, which has been validated for ages 12-84 years, is a 4-week recall questionnaire that addresses issues of asthma control, symptoms, and nocturnal awakenings. The scores range from 5 (poor control of asthma) to 25 (complete control of asthma), with higher scores reflecting greater asthma control. An ACT score &gt;19 indicates well-controlled asthma.</description>
