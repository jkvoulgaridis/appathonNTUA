  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, single-center study to evaluate the everlinQ endoAVF System when used to create
      an endoAVF in hemodialysis patients. This study aims to investigate expansion of the
      percutaneous venous access location to the superficial system which may provide additional
      procedural benefit.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of up to 50 subjects will be enrolled and will undergo an endoAVF creation procedure
      using the everlinQ System. All subjects may be followed for up to 12 months post index
      procedure based on Investigator's discretion. The duration of the study is expected to be
      approximately two (2) years.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Adverse Event Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months following endoAVF creation</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of patients who experience one or more adverse events during the first 3 months following successful endoAVF creation. Adverse events were site-reported and reviewed by an independent Medical Monitor and the Clinical Events Committee (CEC).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Primary Patency at 6 Months Post Index Procedure</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months post index procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Primary Patency was defined as the time interval between the endoAVF index procedure and the earlier of a) any intervention designed to maintain or reestablish patency, b) access thrombosis, or c) access abandonment. Kaplan-Meier (KM) was used to analyze the data.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With EndoAVF Maturation at 1, 3, and 6 Months Post Index Procedure</measure>
    <time_frame>1, 3, and 6 months post index procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Maturity of the endoAVF was defined by duplex ultrasound criteria, as described in the literature as a useful surrogate of suitability for dialysis. Maturation was defined as duplex ultrasound flow in the brachial artery of at least 500 ml/min and a vein diameter ≥ 4mm, without significant stenosis or thrombosis. If a subject was on hemodialysis, maturity was defined by successful dialysis with 2-needles at least once.</description>

    <time_frame>0-10 days, 11-45 days, 46-135 days, 136-210 days post index procedure</time_frame>
    <description>A subject was referred to as a 'cannulation success' with the first successful 2-needle cannulation of the endoAVF access circuit. &quot;Cannulation Success&quot; was defined by at least one successful hemodialysis session through a 2-needle cannulation of the endoAVF access circuit. &quot;Cumulative Cannulation Success&quot; = (Successes Through End Current Interval) / (Subjects on Dialysis at Start Current Interval + Censored Dialysis Subjects through End of Last Interval).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Assisted Primary Patency at 6 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months post index procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Defined as the interval from access placement to thrombosis or abandonment; not triggered by access circuit interventions performed in the absence of occlusion.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Secondary Patency at 6 Months Post Index Procedure</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months post index procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Secondary Patency was defined as the time interval between the endoAVF index procedure and a) access abandonment, or b) loss to thrombosis, irrespective of intervening surgical or endovascular interventions designed to re-establish functionality in a stenosed or thrombosed access circuit.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Functional Patency of the endoAVF at 6 Months Post Index Procedure</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months post index procedure</time_frame>
    <description>The interval of time from the first 2-needle dialysis utilizing the access until access abandonment (SVS Reporting Standards definition). Functional Patency was the interval of time from the first 2-needle dialysis of the endoAVF access circuit until access abandonment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With EndoAVF Related Reintervention</measure>
    <time_frame>At 6 months follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The re-intervention rate for endoAVF (defined as any intervention required to maintain or re-establish patency) was calculated at each available follow-up visit post index procedure.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Modified Primary Patency at 6 Months Post Index Procedure</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months post index procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Modified Primary Patency was defined as a measure of patency that, in addition to occlusion or reinterventions within the access circuit, also included coil embolization or open surgical ligation of outflow venous branches as failures of patency when they occur after the index procedure.</description>

    <description>The everlinQ device is a single-use disposable device. The everlinQ catheter system consists of two flexible, magnetic catheters. Once the catheters are properly inserted and aligned, the magnets contained in each catheter attract to one another, approximating the vessels while simultaneously aligning the electrode with the backstop. Radiofrequency (RF) energy is delivered to the electrode whereby the arterio-venous fistula (AVF) is created.</description>

        <description>Maturity of the endoAVF was defined by duplex ultrasound criteria, as described in the literature as a useful surrogate of suitability for dialysis. Maturation was defined as duplex ultrasound flow in the brachial artery of at least 500 ml/min and a vein diameter ≥ 4mm, without significant stenosis or thrombosis. If a subject was on hemodialysis, maturity was defined by successful dialysis with 2-needles at least once.</description>
