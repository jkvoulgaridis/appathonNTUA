  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transthyretin is a protein produced in the liver that transports thyroid hormone and vitamin
      A. A single substitution of an amino acid in the structure of TTR can result in a relatively
      unstable protein, the breakdown products of which (predominantly monomers) aggregate
      abnormally and produce proteinaceous deposits in nerves and the heart. These deposits are
      known as amyloid and produce progressive nerve and heart damage. Amyloidosis due to a mutant
      TTR is usually an autosomal dominant and hence is a familial condition. Wild-type TTR is also
      capable of producing amyloid deposits which predominantly involves the heart (rather than the
      nervous system) resulting in a progressive decrease in cardiac function with increasing signs
      of heart failure. This study aims to determine whether subcutaneous injection of an antisense
      oligonucleotide drug, known as inotersen, that has been specifically designed to reduce
      production of the protein transthyretin by the liver, can slow or stop the progression of TTR
      amyloid cardiomyopathy as compared to historical controls, using advanced echocardiography
      and cardiac MRI. The study also aims to determine the tolerability and safety of this drug
      when administered over a 24-month period to patients with TTR amyloid cardiomyopathy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single center study of 50 patients with cardiac amyloidosis due to
      wild-type or mutant TTR. Eligible patients will have evidence of cardiac amyloidosis due to
      transthyretin. The diagnosis will be made by biopsy of the heart or other affected organ with
      appropriate staining techniques confirming that the amyloid deposits are derived from
      transthyretin. Alternatively, recent imaging data have shown that a strongly positive nuclear
      scan using technetium pyrophosphate in the absence of evidence of a plasma cell dyscrasia and
      in the presence of a typical echocardiographic or cardiac magnetic resonance appearance of
      cardiac amyloidosis is indicative of TTR amyloidosis and that a biopsy is not needed. This
      will be acceptable for study entry. As inotersen has been associated with kidney toxicity in
      a small number of patients, all subjects in the study will be required to have a glomerular
      filtration rate greater than 45. Once study criteria have been met, and baseline imaging
      including echocardiography and (where feasible) cardiac magnetic resonance imaging have been
      performed, all patients will receive inotersen in a weekly 300 mg dosing. Subsequent visits
      will occur at 6 weeks, and 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. Every 2 weeks, blood will be monitored
      for renal function and platelet count and urine will be tested by dipstick for proteinuria.
      Should kidney function be noted to be deteriorating or should proteinuria be found, a more
      intense renal workup will be performed in order to detect or rule out potential kidney
      toxicity. At each visit, in addition to standard laboratory work and pregnancy testing if
      applicable, (complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, thyroid function tests, and
      urinalysis), Vitamin A level will be drawn (as TTR is a transport protein for Vitamin A) and
      TTR (prealbumin) level will be drawn to determine degree of suppression. Disease progression
      will be measured by serial cardiac biomarkers, 6-minute walk, cardiopulmonary stress testing,
      advanced &quot;strain&quot; echocardiography and cardiac MRI. Patients will be compared to data derived
      from a historical control group and from data in the literature to determine whether
      inotersen slows or stops disease progression.

             appearance of left ventricular wall thickness of 13 mm or more, in the absence of
             uncontrolled hypertension, and with EITHER a positive biopsy for amyloid, which also
             stains positive for TTR by immunochemistry or mass spectrometry OR a positive cardiac
             technetium pyrophosphate scan with isotope uptake in the heart equal or greater to rib
             uptake and with no evidence of a plasma cell dyscrasia.

             defined as having transthyretin genetic sequencing negative for a mutation.
             Mutant/hereditary TTR (ATTRh) will be defined as TTR amyloid cardiomyopathy with TTR
             sequencing showing an amyloidogenic mutation. A positive biopsy can be from any organ,
             providing that the echocardiographic appearance is typical of amyloidosis.

          -  Patients should, in the opinion of the Investigator, be in a stable state in terms of
             NYHA class. Class I-III patients will be recruited.

          -  Male, or non-pregnant, non-lactating females. If a woman is premenopausal, or male
             partners with a premenopausal woman, she/he must be willing to use the following
             methods of contraception: condoms, oral/hormonal contraception, intrauterine device,
             diaphragm, or abstinence

          -  If diagnosis is made by tissue biopsy histochemical diagnosis (positive stains for TTR
             in absence of staining for light chains, or AA amyloid) in the presence of green
             birefringent material in Congo red-stained tissue specimens or sulfated Alcian blue
             stain typical for amyloid deposition. NB. All patients will have had a definitive
             diagnosis of TTR amyloidosis made prior to study entry, either by tissue biopsy or
             positive PYP scan, and all will have been genotyped. No further diagnostic testing
             will need to be done at or after study entry.

          -  If diagnosis is made by nuclear imaging, a positive technetium pyrophosphate scan,
             characterized by isotope uptake in the heart of an intensity equal to or greater than,
             rib uptake.

          -  Willingness to return to the treating center for follow-up.

             cause changes in strain imaging on serial follow-up (e.g. aortic stenosis of greater
             than mild severity, unstable coronary artery disease), or ongoing non-cardiac disease
             that, in the opinion of the investigator, will likely need hospitalization over the
             next 2 years (e.g. active cancer) .
