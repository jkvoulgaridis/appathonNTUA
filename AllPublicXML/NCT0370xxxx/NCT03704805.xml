  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to examine the effect of a psychological intervention on
      antiretroviral therapy outcomes and symptoms of common mental health disorders among adults
      living with HIV and common mental disorders in rural Zimbabwe.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Common mental disorders are highly prevalent among people living with HIV. Left untreated,
      common mental disorders cause substantial disability and undermine individuals' ability to
      adhere to antiretroviral therapy, leading to poor antiretroviral therapy outcomes.

      A recent cluster-randomized controlled trial from Harare, Zimbabwe showed that the friendship
      bench intervention (i.e. six sessions of problem-solving therapy delivered by lay health
      workers followed by a peer support group) effectively reduced symptoms of common mental
      disorders, but the effect of the intervention on antiretroviral therapy outcomes and its
      effectiveness in the rural setting has not been studied.

      To examine the effect of the friendship bench intervention on antiretroviral therapy outcomes
      and symptoms of common mental disorders among adults living with HIV and common mental
      disorders in rural Zimbabwe, a cluster-randomized trial is conducted.

    <description>The friendship bench intervention consists of six individual counseling sessions and a peer-led group activity. Individual counseling is based on problem-solving therapy and delivered by lay health workers. During individual counseling, participants will be actively encouraged to identify and tackle problems leading to sub-optimal antiretroviral therapy adherence. In the group activity, participants are taught an income generating skill and have the opportunity to share personal experience with former participants of the intervention.</description>
