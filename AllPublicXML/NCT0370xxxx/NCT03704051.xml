  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the proposed research is to conduct a within-subject experimental study that
      will assess the effect of feeding mode (breast- versus bottle-feeding) on the quality and
      outcome of infant feeding interactions.

    <intervention_model>Single Group Assignment</intervention_model>
    <intervention_model_description>Every mother will come into the lab two times (separated by one day) and will breastfeed their baby during one visit and bottle-feed their baby during the other visit. The order of these conditions will be randomly assigned and counterbalanced.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Infant intake during the observed feeding (mL)</measure>
    <time_frame>2-hour period</time_frame>
    <description>For both breast- and bottle-feedings, infant intake will be assessed by pre- and post-weighing the baby on an infant scale (model 374; Seca, Hamburg, Germany). During bottle-feedings, we will also note whether the infant finishes the bottle.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Maternal sensitivity to infant cues</measure>
    <time_frame>2-hour period</time_frame>
    <description>Mother and infant behavior during each feeding will be coded using the Nursing Child Assessment Parent-Child Interaction - Feeding Scale (NCAFS). This scale contains six subscales, four of which describe maternal attributes (Sensitivity to Cues, Response to Child's Distress, Social-Emotional Growth Fostering, and Cognitive Growth Fostering) and two of which describe infant attributes (Clarity of Cues and Responsiveness to Caregiver). The proposed analysis will focus on the Sensitivity to Cues subscale, which measures the degree to which the mother is able to understand and respond to her child's cues. This scale provides a global measure of how sensitive the mother is to the infant's needs during the feeding interaction. Possible score range is 0-16, which is derived from summing together maternal scores for each of the 16 subscale items. Higher scores indicate greater sensitivity to infant cues.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physiological synchrony</measure>
    <time_frame>2-hour period</time_frame>
    <description>During each feeding observation, we will also assess both the mothers' and the infant's physiological response (i.e., heart rate variability) to the feeding using electrocardiogram (ECG; BioPac MP160 data acquisition system, BioPac Systems, Inc., Goleta, CA). Two disposable pediatric electrodes will be placed on the infant's chest and one electrode will be placed on the infant's back immediately prior to the start of each feeding. Three disposable electrodes will be placed on the mother's chest immediately prior to the start of each feeding. All electrodes will be wireless and will be placed at least 5 minutes prior to the feeding to allow mothers and infants to become acclimated. Our main variable of interest will be maternal and infant heart rate variability, assessed by estimating inter-beat-intervals (IBI) to determine variation in R-R intervals of the heartbeat during the feeding.</description>
