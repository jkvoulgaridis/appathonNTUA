      Objective: The objective of this study will be to evaluate the effectiveness of different
      endodontic treatment techniques in postoperative symptoms, apical repair and oral
      health-related quality of life.

      Methods: This prospective, randomized, double-blind clinical study was approved at the
      Research Ethics Committee (nÂº 74185417.9.0000.5626) and will consist of a sample of 210
      patients who will be attended in the clinics of the Federal University of
      Fluminense/Institute of Health of Nova Friburgo (UFF/ISNF), in which they will be selected
      based on eligibility criteria. Patients aged up to 18 years, with teeth with necrotic pulps
      and radiographic evidence of periapical lesion will be included. These patients will be
      randomly divided into 6 groups: I (35 patients): unirradicular teeth will be submitted to
      endodontic treatment with foraminal enlargement, instrumentation with reciprocating rotation,
      sodium hypochlorite as irrigant, lateral condensation filling with MTA Fillapex; II (35
      patients): unirradicular teeth will be submitted to endodontic treatment with foraminal
      enlargement, instrumentation with reciprocating rotation, sodium hypochlorite as irrigant,
      PDT, lateral condensation filling with MTA Fillapex; III (35 patients): unirradicular teeth
      will be submitted to endodontic treatment with foraminal enlargement, instrumentation with
      reciprocating rotation, chlorhexidine as irrigant, lateral condensation filling with MTA
      fillapex; IV (35 patients): unirradicular teeth will be submitted to endodontic treatment
      with foraminal enlargement, instrumentation with reciprocating rotation, sodium hypochlorite
      as irrigant, lateral condensation filling with AH Plus; V (35 patients): molars will be
      submitted to endodontic treatment with foraminal enlargement, instrumentation with
      reciprocating rotation, conventional irrigation with sodium hypochlorite, lateral
      condensation filling with MTA fillapex; VI (35 patients): molars will be submitted to
      endodontic treatment with foraminal enlargement, instrumentation with reciprocating rotation,
      passive ultrasonic irrigation with sodium hypochlorite, lateral condensation filling with MTA
      fillapex. The analysis of the postoperative signs/symptoms will be performed by the visual
      analog pain scale at 1th, 2th, 3th, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 14th and 30th days and by the
      subjective evaluation of swelling in 48 and 72 hours. The periapical lesion repair will be
      evaluated clinically and radiographically at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. In addition,
      patients will respond a quality of life questionnaire (OHIP-14) on the day of endodontic
      treatment, on the 7th day and on the 30th day.

      Data analysis: The data will be inserted into a statistical program (SPSS), obtaining the
      frequencies of the characterization variables of the sample. The appropriate tests will be
      used to compare the means of the groups.

    <intervention_name>Foraminal Enlargement / Irrigating solutions / Filling materials</intervention_name>
    <description>Instrumentation with foraminal enlargement and various irrigation solutions and filling materials will be performed according to the allocated group.
The foraminal enlargement provides better results in the bacterial removal of the apical portion of the root canal. This instrumentation will be done with the Reciproc 40 or 50 system in the apical foramen, determined by the apical locator.
To contribute to disinfection of the root canal, sodium hypochlorite and chlorhexidine are the most widely used irrigators. Sodium hypochlorite has a broad antimicrobial spectrum and an effective ability to dissolve organic matter and necrotic tissue; while chlorhexidine shows substantivity and antimicrobial residual activity when used as an irrigating substance.
Besides that, MTA Fillapex or AH Plus will be used and the recommended filling technique will be lateral condensation.</description>
