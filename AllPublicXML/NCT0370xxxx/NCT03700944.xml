      The purpose of this study was to investigate effects of yoga training on rhinitis symptoms
      and cytokines in allergic rhinitis patients. Twenty-seven allergic rhinitis patients, aged
      18-45 year old, were randomized into 2 groups: control group (CON; n=14) and yoga group (YOG;
      n=13). The control group had normal life and the yoga group was required to complete protocol
      with yoga training for a period of 8 weeks, 60 minutes, 3 times a week. Physiological
      variables, lung function variables, allergic rhinitis symptoms variables, and cytokines level
      in nasal secretion variables were analyzed during pre-test and post-test. The dependent
      variables between pre-test and post-test were analyzed by a paired t-test. The dependent
      variables between groups were analyzed by independent t-test. One way repeated measures ANOVA
      was used to compare the variables among pre-test, after 4 weeks, and after 8 weeks.
      Differences were considered to be significant at p &lt; 0.05.

    <description>Nasal symptoms were assessed using Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) questionnaire. The subjects were asked to score symptoms of persistent allergic rhinitis before and after yoga training protocol. The total nasal symptom scores were computed as the sum of four individual nasal symptom scores; nasal congestion, itching, sneezing, and rhinorrhea. The scores ranged from 0 to 3 scale (0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3= severe)</description>

    <description>Nasal secretions collection was performed bilaterally with filter paper strips (7x30 mm Whatman No.42, Whatman, Clifton, NJ). Three filter paper strips were sequentially placed on each anterior portion of the inferior turbinate for 10 min. This filter paper strips were collected into appropriate tubes and centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C and immediately frozen at -70 °C until later analysis.The levels of cytokines were determined by using Sandwich ELISA technique</description>
