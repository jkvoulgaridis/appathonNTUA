  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of viable allograft
      transplantation for the treatment of patients with symptomatic disc degeneration and tissue
      loss.

      All subjects randomized to Active Allograft will undergo injection of a viable allograft into
      the nucleus pulposus of the degenerated disc. All subjects randomized to Placebo will undergo
      injection with saline into the nucleus pulposus of the degenerated disc. All subjects
      randomized to Conservative Care will continue standard of care, with the opportunity to
      crossover at 3 months into the Active Allograft arm.

    <textblock>
      This is a, prospective, randomized, parallel-arm, multicenter study that will enroll up to
      220 evaluable patients at up to 15 clinical sites. The outcomes of this trial will be based
      on assessment of primary and secondary endpoints at 6 and 12 months after treatment of
      supplementary allograft compared to conservative care in subjects who have pain attributable
      to disc degeneration as judged by MRI scoring (Pfirrmann), physical examination, and patient
      reported pain.

      The study is composed of two phases - the Screening Phase (enrollment) followed by the Active
      Phase (12 months). There is an indeterminate overlap of up to 14 days between the end of the
      Screening Phase and the start of the Active Phase for individual subjects in order to
      evaluate the protocol, and consent to their participation. After completing the Informed
      Consent procedure, screening and study specific procedures can be performed. Only patients
      that meet the entry criteria for both phases are eligible and can participate in this study.

      During the 14 days of the Screening Phase (Day -14 to Day 0), subjects will be assessed for
      study eligibility to establish their baseline condition, and will be randomized to either
      conservative care (maintaining current level of care), or be provided with supplementary
      allograft transplantation (Day 0 of the Screening Phase), or receive placebo treatment
      (saline). All subjects who are randomized to conservative care in the Screening Phase (Day
      -14 to Day 0), will be evaluated as per standard of care and will be assessed along with
      those who are selected for eligibility to enter the Active Phase of allograft
      transplantation.

      The first 24 subjects randomized (at least 4 subjects from each group) will return to the
      clinic for a safety assessment 1 month after treatment. Subsequent clinic visits will occur
      at 6 and 12 months following treatment for safety and efficacy assessments. Subjects
      randomized to conservative care will additionally receive a clinical follow-up at 3 months to
      assess pain, change, or loss of function since their initial visit.

    <masking_description>The assignment to treatment (active allograft, or placebo, or conservative care) is open label at Day 0 of the Active Phase to the extent that subjects receiving allograft or placebo will not be aware of what they have received, while those assigned to conservative care will be aware. All site study staff will be aware of the group to which each subject is randomized. Sites will be trained to ensure that subjects receiving the allograft or placebo treatment will remain blinded to their treatment throughout the study duration.</masking_description>
