  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Berlin Heart EXCOR ventricular assist device received approval from the FDA as a bridge
      to transplantation for children in 2011. Successful bridge to transplantation or recovery in
      the IDE trial of the Berlin Heart EXCOR was 88% to 92%, but a high incidence of neurological
      injury was reported in this trial (29%).

      Stroke remains the most important complication of Berlin Heart EXCOR support, with high
      mortality rates, and considerable long‐term morbidity. The EXCOR IDE study incorporated a
      novel anticoagulation protocol (henceforth referred to as the Edmonton Anticoagulation
      Protocol). The preponderance of ischemic strokes in this study raised the question of whether
      the anticoagulation protocol was sufficiently intensive, as ischemic strokes in this setting
      are virtually always thromboembolic phenomena. In response to these data and to the
      experience at the investigator's institution, a novel anticoagulation protocol has been
      devised for use with the EXCOR (Stanford anticoagulation protocol).The purpose of this study
      is to perform a pilot evaluation of this protocol in a multi--center setting, to prepare for
      a randomized trial between this and a subsequent iteration of anticoagulation treatment.

             years of age), refractory to optimal medical therapy

          2. Patient deemed to be candidate for EXCOR implantation according to the clinical
             criteria employed by treating site

          3. Listed or eligible for cardiac transplantation according to the criteria employed by
             the treating site

          4. Two-ventricle circulation, including cardiomyopathy, repaired structural heart
             disease, or acquired heart disease

          5. Age 0 to 18 years of age

          6. Corrected gestational age ≥ 37 weeks

          7. Weight ≥ 3 kg and ≤ 60 kg

          8. Legal guardian (and patient if age-appropriate) understands the nature of the
             investigation, is willing to comply with the protocol and associated evaluations, and
             provides written informed consent and assent prior to the procedure.
