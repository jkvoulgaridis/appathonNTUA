  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endostar is a anti-angiogenesis product and has been launched in China . The efficacy and
      safety have been defined. However, the compliance is unsatisfactory since routine i.v of
      Endostar is needed for 3 to 4 hours daily during one cycle of 14 days. The continuous
      intravenous infusion by using venous pump can improve the compliance.
