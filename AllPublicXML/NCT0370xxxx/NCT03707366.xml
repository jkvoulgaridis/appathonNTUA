  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will implement and evaluate a mentoring program designed to promote positive youth
      development and reduce adverse outcomes among maltreated adolescents with open child welfare
      cases. Teenagers who have been maltreated are at heightened risk for involvement in
      delinquency, substance use, and educational failure as a result of disrupted attachments with
      caregivers and exposure to violence within their homes and communities. Although youth
      mentoring is a widely used prevention approach nationally, it has not been rigorously studied
      for its effects in preventing these adverse outcomes among maltreated youth involved in the
      child welfare system. This randomized controlled trial will permit us to implement and
      evaluate the Fostering Healthy Futures for Teens (FHF-T) program, which will use mentoring
      and skills training within an innovative positive youth development (PYD) framework to
      promote adaptive functioning and prevent adverse outcomes. Graduate student mentors will
      deliver 9 months of prevention programming in teenagers' homes and communities. Mentors will
      focus on helping youth set and reach goals that will improve their functioning in five
      targeted &quot;REACH&quot; domains: Relationships, Education, Activities, Career, and Health. In
      reaching those goals, mentors will help youth build social-emotional skills associated with
      preventing adverse outcomes (e.g., emotion regulation, communication, problem solving). The
      randomized controlled trial will enroll 234 racially and ethnically diverse 8th and 9th grade
      youth (117 intervention, 117 control), who will provide data at baseline prior to
      randomization, immediately post-program and 15 months post program follow-up. The aims of the
      study include testing the efficacy of FHF-T for high-risk 8th and 9th graders in preventing
      adverse outcomes and examining whether better functioning in positive youth development
      domains mediates intervention effects. It is hypothesized that youth randomly assigned to the
      FHF-T prevention condition, relative to youth assigned to the control condition, will
      evidence better functioning on indices of positive youth development in the REACH domains
      leading to better long-term outcomes, including adaptive functioning, high school graduation,
      career attainment/employment, healthy relationships, and quality of life.

    <description>FHF-T employs mentoring, consisting of relationship development, advocating for and empowering youth, and skill-building activities to promote positive youth development. Mentors meet individually for 2-3 hours per week for 30 weeks with each teen they mentor, in order to engage teens in positive youth development activities and provide skills training in areas including emotion recognition, perspective-taking, problem solving, effective communication, managing anger, healthy coping and resisting peer pressure for deviant activities. Youth also attend group workshops over the course of the program, in which they engage with other participants and mentors in skill-building activities.</description>
