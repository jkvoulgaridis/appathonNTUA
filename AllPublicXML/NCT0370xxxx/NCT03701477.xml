  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Migraine headache is one of the disabling conditions that may be associated with decreased
      quality of life, anxiety and depression. Currently, therapeutic approach to migraine is
      mostly based on prophylactic and acute phase medication therapy. Some investigators consider
      migraine a biopsychosocial condition which means that psychological therapies, such as
      cognitive-behavioral therapy and relaxation, may be efficient in controlling the disease.
      According to previous studies, cognitive therapies, including cognitive-behavioral therapy,
      have been efficient in decreasing frequency and severity of migraine, however, there are some
      challenges in applying these kind of interventions: the expenses; presence of multiple
      commodities that may lead to confusion and bewilderment for both therapist and patient; small
      number of trained psychologists for this intervention.

      The trans-diagnostic approach, however, can facilitate some challenges with the previous
      method. Since it is not focused on a single condition, trained psychologists with this
      approach can apply it for a wide range of conditions, including migraine. Also, the
      trans-diagnostic approach leads to lower chances of confusion and bewilderment for therapist
      and patients. The trans-diagnostic approach focuses on therapeutic modules instead of
      constant similar therapeutic models. The five cores of trans-diagnostic approach are
      emotional awareness, cognitive flexibility, recognizing and preventing emotion avoidance and
      maladaptive emotion driven behaviors, awareness and tolerance of emotion-related physical
      conditions, and introceptive and situation-based emotion-focused exposure. This method was
      first designed to replace cognitive-behavioral therapy for emotional disorders, due to its
      feasibility and applicability.

      The trans-diagnostic approach has been investigated by several researchers so far, however,
      most of those researches evaluate the efficacy of the technique on psychiatric disorders. It
      has also been investigated for treatment of headaches in adolescents. But no other study on
      other clinical problems or migraine has been conducted. Considering the high rates of
      comorbid anxiety and depressive symptoms in migrainous patients and the feasibility and
      efficacy of trans-diagnostic cognitive-behavioral therapy in other conditions, we aimed to
      evaluate its efficacy on controlling headache and related symptoms among migrainous patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Migraine headache is one of the disabling conditions that occurs more in young women. It is
      usually associated with decreased quality of life, as well as anxiety and depressed in the
      affected individuals. Currently, therapeutic approach to migraine is mostly based on
      medication therapy in two phases of prophylaxis and acute attacks. However, some
      investigators consider it not only as a biologic disease, but also a multidimensional
      condition that may be accompanied by anxiety and depressive symptoms. Considering migraine as
      a biopsychosocial condition means that psychological therapies, such as cognitive-behavioral
      therapy and relaxation, may be efficient in controlling the disease. According to previous
      studies, cognitive therapies, including cognitive-behavioral therapy, have been efficient in
      decreasing frequency and severity of migraine, however, there are some challenges in applying
      these kind of interventions for patients: the costs of such treatments are usually not
      covered by insurance companies; presence of multiple commodities may lead to confusion and
      bewilderment for both therapist and patient while applying the technique; training
      psychologists for this intervention is costly and not enough psychologists know how to handle
      the condition.

      The trans-diagnostic approach, however, can facilitate some challenges with the previous
      method. Since it is not focused on a single condition, trained psychologists with this
      approach can apply it for a wide range of conditions, including migraine. Also, the
      trans-diagnostic approach leads to lower chances of confusion and bewilderment for therapist
      and patients.

      The trans-diagnostic approach is somehow similar to the classic cognitive-behavioral therapy.
      however, it focuses on therapeutic modules instead of constant similar therapeutic models.
      The five cores of trans-diagnostic approach are emotional awareness, cognitive flexibility,
      recognizing and preventing emotion avoidance and maladaptive emotion driven behaviors,
      awareness and tolerance of emotion-related physical conditions, and introceptive and
      situation-based emotion-focused exposure. This method was first designed to replace
      cognitive-behavioral therapy for emotional disorders, due to its feasibility and
      applicability.

      The trans-diagnostic approach has been investigated by several researchers so far, however,
      most of those researches evaluate the efficacy of the technique on psychiatric disorders. It
      has also been investigated for treatment of headaches in adolescents. But no other study on
      other clinical problems or migraine has been conducted. Considering the high rates of
      comorbid anxiety and depressive symptoms in migrainous patients and the feasibility and
      efficacy of trans-diagnostic cognitive-behavioral therapy in other conditions, we aimed to
      evaluate its efficacy on controlling headache and related symptoms among migrainous patients.

    <measure>Visual Analog Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Before intervention; one month after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Visual analog scale is used to rate the severity of headaches in patients. Patients are supposed to rate their pain on a scale from 0 to 10, 10 means the worst pain and 0 means no pain. They also can see cartoon faces that illustrate the severity of pain along with the numbers. Basically, lower numbers from this scale indicate better outcome. The scale has no sub-scale or other interpretation and the scores rated by patients will be described as the results.</description>

    <measure>Headache Impact Test-6 (HIT-6)</measure>
    <time_frame>Before intervention; one month after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>This standard questionnaire evaluates the impact of headache on patient's ability to function on the job, at school, at home, or in social situations. It contains 6 questions (5-point Likert scale), each question covering one aspect of headache impact. The choices for each question can be never, rarely, sometimes, often, and always. These choices are rated as 6, 8, 10, 11, and 13 points, respectively, and the sum of scores shows the total score. The total score ranges from 36 (lowest score, the favorable outcome) to 78 (worst outcome, debilitating headaches). Also, scores higher than 50 mean that headache had caused significant disability for the patient. This questionnaire has no subscale and total scores will be reported.</description>

    <measure>Migraine Disability Assessment Scale (MIDAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Before intervention; one month after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>This standard questionnaire collects the days of disability due to headache. This questionnaire includes 5 questions, each question asking for number of the days that has caused a certain disability. The answers for these questions will be summed up to find the total score of the questionnaire. Based on the total score, the patient will be categorized in one of these groups: score 0-5 means no/unremarkable disability; score 6-10 means mild disability; score 11-20 means moderate disability; score&gt;21 mean severe disability. As it was described, higher scores show worst outcome and lower scores present favorable outcome.</description>

    <measure>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Before intervention; one month after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire evaluates general status of patient with respect to anxiety and depressive symptoms. The questionnaire contains 14 questions, 7 evaluate depression and 7 evaluate anxiety. Therefore, it has two subscales. Questions are 4-point Liker scales. Each question is scored from 0 to 3 based on the patient's choice, which is defined for each question. At the end, scores in each subscale are summed up to reach the total score on that subscale. In both subscales, score 0-7 means normal status, 8-10 means borderline status, and 11-21 means abnormal status on that subscale. As it was described, higher scores show worst outcome. The total score of the questionnaire won't be reported separately.</description>
