  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the current randomized trial, the investigators will test the ability of two experimental
      approaches to malaria infection management to reduce malaria transmission potential.
      Compounds in Saponé, Burkina Faso, will be randomized to 1 of 3 study arms: arm 1 - current
      standard of care with passively monitored malaria infections; arm 2 - standard of care plus
      enhanced community case management (CCM), comprising active weekly screening for fever, and
      detection and treatment of infections in fever positive individuals using conventional rapid
      diagnostic tests (RDTs); or arm 3 - standard of care and enhanced CCM, plus monthly screening
      and treatment (MSAT) using RDTs. The study will be conducted over approximately 18 months
      covering two high transmission seasons and the intervening dry season
