  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Negative pressure wound dressings have been studied and shown to have applications in
      decreasing rates of surgical wound infections. This study studies the effect of a low cost
      needle-aspirated negative pressure compression dressing on rates of wound infection at prior
      ostomy site in patients undergoing ostomy reversal surgery.

    <textblock>
      Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT) will be studied in colorectal surgery patients
      undergoing ostomy reversal surgery. The immediate goal is to compare primary wound closure
      against primary closure with needle-aspirated compression dressing, and determine if risk of
      potential ostomy site wound infections is decreased. The investigators would also like to
      evaluate if this compression dressing can increase prevalence of complete wound closure by 12
      weeks (last planned clinic visit). NPWT using a continuous suction device was shown to
      decrease surgical site infection (SSI) at ostomy reversal sites undergoing primary closure.
      There is a lack of published literature studying NPWT dressings without an associated suction
      device. The investigators will be using a low-cost simple needle-aspirated suction technique
      to provide negative pressure under a tegaderm/gauze dressing, at the time of placement.
      Patients will be consented and randomized into a negative pressure group, or a control group
      consisting of the same dressing under normal pressure. All adult patients undergoing ostomy
      reversal surgery who consent to the study will be included. Exclusion criteria include prior
      recurrent skin infections, prior stoma-site infection, or large parastomal hernia. Patients
      in the negative pressure group will have the pressure under the dressing measured immediately
      prior to removal on post-operative day 2.
