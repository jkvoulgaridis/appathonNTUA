    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial examining the effectiveness of a teaching intervention
      on residents' and medical students' ability to challenge clearly wrong decisions by a
      superior during a simulated life-threatening crisis. Participants will be randomly allocated
      into the control or intervention arm. The intervention arm will receive education on crisis
      resource management (CRM) and teaching targeting the cognitive skills required to monitor and
      challenge a superior's decision, and conflict resolution tools. Participants will then take
      part in a simulation scenario 2 to 4 weeks later and will be assessed based on 6 challenge
      points, followed by a debrief session.

    <masking_description>Deliberate deception (by not informing of the aim of assessing for ability to challenge authority) will be used to blind the participants. However, open disclosure and explanation of the rationale for deception will be conducted during the debriefing sessions and participants will be extensively counselled.
The confederate specialist will also be blinded to the allocation of the control or intervention arm of participants.
All sessions will be video recorded and assessed in random order by two independent raters blinded to group allocation, using the modified Advocacy-Inquiry Score (mAIS).</masking_description>
