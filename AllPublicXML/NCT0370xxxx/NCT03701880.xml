  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the work is to Evaluate the efficacy, quality of life and safety of early addition
      of ivabradine to B-blocker in reduced EF heart failure patients after acute decompensation
      compared to the standard treatment.

      this study is a Prospective randomized open label study will be conducted on Egyptian patient
      with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction(rEF HF). Each of the eligible patients will
      be randomized to one of these groups, early administration of Ivabradine and B-blocker group
      or control group which follows American Heart Association treatment guidelines of rEF HF.

      The objectives include the following:

        1. Physical examination (heart rate, blood pressure, dyspnea and orthopnea symptoms)

        2. NYHA class

        3. Pro-NT-BNP serum level, ST2 serum level

        4. Echocardiography (left ventricular ejection fraction)

        5. Score of Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire these objectives will be
           measured baseline, 2 weeks and after 3 months

    <measure>ST2 serum level</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Repeated ST2 measurements appeared to be a strong predictor of outcome especially in patients with acute HF. Also, ST2 levels in patients with acute HF are significantly higher than in patients with chronic HF and fall rapidly over days to weeks during HF treatment. This lack of reduction in ST2 level during acute HF treatment is predictive of mortality. So, persistently high levels of ST2 were associated with increased mortality risk</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The effect on patient quality of life using Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months of follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>The questionnaire is comprised of 21 important physical, emotional and socioeconomic ways heart failure can adversely affect a patient's life. the patient marks a 0 (zero) to 5 scale to indicate how much each itemized adverse of heart failure has prevented the patient from living as he or she wanted to live during the past 4 weeks. it is simply scored by summation of all 21 responses.The simple sum of the responses that ranges from 0 to 105 is a measurement of heart failure severity as indicated by its adverse effect on the respondent's life during the past month</description>

    <description>This classification provides a simple way of classifying the extent of heart failure. It classifies patients in one of four categories based on their limitations during physical activity; the limitations/symptoms are in regard to normal breathing and varying degrees in shortness of breath</description>

    <description>an initial dose of 5 mg/12 hours of Ivabradine will be added to beta-blockers (bisoprolol 2.5 mg/day) and ivabradine will be increased until a dose of 7.5 mg/12 hours according to HR. The heart rate target will be at least &lt;70 bpm and not lower than 60 bpm. If HR decreases below 60 bpm, ivabradine and/or beta-blockers doses will be decreased to the previous dose. After discharge, beta-blockers up-titration will be continued during follow-up visit.</description>

Ivabradine will be only added after reaching bisoprolol optimal dose (10mg) or maximum tolerated dose and the HR is still above 70 bpm. If HR decreases below 60 bpm, ivabradine dose will be decreased.</description>
