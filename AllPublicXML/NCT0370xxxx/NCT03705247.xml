  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Angiogenesis is inherently associated to bone formation and healing. During implant
      osseointegration, a successive and successful angiogenic processes has to occur to promote
      bone formation. In 1969, Branemark et al. demonstrated that direct contact between bone and
      titanium implant surface was possible, defining osseointegration as &quot;the direct, structural,
      and functional contact between live bone and the surface of a functionally loaded implant&quot;.
      Consequently, the need of an empirical measurement appeared. With the introduction of
      resonance frequency analysis (RFA), it is now possible to measure the degree of implant
      stability at any time during the course of implant treatment and loading. In this way,
      changes in implant stability can be monitored over the time and it is likely possible to find
      implants at risk of failure before they become loose. The rationale of this study is to
      analyse how important a good vascularization is for the future bone formation around dental
      implants.

        Patients who come to the Unit of Periodontology (UZ Leuven, St. RafaÃ«l), in need of implant
        rehabilitation, will be evaluated for initial study eligibility during a screening visit.
        Patients shall be advised of the need to attend follow-up visits: 3 months after implant
        placement (at abutment placement visit) and 1 year, the latter to analyse the early bone
        remodelling.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males or females American Society of Anesthesiologists classification (ASA) I or II,
             between 18 to 80 years of age

          -  Patient in good general health as documented by self-assessment.

          -  Patients needing implant rehabilitation in the upper or lower jaw.

          -  Patients must be committed to the study and must be willing to sign the informed
             consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any systemic medical condition that could interfere with the surgical procedure or
             planned treatment.

          -  Immunosuppression, Diabetes, Anticoagulation or Antiaggregatory medication.

          -  Current pregnancy or breast feeding/ lactating at the time of recruitment.

          -  Radiotherapy or Chemotherapy in head and neck area.

          -  Intravenous and oral bisphosphonate therapy.

          -  Patients smoking &gt;20 cigarettes a day.

          -  Unwillingness to return for the follow-up examination.

          -  Conditions or circumstances, in the opinion of the investigator, which could represent
             a general contra-indication for surgical procedure or would prevent completion of
             study participation or interfere with analysis of study results, such as history of
             non-compliance, or unrealistic expectations.

        Local exclusion criteria:

          -  Immediate implant placement after tooth extraction.

          -  Risk of extra bleeding due to inflammatory or infectious processes near the zone of
             implantation.
