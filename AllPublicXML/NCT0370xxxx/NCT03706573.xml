    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Cohort Treatment Plan is to allow access to alpelisib for eligible
      patients diagnosed with hormone receptor positive, advanced or metastatic breast cancer
      harboring a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)CA mutation. The patient's Treating Physician
      should follow the suggested treatment guidelines and comply with all local health authority
      regulations.

                  reticulocyte count and peripheral blood smear, normal liver function test
                  results, and absence of other contributing disease processes at the time of

             any prior antineoplastic therapy

          3. Patient has had major surgery within 14 days prior to starting treatment with
             alpelisib or has not recovered from major side effects

             in Appendix) Note: The patient must have discontinued strong inducers for at least one
             week and must have discontinued strong inhibitors before the treatment with alpelisib

             active hepatitis, immuno-compromised, acute or chronic pancreatitis, uncontrolled high
             blood pressure, interstitial lung disease, etc.)

                  functional classification III-IV), documented cardiomyopathy

               3. Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) &lt;50% as determined by Multiple Gated
                  acquisition (MUGA) scan or echocardiogram (ECHO)

               4. myocardial infarction ≤ 6 months prior to enrolment

               5. unstable angina pectoris

               6. serious uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia

               7. symptomatic pericarditis

         12. Patient has impairment of gastrointestinal (GI) function or GI disease that may
             significantly alter the absorption of alpelisib (e.g., ulcerative diseases,
             uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption syndrome, or small bowel
             resection)
