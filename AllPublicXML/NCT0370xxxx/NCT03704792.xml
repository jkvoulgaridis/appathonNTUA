  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic liver diseases (CLDs) represent a major worldwide public health burden. Worldwide
      estimations show that 844 million people have CLDs, a lot more than other chronic diseases
      such as diabetes or cardiovascular diseases. CLD is most of the time an asymptomatic,
      progressive, and potentially fatal disease. With its complications it becomes one of the
      major causes of mortality worldwide. Globally, hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus,
      alcoholic liver disease and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, are the most important causes of
      liver disease.

      The diagnosis of liver lesions remains an important issue for these patients. The prognosis
      and management of liver disease greatly depends on the amount of liver fibrosis. In early
      stages, it is the main factor predicting long-term outcome of these patients. The liver
      biopsy still represents the gold standard diagnostic tool for liver fibrosis assessment,
      although a wide spectrum of noninvasive tools are now commonly used as a surrogate to the
      liver biopsy. It includes direct and indirect serum markers of liver fibrosis, but also
      several imaging-based methods, including transient elastography (FibroScan®, Echosens, Paris,
      France).

      Even if the liver fibrosis is the key pathological feature of progressive liver disease, the
      accumulation of excessive hepatic triglyceride, hepatic steatosis, is today recognized as an
      important factor in the pathogenesis of a number of CLD. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      techniques are sensitive to steatosis and show interesting diagnostic performances,
      especially the MRI using the proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) which has shown at least
      equivalence in accuracy for quantifying hepatic steatosis with both 1H Magnetic Resonance
      Spectroscopy and with histological grade, across several studies. Therefore, this technique
      is now part of the gold standard diagnostic tool to establish the grade of hepatic steatosis.
      Echosens has developed an ultrasonic controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) designed to
      quantify hepatic steatosis using a process based on vibration controlled transient
      elastography (VCTE™).

      Echosens is working on improving the diagnostic accuracy of the CAP measurement performed
      with the FibroScan. This protocol is set-up to compare the diagnostic performances of the
      first generation of the CAP and the second generation of the CAP to the reference, the
      MRI-PDFF, in patients with CLD, all etiologies combined.

    <intervention_name>FibroScan 530 Compact</intervention_name>
    <description>The FibroScan® is a device equipped with probes (M+ or XL+), each of which consists of an ultrasonic transducer mounted on the axis of a mechanical vibrator. Liver stiffness and CAP measurements are performed on the right lobe of the liver with the patient in a dorsal decubitus and maximal abduction position. The procedure is non-invasive and painless.</description>
