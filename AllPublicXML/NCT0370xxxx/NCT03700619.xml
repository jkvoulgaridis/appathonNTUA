  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preterm children have a high risk for neurodevelopmental impairments. The impact on motor
      functions and neurosensory functions is demonstrated but the incidence of executive functions
      is not described for preterm infants.

      It is an epidemiologic, observational, prospective study. All patients, included in the LIFT
      cohort, in 11 to 12 year old during the period study, are contacted by mail. Patients with
      congenital anomalies or genetic syndromes are excluded. Children with parents who do not
      speak French are excluded. Antenatal and postnatal criteria known to be associated with
      disorders of executive functions are collected as gestational age, sex, multiple pregnancy,
      intrauterine growth retardation, antenatal or postnatal steroid use, breastfeeding, cerebral
      injuries and socio-economic status. After a couple of weeks, parents are contacted by a study
      manager, by phone call, to collect parental consent and answer some parental questions. After
      consent collect, BRIEF questionnaires are sending. If they wish, parents could give the BRIEF
      teacher questionnaire to the mean teacher. Teachers send by themselves their response. An
      informatic version is available with a personal link given especially by mail for each child.
      All data are anonymous. BRIEF questionnaire is composed of 86 items, exploring 2 main
      domains: behavior and metacognition. Twenty minutes are necessary to complete questionnaire.
      In case of no questionnaire return after one month, parents are contacted by phone. The
      investigators hypothesize a lost to follow-up at 0.25 and no response at 0.35. The response
      expected is 300 questionnaires.

    <description>estimate incidence of executive functions disorders in preterm children in 11 to 12 year old, born less than 34 weeks of gestation, with the BRIEF parental questionnaire. Effects are potentially important because this study could objectify an increase of risk of executive functions disorders f in preterm children in 11 to 12 year old, and identify associated risk factors. This work could eventually alert pediatrician to be careful at the executive functions and to propose adapted supportive cares.</description>
