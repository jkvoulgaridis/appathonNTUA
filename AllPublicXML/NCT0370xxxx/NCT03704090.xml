  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the world, 230 million surgeries are performed every year and US data indicates that more
      than a third of patients who undergo surgery are older than 65 years, in which between 10 and
      70% develop postoperative delirium (POD). Patients who develop POD have poor outcomes, such
      as a longer hospital stay, a deterioration in functional and cognitive status, high mortality
      rates, and an increase in health costs.

      Delirium is an entity that in a significant percentage is preventable, thus preventing the
      development of POD is fundamental. In fact, in older adults hospitalized in the no surgical
      ward, the implementation of non-pharmacological prevention measures of delirium has
      consistently shown to significantly prevent the development of this condition. However,
      limited information is available about the usefulness of non-pharmacological intervention
      protocols applied in the perioperative context to prevent POD.

      The main aim of this project is to determine whether the application of non-pharmacological
      measures during the perioperative period prevents POD in elderly patients undergoing highly
      complex elective surgeries.

      The hypothesis is that the application of these measures decreases the incidence of delirium
      in this population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To determine whether non-pharmacological measures decrease the incidence of POD during the
      perioperative period in elderly patients undergoing highly complex elective surgeries, it
      will be performed a randomized clinical trial, where two groups of patients older than 75
      years undergoing highly complex elective surgeries will be compared:

        1. The first group will receive a protocol of non-pharmacological interventions implemented
           by occupational therapy teams to prevent delirium plus standard non-pharmacological
           prevention interventions.

        2. The second group will only receive standard non-pharmacological prevention
           interventions.

      This study will be carried out in the surgical units of the Hospital Clinico de la
      Universidad de Chile (HCUCH) and in the Hospital San Jose (HSJ).

      The expected result is to demonstrate that the interventions carried out by occupational
      therapists decrease the incidence of DPO in a significant way in comparison with standard
      prevention intervention.
