  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the effects of transcutaneous direct current stimulation (tsDCS)
      on walking function in individuals with incomplete spinal cord injury. Following
      rehabilitation, individuals with ISCI often demonstrate improved walking function, but
      continue to have serious impairments that limit mobility, community participation and quality
      of life. Adjuvants to rehabilitation that increase spinal excitation during training may
      enhance its effectiveness. tsDCS is a non-invasive neuromodulation approach that uses a mild
      electrical current, applied over the skin of the low back, to alter the membrane potential of
      spinal neurons. tsDCS will be applied during locomotor training, a well-established
      rehabilitation strategy that promotes walking recovery. Locomotor training emphasizes
      repetitive and task-specific practice of coordinated walking, often with therapist assistance
      or cueing to promote high quality movement patterns. The study team will explore if tsDCS
      combined with locomotor training increases spinal excitation and thereby improves the
      effectiveness of walking rehabilitation.

  <detailed_description>

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of transcutaneous direct current
      stimulation (tsDCS) on locomotor function and rehabilitation outcomes in individuals with
      incomplete spinal cord injury (ISCI). tsDCS is a mild, non-invasive form of electrical
      stimulation that can alter spinal cord excitability.

      Specific Aim 1 (Cross-sectional): To test the hypothesis that tsDCS applied during walking
      will improve motor activation in adults with chronic ISCI. A random order, double blind
      cross-over study will be conducted across two test sessions to compare the immediate effects
      of two dosages of tsDCS during walking. To assess motor activation, the primary outcome
      measure will be lower extremity surface electromyography.

      Specific Aim 2 (Interventional): To test the hypothesis that tsDCS applied during 16 sessions
      of locomotor training will improve functional walking outcomes. Participants will be
      randomized to receive 16 sessions of locomotor training with one of the two tsDCS dosages.
      The primary outcome is walking function as measured by standardized clinical tests of walking
      speed and endurance.

      To address the aims of the study, the investigators will use a two-part study design.
      Following phone and in-person screenings and physician approval, individuals will provide
      informed consent to the study procedures. In the first part, participants will complete two
      separate testing sessions, presented in random order, that involve up to 30 minutes of tsDCS
      at one of two dosages levels while walking. The researchers will assess changes in motor
      activation before and at the end of the period of walking. For the second part, participants
      will be randomized to receive 16 sessions of locomotor training with one of the two dosages
      of tsDCS. Before and after the 16-session intervention (i.e., at baseline and post
      intervention), the study team will assess functional outcomes through standardized tests of
      walking speed and endurance.

    <measure>Change in 10-Meter Walk Test (Interventional)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Performance assessment of comfortable and fastest safe walking speed for 10 meters. A reduced time (in seconds) to complete the 10-Meter Walk Test reflects improvement in walking function.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Electromyogram (EMG; Immediate)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; 1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>EMG will be used to assess the neuromuscular activation of the lower extremity muscles. A wireless, 16-channel EMG system will be applied at various key muscle groups on both lower extremities. Greater amplitude or changes in activation timing in the EMG signal will reflect improvement in muscle activation.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline; Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The 6-Minute Walk Test (6 MWT) is a submaximal exercise test that entails measurement of distance walked over a span of 6 minutes. An increase in the number of meters walked during this assessment reflects an improvement in walking endurance.</description>

    <description>All participants will complete 2 sessions of walking with tsDCS separated by at least 72 hours. The only difference between sessions will be the dosage of stimulation (higher or lower dosage tsDCS using the Soterix Medical tsDCS stimulator). During each session, participants will be asked to walk for up to 30 minutes on a treadmill while the stimulation is delivered. Assessments will be completed before and after the bout of treadmill walking.</description>

The training sessions will be scheduled 4 days per week for 4 weeks. All training will be overseen by a physical therapist with experience in SCI walking rehabilitation and will involve the use of an overhead support harness.</description>
