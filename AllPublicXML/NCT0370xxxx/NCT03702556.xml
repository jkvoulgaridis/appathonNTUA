      Rationale: To study the effects of mastectomy and autologous breast reconstruction on the
      sensation of the (reconstructed) breast, not only the peripheral reinnervation of the breast
      should be studied, but also the changes that take place in the somatosensory cortex. Now that
      the region of interest in the brain and the somatotopy of the non-operated breast are known,
      studies with patients who underwent mastectomy and breast reconstruction are the next step to
      understand the neuroplasticity of the brain following breast surgery.

      Objective: To study the neuroplasticity of the brain after mastectomy and breast
      reconstructive surgery by assessing the somatotopy of the breast on the somatosensory cortex
      of patients who underwent either breast reconstruction with and without nerve restoration or
      mastectomy without breast reconstruction.

      Study design: A single center imaging study carried out in Maastricht University Medical
      Center.

      Study population: A total of 30 female breast cancer patients who underwent a unilateral
      mastectomy without breast reconstruction or a mastectomy followed by a unilateral autologous
      breast reconstruction with a deep inferior epigastric artery perforator (DIEP) flap will be
      included in this study. Three groups of patients will be selected and compared: ten patients
      who underwent a mastectomy without breast reconstruction, ten patients who underwent a DIEP
      flap breast reconstruction with sensory nerve restoration of the flap and ten patients who
      underwent a DIEP flap without nerve restoration.

      Intervention: Every subject will undergo a single functional MRI scan in a 7 Tesla MRI scan
      at least six months after the operation. A scanning session takes approximately 75 minutes.
      During the scan, piezo-electric stimulators are applied to both the reconstructed and
      non-operated breast in a fixed pattern. These stimulators stimulate the skin and sensory
      nerves of the breast and nipple-areola complex in a random sequence.

      Main study parameters: The hemodynamic response after stimulation of the skin of the breast
      and nipple-areola complex, representing neuronal activity in that region, is measured. Within
      the somatosensory cortex (S1 and S2), the temporo-spatial brain activity patterns after the
      various stimulation conditions are assessed, and the representation of the breast on the
      somatosensory cortex is mapped.
