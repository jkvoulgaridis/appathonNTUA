  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the microbiome of medicated and non-medicated
      subjects diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. Where available, in comparison to the microbiome
      of a healthy spouse or 1st degree relative.

  <detailed_description>

      First, a cross sectional study where the investigators will compare microbiome composition in
      subsets of PD and Multiple System Atrophy (MSA) patients whose household control agree to
      provide stool samples as well. Each household control subject will be evaluated to ensure
      there is no clinical evidence of neurological disorders including PD. Also, these subjects
      will complete a 24 hour diet recall questionnaire before stool collection and validated 3
      month food frequency questionnaire to collect dietary information similar to PD patients.
      Each subject (including PD subjects) will complete a smell questionnaire and a sleep
      questionnaire to determine whether these &quot;control&quot; subjects have loss of smell or have REM
      sleep disorders because these conditions increase the risk of PD. For assessing smell,
      investigators will use the UPSIT questionnaire. For assessing REM sleep disorder,
      investigators will use RBD1Q which consists of a single question, answered &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no,&quot; as
      follows: &quot;Has the subject ever been told, or suspected themselves that they seem to 'act out
      their dreams' while asleep (for example, punching, flailing their arms in the air, making
      running movements, etc.)?&quot;

      Second, in the longitudinal study, the investigators will collect stool every 3 months with 3
      day diet questionnaire prior to each collection over 12 months and determine microbiome
      composition over time. Investigators will correlate the microbiome data with PD symptoms,
      diet and response to treatment and progression of disease. These studies will determine
      whether disease progression and factors such as PD medications and diet significantly impact
      microbiome composition. Furthermore, the investigators will determine whether changes in
      SCFA-producing bacteria and/or abnormal SCFA profiles correlate with severity of PD symptoms.
