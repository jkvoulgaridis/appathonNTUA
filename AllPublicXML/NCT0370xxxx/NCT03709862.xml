  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Syphilis is an important sexually transmitted infection. There has been an epidemic of
      syphilis amongst men who have sex with men in the United Kingdom in the last decade. Early
      infection with syphilis causes a genital ulcer followed, in the absence of treatment, by a
      generalised illness often accompanied by rash. Studies on syphilis have been limited because
      it is not possible to grow syphilis outside of the body. New approaches allow the whole
      genetic sequence of Treponema pallidum to be obtained from a swab.

      In this study residual DNA collected as part of routine patient care of patients seen at
      sexual health clinics in the UK will be used for sequencing. No patient contact is involved
      in the study which is limited to whole genome sequencing using residual material from
      samples. By better understanding the genome of the T.pallidum insights will be gained in to
      the pathogenesis of this important sexually transmitted disease.

        Patients presenting to sexual health services in UK with a diagnosis of syphilis.

        We will identify residual T.pallidum DNA from routinely collected clinical samples held at
        participating clinics/hospitals. Data accompanying these samples will be anonymised and
        will not include patient identifiable information. Accompanying data will include: city of
        origin, age, gender, HIV status and sexual orientation.
