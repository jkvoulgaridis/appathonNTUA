      Patients with kidney failure have a much higher risk of heart disease compared to people of
      the same age without kidney failure. The reason for this is not fully understood. In this
      project we will use Cardiac MRI (CMR), which is a very detailed scan of the heart and blood
      vessels, to try to better understand the cardiovascular changes that occur in kidney failure.
      We will perform CMR scans in 30 patients before and after dialysis (a treatment for patients
      with kidney failure) to see whether dialysis changes the heart muscle. The same patients will
      also undergo another type of heart scan, called a CT scan. This will allow us to compare the
      pictures from the 2 different types of scan to help us better understand any damage to the
      heart muscle that is present. Finally, we will test a new way to measure hardening of blood
      vessels on CMR. These three studies will help us to better understand the heart and blood
      vessel changes that happen in kidney failure. This research will also be useful for patients
      without kidney failure. We hope to be able to use it in the future to see which new
      treatments might be able to reduce the risk of heart disease in patients with kidney failure.

      Background: Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at a dramatically increased risk
      of cardiovascular disease. This risk is greatest in patients on dialysis and is not explained
      by conventional cardiovascular risk factors. Myocardial fibrosis, so called Cardiomyopathy of
      CKD (CM-CKD), in conjunction with excessive arterial calcification, forms the pathological
      basis for this excess risk. Due to limitations of using myocardial biopsy, combined with the
      inability to use gadolinium-enhanced imaging in patients with advanced CKD, there is an
      urgent need for reliable non-invasive ways of diagnosing and investigating CM-CKD.

      Study participants: Adult patients established on regular hospital-based haemodialysis, with
      evidence of recurrent fluid overload requiring fluid removal by ultrafiltration on dialysis.

      Study design: This is a single centre observational study. We will perform cardiac MRI (CMR),
      contrast CT and blood tests in 30 patients before haemodialysis, with a repeat CMR and blood
      tests post-dialysis.

      Objectives: To assess:

        1. If myocardial native T1 mapping on CMR is affected by fluid status and therefore test
           the validity of T1 mapping as a marker of fibrosis within the dialysis population?

        2. If contrast-enhanced dynamic-equilibrium CT can refine insights into the myocardium in
           CM-CKD?

        3. If novel CMR methods can effectively identify and delineate arterial calcification
           compared to CT?

      Relevance: This project will have immediate clinical relevance by clarifying key questions in
      the diagnosis and investigation of CM-CKD. It will also inform as to the potential role for
      these novel imaging biomarkers as surrogate end-points for use in future clinical trials
      exploring disease specific drug therapies.
