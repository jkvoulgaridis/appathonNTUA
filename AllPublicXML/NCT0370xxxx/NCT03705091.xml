    <textblock>
      Renal transplantation is the optimal method of treatment for end stage kidney disease however
      median lifespan of a kidney transplant is around 15 years. Existing methods of measuring
      transplant function and structure from blood and urine markers are imperfect; renal biopsy is
      often performed but is invasive. Novel methods of investigating transplant function are
      therefore required and emerging renal MRI sequences including ASL and diffusion weighted
      imaging may yield helpful biomarkers. Investigators will recruit 20 patients in the first
      year after transplant and measure MRI biomarkers at three time points, with correlation to
      existing methods of measuring transplant function.

    <textblock>
      Kidney transplantation remains the optimal therapy for patients with end stage kidney disease
      and is associated with significant improvements in life expectancy and quality of life
      compared to subjects receiving dialysis. Despite significant advances in our understanding of
      the immune system and development of drugs to prolong transplant function, a large number
      (Scottish Renal Registry data suggest between 23-35%) of transplants fail in the 10 years
      from operation. This may be due to a number of factors but is often due to development of
      transplant rejection, where the recipient's immune system damages the transplant. Early
      recognition and implementation of therapy is needed to dampen this response, reduce
      irreversible damage and preserve transplant function.

      At present, transplant function and damage is measured using blood and urine tests. These are
      far from perfect markers because there is a delay between transplant damage and abnormalities
      of these tests. This time is vital for the short and long term survival of the transplant.

      In the University of Glasgow, investigators have developed a new type of magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) which allows assessment of kidney blood flow and fibrosis (scarring) without
      the need for administration of harmful contrast agents. Arterial spin labelling magnetic
      resonance imaging (ASL MRI) is a non-invasive method of measuring renal perfusion using
      magnetised blood as endogenous contrast and investigators have validated this technique
      previously in both individuals with and without kidney disease. Diffusion tensor imaging
      (DTI) is another modality of non-contrast MRI which allows measurement of 'stiffness' of
      renal transplants, which represents long term scarring and fibrosis.

      The investigators intend to follow up people receiving a kidney transplant for one year,
      collecting samples of blood, urine, and performing MR imaging at 3 time points, in order to
      investigate novel biomarkers of transplant function and dysfunction.

        Patients who have either recently received, or are undergoing assessment for kidney
        transplantation, will be recruited. Those receiving live donor transplants undergo surgery
        electively and can be approached prior to the time of transplant. Those receiving kidney
        transplants from the waiting list represent the majority of transplant patients, and
        undergo surgery at unpredictable time points depending on the availability of organs. These
        individuals will be approached shortly after transplantation. They will be identified from
        the electronic medical record and approached at the transplant assessment clinic or on the
        transplant ward. A participant information sheet will be given and the patient contacted
        after one week to confirm or refute participation.
