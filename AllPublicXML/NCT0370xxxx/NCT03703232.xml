      The purpose of the study is to obtain feedback about use of a novel prosthetic foot during
      community mobility compared to the participant's usual prosthetic foot. To accomplish this,
      for the participant's usual foot and the investigational foot, participants will complete a
      diary about mobility, describing activities of daily living and their degree of difficulty.
      Global Positioning System (GPS) and accelerometer devices will monitor mobility during that
      time.

      Eligible participants will meet with a researcher and clinical prosthetist to go through the
      consenting process and complete a demographic data questionnaire.

      The prosthetist will assess the condition and fit of the participant's current prosthesis for
      alignment, fit, and condition. The prosthetist will also inspect the participant's residual
      limb for skin condition. People with significant skin breakdown will not be eligible to
      participate. The prosthetist will also determine how best to set up the current socket system
      with the investigational foot at that time, with input from the research participant in case
      any special parts would need to be ordered.

      Then, they will receive a GPS device and accelerometer (step-counter) with assistance in
      fixing it to their prosthetic limb. The ActiGraph wGT3X-BT records 3-axis accelerometer raw
      data as well as calculated activity output variables. The device uses Bluetooth technology to
      send and receive data. Written information will accompany the devices and the logbook. They
      will receive a hard-copy activity log to complete during the study.

      A participant that completes the initial week of data collection with their usual foot will
      return to the University of Washington. The activity monitor and GPS will be replaced. The
      participant will complete the Prosthesis Evaluation standardized questionnaire. The
      prosthetist will fit the new, investigational prosthetic foot prior with the study
      participant's feedback. These are standard procedures in the prosthetic clinic. Alignment of
      the foot occurs in all three anatomical planes. The participant will stand and walk to verify
      correct alignment as evaluated by the licensed prosthetist and with subjective feedback by
      the participant. The participant will practice forward walking, sidesteps, up and downhills,
      up and down stairs, turning, and uneven ground. The participant will receive instructions on
      the new prosthetic foot. If there is an issue or problem the participant is instructed to
      telephone or email the research prosthetist.

      When the prosthetist and participant are satisfied that the participant can walk well with
      the investigational foot, there will be a subsequent 1-week use period. The participant is
      encouraged to perform similar activities compared to their previous week. The participant
      will take their usual foot with them in case there are any problems with the investigational
      foot during the week. The participant will complete a new log book during that time.

      After one week, the participant will again meet with the prosthetist at the University of
      Washington to have their usual foot re-fitted and aligned. Walking gait will be assessed. The
      participant will return the GPS, Actigraph and investigational foot. The participant will
      again complete the Prosthesis Evaluation Questionnaire based on their experiences with the
      investigational foot. Then the participant will be asked to participate in an exit interview.
      They will be asked questions about their experiences, and be asked to compare the different
      feet.

    <description>Self-report questionnaire. PEQ Subscales: The PEQ is a 9-scale instrument that has good psychometric properties and has been validated. The PEQ subscales have a range from 0 (worst) to 100 (best). PEQ subscales of residual limb health, ambulation, utility, and sounds were selected for this study and comprise a total of 24 visual analogue scale questions. ICC estimates for these subscales for the first and second administration ranged from 0.79 to 0.9.(Legro et al., 1988)</description>
