    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-center, single-arm, dose escalation and dose expansion Phase
      I/IIa study designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2
      dose (RP2D), and the safety and tolerability profile along with preliminary signs of efficacy
      of rivoceranib in combination with paclitaxel as a second-line therapy in advanced, recurrent
      and/or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer. This study will also
      characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of rivoceranib and paclitaxel when given in
      combination.

             have provided or can provide tumor tissue prior to screening in this study. This will
             be optional for Phase I patients. Tumor tissue must not have been irradiated.

          4. Patients who have at least 1 measurable lesion as defined by RECIST v1.1. This will be

             last 6 months prior to screening (e.g., myocardial infarction or unstable angina
             pectoris, stroke or transient ischemic attack, or significant peripheral vascular
             diseases) that, in the investigator's opinion, may pose a risk to the patient on VEGFR
             inhibitor therapy.

         21. History of clinically significant glomerulonephritis, biopsy-proven tubulointerstitial
             nephritis, crystal nephropathy, or other renal insufficiencies.
