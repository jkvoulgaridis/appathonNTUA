    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine the effects of an exercise intervention
      and health-education program on brain dopamine receptors and on cognitive functions that have
      been linked to these receptors.

      After completing baseline assessments within 2 wks after admission, participants will be
      randomized to one of two interventions: Exercise (EX, active intervention), consisting of
      3x-weekly 50-min aerobic + resistance-training sessions for 8 wk; Health Education (control
      intervention, CON), consisting of 50-min health education sessions 3x-weekly for 8 wk.
      Participants will undergo positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic
      resonance imaging (fMRI) scans while performing the stop signal task (SST) and the reversal
      learning task (RLT) (cognitive computer tasks) at baseline and after completing the 8-wk
      protocol.

    <description>An individualized aerobic and resistance-exercise program will be developed for each participant on the basis of a maximal incremental exercise test and strength assessments performed at baseline. This test will measure aerobic capacity (VO2 max) and the metabolic or lactate threshold (VO2θ) (i.e., the level of O2 uptake that defines one's ability to perform prolonged work), using indirect calorimetry with an automated metabolic-measurement system. The intervention will comprise 24 sessions over 8 wk (3x/wk), supervised by a credentialed exercise specialist. Each session will consist of a 5-min warm-up, 30-40 min of aerobic activity on a treadmill, 15-20 min of resistance training, and a 5-min cool-down.</description>
