      A study which participants with mild to moderate dry eye disease will have a punctum of one
      eye injected with Restyalne Defyne and the other eye injected with saline solution.
      Participants will be evaluated over four visits.

    <intervention_model_description>Study is set as a single-arm, randomized, single-masked to evaluate Restylane Defyne for canalicular occlusion in participants with mild to moderate dry eye disease. Each participant will have a screening visit, it is then participants will be provided with informed consent form to review and ask questions before written informed consent is obtained. Screening visit occurs 30 days prior to 42 days and will be seen for follow-up exams at 3 , 14 and 42 days.</intervention_model_description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Twenty-one (21) to 80 years of age

          -  Baseline Ocular Surface Disease Index score of at least 13 with no more than 3
             responses of &quot;not applicable&quot; for each eye individually

          -  In the study eye, a baseline Schirmer test with anesthetic of â‰¤ 10 mm/5 minute

          -  Literate, able to speak English and able to complete the questionnaire independently

          -  Willing to sign the informed consent and deemed capable of complying with the
             requirements of the study protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Use of ophthalmic cyclosporine or lifitegrast within 30 days prior to Day 0.

          -  History of surgical punctal occlusion (e.g., cautery), canalicular infection or
             canalicular surgery.

          -  Corneal transplant in either eye

          -  Ocular surgery (such as cataract surgery or LASIK) in either eye within six months of
             the Baseline Visit.

          -  A systemic condition or disease not stabilized or judged by the investigator to be
             incompatible with participation in the study (e.g. current systemic infection,
             uncontrolled autoimmune disease, uncontrolled immunodeficiency disease).

          -  The history or presence of any ocular disorder or condition in either eye that, in the
             opinion of the investigator, would interfere with the interpretation of the study
             results (e.g., significant corneal or conjunctival scarring, pterygium or nodular
             pinguecula; current ocular infection (except mild blepharitis), conjunctivitis or
             inflammation not associated with dry eye; anterior (epithelial) basement membrane
             corneal dystrophy or other clinically significant corneal dystrophy or degeneration;
             history of ocular herpetic infection; evidence of keratoconus; lid or lacrimal cancer.

          -  Active severe systemic allergy, seasonal allergies, rhinitis or sinusitis requiring
             treatment (i.e. antihistamines, decongestants, oral or aerosol steroids).

          -  Use of steroids, including administration by systemic, inhaled or topical ocular
             routes (dermatologic steroids not applied to the eyelids are allowed).

          -  Participation in a clinical trial during the past 30 days

          -  Women who are pregnant, planning a pregnancy, or nursing at study entry
