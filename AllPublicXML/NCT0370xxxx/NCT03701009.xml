    <textblock>
      In recent years, ERCP is the standard procedure to remove the bile duct stones. The big
      stones(&gt;1.2 cm) require additional lithotripsy procedures for complete stone removal.
      Nevertheless, small stone fragments still remain in the common bile duct when the
      cholangiogram shows normal. The fragments are too small to be verified. These retained
      fragments may cause recurrence of stones. Another way to demonstrate residual CBD stones is
      to use intraductal ultrasonography (IDUS). However, IDUS has limited availability in clinical
      practice. The single-operator cholangioscopy (SOC)-system Spyglass gains widespread
      acceptance because of its independent washing channels and direct viewing. The investigators
      used Spyglass to detect if saline(50 or 100ml) infusion might clear the bile duct fragments
      after ERCP. Saline irrigation has many advantages such as easy stone removal, no additional
      cost and rare side effects. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the usefulness of saline
      solution irrigation in decreasing residual CBD stones.

    <description>After CBD stone removal via lithotripsy, and the cholangiogram showed normal, residual CBD stones were detected by SpyGlass in the first round, if CBD not clean, sterile saline 50ml were intermittently irrigated into the CBD. After that, if bile duct clearance was not achieved, another 50ml saline will be irrigated into CBD again until the clear bile duct determined by SpyGlass.</description>
