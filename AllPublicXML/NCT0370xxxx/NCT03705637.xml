    <textblock>
      Burn injuries are painful to patients and the sources of pain result from many areas
      including: the injury itself, wound care, and surgery. Inpatients that require surgical skin
      grafting is often required and the donor site of a skin graft is quite painful for patients.
      The investigators try to minimize that pain with local anesthetic as well as a combination of
      pain medications, the donor site pain lasts for days and is what patients often report as
      being the most painful part of their burn care.

      There has been the development of a new form of local anesthesia that can last up to 72 hours
      when injected into tissue. Based on encouraging results in the literature in areas outside of
      burns, this study aims to evaluate whether administration of this medication at the time of
      surgery can help improve pain for burn patients in the postoperative period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients suffer from pain resulting from the injury, wound care, and surgical treatment of
      their burns. As a result, they often require considerable amounts of narcotics. Given the
      concern for opiate addiction and the national opiate crisis the investigators have tried to
      explore other non-opiate means of pain control. One of the newest methods for pain relief is
      with liposomal bupivacaine, which can provide local analgesia for up to 72 hours at the site
      of injection. This medication has been used with good effect in multiple contexts.

      Skin graft donor sites are the most painful portion of their surgical treatment and the pain
      typically is most severe during the first few days after surgery. For this reason, the
      investigators believe the addition of Exparel to the donor site will help with improved
      multi-modal pain control, making patients more comfortable. It also may decrease opiate
      requirements which would be beneficial for burn patients.

      Few previous studies have been conducted using Exparel at the donor sites of skin grafted
      burn patients. One case series compares usage of Exparel from two different institutions,
      however the sample size at each was relatively small (n=20, 5, respectively). Their findings
      suggest that Exparel may be an effective way of managing postsurgical donor site pain. Based
      on these limited data there is a need for more robust studies, which is the motivation for
      doing this larger evaluation of patients.

      The investigators believe that the use of Exparel can decrease pain for patients after
      surgery, in particular at their skin graft donor sites. The investigators want to conduct
      this study to evaluate whether Exparel can improve pain control for their patients and
      decrease their need for opiate narcotics.

    <description>Donor sites will receive up to 50mg of 0.25marcaine with epinephrine injected uniformly into the wound.
The donor site will also receive one bottle (266mg) of Exparel, diluted to be administered uniformly into the entire donor site, spaced out ever 3-4cm. The dilution will be as follows:
o 20ml Exparel + 10ml injectable 0.9% NS (30ml) for every 100cm2 of donor site.
Injection of local anesthesia will be performed after the donor site has been harvested and is hemostatic. The goal is to provide the maximum time possible for the local anesthetic to work while under anesthesia, so it can benefit the patient and not be administered at the end of the case just prior to extubation.</description>
