      Aim of the study is to evaluate efficacy of freestyle Libre system (flash glucose monitoring)
      in real life in term of Glycated Haemoglobin reduction and acceptance of the system evaluated
      through validated questionnaires after 3 and 6 months of device's use.

      Freestyle Libre is a new technology developed to monitor glycemic values in diabetic
      patients.

      The system is available in Italy from 2014 but in Veneto region reimbursement for insulin
      treated diabetic patients is available from august 2017.

      International trial (for example Impact trial) demonstrated efficacy of the system (reduction
      of the time spent in hypoglycemia).

      Aim of this study is to evaluate efficacy in real life in term of glycated haemoglobin
      (HbA1c) reduction. The investigators will enrollee in this trial all type 1 diabetic patients
      that will start to use the system, on the basis of clinicians decisions and reimbursement
      criteria.

      Investigators will evaluate changes in HbA1c and changes in hypoglycameia fear and therapy
      acceptance through validated questionnaires after 3 and 6 months of system use

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female participants of at least 18 years of age

          -  Diagnosis of type 1 diabetes mellitus (diagnosed according to World Health
             Organization criteria) for at least 1 year

          -  Availability to wear Freestyle Libre sensor

          -  Signature of informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy, breastfeeding, intention to undergo pregnancy

          -  Known allergies to skin patches or disinfectants used during the study.

          -  Skin lesions, irritation, redness, edema in sites where sensors can be applied, as
             this might interfere with sensor's placement

          -  Use of drugs that may interfere with glucose metabolism (such as steroids) unless they
             are chronic therapies whose dosage has remained stable over the past 3 months and is
             expected to remain stable during the study period.

          -  Severe medical or psychological conditions, which, in the opinion of the medical team,
             may compromise patients' safety while using freestyle LIbre sensor

          -  Patients enrolled in other clinical trials.

          -  patients that usually wear other continuous glucose monitoring system
