    <textblock>
      The purpose of this post market surveillance is to continue monitoring the safety and
      effectiveness of the Berlin Heart EXCOR® Pediatric. This surveillance includes an
      &quot;all-comers&quot; prospective cohort of pediatric (&lt;22 years of age) patients implanted according
      to the IFU with the EXCOR® Pediatric.

      The Advanced Cardiac Therapies Improving Outcomes Network (Action) database will be used for
      the surveillance. The network was developed to determine best practice and improve quality in
      the pediatric mechanical circulatory support field. The registry Protocol and Manual of
      Operations will be followed by participating pediatric transplant hospitals. Quality
      assurance of the data will be monitored by the registry's data coordinating center.

    <description>The primary endpoint is to demonstrate that the rate of stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) will be no worse than the pre-specified performance goal. The rate will be calculated as the proportion of subjects experiencing a stroke while on EXCOR® Pediatric support within the first 180 days post-implant. The upper bound of the 95% confidence interval for the observed stroke rate will be compared to the pre-specified performance goal of 30%.</description>
