    <measure>Changes in The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale17 (HAM-D17) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 2, 4, 8</time_frame>
    <description>Hamilton Depression Rating Scale17 is a test measuring the severity of depressive symptoms in individuals. It is often used as an outcome measure of depression in research. In the 17-item version, nine of the items are scored on a five-point scale, ranging from 0 to 4. The remaining eight items are scored on a three-point scale. For the 17-item version, scores can range from 0 to 54. Scores from 0 to 6 indicate no depression, scores between 7 and 17 indicate mild depression, scores between 18 and 24 indicate moderate depression, and scores over 24 indicate severe depression.</description>

    <measure>Changes in The Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 2, 4, 8</time_frame>
    <description>The HAM-A consists of 14 items, each defined by a series of symptoms, and measures both psychic anxiety (mental agitation and psychological distress) and somatic anxiety (physical complaints related to anxiety). Scores range from 0 to 56 where 14-17 indicates mild anxiety, 18-24 indicates moderate anxiety and scores of 25 and over indicate severe anxiety.</description>
