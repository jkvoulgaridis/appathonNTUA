  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acne vulgaris is a disease caused my multiple factors including overgrowth of bacteria,
      clogged pores, excessive sebum production and hormonal changes. Recent literature from the
      Human Microbiome Project has shown there are bacterial strains specific to healthy and acne
      disease states (Fitz-Gibbon et al, 2013, Johnson et al, 2016, McDowell et al, 2012, Tomida et
      al, 2013)

      From this data, the investigators hypothesize that by eliminating disease-associated
      bacterial strains and replacing them with health-associated strains, recurrences or flares of
      acne may be improved, mitigated, and prevented. Instead of current approaches which focus on
      eliminating all bacteria from the skin, the investigators aim to deliver healthy bacteria to
      restore the skin to a healthy state via this replacement therapy.

      The investigators aim to test this in a Phase Ib multiple application study evaluating the
      safety, tolerability, and clinical impact that a multiple applications of NB01 have on adult
      subjects with moderate acne.
