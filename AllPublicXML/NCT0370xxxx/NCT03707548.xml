      With this project investigators focus on the evaluation whether bodily disturbances in
      post-treatment cancer patients can be influenced positively by group BPT and if intermittent
      smartphone-triggered bodily interventions are effective.

      Background: Disturbances in bodily wellbeing represent one key aspect of psychosocial
      impairments related to cancer. Therefore, interventions to improve bodily wellbeing in
      post-treatment cancer patients are important.

      Objectives: This project aims at two goals:

        1. Investigators want to evaluate whether bodily disturbances in post-treatment cancer
           patients can be influenced positively by group BPT (Non-randomized evaluation of a
           weekly group BPT using a waiting-period comparator).

        2. In addition the efficacy of intermittent smartphone-triggered bodily interventions is
           assessed with a nested RCT to evaluate short-term efficacy of smartphone-triggered
           bodily interventions.

      Study design: The project follows the outline of a non-randomized evaluation of a weekly
      group BPT using a waiting-period comparator, with a nested randomized controlled trial (RCT)
      to evaluate the short-term efficacy of smartphone-triggered bodily interventions.

      Study flow:

        -  Participants will first undergo a waiting period (duration at least 6 weeks) followed by
           the group BPT (6 weekly sessions, 90 minutes each).

        -  During the group BPT, either a smartphone-triggered bodily intervention or a
           smartphone-triggered control intervention will be provided at random (randomization on a
           daily basis) over a period of 5 consecutive weeks on 6 days per week. This will result
           in 15 smartphone-triggered bodily interventions and 15 smartphone-triggered control
           interventions, which each patient will undergo.

      Measurement points: Patients will be surveyed at three points in time (initial consultation,
      pre- and post-intervention). Standardized questionnaires will be used to measure patients'
      body disturbances, body image, body mindfulness, physical complaints, quality of life,
      vitality, mental health, anxiety and depression and to explore the effects of BPT on bodily
      disturbances and body image in post-treatment cancer patients.

    <measure>Changes in bodily disturbances assessed by questionnaires</measure>
    <time_frame>Questionnaire at baseline and 6 weeks after baseline (=after the waiting period;pre-therapy) and 14 weeks after baseline (=post-therapy)</time_frame>
    <description>self-perception of change in appearance and displeasure with change or perceived change in appearance; assessed via Body Image Scale (BIS). BIS total score is calculated by adding the score obtained on each item, yielding a possible range from 0-30. Higher scores indicate a higher degree of body image dissatisfaction.</description>

    <time_frame>applied twice on each training day of the smartphone-triggered interventions: first directly preceding, second directly following the smartphone-triggered interventions</time_frame>
    <description>bodily wellbeing is assessed by Multidimensional Mood Questionnaire (MDMQ). 3 scales are calculated: &quot;good-bad&quot;, and &quot;awake-tired&quot;, &quot;calm-nervous&quot;. Scores are calculated by adding the score obtained on each item, yielding a possible range from 4-20 in each scale. Higher values represent a better outcome.</description>

    <description>assessed by Body Mindfulness Questionnaire (BMQ). 2 scales are calculated: &quot;Experiencing Body Awareness&quot;, and &quot;Appreciating Body Awareness&quot;.

    <measure>Changes in somatic symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Questionnaire at baseline and 6 weeks after baseline (=after the waiting period;pre-therapy) and 14 weeks after baseline (=post-therapy)</time_frame>
    <description>somatic symptoms are assessed by the EORTC QLQ-C30 (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire - Core 30 items). All scales and single-item measures range in scores from 0 to 100. A high score represents a high level of symptomatology. The following somatic symptom scales are calculated: fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain, dyspnoea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhoea. The principle for scoring these scales is the same in all cases: 1.The average of the items that contribute to the scale is estimated; this is the raw score. 2. A linear transformation is used to standardise the raw score, so that scores range from 0 to 100.</description>

    <measure>Changes in somatic symptom disorder-B criteria</measure>
    <time_frame>Questionnaire at baseline and 6 weeks after baseline (=after the waiting period;pre-therapy) and 14 weeks after baseline (=post-therapy)</time_frame>
    <description>somatic symptom disorder-B criteria are assessed by Somatic Symptom Disorder-B Criteria Scale (SSD-12). 1 total score and 3 subscores are calculated: &quot;cognitive aspects&quot;, &quot;affective aspects&quot;, and &quot;behavioral aspects&quot;. Scores are calculated by adding the score obtained on each item. Range for subscales: 0-16; range for total score: 0-48; higher scores are representing greater severity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in depression</measure>
    <time_frame>Questionnaire at baseline and 6 weeks after baseline (=after the waiting period;pre-therapy) and 14 weeks after baseline (=post-therapy)</time_frame>

    <time_frame>Questionnaire at baseline and 6 weeks after baseline (=after the waiting period;pre-therapy) and 14 weeks after baseline (=post-therapy)</time_frame>
    <description>mental health is assessed by the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) - scale mental health. Items in the scale are averaged together to create the mental health score. Range from 0 to 100, a higher score defining a more favorable health state.</description>

    <measure>Changes in quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>Questionnaire at baseline and 6 weeks after baseline (=after the waiting period;pre-therapy) and 14 weeks after baseline (=post-therapy)</time_frame>
    <description>quality of life is assessed by European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire - Core 30 items (EORTC QLQ-C30). The following scales are computed: global health status/quality of life, physical functioning, role functioning, emotional functioning, cognitive functioning, and social functioning. All scales range in scores from 0 to 100. A high score for a functional scale represents a high level of functioning, a high score for the global health status represents a high quality of life. The principle for scoring these scales is the same in all cases: 1.The average of the items that contribute to the scale is estimated; this is the raw score. 2. A linear transformation is used to standardise the raw score, so that scores range from 0 to 100.</description>

    <time_frame>Questionnaire at baseline and 6 weeks after baseline (=after the waiting period;pre-therapy) and 14 weeks after baseline (=post-therapy)</time_frame>
    <description>suicidal tendency is assessed by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II), Item I: Suicidal tendency. Range from 0 to 3, a higher value representing a higher suicidal tendency.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in bodily disturbances assessed by semistructured interview</measure>
    <time_frame>qualitative assessment at baseline and 14 weeks after baseline (=post-therapy)</time_frame>

    <measure>Change in group cohesion</measure>
    <time_frame>assessed 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 weeks after baseline directly after each group session</time_frame>
    <description>Group cohesion is assessed by the Group Climate Questionnaire - Short Form (GCQ-S). The questionnaire consists of a total score and 3 subscales (all ranges from 0 to 6): Scale 1: Engaged: This describes the positive working group atmosphere. Scale 2: Conflict: This reflects anger and tension in the group. Scale 3: Avoiding: This describes behaviors indicating avoidance of personal responsibility of group work by the members. Higher values represent a higher degree in engagement, conflict, or avoiding. Scales scores are determined by calculating the mean of the relevant items.</description>
