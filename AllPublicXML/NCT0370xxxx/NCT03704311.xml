      This pilot study established a minimally invasive biopsy technique to obtain high-quality
      MTrP tissue samples to evaluate mitochondrial function via high-resolution respirometry.

      Myofascial trigger points (MTrPs) are hyperirritable areas in the fascia of the affected
      muscle, possibly related to mitochondrial impairment. They can result in pain and hypoxic
      areas within the muscle. This pilot study established a minimally invasive biopsy technique
      to obtain high-quality MTrP tissue samples to evaluate mitochondrial function via
      high-resolution respirometry. Secondary objectives included the safety of the biopsy
      procedure assessed via clinical wound healing (number of patients with signs for local
      infection and inflammation). For this purpose, twenty healthy males participated in this
      study, 10 with a diagnosis of myofascial pain in the musculus (m.) trapezius MTrP (TTP group)
      and 10 with a diagnosis of myofascial pain in the m. gluteus medius (GTP group). The affected
      muscle was biopsied followed by a biopsy from the vastus lateralis to be used as a control.
      Measurements of oxygen consumption were carried out using high-resolution respirometry.

    <description>Local anesthesia was applied to the superficial skin covering the MTrP of each participant. Percutaneous biopsy sampling optimized with a suction-enhancement technique was used to obtain muscle biopsies of the m. trapezius MTrP or the m. gluteus medius MTrP from each participant using small Bergstrom muscle biopsy needle, 8 swg (4.0mm) x 100 mm (Dixons Surgical Instruments, Essex, United Kingdom).</description>
