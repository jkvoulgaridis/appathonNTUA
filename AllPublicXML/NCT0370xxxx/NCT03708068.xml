  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Enteral nutrition in preterm infants is usually started and advanced slowly until reaching
      full enteral feeds. Most preterm infants born before 34 weeks gestation require parenteral
      fluids to maintain normal blood sugar level and prevent excessive weight loss and
      dehydration. Availability of donor human milk (DHM) along with low incidence of necrotizing
      enterocolitis (NEC) in preterm infants born at 30-33 weeks have encouraged neonatologists to
      start feeding early and advance it faster in order to shorten time on parenteral nutrition
      (PN) and minimize the need for intravenous access. The objectives of this trial is to study
      whether exclusive enteral nutrition from day of birth (i.e. no PN) results in shorter time to
      achieve full enteral feed when compared with traditional feeding regimen that involves a
      combination of PN and progressive enteral feeding.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Early nutritional support of preterm infants born at 30-33 weeks gestation is usually
      achieved via a combination of parenteral nutrition (PN) and enteral feeding that is advanced
      over few days to reach full enteral feed. Recent studies suggest that rapid increase of
      enteral feed volumes results in shorter duration on PN and earlier achievement of full
      enteral feed without increasing the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) or death.
      Although PN has an important role in nutrition of preterm infants, it is associated with
      increased risk of metabolic and infectious complications even when it is used for a short
      period of time. Furthermore, PN mandates the need for peripheral or central intravenous
      access. Provision of full enteral feed volume that meets reference daily fluid intake from
      day of birth is used frequently and successfully in stable preterm infants born after 33
      weeks. Expanding the use of this regimen to stable preterm infants born at 30-33 weeks
      gestation may help avoid unnecessary start of intravenous access, prevent complications
      related to PN, and encourage mother-infant bonding experience.
