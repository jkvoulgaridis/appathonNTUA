    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the local tolerability and the systemic availability
      of benzydamine, if any, after single and multiple dose treatment with the test formulation
      containing cetylpyridinium chloride 0.05% + benzydamine hydrochloride 0.15% + mucoadhesive
      polymer and with the reference formulation Tantum Verde Bocca containing cetylpyridinium
      chloride 0.05% + benzydamine hydrochloride 0.15% to healthy subjects , under fasting
      conditions, in two consecutive study periods.
