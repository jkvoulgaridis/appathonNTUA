  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      24 healthy volunteers will be immunized with three times 50 L3 larvae or placebo followed by
      treatment with albendazol and subsequently challenged with twice 50 L3 larvae.

      24 healthy hookworm-naive volunteers will be randomized in a 2:1 allocation to either the
      intervention group or placebo. Volunteers in the intervention group will be immunized three
      times with 50 L3 larvae of Necator americanus with three-week intervals. Two weeks after each
      immunization, volunteers will be treated with albendazole. Four weeks after the last
      treatment all volunteers are challenged with controlled human hookworm infection consisting
      of two doses of 50 L3 larvae with a two week interval. 16 weeks after the first challenge all
      volunteers will be treated with albendazole, except up to four volunteers who will be asked
      to remain as chronic donors for future hookworm studies.

    <intervention_model_description>Volunteers are randomized into either the intervention or the placebo group (2:1 allocation). The two groups run parallel in the trial.

    <masking_description>Participant, clinical trial physicians and laboratory personnel are blinded for treatment allocation. Blinding is maintained by exposing the volunteers in the placebo group to a mock infection with water. During the trial clinical trial physicians are blinded to the outcome measures (i.e. Kato-Katz outcomes), laboratory staff are blinded for the study code of samples delivered.</masking_description>

          3. Known allergy to amphotericin B or gentamicin.

          5. Positive faecal qPCR for hookworm at screening, any known history of hookworm
             infection or treatment for hookworm infection.

          6. Being an employee or student of the department of Parasitology of the LUMC.
