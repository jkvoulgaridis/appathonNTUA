  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is conducted to demonstrate non-inferiority in the immunogenicity of the liquid
      formulation of ROTAVIN in comparison to currently licensed frozen formulation of the Vaccine
      (ROTAVIN-M1), 28 days after the second vaccination when administered as two dose series
      starting at 2-3 months of age.

      The study will also assess the reactogenicity of the vaccine 7 days after each vaccination
      and safety from first vaccination up to 4 weeks after the last vaccination.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed as a phase III, randomized, partially double-blinded, active controlled
      study with two groups of infants receiving vaccines at the ratio of 2:1 (550 participants
      receiving the liquid formulation of ROTAVIN and 275 participants receiving the frozen
      formulation ROTAVIN-M1), to compare their immunogenicity and safety. Two doses of vaccine
      will be administered 8 weeks apart with the first vaccine administration between 60-91 days
      of age. All childhood vaccines as per the Expanded Program for Immunization of the Government
      of Vietnam (including Diphtheria, Tetanus, Pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae type b and
      Hepatitis B vaccine (DTwPHib-HepB), and OPV at at 2, 3 and 4 months of age) will be allowed
      as per the immunization schedule.

      Active surveillance for vaccine reactogenicity (solicited reactions) over the 7-day period
      after each vaccination, unsolicited AEs for 4 weeks after each vaccination and SAEs including
      intussusception over the period between first vaccination and four weeks after the last
      vaccination will be conducted for all infants.

      This trial will generate immunogenicity and safety data which would be submitted to Ministry
      of Health in Vietnam for license of new formulation of ROTAVIN vaccine.
