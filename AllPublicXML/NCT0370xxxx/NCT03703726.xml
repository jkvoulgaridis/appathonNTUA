  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Food fortification is regarded as a safe and cost-effective approach to counteract and
      prevent iron deficiency. Rice is a staple food for millions of people living in regions where
      iron-deficiency anaemia is a significant public health problem. Therefore, rice may be a
      promising fortification vehicle.

      Hot and cold extrusion, have been identified as the major methods for rice fortification.
      Extruded rice has the advantage of incorporating vitamins and minerals into the food matrix.

      Cold, warm and hot extrusion differ in the processing temperature and the physical structure
      of fortified rice kernel matrix. A recent human study in young women showed fractional iron
      absorption was higher in cold extruded rice compared to hot extruded Rice and this was
      associated with changes in the starch microstructure. These changes cannot be detected in
      warm extruded rice, thus, our aim is to test the iron bioavailability in difference extrusion
      methods; hot and warm and cold with and without the solubilizing agent CA/TSC. This will
      provide information on optimized rice formulations for optimal iron delivery.
