  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the efficiency of transversus abominus plane (TAP) block using
      liposomal bupivacaine versus plain bupivacaine that is administered in the operating room
      under ultrasound guidance prior to the in patients undergoing abdominally-based free flap
      breast reconstruction at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.

    <measure>Comparison of WHODAS 2.0 score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and post operative day 30</time_frame>
    <description>WHODAS 2.0 is a validated instrument to assess health status and disability across different cultures and settings. This instrument assess 6 domains; cognition, mobility, self-care, getting along, life activities, and participation. The WHODAS 2.0 score ranges from 0 (no disability) to 100 (full disability).</description>

    <measure>Comparison of PROMIS-29 score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 7, 14 and 30 days after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS-29 (version 2) is a self administered validated instrument to assess seven health domains: physical function, anxiety, depression, fatigue, sleep disturbance, pain interference, and ability to participate in social roles and activities. Each of the seven domains has four questions which are scored on a five-point Likert scale. In addition, pain intensity is measured with a single item on an 11-point numeric scale (NPRS) that ranges from 0 to 10. A score of 50 points represents the population average for each scale, and 10 points represent one standard deviation. Higher scores mean more of the specific scale's construct, which may indicate a desirable or an undesirable outcome.</description>

    <description>Local analgesia (TAP blocks) will be administered under ultrasound guidance in the operating room after the patient is intubated and under general anesthesia. Under sterile conditions and ultrasound guidance, the fascial plane between the internal oblique and transversus abdominis muscles (muscles of the abdominal wall) will be identified at the anterior axillary line, midway between the costal margin and iliac crest. The epidural needle will be inserted through the skin to the appropriate fascial plane, and the local anesthetic will be injected in that plane. 20mL of Exparel® 1.3% mixed with 20mL of 0.25% bupivacaine, for a total of 40mL of local anesthestic mixture, 20mL to be injected on each side.</description>
