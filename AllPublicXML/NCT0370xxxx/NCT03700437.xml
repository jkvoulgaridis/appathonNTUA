      The purpose of this study is to learn the effects of fasting on cancer cells during
      chemo-immunotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancer cells use an increased supply of glucose to make energy and do not have protection
      against fasting that normal cells do. Because of this, researchers would like to study how
      fasting may help chemotherapy target cancer cells instead of normal cells. Initial studies
      suggest that fasting may decrease the side effects of chemotherapy and increase the chances
      of your cancer responding to the chemotherapy. Patient populations will have non-small cell
      lung cancer in which chemo-immunotherapy with carboplatin/pemetrexed and pembrolizumab have
      been recommended to treat the cancer as part of standard care.

      Primary Objective

      1. To determine the effect of fasting-mimicking diet (FMD) on circulating tumor cells (CTCs)
      in patients with advanced NSCLC receiving chemo-immunotherapy

        1. To compare an absolute reduction and/or a percentage reduction in CTCs in patients
           receiving FMD compared to regular diet (RD)

        2. To assess DNA damage via measurement of γ-Η2ΑΧ foci in CTCs compared to PBMCs of
           patients receiving FMD or RD

      Secondary Objectives

        1. To determine the clinical efficacy of FMD compared to RD by comparing the response rate
           (RR) and progression-free survival (PFS)

        2. To demonstrate the safety profile of FMD in conjunction with chemo-immunotherapy

      Correlative Objectives

        1. To demonstrate an increase in platinum lesions measured by ICP mass spectrometry in
           tumor tissue (when available) and PBMCs of patients receiving FMD compared to RD

        2. To demonstrate increase in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in patients undergoing FMD
           compared to RD by obtaining optional tumor tissue samples (when available)

        3. To determine effect of FMD on immune regulation compared to RD

        4. To demonstrate change in FDG avidity in patients receiving FMD compared to RD when
           optional post-treatment PET scans are available

        5. To determine compliance to FMD

        6. To determine effect of FMD on QoL compared to RD
