  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Darvadstrocel for the treatment of
      complex perianal fistulas in adult patients with Crohn's disease over 24 weeks.

      The product being tested in this study is called Darvadstrocel (Cx601). This study will
      assess the efficacy for 24 and 52 weeks, and safety for 156 weeks of Darvadstrocel when
      administered with intralesional injection in adult patients with Crohn's disease whose
      complex perianal fistulas were previously treated and refractory.

      The study will enroll 20 participants. All participants who will meet the criteria will be
      assigned to screening period for approximately 5 weeks and after that will be enrolled the
      treatment period which will be the day of study product administration. After the treatment
      period, this study will include the follow-up period for approximately 52 weeks after study
      product administration, and the long-term follow-up period from Week 52 to Week 156.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Japan. The overall time to participate is
      totally approximately 156 weeks (3 years) from the start of treatment period plus follow-up
      and long-term follow-up period. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic and a
      final visit 156 weeks after treatment of study product for a follow-up assessment.

    <ipd_description>Takeda makes patient-level, de-identified data sets and associated documents available for all interventional studies after applicable marketing approvals and commercial availability have been received (or program is completely terminated), an opportunity for the primary publication of the research and final report development has been allowed, and other criteria have been met as set forth in Takeda's Data Sharing Policy (see www.TakedaClinicalTrials.com for details). To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias. Once approved, qualified researchers who sign a data sharing agreement are provided access to these data in a secure research environment.</ipd_description>
