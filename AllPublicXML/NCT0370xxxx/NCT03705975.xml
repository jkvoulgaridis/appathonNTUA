    <textblock>
      This study aim was to compare the effectiveness of manual treatment and proprioceptive
      neuromuscular fasilitation (PNF) techniques in patients with adhesive capsulitis. One group
      will receive classical physical therapy including hotpack,ultrason and in additon manual
      treatment application. Other group receive classical physical therapy including hotpack,
      ultrason and in addition PNF techniques. Two group will be made wand exercise at home three
      times a day 10 times at one session.

      There is no consensus physical therapy treatment protocol in adhesive capsulitis. It is
      because it etiology and pathophysiology is unknown. Also it has different clinical stage. PNF
      techniques often used by physical therapist in adhesive capsulitis aim increasing range of
      motion, improving muscle strenght and decreasing pain. PNF techniques improves neuromusculer
      control of central nervous system via stimulating muscle spindles, golgi tendon organs and
      other receptors in connective tissue. However, there is limited evidence effectivenes of PNF
      techniques in adhesive capsulitis.

      Other technique often used by physical therapist in adhesive capsulitis is manual treatment.
      Manual treatment decreases pain and improves function. It re-arrange glenohumeral joint
      arthrocinematic. It diminishes capsule fibrosis.

      There is no reasearh aimed comparing the PNF and manual treatment. Our aim was to compare the
      effectiveness of manual treatment and PNF techiques in patients with adhesive capsulitis.

    <measure>Subjective pain assessment: VAS</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline subjective pain assessment at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Rest, activity and night pain will be assessed by Visuel Analog Scale (VAS). It is self reported pain scale.We will question the intensty of shoulder region pain at rest, night and activity by VAS. The pain intensity was scored on a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS) where 0 cm indicated &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 cm indicated &quot;worst imaginable pain.</description>

    <measure>Health quality depent on health</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline health quality assessment at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Health quality depent on health will be assessed using the &quot;Quality of Life (SF-36)&quot; questionnare. Assesses 8 dimensions of health with 36 items such as physical function, social function, role constraints, mental health, vitality (energy), pain and general perception of health. Each subsection of the quality of life questionnaire is scored between 0 and 100 points. Higher score indicates better outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health quality is not related to health</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline health quality assessment at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Health quality is not related to health will be assessed using the &quot; World Health Organization Quality of Life Assessment (EUROHIS-QOL)&quot;. It contains 8 questions. Two of the questions include general health and general quality of life questions, while the remaining 6 questions consist of questions about physical, spiritual, environmental and social dimensions.These questions how long the patient has experienced some things in the last two weeks, what they can do, whether it is good or satisfying, what they think about the quality of life, health and other aspects of life. The total score is calculated by summing the items. The total score is between 8 and 40 points. Higher score indicate worse outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>general health level</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline general health level assessment at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>general healt level will be assessed using &quot;Health Assessment Questionnaire&quot;. Health Assessment Questionnare two to three questions in each of eight areas of activities of daily living (ADL): dressing and grooming, arising. eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and activities. The total score ranges between 0-24. The highest score indicate more disability level.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self rated upper extremity disablity and symptoms.</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline general health level assessment at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Self rated upper extremity disablity and symptoms will be assessed using the &quot;Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand Questionnaire (DASH)&quot; survey. 30 items (total score): 6 items about symptoms (3 about pain, 1 for tingling/numb-ness, 1 for weakness, 1 for stiffness) and 24 about function (21 about physical function, 3 about social/role function). The patients point out the appropriate response between 1-5 points according to the Likert system for each question (1: no difficulty, 2: mild difficulty, 3: moderate difficulty, 4: extreme difficulty, 5: no disability). A score of 0-100 points is obtained from each section according to the results of the DASH survey ( 0=no disability, 100=most severe disability). 0 score indicate best and 100 score indicate worst outcome. Higher values represent worse outcome.</description>

    <time_frame>Change from baseline general health level assessment at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Self-assessment of symptoms and function of the shoulder will be assessed using the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI).The SPADI total score is the unweightedmean of the pain and function subscores.Originally, 0 score indicate best and 100 score indicate worst.</description>
