    <textblock>
      IMPULSE is a prospective, single-arm, multi-center, safety and feasibility study evaluating
      the IOWA Approach Endocardial Ablation System (FARAPULSE, Inc.) for the treatment of
      paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing catheter ablation for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation will be screened for
      enrollment per protocol inclusion and exclusion criteria. Enrolled patients will then undergo
      ablation using the IOWA Approach Endocardial Ablation System (FARAPULSE, Inc.). Subjects will
      be followed at 7 days, 30 days, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months with a blanking period for
      recurrent atrial fibrillation or atrial tachycardia of 3 months following the PEF catheter
      ablation procedure.
