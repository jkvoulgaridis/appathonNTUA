      Study aiming at testing the positive predictive value of the Hevylite blood test in detecting
      minimal residual disease in myeloma compared to an invasive method requiring bone marrow
      sample by multi-parametric flow cytometry

      Multiple Myeloma is a pathology for which treatments are constantly progressing. These
      treatments allow more and more patients to reach deeper and deeper responses. Currently, it
      is possible to detect very low levels of disease : this is called the evaluation of minimal
      residual disease. Its prognostic value is strong.

      Two techniques currently prevail in the evaluation of minimal residual disease: high
      throughput sequencing (NGS) and multi-parameter flow cytometry. They are included in
      evaluation criteria defined by the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG). These
      techniques have the advantage of being very sensitive, reaching 10-5 (cytometry: 50 events
      among 5 000 000 cells analysed) to 10-6 (NGS). Nevertheless, they are invasive for the
      patient (medullary specimen), require technical expertise and are not necessarily available
      in all hospitals.

      The development of blood tests would cope with this constraints.

      The Hevylite® assay is a simple, sensitive, automated and inexpensive immunologic technique
      that allows the accurate quantification of total IgG, Total IgG, Total IgA, Total IgA L,
      Total IgM, and Total IgM in the blood. Given its characteristics, the Hevylite assay could
      play a role in the definition of MRD and allow evaluation of residual disease in myeloma.

      This study aims to evaluate the positive predictive value of the Hevylite test in the
      evaluation of residual disease in myeloma in comparison with multiparametric flow cytometry
      on the bone marrow.
