  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial to test the effects on long-term weight loss of a novel
      stigma-reduction intervention combined with standard BWL treatment, as compared to BWL alone.
      Participants will be a total of 104 men and women seeking weight loss, ages 18 years and
      older, with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m2 or above (or 27 kg/m2 or above with an
      obesity-related comorbidity), a history of experiencing weight bias, and elevated levels of
      WBI. Participants will attend a screening visit in which they will complete a behavioral
      evaluation with a psychologist and a medical history that will be reviewed by a nurse
      practitioner or physician. Questionnaires assessing experiences and internalization of weight
      bias, with confirmation by interviewer assessment during the behavioral evaluation, will be
      used to determine whether participants meet criteria for having high levels of WBI. Eligible
      consenting participants will be randomly assigned to the standard BWL intervention (n = 52)
      or the stigma + BWL intervention (n = 52). All participants will attend weekly, 90-minute
      group meetings for 20 weeks (20 visits). In the stigma + BWL treatment group, 60 minutes will
      be devoted to BWL and 30 minutes to weight stigma. In the standard BWL treatment group, the
      additional 30 minutes will be devoted to sharing recipes and food preparation tips. Following
      20 weeks of weight loss treatment, participants will attend group meetings focused on weight
      loss maintenance, monthly from weeks 21-46 (6 visits), and every-other-month from weeks 47-72
      (3 visits). Maintenance sessions in the stigma + BWL group will continue to incorporate
      discussion of WBI and stigma-related barriers to physical activity. Assessments - which
      include questionnaires, blood draws, and measurements of body weight and physical activity -
      will occur at baseline and weeks 20, 46 (no blood draw this week), and 72. Weight will be
      measured at every group meeting for clinical purposes.

    <description>Participants in this group will receive the standard behavioral weight loss (BWL) program, which will be combined with a stigma-reduction intervention (more details provided in the Intervention section). All group meetings will be 90 minutes. Beginning at week 5, the 60-minute BWL sessions will be followed by 30 minutes devoted to stigma-related content. In the monthly and every-other-month weight loss maintenance sessions from weeks 21-72, strategies for coping with weight stigma and challenging internalized beliefs will be reviewed, and participants will be encouraged to use these strategies specifically with physical activity.</description>

    <description>Session topics will be based on those tested in a previous pilot study, including: psychoeducation about weight and weight stigma; challenging myths and cognitive distortions related to weight; strategies for coping with instances of stigma; and increasing empowerment and body esteem. The effects of weight stigma on health behaviors will be discussed, and sessions will focus specifically on helping participants overcome stigma-related barriers to physical activity. For example, they will be given strategies to cope with anticipated stigma while exercising in public spaces (e.g., while walking), as well as to challenge self-critical beliefs (e.g., that they are lazy) which may otherwise lead them to avoid exercising. These concrete strategies, along with reducing WBI and improving self-confidence, are intended to increase participants' self-efficacy for and engagement in physical activity.</description>

    <description>This intervention will be based on the Diabetes Prevention Program. A diet of 1200-1499 calories per day will be prescribed for participants &lt; 250 lb, and 1500-1800 for those ≥ 250 lb. Participants will be instructed to eat a balanced deficit diet. Session topics during the first 20 weeks will include self-monitoring, stimulus control, social support, portion sizes, and goal-setting. Those during weeks 21-72 will focus on skills required for weight loss maintenance and relapse prevention. Physical activity will be begin with a prescription of 60 min/wk, and will gradually progress by 10 minutes over 2-4 week intervals until achieving 150 min/wk by week 20, 200 min/wk by week 46, and 250 min/wk by week 72. Participants will be instructed to spread the activity equally across at least 5 days in bouts that are &gt;10 minutes in duration. Moderate intensity will be prescribed with an emphasis on walking; the vast majority of our research participants self-select this form of activity.</description>

          -  Eligible participants will be men and women ages 18 years and older.

          -  Participants must have obesity, defined as a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 or ≥ 27 kg/m2 with an
             obesity-related comorbidity.

             o Obesity-related comorbidities (which confer added CVD risk) will include:

          -  coronary heart disease;

          -  other atherosclerotic disease;

          -  sleep apnea;

          -  hypercholesteremia (i.e., high cholesterol, as diagnosed by doctor and/or if taking
             medication to lower cholesterol);

          -  and components of the metabolic syndrome, including hypertension (SBP ≥130, DBP ≥80 mm
             Hg, diagnosed by doctor and/or if taking anti-hypertensive medication); fasting blood
             glucose of 100-125 mg/dL (or prediabetes, diagnosed by doctor),; low HDL cholesterol
             (&lt;40 mg/dL in men, &lt;50 mg/dL in women), elevated triglycerides (&gt;150 mg/dL, i.e.,
             dyslipidemia diagnosed by doctor or taking medication to treat dyslipidemia), or
             elevated waist circumference (≥40 in for men, ≥35 in for women),.

          -  Eligible participants must also report a history of experiencing weight bias as
             assessed by self-report questionnaire and in-person interview, and have elevated
             levels of WBI as indicated by an average score of 4 (midpoint) or above on the Weight
             Bias Internalization Scale (WBIS) and by in-person interview.

          -  Participants must be seeking weight loss.

          -  If currently taking medications, dosages must be stable for at least 3 months.

          -  Participants will be eligible to participate if they exhibit mild to moderate severity
             of depression, anxiety, or binge eating disorder, as determined by the behavioral
             evaluation and the screening measures (Beck Depression Inventory-II and Questionnaire
             for Eating and Weight Patterns; see below for details). Elevated WBIS scores are often
             associated with these variables.

          -  Participants taking anti-depressant medication will be eligible if their dose has been
             stable for a minimum of 3 months.

        Eligible female patients will be:

          -  non-pregnant and non-lactating

          -  surgically sterile or postmenopausal, or they will agree to continue to use a method
             of birth control during the study

        Participants must:

          -  have a PCP who is responsible for providing routine care

          -  have reliable telephone service and/or email access with which to be in contact with
             the study team

          -  understand and be willing to comply with all study-related procedures and agree to
             participate in the study by giving written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Applicants will be excluded if they have:

          -  a diagnosis of type I or II diabetes (for type II diabetes, blood glucose ≥126 mg/dL
             or A1C ≥6.5);

          -  uncontrolled hypertension (blood pressure ≥ 160/100 mm Hg);

          -  experienced a cardiovascular event (e.g., stroke, myocardial infarction) in the last
             12 months;

          -  lost and maintained ≥ 5% of their initial weight in the last 3 months or ≥ 10% in the
             past 2 years;

          -  or have participated in individual or group psychotherapy related to weight in the
             last 3 months (due to the potentially confounding effects of receiving a simultaneous
             cognitive-behavioral intervention).

             o Participants who have recently received or are currently receiving therapy for a
             pre-existing mental health issue unrelated to weight (e.g., psychotherapy for
             depression or anxiety, or marriage, grief, or career counseling) may be eligible if
             the therapy is deemed by the Principal Investigator to be unlikely to affect weight,
             eating habits, or physical activity.

          -  Applicants with severe symptoms of mood (BDI-II score ≥ 29), anxiety, or binge eating
             disorder, and any severity of thought or substance use disorders will not be accepted
             into the study, as these symptoms may interfere with individuals' ability to adhere to
             a weight loss program.

             o Clinician judgment will be used to determine severity of mood disorder symptoms
             independent from obesity-related concerns and complications (e.g., fatigue), and
             decisions about applicants' eligibility based on psychiatric symptoms will fall within
             the Principal Investigator's discretion.

          -  Individuals with bulimia nervosa will not be eligible to participate, because weight
             loss may be contraindicated.

          -  Applicants with current, active suicidal ideation, and/or a suicide attempt within the
             past year will be excluded from the study and referred to psychiatric treatment
             facilities in the greater Philadelphia area.

          -  Applicants will not be eligible if they have a history of bariatric surgery.

          -  Women who are nursing, pregnant, or planning to become pregnant in the next 16 months
             are not eligible to participate.

          -  Applicants who report obtaining 150 minutes or more of structured physical activity
             per week (e.g., 30 minutes 5 days per week) will not be eligible, as they will already
             be obtaining the recommended amount of physical activity and may not be able to
             further increase their activity as part of the study.
