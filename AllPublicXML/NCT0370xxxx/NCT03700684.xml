    <textblock>
      This study addresses several issues related to the clinical management of speech and voice
      disorders associated with Parkinson's disease. Two behavioral treatment programs, Lee
      Silverman Voice Treatment and SpeechVive, are assessed in their ability to improve
      communication in persons with Parkinson's disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Surgical and pharmacological management of the motor-based symptoms of PD has made great
      strides over the last few decades. The behavioral management of the speech and voice symptoms
      however, has not grown by the same leaps and bounds. Despite the prevalence of speech and
      voice symptoms associated with PD, few evidence-based treatment options are currently
      available. In the face of good efficacy data, the Lee Silverman Voice Treatment (LSVT LOUD)
      program continues to be the gold standard for voice treatment. LSVT LOUD trains patients to
      monitor and adjust their vocal intensity when they perceive that their voice is soft.
      Therefore, the success of LSVT LOUD is predicated, in part, on an individual's ability to
      self-monitor and self-cue (internal cueing) during speech production. While LSVT LOUD has
      fostered significant improvements in communication for many patients with PD, not all
      patients respond to treatment. It has been postulated that underlying sensory and cognitive
      factors may hinder treatment outcomes. A new behavioral treatment for speech and voice
      impairment has recently been introduced. The SpeechVive, a small in-the-ear device, uses an
      external noise cue to elicit louder speech. While LSVT LOUD and the SpeechVive have both been
      shown to significantly increase sound pressure level (SPL) in patients with PD, the
      physiologic adjustments supporting these changes in SPL remain unclear. This is an important
      area of study for two reasons. First, both treatments are exercised-based programs, yet the
      physiologic changes associated with these treatments are not well understood. Second, there
      is evidence to suggest that the use of an external cue, such as the noise cue used in
      SpeechVive training, elicits more efficient respiratory patterns in neurologically-healthy
      and neurologically-involved patients, in comparison to self-initiated cueing strategies, such
      as those used in LSVT LOUD. This study proposes to compare the influence of cueing strategy
      on treatment outcomes by examining simultaneous respiratory-laryngeal adjustments before and
      after participation in LSVT LOUD (internal cueing) and SpeechVive (external cueing) training.
      It is important to study respiratory-laryngeal interactions because both of these subsystems
      contribute to vocal intensity regulation. In addition, exercise physiology studies have
      indicated that internal and external forms of cueing elicit different perceptions of physical
      and mental effort during exercise. It is important to understand the patients' level of
      perceived physical and mental effort, associated with each treatment program, as these
      variables can effect adherence to the treatment regime. In summary, the proposed study is
      intended to 1) fill a critical void in the investigator's understanding of
      respiratory-laryngeal adjustments used to support increased SPL under two evidence-based
      behavioral voice treatment programs, and 2) to better understand how patients' perceptions of
      physical and mental effort are shaped by each treatment paradigm. The information generated
      in this study could potentially lead to more efficient voice rehabilitation for persons with
      PD.

    <measure>Treatment-related changes in speech breathing will be assessed using respiratory kinematics and laryngeal aerodynamics.</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline after 8 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in speech breathing will be assessed by examining movement in the ribcage and abdominal walls (respiratory kinematics) during speech. Non-invasive elasticized bands are fitted around the chest and abdominal walls to monitor movement. Respiratory kinematic measures will be expressed in volts. Movement of air through the vocal folds will also be assessed during speech using a vented mask that fits over the nose and mouth (laryngeal aerodynamics). This allow us to derive estimates of how long the vocal folds are open (open quotient) and how quickly they are closing (maximum flow declination rate).</description>

    <description>Ratings of physical and mental effort will be assigned by participants on treatment days using the modified NASA-Task Load Index.

    <time_frame>Change from baseline after 8 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Vocal intensity (dB SPL) will be measured during a reading task and a monologue task. Recorded speech samples are captured using a head-mounted microphone. The speech signals are analyzed for vocal intensity using acoustic software programs. Higher values of vocal intensity represent a louder speaking volume.</description>

    <measure>Treatment-related changes in quality of life will be assessed using the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline after 8 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>This 39-item self-report questionnaire is designed to address aspects of functioning and well-being for those affected by Parkinson's disease. The PDQ-39 scores each item on a 5 point scale (1=never, 5=always) and is scored along 8 discrete scales: mobility, activities of daily living, emotional well-being, stigma, social support, cognition, communication, and bodily discomfort. A summary index score is calculated by averaging the scores obtained across the 8 discrete scales. For the discrete scales and the summary score, lower scores represent a better quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Treatment-related changes in communicative competence will be assessed using the Communicative Participation Item Bank-Short Form Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline after 8 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The Communicative Participation Item Bank-Short Form is a 10-item self-report questionnaire that examines how a given condition (e.g. Parkinson's disease) interferes with communication in various situations (e.g. noisy environment). The questionnaire has 10 questions that depict a variety of speaking situations. Each of the 10 questions is assigned a score between 0 (very much) to 3 (not at all). Participants are asked to indicate how much their condition interferes with participation in each situation. The scores are summed to come up with a summary score between 0 and 30. High scores indicate less interference in participation.</description>

    <measure>Treatment-related changes in activities of daily living assessed by the Voice-related Quality of Life (V-RQOL) Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline after 8 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The Voice-related Quality of Life instrument is a 10-item self-report questionnaire that examines the impact of a persons voice impairment on activities of daily living. For each item, participants assign a score between 1 (Not a problem) and 5 (Problem is as bad as can be). A total score is calculated by summing the assigned scores across the 10 items. Higher scores indicate that the voice problem interferes with activities of daily living.</description>

    <description>While wearing a microphone, participants will read a short passage and provide a monologue on a topic of their choice. These recorded speech samples will be analyzed for speech rate using an acoustic software program. Speech rate is measured and reported in syllables per second. Higher values indicate a faster speech rate.</description>

    <time_frame>Change from baseline after 8 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>While wearing a microphone, participants will read a short passage and provide a monologue on a topic of their choice. These recorded speech samples will be analyzed for filled and unfilled pauses using an acoustic software program. Pauses are reported as a frequency count (how many occur in a given sample) and the average duration of the pauses (in msec).</description>
