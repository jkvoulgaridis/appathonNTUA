  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the master's thesis is to evaluate the clinic-internal strengthening concept of
      the Swiss Paraplegic Centre (SPZ). The SPZ is a rehabilitation clinic for spinal cord injured
      people. The strengthening concept has been routinely used since 2015.

      By default, the patients complete - depending on which training phase they are in - three to
      four strength training sessions per week. As part of the master's thesis, the development of
      maximum strength of patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) in primary rehabilitation will be
      studied. It is explicitly taken care of that the patients comply with the training
      requirements. Furthermore, factors which prevent a consistent buildup of strength - such as
      medical complications (pressure sores, pneumonia, urinary tract infections) - are
      systematically recorded.

      The findings should provide information on the effect and qualitative transfer of the
      existing strength concept in everyday clinical practice. The strength training performed is
      accompanied by the master student and documented in a standardized manner.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients in initial rehabilitation

          -  SCI Level C1-C5 (ASIA Score C-D)

          -  SCI Lever C6-L5 (ASIA Score A-D)

          -  Traumatic and non-traumatic SCI

          -  Disease-related paraplegia, high-grade stenoses and central cord Syndromes

          -  Age &gt;= 18 years

          -  The maximum force is tested on three predefined training devices, two devices for the
             upper and a device for the lower extremity. The participants will only be included in
             the study if they are capable of succeeding in at least both exercises for the upper
             extremity

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Polyneuropathic diseases such as Critical Illness and Guillain Barré Syndrome

          -  Degenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
             etc.

          -  Cognitive impairments

          -  Compliance of less than 2/3 of the training sessions

          -  ≥ 14 days without training

          -  more than 6 weeks between assessments
