  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebellar ataxia is a neurologic symptom caused by a damage or a dysfunction in cerebellum
      and results in loss of coordination, balance and postural control. This impairment could
      result in a reduction of walking speed, short and irregular steps and difficulty in
      coordinating between lower limbs. Pharmacological interventions are not able to modify ataxia
      gait pattern, therefore, new approaches to rehabilitate must be studied. Treadmill locomotor
      training (TLT) and cerebellar transcranial direct current stimulation (ctDCS) are physical
      therapy techniques able to module cerebellar afferences and modify positively ataxia gait
      pattern. However, there is no study involving the association of these two techniques. The
      purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of ctDCS associated to TLT on functional
      mobility in subjects with cerebellar ataxia. A randomized, sham controlled, double blind
      clinical trial will be performed. The subjects will be randomly allocated into two groups:
      (i) ctDCS associated with TLT; (ii) ctDCS sham associated with TLT. The TLT will be performed
      with a speed and step length progression protocol for 25 minutes. The anodal ctDCS (2 mA, 25
      minutes) or sham (2mA, 30 seconds) will be applied during TLT. The functional mobility will
      be the primary outcome and will be evaluated through timed up and go test (TUG). Ataxia'
      severity, balance and fall risky, will be the secondary outcomes and will be evaluated by the
      scale for the assessment and rating of ataxia (SARA), balance evaluation system test
      (miniBest) and TUG, respectively.

    <description>The evaluation of the functional mobility of individuals will be performed by the Timed Up and Go test. It will analyze the time spent by the individual to get up from a chair with arms, walk for three meters and return to the chair. Longer times to performe the Timed Up and Go test mean worse functional mobility.</description>

    <description>The evaluation of the functional mobility of individuals will be performed by the Timed Up and Go test. It will analyze the time spent by the individual to get up from a chair with arms, walk for three meters and return to the chair. Longer time values and step numbers represent a greater risk of falls. Time greater than 10 seconds in the test means greater risk of falling.</description>

    <measure>Change in Ataxia severity</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline (T0) at 7 (T7) and 14 days (T14) after the first intervention's day.</time_frame>
    <description>The ataxia' severity will be assessed by the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA). It consists of eight items (gait, stance, sitting, speech disturbance, finger chase, nose-finger test, fast alternating, hand movements, and heel-shin slide), where ranges from 0 to 40. Higher score mean more severe ataxia.</description>

    <description>The balance of individuals will be assessed through the Balance Evaluation System Test (BESt), which comprises 14 items with a score of 0-2 each from 0 (worst) to 2 (best performance), used to assess dysfunction in balance and independence in life activities daily.</description>

    <time_frame>Change from baseline (T0) at 7 (T7) and 14 days (T14) after the first intervention's day</time_frame>
    <description>The patient's global impression is a questionnaire which the patient has to answer how the treatment changed his life daily activities. Patient will choose the best option that reflects their improvement in quality of life, from &quot;no change&quot; to &quot;much better with differences that have made all the difference&quot;.</description>
