      Pilot study to evaluate the effect of the strain Lactobacillus PS11610 on the microbiota of
      the female and male genital tract in couples with fertility problems. Couples who have
      started treatment for artificial insemination or who are on the waiting list for an invitro
      fertilization treatment will be invited to participate. The estimated duration of the study
      will be 7 and a half months.

    <description>7 months and a half intervention study. A 6 months intervention period preceded by a period of sampling and analysis of vaginal, seminal and gland swabs of 6 weeks. During the 6 months of intervention the men participants will intake one capsule that contains 1*10E9 colony forming unit (CFU) of Lactobacillus PS11610 and the women participating will intake two capsules of the same product (each 12 hours). If the couple stay pregnant during the intervention the man will end the product intake and the woman will reduce the dose to one capsule with 1*10E9 CFU of Lactobacillus PS11610 per day during 12 additional weeks.</description>
