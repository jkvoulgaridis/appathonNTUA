      Patients are randomized into two arms. Arm A patients will receive Stereotactic Body
      Radiation Therapy (SBRT) and Arm B patients with receive conventional concurrent chemotherapy
      and radiation therapy.

      RATIONALE: There are limited studies comparing novel radiation treatments with stereotactic
      body radiation therapy (SBRT) in pancreatic adenocarcinoma to conventional fractionation.
      Much of the existing literature indicates this technique is safe and convenient for patients,
      as compared with conventionally fractionated concurrent chemo-radiation therapy. However,
      there has been no direct comparison of these two treatment modalities when given in the
      preoperative setting. It also remains uncertain if SBRT results in similar nodal downstaging
      to preoperative, conventionally fractionated chemo-RT.

      STUDY DESIGN: This study is a prospective, open-label, randomized, parallel, two-arm, phase
      II clinical trial. Patients meeting the eligibility criteria will be randomized after a
      minimum of two months of induction chemotherapy. These patients will be required to have no
      biopsy-proven distant disease on repeat staging studies before randomization. Patients who
      have radiologically equivocal evidence of distant metastatic disease (small lung nodules, or
      liver lesions that cannot be definitively characterized, etc.) are also eligible for
      enrollment. Patients with biopsy-proven metastatic disease are not eligible. The total number
      of patients planned for accrual is approximately 102 patients (51 patients per arm).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Pathologically confirmed (histologic or cytological), resectable, borderline
             resectable, or locally advanced type A adenocarcinoma of the pancreas; patients must
             have resectable, borderline resectable, or locally advanced type A disease, based on
             institutional standardized criteria and tumor board review.

          2. Patients with and without regional adenopathy are eligible.

          3. Patients are eligible with either no evidence of distant metastatic disease, or
             &quot;equivocal&quot; evidence of distant metastatic disease, as judged by the multidisciplinary
             tumor board. This &quot;equivocal&quot; definition can include small lung or liver lesions that
             are not able to be radiographically characterized otherwise. Any biopsy-proven
             metastatic disease will make the patient ineligible for study participation.

          4. History/physical examination, including collection of weight and vital signs, within
             30 days prior to start of treatment.

             perfusion and diffusion-weighted sequences within 30 days prior to study entry.

          6. Chest CT scan or X-ray within 30 days prior to study entry.

          7. Radiation treatment planning abdominal CT. A recommended abdominal MR will be done as
             a SIM with interpretation. The CT SIM will not be done with interpretation. PET scan
             and MRI are both optional but encouraged. Ability to undergo abdominal MR scans for
             staging and radiation planning and follow-up is optional but encouraged.

          8. ECOG performance status 0-2 within 14 days of randomization.

          9. Age ≥ 18.

         10. Heme Onc (Chem 24) and CA 19-9/CEA within 30 days prior to treatment, as follows:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,000 cells/mm3

               -  Platelets ≥100,000 cells/mm3 (see section 4)

               -  Hemoglobin ≥ 8.0 g/dl (Note: The use of transfusion or other intervention to
                  achieve Hgb ≥ 8.0 g/dl is acceptable.)

               -  ALT or AST &lt; 4 x upper limit of normal

               -  Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x upper normal mg/dL

               -  Alkaline phosphatase &lt; 4 x upper limit of normal

         11. Not on hemodialysis.

         12. Negative serum pregnancy test (if applicable).

         13. Ability to swallow oral medications.

         14. Patients must have had at least two months of systemic chemotherapy without evidence
             of distant progression.

         15. Patient must provide study-specific informed consent prior to study entry.

         16. Women of childbearing potential and male participants who are sexually active must
             practice adequate contraception.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Distant metastatic disease.

          2. Prior invasive malignancy (except nonmelanomatous skin cancer), unless disease free
             for a minimum of three years (for example, carcinoma in situ of the breast, oral
             cavity or cervix are all permissible).

          3. Prior radiotherapy to the region of the study cancer that would result in overlap of
             radiation therapy fields.

          4. Any major surgery within 28 days prior to study entry (for example, insertion of a
             vascular access device or biliary stent, exploratory laparotomy and/or laparoscopy are
             not considered major surgery; biliary or gastric bypass is considered major surgery).

          5. Severe, active comorbidity, defined as follows:

               -  Unstable angina and/or congestive heart failure requiring hospitalization within
                  the last six months.

               -  Transmural myocardial infarction within three months prior to study entry.

               -  Acute bacterial or fungal infection requiring intravenous antibiotics at the time
                  of registration.

               -  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation or other respiratory illness
                  requiring hospitalization or precluding study therapy within 30 days before
                  registration.

               -  Uncontrolled malabsorption syndrome significantly affecting gastrointestinal
                  function.

               -  Any unresolved bowel or bile duct obstruction.

               -  Major resection of the stomach or small bowel that could affect the absorption of
                  capecitabine.

               -  Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), based upon current CDC definition.
                  Note, however, that HIV testing is not required for entry into this protocol. The
                  need to exclude patients with AIDS from this protocol is necessary because
                  patients receiving antiretroviral therapy may experience possible pharmacokinetic
                  interactions with capecitabine.

               -  Absence of any significant medical comorbidity which would preclude the
                  consideration of major pancreatic surgery.

          6. Pregnancy or women of childbearing potential and men who are sexually active and not
             willing/able to use medically acceptable forms of contraception during the course of
             the study and for women three months after study therapy is completed and for men six
             months after study therapy is completed. This exclusion is necessary because the
             treatment involved in this study may be significantly teratogenic.

          7. Women who are lactating at the time of registration and who plan to be lactating
             through three months after study therapy is completed.

          8. Prior allergic reaction to capecitabine or gemcitabine.

          9. Participation in another interventional clinical treatment trial while on study
             (observational trials are permitted).

         10. Patients taking nonprotocol-specified chemotherapy agents or immune modulating agents
             for other medical conditions are not permitted to participate in this trial. Any
             medication questions should be reviewed by the PI.
