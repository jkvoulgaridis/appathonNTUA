  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In order to optimize drug prescription and to reduce potentially inappropriate medications, a
      pharmaceutical analysis activity is conducted in our establishment for several years. Medical
      prescriptions are reviewed daily by pharmacists. This activity is developed in
      approximatively 84% of the hospital wards of the insitution, and especially in the geriatric
      department. Drug induced adverse effects are frequently encountered in elderly people and ICU
      environment causes a high risk of iatrogenic events because of the complexity of care and of
      the severity of illness. The hypothesis of the study is that the intervention of pharmacists
      and geriatricians could improve the medical prescription in elderly patients by reducing
      avoidable drug interactions and thus by decreasing the risk of drug induced adverse effects.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of the intervention of
      pharmacists and geriatricians on medical prescription and on iatrogenic risk in elderly
      critically ill patients admitted in surgical ICU. The secondary objectives are (i) to
      describe the elderly patients population in surgical ICU, (ii) to analyze the impact of the
      ICU stay on medical prescription, (iii) to analyze the opportunities suggested by the
      pharmacists to optimize drug therapies and (iv) to assess the impact of drug prescription in
      the ICU on long-term disability.

      A prospective, observational, before-after study will be conducted from august 1, 2018 to
      February 1, 2020, in the surgical ICU of the hospital. Patients older than 70 years and
      admitted to surgical ICU will be eligible. This study will be conducted in 2 successive
      steps: (1) first step: without any intervention of pharmacists or and geriatricians
      (Baseline), (2) second step: all drug prescription during the ICU and the hospital stay will
      be analyzed by a pharmacist and a geriatrician, to decrease drug interaction and risk of drug
      related adverse effect. During each step, the demographic and medical datas will be recorded.
      Medical prescriptions will be reviewed at ICU admission, at 96 hours after ICU admission and
      then every 4 days until discharge from the ICU. For each patient, the impact of the
      intervention on mid-term and long-term disability will be assessed during a geriatric
      evaluation by using adequate specific scale at hospital discharge and at 3 months after
      hospital discharge. All iatrogenic events will be collected and analyzed.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of the intervention of pharmacists and
      geriatricians on medical prescription and on the iatrogenic risk in elderly critically ill
      patients admitted in surgical ICU. This study is before-after prospective study, carried out
      in 2 steps.

      Step 1 data collection from August 1, 2018 to February 1, 2019

      This step is a prospective analysis without any intervention of the pharmacist and of the
      geriaitrician.

        -  The sociodemographic, and medical (comorbidities, reason for ICU admission, SAPS II
           (Simplified Acute Physiology Score) and SOFA (Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment)
           scores, laboratory datas, invasive procedures datas will be collected from ICU medical
           record.

        -  A geriatric evaluation and disability evaluation will be performed by using the ADL
           (Activity Daily Living), Charlson, and SEGA (Short Emergency Geriatric Assessment)
           scales.

        -  The medical prescriptions will be reviewed at the first day and at 96 hours after
           admission in the ICU, and every 4 days during ICU stay. The pharmacist will analyse the
           medical prescriptions by using a standardized tool (Micromedex®, Theriaque®, Vidal®), to
           identify inappropriate prescription, and to assess the iatrogenic risks. These
           interventions will be quantified by using the SFPC Scale (French Society of clinical
           pharmacy).

        -  Iatrogenic events will be reported and analyzed.

        -  Drug prescription and patient outcome at discharge from the ICU and at discharge from
           the hospital will be collected.

        -  At 3 months from discharge from the hospital, a new geriatric evaluation will be
           conducted (patient's outcome and medical prescription).

      Step 2, from March 1, 2019 to March, 2020.

      This step is a prospective analysis with the intervention of the pharmacist and of the
      geriatrician.

      The same datas that step 1 will be collected. During this step, the pharmacist carries
      individualized interventions that will be discuss with the physician in charge of the patient
      to improve the safety of drug prescription. The physician will be allowed to accept or to
      refuse these interventions.

      At 3 months from discharge from the hospital, a consultation with geriatrician will be
      proposed to the elderly patient. The geriatric evaluation and disability assessment will be
      conducted during this consultation.
