      The investigators plan this research to be prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled and
      double blinded. It will be held according to Declaration of Helsinki and in harmony with Good
      Clinical Practice guidelines. All patients would be required to sign informed consent,
      approved by the Ethics Committee of Clinical Hospital Center (CHC) Rijeka.

      All patients will have at their disposal current medications for diarrhea based on
      guidelines, and education regarding side effects and dietary recommendations will be
      undertaken. One cohort will also ingest a probiotic (OMNi-BiOTiC® 10AAD), while other cohort
      will take a placebo, same in colour, shape, taste and smell; both medications will be taken 2
      per day, every 12 hours, over 84 days (6 chemotherapy cycles every 14 days). After 84 days, a
      regular examination will be undertaken. Total follow-up would be for two full cycles, at
      least 160 days. (Stool analyses will take place before and after chemotherapy(6-8 weeks after
      chemotherapy) and eventually three month later) Patients will be followed up in six main
      control points, t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, t6, which all represent the 1st day of matching
      2-week-chemotherapy cycle. Each cycle starts exactly and at least 14 days from the first day
      of previous chemotherapy cycle. There would be no additional invasive procedures done for
      this study, regular blood examinations will be expanded with additional parameters. All
      patients would have the right to withdraw their written consent to participate in the study
      at any given time and for any reason whatsoever. (fecal analyses only before and 6-8 weeks
      after the last chemotherapy cycle)
