  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to analyze the efficacy of massage therapy and kinesiotherapy,
      applied by the parents of hospitalized preterm infants, in the improvement of the biological
      state, neuromotor activity and other associated factors.

      Premature infants are prematurely deprived of the cutaneous stimulation provided during
      intrauterine development and of the continuous contact with their parents. It has and adverse
      effect on both psychological and biological development of the child.

      Knowledge of these factors has led many neonatal units to begin to introduce therapeutic
      massage protocols to facilitating satisfactory neuromotor and anthropometric development of
      preterm infants.

      In this study, premature newborns were assigned to one of two groups:

      A: Control Group. B: Massage and kinesiotherapy Group, 15 minutes twice a day.

    <description>Effect of treatment on neuromotor development. Neuromotor development were measured using the Spanish Premie-Neuro Scale, a scale for the neurological examination of premature babies, between 23 and 37 gestational weeks.
It consists of twenty-four items divided into three factors: Neurological, movement and responsiveness, each with eight items. Each of the items is assigned a score of 1, 3 or 5. The scores for items are added up to yield a total raw score, with the possible figures for this ranging from 24 to 120 (higher values represent a better neuromotor development).</description>
