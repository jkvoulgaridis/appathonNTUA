  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial aims to enhance antenatal care (ANC) to address the changing disease burden
      affecting pregnant women in India and Nepal. The enhancement includes using a tablet-based
      electronic decision support system that prompts front line health workers to provide
      evidence-based routine ANC, enhances detection and management of pregnancy-induced
      hypertension and gestational diabetes, facilitates record-keeping and reporting, and links
      across levels of care providers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to develop and evaluate the use of mHealth to enhance antenatal
      care (ANC) in primary care settings of India and Nepal. Currently, the usual pathways for
      obtaining ANC in India and Nepal start with Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) and
      Female Community Health Volunteers (FCHVs) respectively. These workers mobilize pregnant
      women in the community to attend ANC services with Auxiliary Nurse Midwifes (ANMs), who
      provide routine ANC, and refer women to physicians (MBBS doctors) at PHCs, or higher levels
      of care, as required. However, health programme managers and providers in both India and
      Nepal are cognizant of concerns over current ANC practice, and wish to enhance ANC in a
      number of ways. First, they recognize the changing disease burden and rising importance of
      PIH and GDM, and seek to increase access to specialized care when needed.

      The investigators propose using an EDSS intervention to enhance ANC. EDSS can allow FHWs to
      incorporate screening, detection and referral of high-risk pregnancies for appropriate
      clinical management into routine ANC services to improve glucose and blood pressure control
      and health outcomes for both mothers and babies. EDSS should also improve adherence to
      National ANC guidelines and provide an integrated continuum of maternal care services across
      several levels of care.

    <measure>Proportion of pregnant women receiving at least four antenatal check-ups</measure>
    <time_frame>One month post-delivery</time_frame>
    <description>Difference in proportion of pregnant women who receive at least 4 ANC check-ups between the two arms (mHealth integrated ANC and routine ANC). A pregnant woman is supposed to make at least four visits throughout her pregnancy, distributed according to her period of gestation as follows:
1st visit, within 12 weeks; preferably as soon as pregnancy is suspected for registration of pregnancy and first antenatal check-up
2nd visit: Between 14 and 26 weeks
3rd visit: Between 28 and 34 weeks
4th visit: Between 36 weeks and term It should be emphasised that this is only a minimum requirement and that more visits may be necessary, depending on the woman's condition and needs.</description>

    <description>Non-physician front line health workers (FHWs) will screen, detect, and refer PIH and GDM cases. Physicians will be trained to manage PIH and GDM. In the intervention clusters, pregnant women will receive enhanced antenatal care via a Frontline Health Worker (FHW), supported by an electronic decision support system (EDSS). This will integrate the screening, detection, and referral/management of GDM and PIH with existing antenatal care services, prompt FHWs to provide routine care, and help them record and report data upwards. Non-physician FHWs will not prescribe treatments, but they will carry out all other duties including diagnosis, referral to an appropriate physician to prescribe drugs, provide lifestyle advice, follow-up, and subsequently support adherence to management plans.</description>
