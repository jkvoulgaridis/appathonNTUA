  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The intervention trial will examine the effectiveness and feasibility of integrating stroke
      survivors into an existing hospital-based cardiac rehabilitation program at Novant Health in
      Charlotte, NC. Stroke survivors will be recruited through hospital system providers and
      physical therapists (PTs) for entry into a multidisciplinary, three-month cardiac
      rehabilitation program. This program consists of three sessions per week of supervised
      cardiovascular endurance and strength training, stretching, relaxation and education.
      Participants will be stroke survivors, have completed formal physical and occupational
      rehabilitation (if applicable), and have treating provider approval.

    <measure>Stroke Impact Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in Stroke Impact Scale at 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of Life Questionnaire evaluating difficulty after stroke in 8 domains: strength, hand function, activities of daily living, mobility, communication, emotion, memory/thinking, participation/role function. Score is 0-100 in each domain and is transformed using the equation Domain score = (mean item score - 1)/4 * 100. Higher Scores indicate less impact of stroke.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fatigue Severity Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in Fatigue Severity Scale at 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>A scale measuring the perceived impact of fatigue on life activities. Total score is 9-63 with a higher score indicating more fatigue severity and impact.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Activities Specific Balance Confidence (ABC) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in ABC Scale at 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Activities Specific Balance Confidence scale measures an individual's confidence in performing 16 activities without loss of balance. Possible scores are 0-100 with higher scores indicating higher balance confidence.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Readiness for Change Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in Readiness/Confidence in Behaviors at 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The readiness for change questionnaire evaluates self-perception of readiness and confidence in exercise, physical activity and overall wellness behaviors. Readiness score is 3-15 with higher scores indicating higher readiness, and confidence score 3-9 with a higher score indicating more confidence in behavior.</description>

    <measure>Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ9)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in PHQ9 at 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The patient health questionnaire is a 9 question self report measure of depression and depression severity. The score is 0-27 with a higher score indicating more severe depression.</description>

    <measure>Ferrans and Powers Quality of Life Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in Ferrans and Powers Quality of Life Questionnaire at 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Ferrans and Powers Quality of Life questionnaire is a measure of satisfaction and importance of 7 domains (health, healthcare, self-care, energy, family/friends support, engagement in life activities, happiness). Raw scores are converted to overall scores by weighting satisfaction by importance and adjusting for unanswered questions. Total scores are 0-30 with higher scores indicating a higher quality of life.</description>
