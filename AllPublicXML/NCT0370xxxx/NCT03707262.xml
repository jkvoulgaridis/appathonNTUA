  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if an investigational treatment will allow kidney
      transplant recipients to better accept their new kidney and stop immunosuppressive medicines.
      This study is for kidney transplant recipients who receive a kidney from a sibling donor.

      The investigational treatment is started after kidney transplant. It begins with a regimen of
      a drug called rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (rATG) combined with radiation therapy (known as
      total lymphoid irradiation, or TLI) to the lymph nodes and spleen. This is followed by an
      infusion of blood stem cells, which will be donated by the same sibling who donated their
      kidney. Researchers think that this treatment allows immune cells from the donor and
      recipient to live side by side, a condition referred to as &quot;mixed chimerism.&quot; Mixed chimerism
      may help create a state of &quot;tolerance&quot; in kidney transplant recipients in which all
      immunosuppressive medications can be stopped without rejection of the transplanted kidney.

      This study will test whether (1) the investigational treatment will allow patients to stop
      immunosuppressive medications after their kidney transplant and (2) if the treatment impacts
      the rate of kidney rejection and the side effects of immunosuppressive medications.

    <textblock>
      In spite of the pronounced benefit of kidney transplantation in prolonging survival and
      improving the quality of life of patients with end stage renal disease, it is still hampered
      by the risk of graft rejection and the need for lifelong immunosuppression. Researchers have
      sought to circumvent these challenges through the use of combined kidney and hematopoietic
      stem cell transplantation to induce immune tolerance. This study will build upon published
      reports showing favorable results for the TLI/rATG regimen in HLA-matched living donor
      transplant recipients. The investigators seek to confirm that patients treated with total
      lymphoid irradiation (TLI) and rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (rATG) followed by human
      leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical donor hematopoietic progenitor cell transplant can be
      withdrawn from immunosuppressive drugs while maintaining normal renal function after renal
      transplantation. At serial time points, (1) graft function will be monitored, (2) chimerism
      will be measured in recipient white blood cell subsets, and (3) protocol biopsies of the
      graft will be obtained. An attempt will be made to discontinue tacrolimus at 12 months if the
      following conditions are met: (1) chimerism (defined as ≥5% donor type cells among the T
      cells, B cells, Natural Killer [NK] cells, and granulocytes) is detectable for at least 180
      days after CD34+ and CD3+ cell infusion, (2) stable graft function without clinical rejection
      episodes is maintained, (3) there is lack of histologic rejection on protocol biopsies, and
      (4) there is no evidence of graft vs. host disease (GVHD). Recipients in the proposed study
      will be given a target dose of ≥ 5 x106 CD34+ cells/kg and 5x106 CD3+ cells/kg with the goal
      of achieving durable mixed chimerism.
