      This study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of Bushen Culuan Decoction in the
      treatment of anovulatory infertility, including anovulatory abnormal uterine bleeding,
      polycystic ovarian syndrome, hyperprolactinemia, luteinized unruptured follicle syndrome,
      corpus luteum insufficiency and ovarian insufficiency, through a randomised, double-blinded,
      double-dummy, parallel positive controlled, adaptive multicenter clinical trial.

    <textblock>
      Anovulation is one of the main causes of female infertility. Anovulatory infertility account
      for a proportion of 25-30% in whole female infertility.

      In western medicine, hormone induced ovulation and assisted reproduction technology are two
      main ways to solve the problem and Clomiphene citrate is the first-line medication in
      ovulation induction. There are many side effects being reported in the treatment with modern
      medicine technique such as ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, complication with uteroscope
      and puncture egg retrieval, low pregnancy rate with high ovulation rate, potential cancer
      occuring risk and offspring healthy risk.

      Bushen Culuan Decoction is a traditional Chinese medicine recipe with 10 Chinese herbs
      including Tusizi, Yinyanghuo, Xianmao, Xuduan, Gouqizi, Nvzhenzi, Zelan, Shengpuhuang,
      Xiangfu and Chuanshanlong. Previous laboratory and exploratory clinical researches have
      proved Bushen Culuan Decoction had an exactly efficacy in treating anovulatory infertility
      safely.

      In the first stage, the primary sample size In the study is 528. Half patients will receive
      Bushen Culuan Decoction and clomiphene citrate placebo, while the other half will receive
      clomiphene citrate tablets and Bushen Culuan Decoction placebo. When 1/3 of 528 patients
      complete the treatment, we will analysis the treatment efficacy of 6 diseases separately, and
      find which of them could be the target diseases of Bushen Culuan Decoction. Then we will
      modify the sample size depending on the result in first stage, and the research will only be
      processed in the target diseases being chosen. In the next stage, half patients will receive
      Bushen Culuan Decoction and clomiphene citrate placebo, while the other half will receive
      clomiphene citrate tablets and Bushen Culuan Decoction placebo.
