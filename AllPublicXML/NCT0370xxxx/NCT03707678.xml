  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK2245035 belongs to a novel class of agonist drugs targeted at toll like receptors (TLR).
      T-helper cell 2 (Th2) driven inflammation is a key patho-physiological mechanism in allergic
      asthma. The clinical manifestations and inflammatory pathways of allergic asthma are
      sensitive to corticosteroid therapy. However, GSK2245035 reduces Th2-driven airway
      inflammation and thereby controls asthma symptoms. This study aims to determine whether
      intranasal GSK2245035 maintains biological and clinical control of allergic asthma using
      'tapering of ICS' study design. This study will assess the efficacy and safety of GSK2245035
      in subjects with allergic asthma treated with ICS. This will be a randomised, double-blind
      (sponsor open), placebo-controlled, parallel group, 8-week study treatment period. The study
      will consist of a screening period of up to approximately 5 weeks, blinded treatment period
      of 8 weeks, followed by a follow-up period of 7 weeks. A total of 60 subjects will be
      included in this study and duration of time for each subject will therefore be 141 days
      including screening and study ICS dose adjustment period. Diskus® is a registered trademark

    <measure>Change from Baseline in fractional exhaled breath nitric oxide (FeNO) level</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to Week 9</time_frame>
    <description>FeNO level will be measured to determine efficacy of GSK2245035 in reducing asthma (airway) inflammation. The measurements will be performed using a handheld electronic device. 'Primary Endpoint Visit' (PEPV) will be 1-week post 8th dose.
