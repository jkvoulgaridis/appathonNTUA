  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lesions involving coronary bifurcations account for approximately 20% of all percutaneous
      coronary interventions (PCI). Revascularization within bifurcation sites remains technically
      challenging. While the most optimal interventional treatment strategy for bifurcation lesions
      is still debatable, side branch (SB) occlusion is one of the most serious procedural
      complications with prevalence rates over 7%.

      Numerous mechanisms of the SB occlusion (e.g. plaque or carina shift, coronary artery
      dissection, thromboembolism, coronary artery spasm, etc) have been postulated. Regardless of
      the cause, loss of the SB is associated with increased risk of periprocedural mortality and
      myocardial infarction. Therefore, PCI involving coronary bifurcation mandates consideration
      of the risk of SB compromise. The CT-PRECISION (Computed Tomography angiography PREdiCtIon
      score for SIde branch Occlusion in coronary bifurcation interventioN) registry was designed
      to evaluate the application of coronary computed tomography angiography (coronary CTA) for
      the prediction of SB occlusion during percutaneous revascularization of bifurcation lesions.
      The main purpose of this single-center study is to develop a noninvasive CTA-based prediction
      tool to determine the procedural outcome of PCI in bifurcation lesions.

      Coronary CTA allows for precise and noninvasive evaluation of coronary bifurcation lesions.
      Pre-procedural planning for coronary revascularization using CTA provides detailed
      characterization of bifurcation anatomy and morphology including the spatial distribution of
      coronary plaque. To date there has been no compiled CTA-based prediction model for SB
      occlusion in coronary bifurcation intervention.

      The CT-PRECISION registry is a retrospective observational cohort study of patients
      undergoing preprocedural coronary CTA before PCI involving coronary bifurcation lesions
      between January 2010 and July 2018. The study is designed to enroll 400 consecutive patients
      undergoing elective main vessel stenting with a provisional approach to the SB at a single
      high-volume PCI center.
