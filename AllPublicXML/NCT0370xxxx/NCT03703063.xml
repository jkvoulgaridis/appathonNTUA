    <textblock>
      Using alternative neoadjuvant gemcitabine-nab-paclitaxel and nal-IRI with 5-Fluorouracil
      (5FU) and folinic acid (Leucovorin) regimens of localized cancer, we hope to ensure exposure
      of the cancer to a broader array of potentially active agents. Also, potentially improves
      patient tolerance and minimizes significant drug toxicity that could impair delivery of all
      treatment elements. Furthermore, it may enable prediction of superior to inferior treatment
      outcomes at an earlier point in the disease progress.

      This research study is a Phase Ib clinical trial. It will assess the Safety, tolerability,
      and feasibility of gemcitabine-nab paclitaxel alternating with nal-IRI/5FU/leucovorin
      (NAPOLI) in de novo resectable and borderline resectable pancreatic cancer.

      Subjects must have a newly diagnosed resectable or borderline resectable pancreatic ductal
      cancer and meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria.

      Treatment consists of 4 week treatment cycles. Nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine will be
      administered on days 1,8, and 15 with NAPOLI will be administered on days 1 and 15.
