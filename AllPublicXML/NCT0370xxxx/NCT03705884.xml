  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PET scanning (positron emission tomography) is a well-established technique used to identify
      areas of interest within the body. It involves injecting a radioactive tracer which
      highlights abnormal areas. It has recently been combined with CT (computed tomography) and
      MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scanning to more accurately identify abnormalities within
      the heart. Cardiac sarcoidosis, a condition which causes scarring and inflammation within the
      heart muscle, is of particular interest.

      The study makes use of hybrid PET/MR scanning using a designated scanner which enables PET
      scanning combined with MRI scanning. This will allow imaging of abnormal areas within the
      heart in this condition alongside treatment regimens in a way which hasn't been done before.
      If successful, this imaging method will play a key role in diagnosing, quantifying and
      monitoring these conditions.

      All participants will undergo PET scanning, where a radioactive tracer is injected into a
      vein before the scan. The radioactive substance only lasts for a short time and is safe,
      passed out of the body in urine. The scan will be performed twice; once before treatment and
      once after treatment has been established. A cohort of healthy volunteers will undergo
      scanning in exactly the same way to enable us to compare the results with hearts of people
      who don't have cardiac sarcoidosis.

    <intervention_model_description>Patients and healthy subjects will be allocated in a non-randomised fashion to either corticosteroid or control arms, for parallel comparison within the two groups. The corticosteroid is recognised treatment for the condition and is being used to observe the impact on diagnostic imaging; no treatment effects are being studied or are endpoints of the study (i.e. the study is not a clinical trial of treatment in cardiac sarcoidosis with corticosteroid).</intervention_model_description>
