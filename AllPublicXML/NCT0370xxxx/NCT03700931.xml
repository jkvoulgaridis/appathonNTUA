      The present research project investigates if recall of recent eating episodes enhances
      consumption of fruits and vegetables

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Episodic memory is the capacity to remember past autobiographic events, including eating
      episodes. Recalling a previous meal decreases the amount eaten in a subsequent snack
      occasion.

      Recall of recent eating episodes could alert individuals about the relationship between their
      eating behaviour and wellbeing. This is supported by the observation in slimming trials that
      participants who keep a food diary lose more weight than those who do not record their
      intake.

      Lab experiments have focused on the effect of eating episodic memory on later intake of
      unhealthy food. However, less is known about the effect on intake of healthy food. Increasing
      consumption of food that contains nutritious elements like fruit could protect against
      chronic disease. If eating episodic memory would increase intake of healthy food, this would
      benefit individuals' health.

      The aim of the present between-subjects experiment is to test the influence of memory of
      recent eating episodes on fruit and vegetable consumption. The interest is to assess
      differences in amount of fruit/vegetables eaten in each of two conditions: (i) after a recall
      of eating episodes of the day before and (ii) after recall of activities of the day before
      excluding eating episodes. The hypothesis is that fruit/vegetable consumption after recalling
      eating episodes would be higher than after recalling non-eating related activities.

      The project will consist of four individual studies varying weight status of participants and
      test food: i) Female with healthy weight, and fruit as test food; ii) Female with healthy
      weight, and vegetable as test food; iii) Female with unhealthy weight, and fruit as test
      food; and iv) Female with unhealthy weight, and vegetable as test food.
