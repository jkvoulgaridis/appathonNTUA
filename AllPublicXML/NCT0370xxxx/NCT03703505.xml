  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and absolute
      bioavailability of AG-348 in healthy male participants. Potential participants will be
      screened within 29 days prior to dose administration to determine eligibility. Eligible
      Participants will be admitted into the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) one day prior to
      administration of AG-348 and will be confined to the CRU until at least Day 8. If
      participants are not eligible for discharge on Day 8, they may remain in the CRU up to Day
      11. Radiolabelled analytes of AG-348 will be administered in a single oral and intravenous
      (IV) dose on Day 1. Participants will be required to fast pre-dose, remain in a supine
      position for 1 hour post-dose and avoid water for 2 hours post-dose.

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Willing and able to provide voluntary written informed consent;

          -  Males of any race between 18 and 55 years of age, inclusive;

          -  Body mass index between 18.5 and 29.0 kilograms per meter squared (kg/m2), inclusive,
             and a total body weight between 50 and 100 kilograms (kg), inclusive;

          -  In good health;

          -  Participants will be surgically sterile for at least 90 days or, when sexually active
             with female partners of childbearing potential, will be required to use a male condom
             with spermicide from Check-in until 90 days after study drug administration. Sexual
             intercourse with female partners who are pregnant or breastfeeding should be avoided
             unless condoms are used from the time of study drug administration until 90 days after
             study drug administration. Male participants are required to refrain from donation of
             sperm from Check-in until 90 days after the last dose of study drug;

          -  Participants who practice true abstinence, because of the participant's lifestyle
             choice (ie, the participant should not become abstinent just for the purpose of study
             participation), are exempt from contraceptive requirements. Periodic abstinence (eg,
             calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not
             acceptable methods of contraception. If a participant who is abstinent at the time of
             signing the informed consent form (ICF) becomes sexually active they must agree to use
             contraception as described previously;

          -  Participants who are exclusively in same-sex relationships, contraceptive requirements
             do not apply. If a participant who is in a same-sex relationship at the time of
             signing the ICF becomes engaged in a heterosexual relationship, they must agree to use
             contraception as described previously;

          -  Willing and able to communicate verbally and in writing with the Investigator and to
             participate in all scheduled study procedures (including Follow-up procedures) and
             abide by the study restrictions;

          -  Agrees to abstain from any alcohol consumption, starting 48 hours before Check-in and
             continuing until Discharge;

          -  History of a minimum of 1 bowel movement per day.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  History of a medical or surgical condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             may potentially interfere with study drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and/or
             excretion (eg, participant has undergone gastrectomy, appendectomy, or
             cholecystectomy);

          -  Undergone any major surgical procedure within the past 3 months;

          -  After 5 minutes of rest in the supine position at Screening, has a systolic blood
             pressure (BP) reading of ≥140 mmHg (≥150 mmHg in participants &gt;45 years of age) OR a
             diastolic BP reading of ≥90 mmHg;

          -  Experienced any serious adverse reaction or serious hypersensitivity to any drug or
             its formulation excipients;

          -  History of a primary malignancy, with the exception of a malignancy that has been
             curatively treated and for which the participant has displayed no evidence of disease
             within the past 3 years;

          -  History of alcoholism or drug/chemical abuse within the past 2 years;

          -  Alcohol consumption of &gt;21 units per week. One unit of alcohol equals 12 oz (360 mL)
             of beer, 1½ oz (45 mL) of liquor, or 5 oz (150 mL) of wine;

          -  Positive urine drug screen at Screening or Check-in, or positive alcohol breath test
             at Check-in (confirmed by repeat);

          -  Positive for hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C virus antibody, or human
             immunodeficiency virus;

          -  Participation in a clinical study involving administration of an investigational
             product (IP) or new chemical entity (NCE) in the past 90 days, or 5 half-lives, if
             known, of the respective IP or NCE, whichever is longer;

          -  Has taken, within the 14 days prior to Check-in, any of the following: prescription
             medication, over-the-counter medication, nonprescription preparation (including

             products;

          -  Has taken within the 28 days prior to Check-in, any restricted product known to
             strongly induce cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 metabolism (eg, St. John's wort);

          -  Is a current smoker or user of any other tobacco product, as confirmed by Screening
             and Check-in urine cotinine test OR has used any tobacco product within the past 3

             AG-348, and have previously received the IP;

          -  Radiation exposure, including that from the present study, excluding background
             radiation but including diagnostic X-rays and other medical exposures (eg, computed
             tomography scan, barium meal) exceeding 5 millisieverts (mSv) in the last 12 months or
             10 mSv in the last 5 years, or current employment in a job requiring radiation
