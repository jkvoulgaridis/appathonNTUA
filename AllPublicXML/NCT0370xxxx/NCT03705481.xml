      Prospective, single-arm, single center, non-randomized feasibility study of the CorPath GRX
      POP System to examine its performance during remote angioplasty (ballooning) and stenting and

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age ≥18 years;

          2. Patients with coronary artery disease with clinical indication for PCI;

          3. Patient deemed appropriate for robotic-assisted PCI; and

          4. The subject has been informed of the nature of the study, agrees to its provisions and
             has provided written informed consent.

        Angiographic Inclusion:

          1. Study lesion is a single de novo native coronary artery lesion (i.e. a coronary lesion
             not previously treated).

          2. The lesion reference vessel diameter is between 2.50 mm and 4.0 mm by visual estimate.

          3. Study lesion length less or equal to 20 mm by visual estimate.

          4. The study lesion length can be treated with one stent. The stent should be able to
             cover the whole length of the lesion with at least 2 mm of normal segments on proximal
             and distal edges of the lesion.

          5. Study lesion diameter showing significant stenosis of at least 50% by visual estimate.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Failure/inability/unwillingness to provide informed consent; or

          2. The investigator determines that the patient or the coronary anatomy is not suitable
             for robotic-assisted PCI.

        Angiographic Exclusion:

          1. Target lesion that cannot be fully covered by a single stent.

          2. Subject requires treatment of multiple lesions

          3. Any previous stent placement within 5 mm (proximal or distal) of the target lesion

          4. The study lesion requires planned treatment with DCA, laser, rotational atherectomy,
             or any device except for balloon dilatation prior to stent placement

          5. The study vessel has evidence of intraluminal thrombus or moderate to severe
             tortuosity (&gt; 90°) proximal to the target lesion

          6. The study lesion has any of the following characteristics:

               1. Total occlusion

               2. Within 2mm of a side branch &gt; 2.0 mm vessel diameter

               3. Not ostial in location

               4. Is located at ≥ 45° bend in the vessel

               5. Is severely tortuous

               6. Is severely calcified

               7. Severe calcification at the part of the vessel proximal to target lesion

               8. Target lesion that is located in a native vessel distal to an anastomosis with a
                  saphenous vein graft or a left/right internal mammary artery (LIMA/RIMA) bypass
                  and is approached through the by-pass graft

          7. Unprotected left main coronary artery disease (an obstruction greater than 50%
             diameter stenosis in the left main coronary artery)
