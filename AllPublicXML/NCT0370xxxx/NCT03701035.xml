  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the influence on three different training modalities on
      the blood concentration levels of a growth factor called Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor
      (BDNF) and on the recovery of arm function following in sub-acute and chronic stroke
      survivors. The training modalities are 1. moderate intensity aerobic training on a bike
      ergonometer followed by robotic or sensor-based upper-limb training, 2. non-aerobic circuit
      training followed by robotic or sensor-based upper-limb training 3. circuit training alone.

      Background and Rationale:Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) belongs to a group of
      neurotrophins which influence neuroplasticity by increasing long-term potentiation and axonal
      and dendritic growth. Levels of serum BDNF are increased following moderate intensity aerobic
      exercise (MAE) in animal and healthy subjects. The influence of MAE on BDNF following stroke
      and the resultant efficacy of motor training in this environment remains unclear.

      Objective(s):To investigate the influence of MAE on acute and chronic levels of serum BDNF in
      sub-acute and chronic stroke patients, the efficacy of robotic upper limb or sensor based
      motor task training in this environment and consequent effect on functional arm recovery
      compared to the same upper limb training following non-aerobic training circuit training, or
      non-aerobic circuit training alone To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the interventions.
      Study Interventions: Group 1: moderate intensity AE 40 minutes, 3 times weekly followed after
      20 minutes break by 40 minutes robotic or sensor-based upper-limb Training. Group2:
      non-aerobic gait and balance circuit training 40 mins 3 times weekly followed after 20
      minutes break by 40 minutes robotic or sensor-based upper-limb training, group 3: 40 minutes
      non-aerobic gait and balance circuit training.In total 45 participants will be enrolled - 15
      in each group.Study Duration:3 monthly Intervention period per intervention group, with a 3
      month and 6 month follow-up. .
