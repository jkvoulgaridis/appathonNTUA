    <textblock>
      This is a 2-visit, multi-site, partially subject-masked, 2-arm parallel, controlled,
      randomized and dispensing trial. Subjects will be randomized to one of two study lenses for
      the entire duration of the study. The study lenses will be worn for a period of 2 weeks each
      in a bilateral fashion.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Comfort Score</measure>
    <time_frame>2-Week Follow-up Evlauation</time_frame>
    <description>Overall comfort was assessed using the Contact Lens User Experience™ (CLUE) questionnaire. CLUE is a validated patient-reported outcomes (PRO) questionnaire to assess patientexperience attributes of soft contact lenses (comfort, vision, handling, and packaging) in a contact-lens wearing population in the US, ages 18-65. Derived CLUE scores using Item Response Theory (IRT) follow a normal distribution with a population average score of 60 (SD 20), where higher scores indicate a more favorable/positive response with a range of 0-120.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Vision Satisfaction in Bright Lighting</measure>
    <time_frame>2-Week Follow-up Evaluation</time_frame>
    <description>Vision satisfaction in bright light was assessed using the individual item&quot; I was satisfied with the quality of my vision in bright lighting&quot; from the CLUE™ questionnaire. This item used the response scale, 1: Strongly Disagree, 2: Disagree, 3: Neither Agree nor Disagree, 4: Agree and 5: Strongly Agree. CLUE is the Contact Lens User Experience™ questionnaire. CLUE is a validated patient-reported outcomes (PRO) questionnaire to assess patient-experience attributes of soft contact lenses (comfort, vision, handling, and packaging) in a contact-lens wearing population in the US, ages 18-65. Derived CLUE scores using Item Response Theory (IRT) follow a normal distribution with a population average score of 60 (SD 20), where higher scores indicate a more favorable/positive response with a range of 0-120. The Proportion of responses in each category were reported for each lens type.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Distance Visual Acuity</measure>
    <time_frame>2-Week Follow-up Evlauation</time_frame>
    <description>Distance visual acuity was assessed by eye using LogMAR visual acuity at 4 meters using an ETDRS chart under high illumination high contrast conditions (room illumination &gt; 400 lux and chart luminance 120-200 cd/m2) at the 2-week follow-up for each subject eye. Lower values of logMAR indicate better vision, where a score of 0.0 equates to 20/20 snellen vision. The average visual acuity for each lens was reported.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Contact Lens Fitting Acceptance Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2-Week Follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Acceptable lens fit will be assessed at all study visits (scheduled and unscheduled) for each subject eye. Fit acceptance rate will be based on the lens fit acceptance of eyes wearing the Test lens only. Fit acceptance is a binary response where Y=1 if lens fit is acceptable and Y=0 otherwise. Unacceptable is defined as unacceptable if any one of the following criteria:
limbal exposure at primary gaze or with extreme eye movement;
edge lift;
excessive movement in primary up gaze;
insufficient movement in all three of the following conditions: primary gaze, up gaze, and push up test.
Eyes with multiple unacceptable fitting events will be counted only once. Fit rates of the Control lens will also be collected but are not a primary endpoint.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Grade 3 or Higher Slit Lamp Findings</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2-Week Follow-up Evlauation</time_frame>
    <description>Slit Lamp Findings (SLF) were assessed using a biomicroscope and was graded using the FDA grading scale (Grade: 0, 1,2, 3 and 4) with grade 0 represents the absence of findings and 1 to 4 representing successively worse findings (i.e. Grade 1 = trace, Grade 2 = Mild, Grade 3 = moderate and Grade 4 = severe). Slit Lamp Findings will be assessed for each subject eye at all study visits (schedule and unscheduled). SLF is a binary response where Y=1 for at least one Grade 3 or 4 slit lamp finding. The percentage of eyes with Grade 3 or higher slit lamp findings will be analyzed and will include corneal infiltrates. Eyes with multiple events will be counted only once. The number of eyes with SLF with grade 3 or higher by lens was reported.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Handling Score</measure>
    <time_frame>2-Week Follow-up Evlauation</time_frame>
    <description>Overall handling was assessed using the Contact Lens User Experience™ (CLUE) questionnaire. CLUE is a validated patient-reported outcomes (PRO) questionnaire to assess patientexperience attributes of soft contact lenses (comfort, vision, handling, and packaging) in a contact-lens wearing population in the US, ages 18-65. Derived CLUE scores using Item Response Theory (IRT) follow a normal distribution with a population average score of 60 (SD 20), where higher scores indicate a more favorable/positive response with a range of 0-120.</description>

        <description>Overall comfort was assessed using the Contact Lens User Experience™ (CLUE) questionnaire. CLUE is a validated patient-reported outcomes (PRO) questionnaire to assess patientexperience attributes of soft contact lenses (comfort, vision, handling, and packaging) in a contact-lens wearing population in the US, ages 18-65. Derived CLUE scores using Item Response Theory (IRT) follow a normal distribution with a population average score of 60 (SD 20), where higher scores indicate a more favorable/positive response with a range of 0-120.</description>

Fit acceptance rate will be based on the lens fit acceptance of eyes wearing the Test lens only. Fit acceptance is a binary response where Y=1 if lens fit is acceptable and Y=0 otherwise. Unacceptable is defined as unacceptable if any one of the following criteria:
limbal exposure at primary gaze or with extreme eye movement;
edge lift;
excessive movement in primary up gaze;
insufficient movement in all three of the following conditions: primary gaze, up gaze, and push up test.
Eyes with multiple unacceptable fitting events will be counted only once. Fit rates of the Control lens will also be collected but are not a primary endpoint.</description>
