    <time_frame>From Baseline (Day 1 pre-dose) at predefined time points (up to Day 140)</time_frame>
    <description>The Cmax is the maximum plasma drug concentration of BKZ observed from pharmacokinetic samples taken at predefined time points.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Area under the BKZ plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to last quantifiable concentration (AUCt)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline (Day 1 pre-dose) at predefined time points (up to Day 140)</time_frame>

    <measure>Total body plasma clearance for BKZ (CL/F)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline (Day 1 pre-dose) at predefined time points (up to Day 140)</time_frame>
    <description>The total body clearance (CL/F) for BKZ will be calculated as Dose/AUC. Clearance of a drug is a measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. Drug clearance is a quantitative measure of the rate at which a drug substance is removed from the plasma.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Volume of distribution for BKZ (Vz/F)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline (Day 1 pre-dose) at predefined time points (up to Day 140)</time_frame>
    <description>Volume of distribution (Vz/F) for BKZ will be calculated as CL/lambdaz.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to last quantifiable BKZ plasma concentration (tmin)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline (Day 1 pre-dose) at predefined time points (up to Day 140)</time_frame>
    <description>Tmin is the time to last quantifiable plasma concentration for BKZ.</description>
