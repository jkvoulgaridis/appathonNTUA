  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that exercise training program guided by virtual augmented
      reality glasses or by video from computer screen used at home will improve motivation into
      exercise training and results in superior adherence to exercise training compared to current
      practice. The primary objectives of this research project are to study the effects of
      exercise training guidance by novel technology on 1) exercise capacity, 2) adherence to
      exercise training, 3) changes in cardiac autonomic function and 4) quality of life in acute
      coronary syndrome (ACS) patients.

      The subjects of the study will be recruited from the consecutive series of patients of men
      and women admitted to Oulu University Hospital due to an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The
      study population will be randomized into control group (n=25) and study group (n=25) matched
      with age and gender. For all subjects, clinical status including quality of life
      questionnaire, exercise capacity and autonomic function measurements will be performed at
      baseline and after exercise training. Exercise training program is six months for both groups
      according to current guidelines. All the patients will have a detailed and personalized
      training prescription. Study group will have virtual augmented reality glasses or computer
      with training video to motivate and control exercise training prescription at home.
