  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to estimate and compare the value of the preoperative fentanyl test
      and the short OSAS screening scale to diagnose severe obstructive sleep apnea；and to observe
      the required amount of hydromorphone and the adverse respiratory events after
      adenotonsillectomy.

      The results of polysomnography were obtained before adenotonsillectomy, and the short OSAS
      screening scale was completed by the subjects' parents in preoperative interview. All
      children were induced by sevoflurane inhalation. After eyelash reflex disappeared and
      pharyngeal airway insertion, giving 1 mcg/kg fentanyl when the End-tidal concentrations of
      sevoflurane were maintained at 3.0 and the spontaneous respiratory frequency was stable,
      observing the changes of respiratory rate. Severe OSAS was diagnosed as respiratory rate
      decreased by more than 50%. Anesthesia was maintained with desflurane and 60% nitrous oxide
      in oxygen. The children were transferred to the PACU after extubation. The postoperative pain
      and agitation were assessed according to the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain
      Scale (CHEOPS) and The Pediatric Anesthesia Emergency Delirium (PAED) score, and all children
      were given hydromorphone for pain relief according to our protocol.

    <description>Pain was assessed according to the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale (CHEOPS) and hydromorphone of 2 µg/Kg was provided if the CHEOPS pain score was &gt;6.
The CHEOPS is a behavioral scale for evaluating postoperative pain in young children. It can be used to monitor the effectiveness of interventions for reducing the pain and discomfort.It includes six categories of pain behavior, each with 3-4 levels.
CHEOPS pain score = SUM(points for all 6 parameters)
minimum score: 4 maximum score: 13</description>
