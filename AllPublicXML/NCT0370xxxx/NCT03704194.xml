    <textblock>
      This study will test the feasibility of a study design for the Adapted Lifestyle-integrated
      Functional Exercise (LiFE) program for medically underserved older adults and to explore
      factors related to implementation. A feasibility trial will be conducted with a total of 16
      participants. The control group will receive flexibility exercise program as attention
      control.

    <textblock>
      This study will test the feasibility the Adapted Lifestyle-integrated Functional Exercise
      (LiFE) program among medically underserved older adults. Sixteen medically underserved older
      adults will be recruited in the study and randomized to Adapted LiFE or attention control
      group (flexibility exercise program). Process outcomes and preliminary outcomes will be
      collected to determine feasibility and preliminary efficacy. Process outcomes such as reach,
      acceptance, adherence, fidelity, and safety will also be collected throughout the study.
      Preliminary efficacy outcomes include habit formation, balance, muscle strength will be
      collected at baseline and at immediately after intervention is completed.

    <measure>The Berg Balance Scale (BBS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Berg Balance Scale (BBS) is a 14-item assessment of static and dynamic balance. Performance quality, time, and assistance required are rated on a scale of 0-4 based on pre-specified criteria. Total scores range from 0-56, with a score of 45 or below indicating high risk of falls.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Self-Reported Habit Index (SRHI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Self-Reported Habit Index (SRHI) is a 12-item assessment assesses habit exercise strength, frequency, relevance to self-identity, and automaticity. Items are self-rated with a seven-point Likert scale (1=strongly disagree, 7= strongly agree). Total score range from 12 to 84, where higher scores indicate stronger the habit is.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale (ABC)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale (ABC) is 16-item self-report measure in which participates rate their balance confidence for performing activities. Each item is rated on a 0-100 scale (0= no confidence, 100 = complete confidence). A final score is the average of all items ( range from 0 to 100).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Short Physical Performance Battery-Balance Test (SPPB) assess balance and mobility with three subtests (score range: 0 to 4): standing balance, three-meter gait speed, and five repetitions of sit-to-stand motion. Total score are sums of subtest scores ranging from 0 (worst performance) to 12 (best performance).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Center of Pressure (CoP) Path (cm)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Center of Pressure (Cop) is measured by a balance board system BtracKS. Participant stands on the balance board in 4 posture in three 30-second trials for each posture: hip-width stand (HS), hip-width stand with eyes closed (HSEC), narrow stand (NS), narrow stand with eyes closed (NSEC). Trajectory and mean velocity of CoP in each postures are calculated to represent static balance. Larger trajectory or velocity indicates lower static balance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Center of Pressure (CoP) Velocity (cm/s)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Center of Pressure (Cop) mean velocity (cm/s) is measured by a balance board system BtracKS. Participant stands on the balance board in 4 posture in three 30-second trials for each posture: hip-width stand (HS), hip-width stand with eyes closed (HSEC), narrow stand (NS), narrow stand with eyes closed (NSEC). Larger velocity indicates a lower static balance.</description>

    <measure>Lower Extremity Muscle Strength</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Lower extremity muscle strength of hip and knee are measured by a dynamometer.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Recruitment and Retention Rate Are Documented by Therapist Logs</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The status of each potential participant we contacted is documented in an electronic therapist log. Treatment and control groups share the same recruitment rate since randomization took place after enrollment, and the two groups were not recruited separately. Recruitment rate will be measured by the percentage of participants successfully enrolled in the study. Retention rate is calculated by the number of participants completed divided by the number of participants enrolled. Retention rate is calculated by the number of participants completed divided by the number of participants enrolled.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Acceptance of the Intervention Programs is Measured by a Question.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A question, &quot;Are you satisfied with the program?,&quot; using a seven-point Likert scale from one (very unsatisfied) to seven (very satisfied) is used to represent acceptance. Score range: 1-7. Higher values indicate higher satisfaction.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Adherence Rate is Documented by LiFE Activity Calendar</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants in the treatment group documents their exercise activities in the LiFE activity calendar. Adherence rate is defined as the average percentage of exercise activities achieved during the intervention period.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Fidelity is Documented by a Visit-by-visit Checklist</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Therapists in both treatment and control group complete a checklist after every visit. The checklist consist of pre-determined key activities. The number of delivered key activities divided by the number of planned key activities in all visits calculates a fidelity score.</description>

        <description>Center of Pressure (Cop) mean velocity (cm/s) is measured by a balance board system BtracKS. Participant stands on the balance board in 4 posture in three 30-second trials for each posture: hip-width stand (HS), hip-width stand with eyes closed (HSEC), narrow stand (NS), narrow stand with eyes closed (NSEC). Larger velocity indicates a lower static balance.</description>

        <description>The status of each potential participant we contacted is documented in an electronic therapist log. Treatment and control groups share the same recruitment rate since randomization took place after enrollment, and the two groups were not recruited separately. Recruitment rate will be measured by the percentage of participants successfully enrolled in the study. Retention rate is calculated by the number of participants completed divided by the number of participants enrolled. Retention rate is calculated by the number of participants completed divided by the number of participants enrolled.</description>

          <title>Adapted LiFE</title>
          <description>Participants in the Adapted LiFE group learns to imbed 19 exercise activities (7 balance and 12 lower extremity muscle strength activities) into daily routines. An Occupational Therapy practitioner conducts 7 in-home visits over 12 weeks and a follow phone call a month after the last in-home visit.
Adapted LiFE: The standardized components include presenting the Adapted LiFE user manual to participants, and teach participants to embed the exercise activities in their daily routine with the LiFE activity calendar.</description>

          <title>Attention Control</title>
          <description>Participants in the attention control group will learn gentle stretch exercise. An Occupational Therapy practitioner conducts 7 in-home visits over 12 weeks and a follow phone call a month after the last in-home visit.
Attention control: Attention will be provided to the control group to ensure they experience the same effects of time and attention but no effect on the outcome of interest.</description>
