  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients deemed non-adherent to their specialty medications will be randomized to receive a
      pharmacist-driven intervention or the standard of care. Medication adherence will be measured
      at 8-months post-randomization to determine if the intervention improved specialty medication
      adherence.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single-center, prospective, randomized controlled trial. A report of patients
      who use the Vanderbilt Specialty Pharmacy (VSP) will be generated daily for patients with a
      Proportion of Days Covered (PDC) &lt; 90% based on pharmacy claims. Patients who meet criteria
      will be randomized to receive an intervention by an adherence specialist (pharmacist) or to
      receive normal clinical care. For patients who are randomized to receive an intervention, the
      adherence specialist will review their medication fill history and electronic health record
      to identify potential reasons for nonadherence or to see if the pharmacy claims
      inappropriately categorize them as non-adherent (this could be due to holding treatment for a
      clinical reason, transferring the prescription outside of VSP or other reasons listed in
      Table 2). After reviewing the patients pharmacy and medical history, if the adherence
      specialist believes they should be taking treatment as prescribed, but are not (classified as
      truly nonadherent), she will contact the patient to identify potential reasons for
      nonadherence and intervene to improve adherence based on the identified reasons for
      nonadherence. Adherence rates for those receiving the additional adherence specialist and
      those receiving standard of care will be calculated 8 months after the date of randomization.
      The reasons for nonadherence and the intervention to improve adherence rates will be
      documented in a secured REDCap database. It is important to note that the adherence
      specialist is not study staff, but a full time employee of the Vanderbilt Specialty Pharmacy
      performing her normal functions. The randomization to receive these services or not will
      allow for evaluation of their efficacy.
