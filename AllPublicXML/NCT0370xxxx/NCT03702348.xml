  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Common symptoms of chikungunya fever are persistent arthritis and arthralgia, such symptoms
      can lead to impairment in functionality. The objective of this study is to evaluate the
      efficacy of a resistance exercise protocol on the functionality of individuals with chronic
      musculoskeletal manifestations of Chikungunya fever. Quality of life, number of painful
      joints, intensity of pain, number of recurrence of exacerbation and thermography are
      secondary outcomes that will also be evaluated. The protocol uses elastic resistance to
      strengthen muscle groups that stabilize the main joints affected by Chikungunya Fever. The
      sessions will be 2 times a week for 12 weeks. The control group will not be submitted to the
      intervention during the 12 weeks, being contacted through telephone calls. After the
      reevaluation at the end of the 12 weeks the control group will perform the same protocol. The
      sample will be characterized and the effect size and the mean difference will be calculated.
      Intention-to-treat analysis and rate of adherence will also be calculated.
