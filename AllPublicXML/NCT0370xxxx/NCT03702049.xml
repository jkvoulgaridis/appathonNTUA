    <textblock>
      Tuberculosis (TB) is the prototypical disease of poverty as it disproportionately affects
      marginalized and impoverished communities. In the US, TB rates are unacceptably high among
      homeless persons who have a 10-fold increase in TB incidence as compared to the general
      population. In California, the rate of TB is more than twice the national case rate and
      recent TB outbreaks have been alarming. Among persons with active TB disease, over 10% die
      during treatment, with mortality being even higher among homeless persons with TB. While TB
      can be prevented by treating TB infection (TBI) before it develops into infectious,
      symptomatic disease, individual factors such as high prevalence of psychosocial
      comorbidities, unstable housing and limited access to care have led to poor adherence and
      completion of TBI treatment among homeless persons.

      Given the complex health disparity factors that affect TBI treatment adherence among homeless
      persons, this study will assess the feasibility of a theoretically-based novel model of care
      among persons with TBI and complex chronic illnesses. This study will evaluate an innovative,
      community-based intervention that addresses critical individual level factors which are
      potential mechanisms that underlie health disparities in completing TBI treatment among the
      predominantly minority homeless. The study hypothesis is that improving these conditions, and
      promoting health by focused screening for TBI, and early detection and treatment for these
      vulnerable adults will improve TB treatment completion and prevent future TB disease.

      The proposed theoretically-based health promotion intervention focuses on: 1) completion of
      TBI treatment, 2) reducing substance use; 3) improving mental health; and 4) improving
      critical social determinants of TB risk (unstable housing and poor health care access) among
      homeless adults in the highest TB prevalence area in Los Angeles. A total of 76 homeless
      adults with TBI will receive this program which includes culturally-sensitive education, case
      management, and directly observed therapy (DOT) delivery of medication among patients who
      have been prescribed 3HP (12 weeks treatment for latent TB infection) by a medical provider.
      This study will determine whether this intervention can achieve higher completion rates than
      the 65% completion rate among homeless persons reported by previous TB programs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tuberculosis (TB) is a global public health threat, which is driven by social factors,
      including poverty, inadequate housing, malnutrition, and substance use. In the United States
      (US), TB disproportionately impacts homeless populations. When compared to the general
      population, homeless persons have a 10-fold increase in TB incidence. Lack of stable housing
      and living in congregate settings are predisposing factors for TB Infection (TBI). Homeless
      persons who develop active TB disease are also at higher risk of death during TB treatment
      due to mental illness and substance use. Even one TB case among a homeless person can easily
      lead to widespread TB transmission due to crowded, poorly ventilated, and congregate living
      situations. Therefore, an extensive public health response is needed for each case of
      infectious TB disease that develops among homeless persons.

      Given the significant public health impact of TB among homeless persons, development of
      effective interventions to prevent TB among homeless persons that are theoretically-based and
      advance science in the area of best adherence strategies to minimize these health disparities
      can lead to significant benefits for patients and further reduce the disparity in TB rates
      between homeless and housed persons. While adherence to traditional TBI treatment with 6 to 9
      months of isoniazid (INH) has been dismal, over the last few years, a promising treatment
      option in form of a 12-dose combination therapy (3HP; rifapentine [RPT] plus isoniazid
      [INH]), delivered once weekly as directly observed therapy (DOT), has achieved treatment
      completion rates of 82%. However, homeless populations who are at high risk for TBI have
      complex, multi-dimensional barriers to TBI treatment adherence. Thus, TBI treatment programs
      in this population have yielded marginal results of 65% completion to date. Among homeless
      persons, health disparities are accentuated by additional barriers to TBI treatment
      adherence, including substance use, mental disorders, and unstable housing.

      Given the complex factors that affect TBI treatment adherence among homeless persons, the
      research team developed a theoretically-based novel model of care that has been successfully
      investigated in other disadvantaged populations. This model involves understanding the
      behavioral, psychological, and environmental influences on health and developing
      culturally-tailored interventions to reduce health disparities, and promote health. By
      engaging nurses, physicians, and community health workers (CHW), the investigators have
      developed a team-based approach to better understand and support medication adherence by
      engaging individuals as active partners in managing their own health. This scientific
      contribution has the potential to be highly significant as new models of care are being
      proposed to improve timely entry, engagement and retention in care, and supportive services
      for homeless persons and other vulnerable populations affected by complex health disparities
      impacting treatment adherence. The pilot study builds on the investigators' extensive three
      decades of research with homeless persons in improving health, including TBI treatment
      adherence, HBV vaccination, and adherence to HIV therapy.

      This study will assess the impact of the TBI program that the investigators have developed,
      as a single arm intervention study, among 76 eligible TBI homeless adults on completion of
      3HP treatment, decrease in drug and alcohol use, improved access to care and mental health,
      and shelter stability. Completion of 3HP will be compared to a minimum standard completion
      rate of 65%. This small pilot will generate the effectiveness data for a future R01
      application to evaluate the intervention in a definitive randomized-controlled trial (RCT).
