  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) caused by surfactant deficiency remains one of the major
      reasons of morbi-mortality in preterm infants and affects 85% of preterm babies born less
      than 32 week gestational age (wGA). The strategy to manage RDS relies on the use of
      surfactant and non-invasive nasal ventilation, to limit tracheal mechanical ventilation.
      During recent years, surfactant administration through a thin catheter in spontaneously
      breathing preterm used in association with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) has
      emerged as a new approach for treating neonates with respiratory failure. The main objectives
      of Less Invasive Surfactant Administration (LISA) are to avoid endotracheal mechanical
      ventilation and its side effects including bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The LISA premedication
      procedure still under debate, because only 1 trial use analgesia or sedation during
      procedure. This reflects neonatologists concerns about side effects (apnea and the need for
      mechanical ventilation) of this premedication. This study aims to optimize sedation during
      LISA procedure by evaluating pain score with Ketamine or Protofol sedation, in Neonatal
      intensive care unit (NICU) patients with RDS.

      Systematic reviews of the prospective studies performed suggest that among preterm infants,
      the use of LISA was associated with the lowest likelihood of the composite outcome of death
      or bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age when compared with the
      other ventilation strategies for preterm infants. Further studies are needed to optimize the
      indications and identify adequate strategies for premedication that preserve respiratory
      function and which limits pain and cardio-respiratory instability associated with laryngeal
      exposure without increasing risks of complications. According to a recent European survey,
      only 48% of neonatologists perform LISA with sedation. In a recent retrospective study,
      Dekker showed a more favorable COMFORTneo score with Propofol versus without, similar rates
      of intubation during LISA. Ketamine infusion has been used in several NICUs with few reported
      effects on respiratory function, but without publication. No prospective studies exist on
      LISA premedication. This study aims to optimize sedation during LISA in NICU patients with
      RDS. Comparing Ketamine and propofol sedation with rate of mechanical tracheal ventilation
      from the start of the LISA procedure up to 2 hours of life, in the NICU of Arnaud de
      Villeneuve University Hospital of Montpellier (France).
