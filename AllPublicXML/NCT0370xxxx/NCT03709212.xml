  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death in patients with Chronic
      Kidney Disease (CKD). Patients who spend a lot of time being inactive have an increased
      chance of developing CVD. Thus, interventions that can help to increase the levels of
      physical activity in patients with CKD are needed. A recent study the investigators completed
      with kidney transplant participants showed a benefit from the investigators supervised
      exercise programme. However, the investigators results showed that 11 of the 18 patients who
      dropped out from the 12-month study were from black and minority ethnic groups. Some patient
      feedback from these participants suggested that cultural beliefs; including women not being
      comfortable to exercise in front of men in an exercise class environment, and difficulties
      around appropriate dress for exercise classes, contributed to some of these participants'
      decisions to withdraw from the study. This has prompted the investigators to investigate, the
      cultural influences that may contribute to patient decisions about partaking in physical
      activity and exercise training. The aim of this study is therefore to invite patients with
      CKD from the three most widely represented ethnic groups found in our South-East London
      Hospital Trust (Black African and African-Caribbean; South Asian, and White Caucasian
      patients) to discuss their beliefs and the cultural influences that may affect their decision
      on whether to engage with exercise and physical activity. Participants will complete a
      questionnaire on physical activity levels, and a questionnaire that looks at a patient's
      readiness to be involved in physical activity, prior to attending interviews or group
      discussions. The questionnaires will be translated for use with non-English speaking
      participants and will be used to ensure we get views on physical activity from those
      participants who are active and not, and ready to be involved in physical activity, and not.
      A combination of individual interviews and group discussions will then be used to explore the
      understanding of the terms 'physical activity' and 'exercise', and cultural barriers to
      participation. The investigators will have interpreters present for all discussions,
      undertaken in the community. The work from this pilot study will be used to inform and design
      a larger multi-centre study with an aim to design physical interventions that are culturally
      sensitive, and appropriate for all patients with CKD in the United Kingdom.

      Background:

      This present study will utilise Stokol's Social Ecological Theory of Health Behaviour as the
      main theoretical framework. This multi-level Ecological theory suggests that an individual's
      behaviour results from a complex interaction between the individual, the environment, and
      community in which they live. Multi-level theories are thought to be more robust and
      explanatory, in comparison to single-level approaches as they are representative of the
      public health approach to population change. Ecological approaches such as Stokol's Social
      Ecological Theory form a robust base to evaluate complex multifactorial behaviours such as
      physical activity. This theory has been used, and is promoted for use, in designing
      community-level health programmes, such as physical activity interventions for different
      ethnic communities. David Howe, a sports anthropologist, will advise the research team with
      the interpretation of the data using this framework.

      Purpose:

      The purpose of this present study is to utilise a mixed-methods design to explore the
      understanding of physical activity and exercise, and factors that contribute to a decision to
      be physically active or sedentary, in patients with CKD from different ethnic backgrounds.
      The investigators intend to measure self-reported physical activity levels with the General
      Practice Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPPAQ) and self-efficacy for exercise (readiness to
      start doing exercise) with Bandura's self-efficacy for exercise scale. The investigators then
      aim to explore perceptions, attitudes and values about physical activity and exercise therapy
      in different ethnic groups. The investigators will ensure that views are captured from
      patients stratified by activity, readiness to be active, age and gender. To accomplish these
      goals, the present study will explore: (i) the understanding of the terms 'physical activity'
      and 'exercise'; (ii) the interpretation of the socio-cultural contexts in which they choose
      (or not) to be physically active, and; (iii) the participants understanding of physical
      activity and exercise opportunities and barriers in their local environment. All
      questionnaires will be translated for non-English speaking participants, and individual and
      focus group discussions will be facilitated with translators.

    <measure>Physical activity through General Practice Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPPAQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of one year</time_frame>
    <description>GPPAQ is a reliable and validated questionnaire used to measure adult physical activity levels.
It contains seven questions and provides a simple, 4-level Physical Activity Index (PAI) of: Active, Moderately Active, Moderately Inactive, and Inactive.
PAI scale from question answers range from 'inactive' which indicates a sedentary job and no physical exercise or cycling. This scale then ranges through to 'active' indicates a sedentary job and â‰¥ 3 hours physical exercise OR a standing job and 1-2.9 hours physical exercise per week OR a physical job and some but &lt; 1 hour physical exercise per week.
The classification of Physical Activity Index gives an indication of how active an adult individual is on a weekly basis.</description>

    <description>Bandura self-efficacy for exercise scale
This questionnaire contains 18 questions to answer with regards to self-efficacy to exercise on a scale of 0-100.
The questions relate to the certainty of the participant to continue with a regular exercise routine (three or more times a week) in relation to the questions posed.
In relation to the scale 0 is 'cannot do at all' and 100 is 'highly certain can do'.
The total score is calculated by summing the responses to each question. The scale has a range of total scores from 0-1,800. A higher score indicates greater exercise related self-efficacy.</description>

        The investigators aim to recruit up to 20 patients (for the individual interviews) and 60
        patients (for the 6 single-sex focus groups), aged over 18 years or over with CKD from the
        3 identified ethnic groups, will be recruited to the study. Each patient must have met the
        inclusion and exclusion criteria at entry level to the study. For focus groups the
        investigators will aim to meet with six to twelve participants per group. Appropriate topic
        guides will be developed and discussed with the patient advisory group, and the steering
        group. The investigators will continue with individual interviews and focus groups until
        data saturation is reached, there is no new data, no new themes, no new coding and the
        investigators are able to replicate the study.
