  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is looking at possible new medicines for weight control in people with high body
      weight. The study looks at how the new medicines work in the body. The study consists of two
      parts. If participants take part in Part 1, they will either get a single dose of
      NNC0165-1875 or a &quot;dummy&quot; medicine (placebo). If participants take part in Part 2, they will
      either get a single dose of NNC0165-1875 or &quot;dummy&quot; medicine and also a single dose of
      semaglutide. Which treatment participants get is decided by chance. For Part 1 participants
      will get 1 injection. For Part 2 participants will get 2 injections. A study nurse at the
      clinic will inject the medicine with a thin needle in a skin fold in the stomach. The study
      will last for about 9 weeks. Participants will have 7 visits to the clinic with the study
      doctor.

    <intervention_model_description>In total, 11 cohorts are planned. Five cohorts in Part 1 (cohort 1-5), and 6 cohorts (cohort 6-11) in Part 2. Each cohort will contain 8 participants. The first 2 participants will be randomised so one participant will receive active (Part 1: NNC0165-1875; Part 2: NNC0165-1875 and semaglutide) while the other receive placebo (Part 1: placebo; Part 2: placebo and semaglutide) treatment. The participants will remain in-house for a 5 days safety observation period. The remaining 6 subjects will be dosed at least after 96 hours.</intervention_model_description>
