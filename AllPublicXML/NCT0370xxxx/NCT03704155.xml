      Purpose: The aim of this study was investigate the effects of botulinum toxin type A (BoNT-A)
      associated with physical therapy on the functional capacity of children with spastic cerebral
      palsy (CP). Material and methods: Twenty-four children with spastic CP were concealed and
      randomly assigned to the Experimental Group (EG) consisting of 12 patients treated with
      BoNT-A and physical therapy and Control with 12 patients treated only with physical therapy.
      All participants were assessed through motor and functional scales (GMFM-88, Ashworth, Berg
      Balance Scale, TUG test and Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory) at three different
      times: before and after 30 days of treatment as well as 3 months after the end of treatment.

    <description>Botulinum Toxin type A The intervention with BoNT-A (DysportÂ®, Ipsen Biopharmaceutical, USA) was performed in the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles, bilaterally for diplegic children and unilaterally for hemiplegic children.</description>

    <description>Physiotherapeutic intervention was performed twice a week, with duration of one hour per session for 4 weeks. To maintain standardization of treatment, physiotherapists received a booklet with instructions on what treatment they should do.
The intervention protocol consisted of:
Passive stretching of lower limbs,
Stretching associated with the functionality of the plantar flexor muscles, knee flexors, adductors and hip flexors;
Strengthening of the antagonist muscles with the application of BoNT-A;
Static and dynamic balance training;
Up and down stairs;
Functional walking training, prioritizing the initial contact of the heel and active and passive dorsiflexion.</description>
