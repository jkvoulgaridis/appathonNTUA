    <textblock>
      The study is to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying the occurrence of malignant
      cerebral edema (cerebral hernia) after large hemispheric infarction. Acute LHI (&lt;=48h)
      patients that develop cerebral hernia or not within 5 days post-stroke onset, as well as the
      healthy controls will be studied. The participants will be followed for up to 6 months post
      stroke-onset, and their modified Rankin Scale (mRS) will be recorded. A mRS score of 0-4 is
      considered as a favorable outcome while a score of 5-6 as an unfavorable one.

    <textblock>
      A total of 80 patients with acute large hemispheric infarction (LHI) within 48h after
      occurrence admitted into NICU of Xuanwu Hospital as well as 40 healthy volunteers will be
      recruited. The patients' baseline characteristics, treatment and changes of clinical
      conditions will be recorded, and ICP monitoring (D2-D7 post-stroke), chest X-ray (D2, D7, D14
      post-stroke), ECG (D2, D7, D14 post-stroke), cerebral vascular ultrasound, TCD and head MRI
      (T1WI, T2WI, FLAIR, DWI) on D2 and D14 post-stroke will be performed. Blood samples from both
      the LHI patients (D2, D4, D7, and D14 post-stroke) and the controls will be analyzed for NEU,
      TNF-alpha, IL-1b, IL-6, IL-8, IL-17, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, MPO, NE, MMP-9,miRNA, free dsDNA, H3CIT
      and NETosis levels. All patients were treated for brain edema with osmotic medicationsâ€”either
      intravenous 20% mannitol or 10% hypertonic saline. In addition, some patients were treated
      with decompressive surgery.The patients will be followed up to 6 months and their modified
      Rankin Scale (mRS) will be recorded. A mRS score of 0-4 is considered as a favorable outcome
      while a score of 5-6 as an unfavorable one. Statistical differences in the different
      parameters between different groups at different time points will be analyzed by SPSS 22.0
      software.

    <description>modified Rankin Scale: 0 - No symptoms. 1 - No significant disability. Able to carry out all usual activities, despite some symptoms.2 - Slight disability. Able to look after own affairs without assistance, but unable to carry out all previous activities. 3 - Moderate disability. Requires some help, but able to walk unassisted. 4 - Moderately severe disability. Unable to attend to own bodily needs without assistance, and unable to walk unassisted. 5 - Severe disability. Requires constant nursing care and attention, bedridden, incontinent. 6 - Dead. A score of 0-4 is considered as a favorable outcome, whereas a score of 5-6 was considered as an unfavorable one. The reasons for death should be also recorded.</description>
