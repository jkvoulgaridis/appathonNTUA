  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase 1 study, a single dose of ZTI-01 given to pediatric subjects (under 12 years of age)
      who require antibiotic therapy to see what the body does to the drug (pharmacokinetics) and
      to compare if these effects are similar to those observed in adults at a 6g ZTI-01 dose.
      Study will help establish pediatric dosing in younger children by age cohort. This is a
      multiple-center, open-label, PK study of ZTI-01 (fosfomycin for injection) single dose scaled
      by allometric weight-modeling from an adult ZTI-01 dose of 6 grams. Eligible subjects must be
      receiving standard of care antibiotics for proven or suspected bacterial infection or for
      peri-operative prophylaxis surgery (in or out of hospital).

      Based on pre-dose weight on Day -1, subjects weighing within the 3rd to &lt; 97th percentile
      based on age - will receive a single, weight adjusted dose of ZTI-01 via continuous IV
      infusion or syringe pump over a 1- hour (+10 min) period. Pediatric subjects participating in
      this study will be assigned to one of three cohorts based on age:

      Cohort 1: ≥ 6 years to &lt;12 years (n=6 PK evaluable subjects) Cohort 2: ≥ 2 years to &lt;6 years
      (n=6 PK evaluable subjects)

      Cohort 3: Birth to &lt; 2 years (n=9 PK evaluable subjects), split into 3 subgroups:

      (3a) Birth (defined as full term: 37 weeks of gestations or greater) to &lt; 3 mos, (3b) ≥ 3 mos
      to &lt; 6 mos, (3c) ≥ 6 mos to &lt; 24 months

      Cohorts 1 and 2 will be enrolled first with safety and PK data evaluated before enrolling the
      youngest Cohort 3. Blood for fosfomycin concentration measurement will be collected
      throughout the study. Safety will be assessed by monitoring adverse and serious adverse
      events based on medical history, vital signs, ECG, laboratory assessment and physical
      examination.
