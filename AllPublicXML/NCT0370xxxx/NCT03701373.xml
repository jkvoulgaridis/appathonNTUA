  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastric cancer remains the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide and is
      especially frequent in East Asia. Fluoropyrimidines are the backbone of first-line
      chemotherapy for advanced gastric cancer (AGC), and S-1 provides new option with its
      simplicity and convenience.

      5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) was the only efficacious treatment for AGC before the nineties of the
      20th century, and afterwards with the discovery of chemotherapy such as cisplatin,
      oxaliplatin, S-1 and capecitabine, response rate as well as survival had been improved
      greatly.

      Most of AGC will progress after first-line treatment; therefore, seeking an efficient and low
      toxic maintaining regimen to prolong progression-free survival (PFS) becomes a hot topic in
      oncologic field. Some clinical researches demonstrated maintenance treatment for advanced
      colorectal cancer (CRC) and lung cancer. The investigators had conducted a phase III clinical
      trial that demonstrated capecitabine maintenance versus observation prolonged PFS
      significantly after first-line chemotherapy with FOLFOX or XELOX regimens in advanced CRC. In
      AGC, several retrospective studies revealed patients receiving 5-FU/leucovorin(LV),
      capecitabine, or trastuzumab maintaining therapy experienced significantly longer PFS than
      that stopped chemotherapy after first-line chemotherapy. Some one-arm phase II clinical
      trials found 5-FU/LV, capecitabine, S-1, capecitabine plus bevacirumab, or capecitabine plus
      bevacirumab plus trastuzumab maintenance seemed to yield sound PFS and good tolerance.
      However, there were no randomized controlled clinical trials for maintenance treatment of
      these regimens in AGC, except that a phase II Chinese randomized controlled trial of Uracil
      and Tegafur (UFT) versus observation experienced early termination.

      Above all, so far, there is no data to demonstrate that regular 2-6 months of chemotherapy
      followed by maintenance treatment could prolong PFS and OS for AGC. S-1 is effective for
      gastric cancer, and was approved as palliative treatment for advanced gastric cancer and
      adjuvant treatment; in addition, with its relative less frequency of side effects and
      convenient oral administration, S-1 as maintenance regimen could be prone to be accepted by
      patients. Therefore, the current study is designed to investigate that S-1 as maintenance
      treatment after first-line palliative chemotherapy could improve PFS and OS for patients with
      advanced gastric cancer through a perspective randomized clinical study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with AGC who achieved objective response or stable disease after 2-6 months of
      first-line chemotherapy were randomly assigned to one of two groups, to receive either S-1
      (40 mg for BSA&lt;1.25 m2, 50 mg for 1.25≤BSA&lt;1.50 m2 and 60 mg for BSA≥1.50 m2 b.i.d. on days
      1-14, q3w) as maintenance therapy or observation. The treatment will continue until disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.
