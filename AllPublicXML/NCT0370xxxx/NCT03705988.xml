  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tic disorders is recognized as a neuropsychiatric disease. The treatments of tic disorders
      include drug therapy, psychotherapy and physical therapy. As a non-invasive therapy, cranial
      electrotherapy stimulation(CES) is approved to have few side effects and applied in various
      areas, especially in psychiatric diseases. However, up to now there have been no results
      about the effects of CES in the treatment of tic disorders.The investigators hope CES could
      offer a useful approach for treating tic disorders.

      The investigators will conduct a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled trial to determine
      the efficacy of CES as an add-on treatment for tic disorders (SCATT). The study will be
      conducted at an outpatient, single-center academic setting. A total of 100 patients aged 6 to
      17 years with tic disorders and lack of clinical response to 4 weeks' pharmacotherapy will be
      enrolled. Patients will be randomly into 2 groups and given 4 weeks' treatment, including 40
      daily 30-minute sessions of active CES(500μA~2mA) or sham CES(lower than 100μA) on weekdays.
      Change in Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS) is considered to be the primary outcome. The
      secondary outcome is the changes in Clinical Global Impression (CGI) and Hamilton Anxiety
      Scale (HAMA). Assessments will be performed at baseline, week 2, week 4 and week 8. Adverse
      events(AE) will be also evaluated.

    <description>Change in Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS) at baseline and week 2, 4, 8. The YGTSS is applied by means of a semistructured interview with multiple informants (generally, the parents) who assess the child's tics over a period of at least one week.</description>

    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in The Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A) at baseline and week 2, 4, 8.
The HAM-A consists of 14 items, each defined by a series of symptoms, and measures both psychic anxiety (mental agitation and psychological distress) and somatic anxiety (physical complaints related to anxiety). Scores range from 0 to 56 where 14-17 indicates mild anxiety, 18-24 indicates moderate anxiety and scores of 25 and over indicate severe anxiety.</description>

    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Any adverse event notified spontaneously by the subject, or observed by the research team will be recorded on the form designed for this purpose. The researcher will classify the intensity of adverse events in accordance with the following scale: Mild: some discomfort experienced but not such as to interrupt normal daily activity.
Moderate: sufficient discomfort to reduce or notably affect normal daily activity. Severe: provoking incapacity to work or perform normal daily activity.</description>
