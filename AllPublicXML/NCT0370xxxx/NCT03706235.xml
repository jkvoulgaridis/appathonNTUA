      To compare the sensitivity and specificity estimates of Colvera with that of a commercially
      available CEA test for detection of recurrent disease in CRC subjects who are undergoing
      surveillance for recurrence.

      This is an observational, prospective comparison study, where blood is collected for assay of
      methylated BCAT1 and IKZF1 DNA and CEA, from subjects who have undergone curative treatment
      for primary CRC of stages II and III (AJCC) and who are in remission and scheduled for
      follow-up radiological imaging as part of their surveillance program for recurrence.
      Participation is for one visit only as part of each subject's surveillance-monitoring
      schedule. Two K2-EDTA blood tubes and two PAXgeneâ„¢ tubes will be collected Any evidence of
      methylated BCAT1 and/or IKZF1 DNA in blood represents a Colvera &quot;positive&quot; result. CEA levels
      of 5ug/L or higher will represent a &quot;positive&quot; result. Sensitivity and specificity of the
      Colvera and CEA test will be estimated and compared in a paired fashion in each case where
      recurrence status has been investigated and determined by the site clinical management team.
      Blood testing shall be performed and analyzed by qualified staff blinded to clinical status.
      This is a cross-sectional observational non-significant risk study, and test results will not
      be used for clinical management, i.e. there will be no interventions in subjects consenting
      to participate in this Research Study.
