  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single centre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel staggered
      group study of BIA 5-1058 in 10 different cohorts of 15 healthy subjects. Subjects will be
      randomly assigned to receive once-daily oral doses of BIA 5-1058 or matching placebo for 10
      days.

      The primary objectives of the study are to assess the safety and tolerability of BIA 5-1058
      after repeated ascending doses under fed and fasted conditions and to assess the
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of BIA 5-1058 after repeated ascending doses under fed conditions
      having matching fasting cohorts for comparison of bioavailability.

      It is planned that comparison cohorts will be dosed in parallel, i.e. Cohorts 1 and 2, 3 and
      4, 5 and 6, 7 and 8 and 9 and 10. Cohorts may be split or dosed sequentially for logistical
      purposes; however, data from both comparison cohorts (e.g. Cohorts 1 and 2) must be available
      before dose escalation to the next dose levels.

    <textblock>
      Each cohort will follow the same study design. Subjects will be screened for inclusion in the
      study between 28 and 3 days before the first dose. Eligible subjects will be admitted 2 days
      before dosing (Day 2) for all regimens, and will remain resident in the clinic until 72 h
      after the last dose (Day 13).

      On Day -1, blood samples will be taken in all cohorts for PD assessments at pre-defined time
      points. These time points will be time matched to Day 1 PK and PD time points. Subjects in
      Cohorts 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 (fed cohorts) will also undergo continuous cardiac monitoring via
      24 h Holter recordings on Day -1.

      Subjects in Cohorts 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 will receive oral doses of BIA 5 1058 or matching
      placebo once daily from Day 1 to Day 10, administered in the morning of each day after a
      minimum of 8 h fast and will remain fasted until 4 h post-dose. Subjects in Cohorts 2, 4, 6,
      8 and 10 will receive oral doses of BIA 5 1058 or matching placebo once daily from Day 1 to
      Day 10, administered in the morning of each day, 30 minutes after the start of a moderate
      breakfast containing approximately 550 kcal with fat contributing approximately 150 kcal.

      There will be an interim review of the safety and PK data up to 24 h following the Day 6 dose
      of each set of comparison cohorts to confirm the dosing regimen for the next comparison
      cohorts.

      Subjects will attend the clinic for a follow-up visit 14 ± 2 days after the final dose or
      within 5 to 7 days after early withdrawal or at the discretion of the investigator.

      The estimated duration of the study from screening until the follow-up visit is 8 weeks.
