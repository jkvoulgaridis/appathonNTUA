  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, multi-site, randomized controlled trial (RCT) that will recruit 200
      participants.The purpose of the RCT will be to evaluate the efficacy of transcranial direct
      current stimulation (tDCS) in combination with mindfulness meditation compared to sham tDCS
      to maintain wellness following an acute course of repetitive transcranial magnetic
      stimulation (rTMS) for up to 6 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Home-based tDCS (active vs. sham) will involve 30-min tDCS (3 days per week) for the first 3
      months and once weekly for the subsequent 3 months, in combination with mindfulness mediation
      for the duration of tDCS each treatment. Subjects who miss 4 consecutive treatment days or 20
      percent of total treatments will be exit the treatment intervention as it is our intention to
      encourage compliance with the proposed treatments to maintain optimal wellness.

      Aim 1. To investigate the efficacy of at home maintenance tDCS for patients with MDD who have
      responded to a successful acute course of rTMS.

      Hypothesis 1. Patients receiving tDCS will have a higher proportion of sustained responders
      or remitters after 6 months compared to sham tDCS.

      Exploratory Aim 2. To investigate clinical predictors of sustained response to rTMS using
      tDCS Hypothesis 2. Remitters and those not on benzodiazepines will be associated with greater
      likelihood of sustained response.

    <description>This scale is used to quantify the severity of symptoms of depression
Scale range: 0-52 (total score)

Remitters will discontinue tDCS and discuss treatment options if they have an HRSD-17 score of &gt;18 over 2 consecutive assessments separated by at least 1 week.</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to this group will receive active tDCS 3 times a week for approximately 3 months and then weekly for 3 months. After completing baseline procedures they will be trained how to apply the tDCS device themselves. The first 3-6 treatments will be completed at the hospital to ensure proper and safe application. Prior to taking the tDCS device home, they will pass the self-application scale adequately 3 times. Each treatment session lasts 30 minutes, during which, they will engage in mindfulness meditation.</description>
