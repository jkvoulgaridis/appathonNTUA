    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the recommended dose and evaluate the
      effect of KW-6356 on motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease and the primary endpoint is the
      change from baseline in Movement disorder society-unified Parkinson's disease rating
      scale(MDS-UPDRS) partIII score between KW-6356 and placebo in patients with Parkinson's
      disease on treatment with Levodopa-containing preparations as an adjunctive therapy.

    <time_frame>Up to 26 weeks after dosing</time_frame>
    <description>MDS-UPDRS retains the four-scale structure with a reorganization of the various subscales. The scales are now titled; (Part I) nonmotor experiences of daily living (13 items), (Part II) motor experiences of daily living (13 items), (Part III) motor examination (18 items), and (Part IV) motor complications (six items). Each subscale now has 0-4 ratings, where 0 = normal, 1 = slight, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, and 4 = severe.
The total score is the sum of the subscale scores for Parts III and ranges from 0 (no disability) to 136 (total dependence).</description>
