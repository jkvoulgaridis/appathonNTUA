      This research is being done to learn more about reduced-intensity bone marrow transplantation
      (BMT), also known as a &quot;mini&quot; transplant for patients with blood cancers, using bone marrow
      from a relative.

      The main goal of the study is to determine how quickly the donor's bone marrow &quot;takes&quot; in
      your body. Other goals include describing how many people accept the bone marrow and how
      quickly the blood counts come up; describing Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and other
      complications; and describing how many people survive without progressive cancer and survive
      overall

    <textblock>
      At the present time there are few or no cures for people with cancer of the blood or lymph
      glands outside of a bone marrow transplant (BMT). BMT has developed over several decades of
      research as an effective treatment of various malignant and nonmalignant hematologic
      diseases.

      This research is being done to learn more about reduced-intensity bone marrow transplantation
      (BMT), also known as a &quot;mini&quot; transplant for patients with blood cancers, using bone marrow
      from a relative. The bone marrow for this transplant comes from a relative who is a
      half-match or &quot;haplo&quot; match to you. Possible donors include parents, siblings, and children.

      &quot;Mini&quot; transplants have been given to many people with various cancers but are considered
      experimental. Over 200 people at Johns Hopkins have received mini transplants with high doses
      of cyclophosphamide after the transplant. However, the chemotherapy combination and other
      treatment given before those transplants were different from what is in this study. Although
      all of the chemotherapy and immune-lowering drugs used in this study are approved by the Food
      and Drug Administration (FDA), the combination of medications used in this study are not FDA
      approved and are experimental.
