  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - Traumatic brain injury may have a range of effects, from severe and permanent disability to
      more subtle functional and cognitive deficits that often go undetected during initial
      treatment. To improve treatments and therapies and to provide a uniform quality of care,
      researchers are interested in developing more standardized criteria for diagnosing and
      classifying different types of traumatic brain injury. By identifying imaging and other
      indicators immediately after the injury and during the initial treatment phrase, researchers
      hope to better understand the nature and effects of acute traumatic brain injury.

      Objectives:

      - To study the natural history of traumatic brain injury by examining the changes in brain
      scans, blood samples, and brain function over 5 years after a the injury.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals between 18 and 70 years of age who have had a traumatic brain injury within the
      past 6 months.

      Design:

        -  This study will include about eight visits to the NIH Clinical Center over 5 years.
           Participants will have four visits in the first year, and one visit each year for the
           following 4 years. Each visit will take between 1 and 4 days, and participants will be
           in the outpatient clinic for about 8 hours each day of the visit.

        -  At each study visit, participants will have some or all of the following tests:

        -  Medical history and physical examination

        -  Blood and urine tests

        -  Questionnaires and assessments of thinking and memory, which may be spoken aloud,
           written down, or entered into a computer

        -  Imaging scans, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or positron emission
           tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT).

        -  This study does not provide treatment and does not replace any current therapies.
           However, participants who are eligible for other National Institutes of Health studies
           may be referred to these studies by researchers.

      Objective

      The primary objective is to contribute to the understanding of non-penetrating traumatic
      brain injury (TBI) through the description of the relationships between neuroimaging,
      hematological, and extensive functional/cognitive phenotyping measures. We will generate
      natural history data for cohort-based comparisons and to serve as the basis for future
      hypothesis-driven protocols. In addition, we will create and test a series of new taxonomies
      to describe TBI severity and predict outcome.

      Study Population

      Three hundred adult subjects with a clinical diagnosis of non-penetrating TBI (mild, moderate
      and severe) will be enrolled. Subjects will be recruited from NIH, affiliated
      hospitals/clinics, and in the community. Additionally, a select group of up to 80 US
      government associated personnel experiencing TBI-like symptoms arising after possible
      exposure to a non-natural energy source, will be studied (select exposure group). This select
      group will require a separate age and sex matched group of 80 unaffected volunteers.

      Design

      This is a natural history study following a prospective cohort of subjects with a clinical
      diagnosis of non-penetrating traumatic brain injury with a cross-sectional sub-study.
      Subjects will be enrolled in the prospective cohort within one year of their head injury and
      then followed periodically for five years, with neuroimaging, including Magnetic Resonance
      Imaging (MRI), hematological, and extensive functional/cognitive phenotyping measures.
      Subjects will be enrolled in the cross-sectional sub-study within five years of their head
      injury and may be evaluated with MRI, hematological, and functional/cognitive measures
      usually within a single visit. However, procedures may be scheduled during multiple visits,
      depending on the number of procedures performed. Study participants may be offered standard
      of care rehabilitation therapies provided at no cost by Investigators and supervised by Dr.
      Chan. Tests will be subject to investigator discretion and subject willingness to participate
      in evaluation. After first MRI, future MRI s will be obtained based on subject willingness
      and investigator discretion from findings on previous imaging. Subjects will be stratified
      according to findings into cohorts for comparison. Subjects will not be treated with
      experimental therapies as part of the research study. This study will provide direct benefit
      to subjects as they will receive sensitive neuro-imaging and clinical testing that may have
      diagnostic value and rehabilitation therapies that might not be provided to them in the
      community. In addition to the TBI patient group, a longitudinal control group comprised of
      healthy volunteers will be collected. The control group participants may complete the
      Neuroimaging (MRI without gadolinium), hematological and functional/cognitive phenotyping
      measures as the TBI patient population.

      The prospective select exposure group of US government associated personnel will be followed
      periodically for a total of six years. Subjects may complete neuroimaging, including Magnetic
      Resonance Imaging (MRI), hematological, and extensive functional/cognitive, auditory,
      vestibular, and oculomotor phenotyping measures. In addition to the select exposure group, a
      longitudinal control group comprised of unaffected volunteers matched to this group will be
      collected. The control group participants will complete the same Neuroimaging (MRI without
      gadolinium), hematological and functional/cognitive phenotyping measures as the select
      exposure patient population. Additionally, if a select exposure matched control participant
      is subsequently exposed, they may enroll into the select exposure group arm of the study for
      pre and post exposure analysis.

      Outcome Measures

      A variety of outcome measures will be used including MRI, to include Diffusion Tensor Imaging
      (DTI), Dynamic Susceptibility Contrast (DSC), and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging
      (fMRI), high field 7T MRI. In addition, extensive and sensitive clinical phenotyping will be
      performed to assess functional and cognitive impairment, and quality of life assessments.
      Blood and saliva (buccal cells may be collected in lieu of whole blood for subjects unwilling
      or unable to provide blood draw) may also be collected and sent to a biorepository for future
      analysis if subject agrees to participation in sample collection.

        Three hundred adult subjects with a clinical diagnosis of non-penetration TBI will be
        enrolled. Recruitment will occur from NIH, affiliated hospitals/clinics in the community as
        well as local practioners offices. One hundred healthy volunteers without a history of TBI
        will be recruited to compare outcomes to TBI participants. A select exposure group of up to
        40 US government associated personnel experiencing TBI like symptoms arising after possible
        exposure to a non-natural energy source will be studied. An age and sex matched cohort of
        non TBI healthy volunteers will be recruited for comparison.
