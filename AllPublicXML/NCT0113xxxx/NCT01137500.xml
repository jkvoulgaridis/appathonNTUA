  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Various haemodynamic changes are observed during laparoscopic surgery, relating to
      insufflation of CO2 &amp; patient position. Cardiac output calculations using oesophageal doppler
      monitoring are based on the assumption that the aortic diameter is fixed. This study aims to
      measure the aortic diameter at preset times during surgery using ultrasound to discover if
      the diameter remains the same, and hence if the assumptions made by the oesophageal monitor
      are reliable. Assessing the aortic diameter involves a noninvasive ultrasound measurement
      taken in patients electively having laparoscopic procedures at the Royal Surrey County
      Hospital.

      Purpose and design:This study aims to measure the aortic diameter at preset times during
      surgery using ultrasound to discover if the diameter remains the same, and hence if the
      assumptions made by the oesophageal monitor are reliable. Assessing the aortic diameter
      involves a noninvasive ultrasound measurement taken in patients electively having
      laparoscopic procedures at the Royal Surrey County Hospital.

      Recruitment: Patients undergoing elective laparoscopic procedures at the Royal Surrey County
      Hospital. Recruitment done by Dr M Dickinson or Dr M Scott (COnsultant Anaesthetists). No
      therapeutic promises are to be made as this is purely an observational study.

      Inclusion / exclusion: Patient refusal, Surgical refusal, Conversion to an open procedure.

      Consent: Informed consent will be gained from each participant.

      Risks, burdens and benefits: This is an observational study using a non invasive technique in
      patients undergoing elective surgery. There is very little in the way of risks, burdens and
      benefits to the patient.

      Confidentiality: Caldicott principles will be adhered to.

      Conflict of interest: None.

      Use of tissue samples in future research: None.
