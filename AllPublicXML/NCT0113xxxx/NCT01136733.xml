    <measure>Phase 1b: Number of Participants With Dose-limiting Toxicity (DLT)</measure>
    <time_frame>First dose of study drug (Cycle 1 Day 1) to end of first 4 weeks of therapy (Cycle 1)</time_frame>
    <description>A DLT was defined as either a treatment-related failure to administer greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 75% of the planned dosage of lenvatinib/everolimus or a specific National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI CTC) &gt;= Grade 3 (severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self-care daily living activities) hematologic or nonhematologic toxicities considered to be possibly related to lenvatinib and/or everolimus therapy assessed during the first treatment cycle of each dose level. Higher grade indicates more severe toxicity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Phase 1b: Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and Recommended Phase 2 (RP2) Dose</measure>
    <time_frame>First dose of study drug (Cycle 1 Day 1) to end of Cycle 2 (1 cycle = 28 days/4 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The highest dose level resulting in 0 or 1 DLT in 6 participants was to be considered the MTD of Phase 1b. Once the MTD was established, the participant cohort was expanded to a minimum of 10 participants. The MTD was confirmed by assessing DLTs during Cycle 1 and intolerable toxicities (i.e., not manageable with dose interruption and/or reduction) during Cycle 2 of therapy. Once the dose of lenvatinib/everolimus combination to be used in the succeeding Phase 2 part of the study was established, enrollment into Phase 2 was started. The RP2 dose was the same as the confirmed MTD and was used for the Phase 2 Treatment Arm A of this study.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Phase 2: Progression-Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Date of randomization into Phase 2 (Cycle 1 Day 1) to the date of first documentation of disease progression or death (whichever occurred first), assessed up to data cutoff date (13 Jun 2014), up to approximately 2 years and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>PFS was defined as the time (in months) from the date of first dose of study drug to the first documentation of disease progression or death, whichever occurred first. Kaplan-Meier (K-M) estimates were used to estimate median PFS, presented with 2-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Tumor assessments were performed every 8 weeks (or sooner if there was evidence of progressive disease using computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and scan acquisition techniques (including use or nonuse of intravenous (IV) contrast). Tumor response was determined at the site by the investigator and radiologist using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 in the evaluation of the tumor assessment scans. The date of objective disease progression was defined as the earliest date of radiological disease progression. Participants removed from therapy due to clinical progression with no radiologic confirmation were censored at their last radiologic assessment date.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Phase 2: Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization (Cycle 1 Day 1) until date of death from any cause, assessed up to the data cutoff date (10 Dec 2014), up to approximately 2 years and 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>OS was defined as the time (in months) from the date of randomization until date of death from any cause. Median survival time was calculated using K-M estimate for each treatment arm and presented with 2-sided 95% CIs. Participants who were lost to follow-up or alive at the data cutoff date (10 Dec 2014) were censored at the date the participants were last known to be alive.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Phase 2: Objective Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization (Cycle 1 Day 1) until first evidence of disease progression, assessed up to the data cutoff date (13 Jun 2014), or up to approximately 2 years and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The ORR was defined as the percentage of participants who had the best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as determined by the investigator, using RECIST 1.1 in the evaluation of MRI or CT scans of targeted lesions. Tumor assessments were performed every 8 weeks (or sooner if there was evidence of progressive disease). The BOR was defined as the best response recorded from the start of the study treatment until discontinuation from the study. CR was defined as disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) had to have reduction in short axis to less than 10 mm. PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. ORR = CR + PR was calculated with exact 95% CIs using the method of Clopper and Pearson.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disease Control Rate (DCR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Randomization) to first evidence of disease progression, assessed up to the data cutoff date (13 Jun 2014), or up to approximately 2 years and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The DCR was defined as the percentage of participants who had a BOR of CR or PR or SD (minimum duration from randomization to SD greater than or equal to 7 weeks). Assessments were performed every 8 weeks and were based on investigator review data using RECIST 1.1. The 95% CI was constructed using the method of Clopper and Pearson. DCR = CR + PR + SD greater than or equal to 7 weeks.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Durable Stable Disease (SD) Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Randomization) to first evidence of disease progression, assessed up to the data cutoff date (13 Jun 2014), or up to approximately 2 years and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The durable SD rate was defined as the percentage of participants whose BOR was SD and the duration of SD was greater than or equal to 23 weeks. The durable SD was based on investigator review data using RECIST 1.1. The 95% CI was constructed using the method of Clopper and Pearson.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Randomization) to first evidence of disease progression, assessed up to the data cutoff date (13 Jun 2014), or up to approximately 2 years and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The CBR was defined as the percentage of participants who had BOR of CR, PR, or durable SD (duration of SD was greater than or equal to 23 weeks) and was based on investigator review data using RECIST 1.1. The BOR was defined as the best response recorded from the start of study treatment until discontinuation from the study. There was no requirement for confirmatory measurement of PR or CR to deem either one the BOR. The 95% CI was constructed using the method of Clopper and Pearson. CBR = CR + PR + SD greater than or equal to 23 weeks.</description>

    <measure>Summary of Plasma Concentrations of Lenvatinib for Sparse Pharmacokinetic (PK) Sampling for Phase 1b and Phase 2</measure>
    <time_frame>Cycle 1 (Day 1), Cycle 2 (Day 1), Cycle 3 (Day 1)</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples were collected during the Randomization Phase. Most participants had 6 samples taken over 3 cycles of treatment (sparse sampling - 2 samples taken per cycle, one at predose and one at 2 to 8 hours postdose). Plasma concentrations of lenvatinib were measured and concentration data were summarized. The summary statistics at time points with one or more below the limit of quantitation (BLQ) values were calculated by assigning zero for each BLQ value.</description>

    <time_frame>Cycle 1 (Day 1), Cycle 2 (Day 1), Cycle 3 (Day 1)</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples were collected during the Randomization Phase. Most participants had 6 samples taken over 3 cycles of treatment (sparse sampling - 2 samples taken per cycle, one at predose and one at 2 to 8 hours postdose). Whole blood concentrations of everolimus were measured and concentration data were summarized. The summary statistics at time points with one or more BLQ values were calculated by assigning zero for each BLQ value.</description>

    <measure>Area Under the Plasma Concentration-Time Curve From 0 to 24 Hours (AUC(0-24)) for Lenvatinib When Administered Alone or in Combination With Everolimus</measure>
    <time_frame>Phase 2: Cycle 1 Day 15 immediately predose, and 30 minutes, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12 (optional), and 24 hours postdose (predose on Day 16)</time_frame>
    <description>Between 9 and 12 participants in each of the 3 treatment arms participated in an optional substudy where instead of the sparse sampling, 9 samples were to be taken over 1 single 24-hour period (i.e., intensive sampling) for full PK profiling. Blood samples were analyzed for study drug using standardized methods. PK parameters for lenvatinib were derived from lenvatinib concentration data using non-compartmental methods. Data were compared via descriptive statistics between single agent and combination therapy.</description>

          <title>Phase 1b (Cohort 1): 12 mg Lenvatinib Plus 5 mg Everolimus</title>
          <description>Oral lenvatinib (12 mg) and everolimus (5 mg) were taken once daily in continuous 28-day cycles. Dose Escalation Cohort-Cycle 1: both study drugs were taken at the same time of day in a fasting state with water. Cycles 2, 3, etc. and Expansion Cohort: both study drugs were taken at the same time of day with water, either after a meal or in a fasting state. Dose escalation began with 3 participants in Cohort 1. If no dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) occurred, then enrollment proceeded to Cohort 2. If 1 participant had a DLT, 3 more participants were enrolled in Cohort 1. If 1 or none of the 6 participants had a DLT, then enrollment proceeded to Cohort 2.
If 2 or more participants had a DLT during Cycle 1, the dose escalation committee (DEC) decided if they were lenvatinib-related and if enrollment could proceed, lenvatinib was reduced to 6 mg daily (everolimus dose was not reduced). If it could not be determined that the DLTs were lenvatinib-related, enrollment stopped.</description>

If 1 or none of the 6 participants exhibited a DLT, enrollment proceeded to Cohort 3.
If 2 or more participants had a DLT during Cycle 1, dose escalation ceased and additional participants were enrolled to the next lower dose to achieve a total of 6 participants in that cohort.</description>

          <description>Oral lenvatinib (12 mg) and everolimus (5 mg) were taken once daily in continuous 28-day cycles. Dose Escalation Cohort-Cycle 1: both study drugs were taken at the same time of day in a fasting state with water. Cycles 2, 3, etc. and Expansion Cohort: both study drugs were taken at the same time of day with water, either after a meal or in a fasting state. Dose escalation began with 3 participants in Cohort 1. If no dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) occurred, then enrollment proceeded to Cohort 2. If 1 participant had a DLT, 3 more participants were enrolled in Cohort 1. If 1 or none of the 6 participants had a DLT, then enrollment proceeded to Cohort 2.
If 2 or more participants had a DLT during Cycle 1, the dose escalation committee (DEC) decided if they were lenvatinib-related and if enrollment could proceed, lenvatinib was reduced to 6 mg daily (everolimus dose was not reduced). If it could not be determined that the DLTs were lenvatinib-related, enrollment stopped.</description>

        <description>The highest dose level resulting in 0 or 1 DLT in 6 participants was to be considered the MTD of Phase 1b. Once the MTD was established, the participant cohort was expanded to a minimum of 10 participants. The MTD was confirmed by assessing DLTs during Cycle 1 and intolerable toxicities (i.e., not manageable with dose interruption and/or reduction) during Cycle 2 of therapy. Once the dose of lenvatinib/everolimus combination to be used in the succeeding Phase 2 part of the study was established, enrollment into Phase 2 was started. The RP2 dose was the same as the confirmed MTD and was used for the Phase 2 Treatment Arm A of this study.</description>

        <description>PFS was defined as the time (in months) from the date of first dose of study drug to the first documentation of disease progression or death, whichever occurred first. Kaplan-Meier (K-M) estimates were used to estimate median PFS, presented with 2-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Tumor assessments were performed every 8 weeks (or sooner if there was evidence of progressive disease using computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and scan acquisition techniques (including use or nonuse of intravenous (IV) contrast). Tumor response was determined at the site by the investigator and radiologist using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 in the evaluation of the tumor assessment scans. The date of objective disease progression was defined as the earliest date of radiological disease progression. Participants removed from therapy due to clinical progression with no radiologic confirmation were censored at their last radiologic assessment date.</description>

        <title>Phase 2: Objective Response Rate (ORR)</title>
        <description>The ORR was defined as the percentage of participants who had the best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as determined by the investigator, using RECIST 1.1 in the evaluation of MRI or CT scans of targeted lesions. Tumor assessments were performed every 8 weeks (or sooner if there was evidence of progressive disease). The BOR was defined as the best response recorded from the start of the study treatment until discontinuation from the study. CR was defined as disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) had to have reduction in short axis to less than 10 mm. PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. ORR = CR + PR was calculated with exact 95% CIs using the method of Clopper and Pearson.</description>

Dose Escalation Cohort-Cycle 1: both study drugs were taken at the same time of day in a fasting state with water.

Dose escalation began with 3 participants in Cohort 1. If no dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) occurred, then enrollment proceeded to Cohort 2. If 1 participant had a DLT, 3 more participants were enrolled in Cohort 1. If 1 or none of the 6 participants had a DLT, then enrollment proceeded to Cohort 2.
If 2 or more participants had a DLT during Cycle 1, the dose escalation committee (DEC) decided if they were lenvatinib-related and if enrollment could proceed, lenvatinib was reduced to 6 mg daily (everolimus dose was not reduced).

        <title>Summary of Blood Concentrations of Everolimus for Sparse PK Sampling for Phase 1b and Phase 2</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected during the Randomization Phase. Most participants had 6 samples taken over 3 cycles of treatment (sparse sampling - 2 samples taken per cycle, one at predose and one at 2 to 8 hours postdose). Whole blood concentrations of everolimus were measured and concentration data were summarized. The summary statistics at time points with one or more BLQ values were calculated by assigning zero for each BLQ value.</description>

      <time_frame>Treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) were collected and defined as those AEs that occurred after the first dose of study medication and up to 30 days after the last dose of study medication. AEs were collected for approximately 4 years.</time_frame>
      <desc>Safety analysis set included all participants who received at least one dose of study drug/s and had at least one postbaseline safety evaluation. AE severity was assessed using Common Terminology for Adverse Events (CTCAE). Serious AEs were followed until the event resolved or the event or sequelae stabilized.</desc>

          <description>Oral lenvatinib (12 mg) and everolimus (5 mg) were taken once daily in continuous 28-day cycles. Dose Escalation Cohort-Cycle 1: both study drugs were taken at the same time of day in a fasting state with water. Cycles 2, 3, etc. and Expansion Cohort: both study drugs were taken at the same time of day with water, either after a meal or in a fasting state. Dose escalation began with 3 participants in Cohort 1. If no dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) occurred, then enrollment proceeded to Cohort 2. If 1 participant had a DLT, 3 more participants were enrolled in Cohort 1. If 1 or none of the 6 participants had a DLT, then enrollment proceeded to Cohort 2.
If 2 or more participants had a DLT during Cycle 1, the dose escalation committee (DEC) decided if they were lenvatinib-related and if enrollment could proceed, lenvatinib was reduced to 6 mg daily (everolimus dose was not reduced). If it could not be determined that the DLTs were lenvatinib-related, enrollment stopped.</description>
