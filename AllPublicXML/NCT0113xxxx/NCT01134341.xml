  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to determine the recommended dose, safety, pharmacokinetics, and early
      efficacy of the combination of pralatrexate plus oral bexarotene in patients with relapsed or
      refractory CTCL.

    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, dose-finding, Phase 1 study of pralatrexate plus bexarotene in
      patients who have relapsed or refractory CTCL.

      Primary Objective(s):

      • Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended dose of pralatrexate plus
      bexarotene with concurrent vitamin B12 and folic acid supplementation when administered to
      patients who have failed prior systemic treatment.

      Secondary Objective(s):

        -  Determine the safety profile of pralatrexate plus bexarotene when administered to
           patients with relapsed/refractory cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL).

        -  Collect preliminary efficacy data.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of pralatrexate plus bexarotene in patients
           who underwent plasma PK sampling

    <description>Bexarotene (Targretin): administered po qd. The initial daily dose of bexarotene will depend on the cohort to which each patient is assigned. Bexarotene will be self-administered except in patients who underwent plasma PK sampling on cycle 1, dose 1 and cycle 1, dose 3, at which time bexarotene was to be administered at the investigational site 1 hour (± 5 minutes) prior to pralatrexate administration.
Pralatrexate (Folotyn): administered weekly via IV push over a minimum of 30 seconds up to a maximum of 5 minutes. One cycle is 4 weeks in duration consisting of weekly dosing of pralatrexate for 3 weeks followed by 1 week of rest. The initial dose of pralatrexate will depend on the cohort to which each patient is assigned.</description>
