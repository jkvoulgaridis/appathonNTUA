  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a pilot study to test the novel hypothesis that Exenatide treatment
      in patients with type 2 diabetes results in improved sleep duration and quality and to
      explore the relationship between improvements in sleep and measures of metabolic and
      circadian function. This project would be the first to probe the relationship between
      incretin hormone regulation, duration and intensity of sleep, glucose tolerance and circadian
      dysfunction in diabetic patients.

    <measure>Severity of Obstructive Sleep Apnea</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and after 6 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) will be calculated from polysomnographic recordings. The minimum score for AHI is 0 (zero), corresponding to total absence of apnea or hypopnea. There is no theoretical maximum score although scores above 100 are very rarely observed. The lower the AHI value, the better. Higher AHI values correspond to greater severity of sleep apnea, a worse outcome. There are no subscales. We use continuous AHI values to measure severity of obstructive sleep apnea.</description>

        <title>Severity of Obstructive Sleep Apnea</title>
        <description>The apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) will be calculated from polysomnographic recordings. The minimum score for AHI is 0 (zero), corresponding to total absence of apnea or hypopnea. There is no theoretical maximum score although scores above 100 are very rarely observed. The lower the AHI value, the better. Higher AHI values correspond to greater severity of sleep apnea, a worse outcome. There are no subscales. We use continuous AHI values to measure severity of obstructive sleep apnea.</description>
