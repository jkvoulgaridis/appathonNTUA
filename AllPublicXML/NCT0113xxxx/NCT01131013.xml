    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this early-stage clinical study is to demonstrate an effect of
      single doses of CK-2017357 on measures of skeletal muscle function and fatigability in
      patients with peripheral artery disease and symptomatic claudication.

    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase II, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, three-way crossover
      design of two single doses of CK-2017357 in patients with peripheral artery disease and
      symptomatic claudication. 36 to 72 patients will be randomized at approximately 15 study
      centers to one of six different treatment sequences. Each treatment sequence consists of
      three dosing periods in which patients receive single oral doses of placebo, 375 mg and 500
      mg of CK-2017357. All six treatment sequences will enroll approximately the same number of
      patients. A wash out period of at least 6 days (to a maximum of 10 days) will be employed
      between the individual doses for each patient. This study is designed to assess the effects
      of CK-2017357 on measures of endurance/fatigue, work output, and walking capacity. The PK and
      PD relationship of CK-2017357 after two single doses will be assessed versus placebo, and the
      CK-2017357 concentration versus time data obtained in this study may be used to develop a
      population PK model to estimate intra- and inter-patient variability of PK parameters in
      patients with claudication.
