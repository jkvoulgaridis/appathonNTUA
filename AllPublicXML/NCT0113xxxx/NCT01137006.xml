  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A dose-escalation study designed to determine the safety, maximum tolerated dose (MTD),
      anti-melanoma activity, antibody blood levels and progression-free survival (PFS) in
      participants with malignant melanoma receiving IMC-20D7S either every 2 weeks or every 3
      weeks.

    <measure>Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of IMC-20D7S</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to toxicity [up to end of Cycle 1 (4 or 6-week cycles)]</time_frame>
    <description>The MTD was defined as the dose preceding the dose level at which 2 participants experienced a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) during treatment Cycle 1. A DLT was defined as any Grade 3 or above toxicity that emerged during study treatment and was clearly not attributable to malignant melanoma or co-medication and was possibly, probably, or definitely related to IMC-20D7S in the judgment of the investigator. No DLT was observed in the study; a provisional MTD was established.</description>

          -  Participant has documented and/or symptomatic brain or leptomeningeal metastases

          -  Participant is receiving systemic steroids or other immunosuppressive medications.
             (Intermittent use of steroid-containing medications e.g., for asthma exacerbation or

          -  Participant has an uncontrolled undercurrent illness

          -  Participant has a concurrent active malignancy other than adequately treated
             nonmelanomatous skin cancer or other noninvasive carcinoma or in situ neoplasm

          -  Participant has a known allergy to any of the treatment components (monoclonal
             antibodies or other therapeutic proteins such as fresh frozen plasma, human serum
             albumin, cytokines, or interleukins). In the event that there is suspicion the
             participant may have allergies, the participant should be excluded

          -  Participant is pregnant or lactating

          -  Participant has known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or acquired immune deficiency
             syndrome (AIDS) infection

        <description>The MTD was defined as the dose preceding the dose level at which 2 participants experienced a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) during treatment Cycle 1. A DLT was defined as any Grade 3 or above toxicity that emerged during study treatment and was clearly not attributable to malignant melanoma or co-medication and was possibly, probably, or definitely related to IMC-20D7S in the judgment of the investigator. No DLT was observed in the study; a provisional MTD was established.</description>
