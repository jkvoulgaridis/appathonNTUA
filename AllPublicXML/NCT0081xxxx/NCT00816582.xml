    <textblock>
      Purpose:

      To determine whether [18F]FES can predict clinical benefit (defined as complete response,
      partial response and stable disease ≥ 6 months) to fulvestrant (250 mg IM q 28 days) in
      post-menopausal women with recurrent or metastatic ER+ breast cancer who are candidates for
      further hormonal therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The majority of women diagnosed with breast cancer are post-menopausal, of which up to 75%
      are estrogen (ER) and/or progesterone receptor (PR) positive. Even in pre-menopausal breast
      cancer over half of all patients will have expression of these hormone receptors. Thus
      therapeutic strategies targeting the estrogen receptor or its ligand are the most common
      treatment offered in breast cancer. Despite substantial benefits now demonstrated with
      selective estrogen receptor modulators (e.g. tamoxifen) and aromatase inhibitors (e.g.
      anastrazole, letrozole and exemestane), a significant proportion of patients will still
      unfortunately have or develop resistance to these hormonal therapies.

      Despite approximately two-thirds of patients who are prescribed fulvestrant following prior
      hormonal agents not benefiting from this therapy, clinicians are still offering this option
      to all suitable women because of the lack of a better means of identifying the individual
      responders.

      To assess whether the recommended treatment is beneficial to a specific individual, the
      disease burden is assessed before and following treatment. Conventional imaging techniques
      such as the bone scan or computerized tomography (CT) can take several months to show a
      successful response to treatment. Positron emission tomography (PET) can improve the
      evaluation of women with breast cancer by providing an accurate assessment of the extent of
      disease and unique information about tumor biology such as metabolic activity.
