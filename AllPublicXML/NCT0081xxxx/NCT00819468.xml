  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to compare the pharmacokinetic profile of teduglutide in healthy participants
      with normal hepatic function with participants who have moderate hepatic impairment.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      24 participants (equally divided between participants with normal hepatic function and those
      with moderate hepatic impairment (defined by the protocol as a Child-Pugh classification of
      grade B score of 7-9)will be given a single injection of teduglutide (20mg) through
      subcutaneous injection into the abdomen. Blood samples would be taken within 30 minutes of
      dose through 24 hours post-dose. Participants in both groups are matched up by sex, age, BMI,
      and renal function.

    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical/medicinal product which includes an exacerbation of a pre-existing illness, sign, symptom, or clinically significant laboratory test abnormality that is detected or diagnosed after study drug administration, pretreatment or post-treatment events that occur as a result of protocol-mandated procedures. An AE does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with study drug.</description>
