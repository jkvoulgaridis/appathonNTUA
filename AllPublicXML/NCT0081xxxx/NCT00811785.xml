  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Menkes disease and occipital horn syndrome are two forms of copper deficiency that must be
      diagnosed and treated very early in life to prevent serious developmental problems. However,
      these and other forms of copper deficiency are not very well understood, and further research
      is needed to determine whether certain treatments are useful in treating copper deficiency.
      One such treatment is copper histidine, a copper replacement that can be injected directly
      into the body to avoid absorption through the gastrointestinal tract. This study will
      investigate the effectiveness, side effects, and dosage of copper histidine treatment for
      patients with copper deficiency. It will also collect medical history information from
      patients to allow researchers to study possible genetic and nongenetic origins of copper
      deficiency.

      This study will include 100 subjects, all of whom will be children and adults who have been
      diagnosed with Menkes disease, occipital horn syndrome, or other unexplained copper
      deficiency.

      Patients will receive a prescribed dose of copper histidine, which will be administered daily
      as an injection.

      During the study, patients will be admitted to the NIH Clinical Center on an outpatient basis
      to evaluate their response to the copper histidine treatment. These evaluations will take
      place every 8 months, with a final evaluation performed after 3 years of treatment. During
      the outpatient visits, patients will be required to give blood and urine samples for testing
      and undergo ultrasound testing. They will also undergo brain MRI scans at the initial visit
      and at the 16-month and 36-month visits. Patients who agree will give additional blood
      samples for genetic research purposes.

      Study Description:

      The purpose of this study is to allow currently enrolled participants to complete their
      three-year course of subcutaneous Copper Histidinate treatment under the protocol. We
      hypothesize that subcutaneous injections of this drug will raise serum copper levels and
      ceruloplasmin levels in enrolled participants, improve neurodevelopmental and neurological
      outcomes, and reduce mortality compared to untreated affected subjects.

      Objectives:

      -Primary Objective: Evaluate responses to Copper Histidinate treatment for clinical care.

      Endpoints:

      -Completion of three years treatment by 13 remaining subjects

      Study Population:

      The 13 remaining subjects

      Phase: Clinical Care/Treatment only

      Description of Sites/Facilities Enrolling Participants: The study will occur at the NIH
      Clinical Center

      Description of Study Intervention:

      The study intervention is administration of Copper Histidinate in dose(s) prescribed as
      follows: 250 microgram sc b.i.d. in infants up to 12 months of age, and 250 microgram sc q.d.
      for infants and children older than 12 months. The total duration of copper histidinate
      treatment will not exceed three years.

      Study Duration:

      The estimated time from when the study opens to enrollment until completion is approximately
      151 months (02/27/2009-09/30/2021). (May end sooner pending FDA new drug approval.)

      Participant Duration:

      The time it will take for each individual participant to complete all participant visits is
      approximately 36 months. There are 13 subjects with a total of 31 visits to complete.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        In order to be eligible to participate in this study, an individual must meet all of the
        following criteria:

          1. Provision of signed and dated informed consent form by parent or legal guardian, or
             the subject himself/herself.

          2. Male or female, aged 0 to 80 years.

          3. Diagnosed with classic Menkes disease, Occipital Horn Syndrome (OHS), or unexplained
             copper deficiency.

          4. Serum copper level results between 0 and 75 mg/dl (normal range 80-180 microgram/dl).

          5. Ability to adhere to the prescribed subcutaneous Copper Histidinate injection regimen.

          6. Willingness to comply with all study visits and procedures.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        An individual who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation
        in this study:

          1. Pre-existing liver (e.g., hepatitis, biliary atresia, cirrhosis) or kidney disease
             (e.g., serum creatinine &gt;1.0 mg/dL)

          2. History of bleeding diatheses

          3. Pregnancy or lactation

          4. Diagnosis of Wilson disease

          5. Any disease or condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, has a high
             probability of precluding the patient from completing the study or where the patient
             cannot or will not appropriately comply with study requirements

          6. Participation in any other investigational trial in which receipt of investigational
             drug or device occurred within 30 days prior to screening for this study

          7. History of diagnosed drug or alcohol dependence within the previous 3 years

          8. Any disease process that may adversely affect gastrointestinal absorption, e.g. celiac
             sprue

          9. Chronic/severe cardiac disease (applies to adult subjects only) that could make
             participating in a clinical trial physically demanding, including but not limited to
             cardiac insufficiency, arrhythmias, bradycardia, or hypotension, unless associated
             with other features of dysautonomia, as in OHS.

         10. History of cerebrovascular accident (applies to adult subjects only) that could make
             participating in a clinical trial difficult for the subject.

        Adults who are, or who may be, unable to consent will not be allowed to participate in this
        study. This is because we did not encounter subjects in this category for whom enrollment
        would be necessary or appropriate in our previous studies (90-CH-0149, 90-N-0149) with this
        IND. The main populations to be recruited are 1) pediatric subjects under 18 years of age
        with inherited copper transport disorders, and 2) non-cognitively-impaired adults with
        unexplained copper deficiency.

        NIH employees are eligible to participate in this protocol if they meet the Inclusion
        criteria and have no exclusion criteria. Recruitment, enrollment and compensation of NIH
        employee subjects will be consistent with the Guidelines for the Inclusion of Employees in
        NIH Intramural Research Studies (December 2015) and NIH Policy Manual Chapter 2300-630-3,
        &quot;Leave Policy for NIH Employees Participating in NIH Medical Research Studies&quot;. The
        consenting research team member will make the NIH Information Sheet on Employee Research
        Participation available to staff members who are considering enrolling.

        If the individual requesting to participate in the protocol is a co-worker, the consent
        from the NIH staff member (co-worker) will not be obtained by the staff member s direct
        supervisor but by another research staff member approved for obtaining informed consent who
        is not a co-worker.

        Neither participation nor refusal to participate as a subject in this protocol will have an
        effect, either beneficial or adverse, on the participant s employment or position at NIH.

        Employee subjects' privacy and confidentiality will be respected by protocol and consenting
        staff the same as for all subjects participating in research protocols. However, all
        subjects will be made aware that there are limits to these protections.
