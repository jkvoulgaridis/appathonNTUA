  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to estimate the efficacy of intracervical versus paracervical block
      on pain experienced during first trimester suction curettage without the use of preoperative
      cervical ripening. Because of the theoretical improved reliability of stromal block, the
      investigators hypothesize that intracervical block would produce lower pain scores than
      paracervical block at the time of cervical dilation.

    <description>The paracervical block was administered using 20 ml of buffered lidocaine and a 5/8 inch, 25-gauge needle. A small amount was injected at the tenaculum site, and the remainder equally distributed around the cervicovaginal junction at 3, 5, 7, and 9 o'clock.

          <title>Paracervical Block</title>
          <description>Paracervical block: The paracervical block was administered using 20 ml of buffered lidocaine and a 5/8 inch, 25-gauge needle. A small amount was injected at the tenaculum site, and the remainder equally distributed around the cervicovaginal junction at 3, 5, 7, and 9 o'clock. The depth was standardized at 5/8 inch by inserting the needle to the hub.
Buffered Lidocaine, vasopressin, sodium bicarbonate: The buffered lidocaine preparation for both block techniques consisted of 50 mL of 1% lidocaine, 5 units of vasopressin, and 5 mL 8% sodium bicarbonate.</description>

          <title>Intracervical Block</title>
          <description>Intracervical: The intracervical block was administered using 20 ml of buffered lidocaine and a 1-1/2 inch, 20 gauge needle in order to overcome the increased resistance to injection caused by the cervical stroma. A small amount was injected at the tenaculum site, and the remainder into the cervical stroma at 12, 3, 6, and 9 o'clock, at a depth of 1-1/2 inch by inserting the needle to the hub.
Buffered Lidocaine, vasopressin, sodium bicarbonate: The buffered lidocaine preparation for both block techniques consisted of 50 mL of 1% lidocaine, 5 units of vasopressin, and 5 mL 8% sodium bicarbonate.</description>
