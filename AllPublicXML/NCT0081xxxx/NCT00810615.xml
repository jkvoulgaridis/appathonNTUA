  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) improves the
      cognitive function of OIF/OEF individuals who have chronic mild to moderate traumatic brain
      injury (TBI). Cognitive function includes such things as thinking, remembering, recognition,
      concentration ability and perception. Traumatic brain injury is common with head injuries
      caused by blows to the head, nearby explosions, or concussion. Subjects will be assigned to
      an intervention or sham arm. Computer based cognitive tests will be used as outcome measures.
      Subjects are enrolled by invitation only.

      The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) did a comprehensive review of the
      literature focusing on TBI, stroke and cerebral palsy in Sep 2003. The study design and goals
      were based on the AHRQ recommendations for future hyperbaric oxygen for TBI research. This
      report stated, &quot;The most important gap in the evidence is a lack of a good quality
      time-series study or controlled trial of the effects of HBOT on cognition, memory, and
      functional status in patients with deficits due to mild and moderate chronic TBI.&quot; The AHRQ
      Evidence Report further stated, &quot;Lack of agreement on the dosage of HBOT and the duration of
      treatment is an important barrier to conducting good-quality clinical studies…Good-quality
      dose-ranging studies of HBOT for brain injury can be done, based on the model used by
      pharmaceutical manufacturers and the FDA. It is likely that the dosage of HBOT needs to be
      individualized based on the patient's age, clinical condition, and other factors&quot;. Although
      there are many anecdotal cases of TBI improvement with HBO, this case is backed with
      non-subjective data. The biological basis for why breathing 100% oxygen under pressurized
      conditions improves chronic neurological trauma remains unclear. There is some evidence that
      chronic TBI effects are related to the demyelization effect linked to the expression of a
      specific protease, calpain. This protease is also seen in demyelination delayed effects of
      carbon monoxide poisoning which is slowed by treatment with HBO. The &quot;idling neuron&quot; theory
      advocated in neurological studies suggest that HBO may increase metabolic performance of
      chronically impaired neurons that were marginally capable, enabling restoration of full
      function leading in turn to increased integrative plasticity. HBO has been shown to increase
      recruitment of stem cells from the bone marrow, suggesting that HBO may increase the rate at
      which damaged neuronal tissue can be reconstituted de novo. The proposed research will treat
      25 subjects using HBO (2.4 ATA breathing 100% oxygen) and 25 subjects in a sham HBO treatment
      (1.3 ATA breathing air). Computer-based cognitive testing and the Post-traumatic Stress
      Disorder Checklist for Military (PCL-M) will be administered pre- and post-HBOT as well as at
      intervals throughout the treatment. The cognitive test results and stem cell results will be
      analyzed within each subject at the various treatment points as well as cohort groups between
      each treatment leg. Cognitive test scores will also be compared to cognitive test population
      reference bases matched for gender and age. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality
      2003 report also stated, &quot;If there is a 1 percent chance that the treatment works, a rational
      decision maker would try it—there is a potential gain and no potential loss. On the other
      hand, if there are proven harms, and their severity and frequency are well described, the
      probability that the treatment works would have to be higher before most people would try it&quot;

    <measure>Computer Cognitive Test Scores - ImPACT Verbal Memory</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and six weeks post hyperbaric exposure series</time_frame>
    <description>The Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing (ImPACT) battery was developed at the University of Pittsburgh. It has a sensitivity of 81.9% and specificity of 89.4% in discriminating between concussion and non-concussion groups. It consists of a medical history questionnaire regarding concussions and resultant symptoms including loss of consciousness, memory loss, confusion, headache, seizure activity, emotional state, and sleep patterns. There are four subtests given and scored by computer. These include verbal and visual memory, visual motor speed, and response time. The composite scores are specifically designed to determine changes within the individual, better or worse, over time. The verbal memory score demonstrates improvement as the score increases. The score range was 36.8 to 98.6.</description>

    <measure>Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist - Military Version (PCL-M) Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline compared to the change at post hyperbaric exposures (30) series and the six weeks post hyperbaric exposure series</time_frame>
    <description>The PCL-M is a self reported test in which a list of 17 problems and complaints are offered to the individual to score on a 1 to 5 scale with 1 designating &quot;not at all&quot;, 2= &quot;a little bit&quot;, 3= &quot;moderately&quot;, 4= &quot;quite a bit&quot; and 5 designating &quot;extremely&quot;. A sample complaint would be &quot;repeated, disturbing dreams of a stressful military experience&quot;. Hence there is a possible total score range from 17 to 85. For military members, a score of 50 or above is indicative of PTSD. A change from baseline of 5-9 represents a reliable change and change of 10 or greater is a significant change.</description>

To simulate the treatment 2.4 ATA pressurization, pressurizations and depressurizations were done using venting techniques that would be nearly identical with the noise and temperature as that experienced with the treatment pressure. The inside observers simulated pressure equalization measures (Valsalva) every 10 to 30 seconds and breathed oxygen by mask (required in the 2.4 ATA pressure to prevent decompression sickness) at the same frequency as if they were in the treatment exposure pressure.</description>

        <title>Computer Cognitive Test Scores - ImPACT Verbal Memory</title>
        <description>The Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing (ImPACT) battery was developed at the University of Pittsburgh. It has a sensitivity of 81.9% and specificity of 89.4% in discriminating between concussion and non-concussion groups. It consists of a medical history questionnaire regarding concussions and resultant symptoms including loss of consciousness, memory loss, confusion, headache, seizure activity, emotional state, and sleep patterns. There are four subtests given and scored by computer. These include verbal and visual memory, visual motor speed, and response time. The composite scores are specifically designed to determine changes within the individual, better or worse, over time. The verbal memory score demonstrates improvement as the score increases. The score range was 36.8 to 98.6.</description>

        <title>Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist - Military Version (PCL-M) Scores</title>
        <description>The PCL-M is a self reported test in which a list of 17 problems and complaints are offered to the individual to score on a 1 to 5 scale with 1 designating &quot;not at all&quot;, 2= &quot;a little bit&quot;, 3= &quot;moderately&quot;, 4= &quot;quite a bit&quot; and 5 designating &quot;extremely&quot;. A sample complaint would be &quot;repeated, disturbing dreams of a stressful military experience&quot;. Hence there is a possible total score range from 17 to 85. For military members, a score of 50 or above is indicative of PTSD. A change from baseline of 5-9 represents a reliable change and change of 10 or greater is a significant change.</description>

            <description>Subjects breathed air at less than 1.3 Atmospheres Absolute (ATA) in three 30 minute periods separated by 10 minutes of breathing air at less that 1.3 ATA. Hyperbaric exposures were done up to 5 times per week with a total number of 30 exposures. Pressurization time was seven minutes to a depth of 11 feet of sea water (fsw) or 1.3 ATA. The chamber pressure was slowly decreased over 10 minutes to 6 fsw (1.2 ATA). The final depressurization to surface was done over a 10 minute period. To simulate the treatment 2.4 ATA pressurization, pressurizations and depressurizations were done using venting techniques that would be nearly identical with the noise and temperature as that experienced with the treatment pressure. The inside observers simulated pressure equalization measures (Valsalva) every 10 to 30 seconds and breathed oxygen by mask (required in the 2.4 ATA pressure to prevent decompression sickness) at the same frequency as if they were in the treatment exposure pressure.</description>

        <title>Computer Cognitive Test Scores - ImPACT Processing Speed</title>
        <description>The Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing (ImPACT) battery was developed at the University of Pittsburgh. It has a sensitivity of 81.9% and specificity of 89.4% in discriminating between concussion and non-concussion groups. It consists of a medical history questionnaire regarding concussions and resultant symptoms including loss of consciousness, memory loss, confusion, headache, seizure activity, emotional state, and sleep patterns. There are four subtests given and scored by computer. These include verbal and visual memory, visual motor speed, and response time. The composite scores are specifically designed to determine changes within the individual, better or worse, over time. The Processing Speed score demonstrates improvement as the score increases. The score range was 9.7 to 52.4.</description>

        <description>The purpose of a pilot study is to identify potential subgroups who may respond to treatment. The various composite scores were ranked and separated by subject and within groups for those who improved and those who did not. This allowed the application relative risk analysis using MedCalc (http://www.medcalc.org) to identify potential subgroups. Relative Risk of Improvement (RROI) was calculated against the concussion history items. Main categories were the number of concussive events, whether the subject had multiple non-concussive events or not, if there were two concussive events within a 48 hour period, the time expired from the last concussion to consent, the etiology of the event, and loss of consciousness. A concussive event was defined as one immediately followed with symptoms. This outcome measure analyzed PCL-M score decreases of 10 or more (significantly improved) in the individuals who experienced only one concussive event.</description>

        <description>The purpose of a pilot study is to identify potential subgroups who may respond to treatment. The various composite scores were ranked and separated by subject and within groups for those who improved and those who did not. This allowed the application relative risk analysis using MedCalc (http://www.medcalc.org) to identify potential subgroups. Relative Risk of Improvement (RROI) was calculated against the concussion history items. Main categories were the number of concussive events, whether the subject had multiple non-concussive events or not, if there were two concussive events within a 48 hour period, the time expired from the last concussion to consent, the etiology of the event, and loss of consciousness. A concussive event was defined as one immediately followed with symptoms. This outcome measure analyzed PCL-M score decreases of 10 or more (significantly improved) in individuals who experienced two concussive events.</description>

This allowed the application relative risk analysis using MedCalc (http://www.medcalc.org) to identify potential subgroups. Relative Risk of Improvement (RROI) was calculated for the number of concussive events, whether the subject had multiple non-concussive events or not, if there were two concussive events within a 48 hour period, the time expired from the last concussion to consent, the etiology of the event, and loss of consciousness. Many subjects had multiple blast and/or impact events without a concussion (asymptomatic), but had a flight or flight (danger response) experience. This outcome measure analyzed PCL-M score decreases of 10 or more (significantly improved) in individuals who experienced multiple non-concussive blast and/or impact events.</description>

          <description>Subjects breathed air at less than 1.3 Atmospheres Absolute (ATA) in three 30 minute periods separated by 10 minutes of breathing air at less that 1.3 ATA. Hyperbaric exposures were done up to 5 times per week with a total number of 30 exposures. Pressurization time was seven minutes to a depth of 11 feet of sea water (fsw) or 1.3 ATA. The chamber pressure was slowly decreased over 10 minutes to 6 fsw (1.2 ATA). The final depressurization to surface was done over a 10 minute period. To simulate the treatment 2.4 ATA pressurization, pressurizations and depressurizations were done using venting techniques that would be nearly identical with the noise and temperature as that experienced with the treatment pressure. The inside observers simulated pressure equalization measures (Valsalva) every 10 to 30 seconds and breathed oxygen by mask (required in the 2.4 ATA pressure to prevent decompression sickness) at the same frequency as if they were in the treatment exposure pressure.</description>
