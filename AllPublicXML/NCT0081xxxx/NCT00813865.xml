    <textblock>
      This study evaluated the long-term safety and efficacy of afegostat tartrate in participants
      with Gaucher disease who were enrolled in a previous Phase 2 study of afegostat tartrate.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was an open-label, long-term extension study of afegostat tartrate in participants with
      type 1 Gaucher disease who successfully completed Study GAU-CL-202 (NCT00446550).
      Participants could enter the study immediately upon completion of participation in the
      lead-in study GAU-CL-202, or at any later time point. Participants received 225 milligram
      (mg) afegostat tartrate, administered orally for 30 months, and remained in 1 of the 2
      randomized treatment regimens of Study GAU-CL-202: afegostat tartrate once daily (QD) for 3
      consecutive days, then no afegostat tartrate for 4 consecutive days (consecutive
      3-days-on/4-days-off) or QD for 7 consecutive days, then no afegostat tartrate for 7 days
      (consecutive 7-days-on/7-days-off). Amendment 2 removed the 7-days-on/7-days-off regimen and
      added an alternative 3-days-on/4-days-off regimen: afegostat tartrate QD on Monday,
      Wednesday, and Friday, then no afegostat tartrate on Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday
      (MWF 3-days-on/4-days-off). Once Amendment 2 was implemented at a site, participants assigned
      to the 7-days-on/7-days-off regimen switched to a 3-days-on/4-days-off regimen; those on the
      original 3-days-on/4-days-off regimen could switch to the MWF 3-days-on/4-days-off regimen.
      Amendment 4 removed the original 3-days-on/4-days-off regimen and any participants still on
      that regimen switched to the MWF 3-days-on/4-days-off regimen. Study visits occurred every 3
      months for 30 months. Participants were contacted approximately 1, 3, and 6 months after the
      end of treatment (EOT) or early termination for follow-up assessments.

    <description>A TEAE was defined as any adverse event (AE) with start date on or after administration of study drug or pre-existing conditions that worsened on or after the start of the first study drug administration (on Day 1). A severe AE defined as an AE that was incapacitating and required medical intervention. The number of participants who experienced 1 or more severe TEAEs after dosing on Day 1 through the end of follow-up is presented. A summary of serious and all other non-serious AEs regardless of causality is located in the Reported Adverse Events module.</description>

Amendment 2 added a MWF 3-days-on/4-days-off regimen. After Amendment 2 was implemented, all participants were assigned to one of the two 3-days-on/4-days-off regimens. Amendment 4 removed the consecutive 3-days-on/4-days-off regimen, and all participants were assigned to the MWF 3-days-on/4-days-off regimen. Participants were to receive afegostat tartrate for 30 months and be followed for 6 months after EOT.</description>

          <description>Standard MRI procedures were used to measure the volume of the spleen. The baseline value was defined as the value recorded on Days 1 to 3 of the study (certain values could have been carried over from the last assessment in the lead-in study, GAU-CL-202). A negative change from Baseline indicates that spleen volume decreased.</description>
