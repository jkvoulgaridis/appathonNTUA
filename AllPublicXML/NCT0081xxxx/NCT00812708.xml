    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of Morcher iris diaphragms
      in the treatment of congenital and acquired aniridia. Morcher iris diaphragms are intraocular
      devices that are designed to provide an artificial pupil for patients suffering from partial
      or complete aniridia. These devices are constructed from clinical quality, ultraviolet
      light-absorbing, opaque black polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA). After surgical implantation,
      patients are monitored over the course of 1 year to measure any changes to visual acuity and
      improvements in light and glare sensitivity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aniridia is a condition in which the iris, the colored portion of the eye, is either
      partially or completely absent. The iris is responsible for regulating the amount of light
      entering the eye by adjusting the size of the pupil.

      Aniridia can either be a congenital condition, often a genetically-based abnormality
      affecting the formation of the iris, or it can be acquired by blunt trauma with or without
      rupture, penetrating trauma, or severe intraocular inflammation.

      Aniridia can also vary in the level of severity. A mild case might involve a thinner iris or
      iris remnant with a normal pupil. A severe case might involve complete absence of the iris or
      impairment of the muscles responsible for adjusting pupil size.

      Iris defects can occur without the loss of stromal tissue as well. In some cases, the iris
      pigment epithelium is missing. In other cases, holes are present in the iris or the pupil is
      chronically enlarged or mydriatic.

      People who suffer from iris defects also commonly suffer from other eye conditions. Common
      comorbidities include glaucoma, cataract, and nystagmus. Other structures in the eye are
      often affected, including the cornea, crystalline lens, zonules, and retina. Iris defects can
      cause severe visual disability if untreated.

      Common treatments for iris defects include the use of colored or tinted glasses or contact
      lenses to reduce the amount of light entering the eye.

      In this trial, several Morcher iris diaphragms are being evaluated as a potential treatment
      to improve the symptoms associated with aniridia and other iris defects. Morcher iris
      diaphragms are manufactured in Germany by Morcher GmbH [website: http:// www.morcher.com].
      These devices have been utilized in Europe to treat aniridic patients for over 40 years.
      Additionally, these devices hold the European CE mark of conformity.

      When a patient is implanted with a Morcher iris device, surgery always involves additional
      standard of care surgical procedures. Typically, a device is implanted during cataract
      surgery along with an intraocular lens (IOL). Morcher devices can also be implanted during an
      IOL exchange with or without an anterior vitrectomy. All implantation procedures take place
      in an operating room under local or general anesthesia. In some cases, a Morcher iris
      reconstruction lens containing both an artificial iris and a lens is implanted. Also,
      depending on the condition of the eye, the lens and iris device may need to be sutured to the
      sclera, the white portion of the eye.

      All patients undergoing surgery are prescribed 2 different eye drops, an antibiotic and a
      corticosteroid. These medications are used for up to 6 weeks following implantation of the
      device. There are 5 postoperative follow-up visits that each patient must complete. Visits
      occur at specific intervals over the course of a 1-year period. At each visit, standard of
      care procedures are performed and, at certain time points during the follow-up interval,
      digital photos and endothelial cell counts are obtained. In instances where both eyes are
      implanted, surgery for the second eye is scheduled 6 months or more later.

    <measure>Change in Light and Glare Sensitivity as Determined by a Clinical Glare Test (Primary Efficacy Measure)</measure>
    <time_frame>Preoperatively and 1 year postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>The primary efficacy measure of the study was the change in corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) under glare conditions. A transilluminator light was held just in front of the distance corrected study eye in one of four quadrants (above, below, nasal, or temporal) to the line of sight to evoke a glare response. The direction that produced the worst CDVA was called the CDVA with glare. A ≥ 2 line improvement in Snellen CDVA with glare following Morcher device implantation was considered a positive clinical change (glare sensitivity better). A ≥ 2 line worsening of Snellen CDVA with glare following Morcher device implantation was considered a negative clinical change (glare sensitivity worse). A change of &lt; 2 Snellen lines following Morcher device implantation was considered to be a neutral change (glare sensitivity the same).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Best Corrected Visual Acuity (Primary Safety Measure)</measure>
    <time_frame>Preoperatively and 1 year postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>The primary safety measure of the study was the change in best corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) as measured using a Snellen eye chart. A ≥ 2 line improvement in Snellen CDVA following Morcher device implantation was considered a positive clinical change (visual acuity better). A ≥ 2 line worsening of Snellen CDVA following Morcher device implantation was considered a negative clinical change (visual acuity worse). A change of &lt; 2 lines was considered to be a neutral change (visual acuity the same).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Glare Sensitivity Under Day Time Lighting Conditions (Secondary Efficacy Measure)</measure>
    <time_frame>Preoperatively and 3 months postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>A secondary efficacy measure of the study was day time glare disability as assessed by subjective questionnaire. Glare disability was rated using a 0 to 10 scale, where 0 was considered very slight and 10 was considered very significant.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Glare Sensitivity Under Night Time Lighting Conditions (Secondary Efficacy Measure)</measure>
    <time_frame>Preoperatively and 3 months postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>Another secondary efficacy measure of the study was night time glare disability as assessed by subjective questionnaire. Glare disability was rated using a 0 to 10 scale, where 0 was considered very slight and 10 was considered very significant.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Endothelial Cell Count (Secondary Safety Measure)</measure>
    <time_frame>Preoperatively and 3 months postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>A secondary safety measure of the study was the change in endothelial cell count. A loss of &gt;10% of central corneal endothelial cells was considered clinically significant at the onset of the study. (Note, the 10% loss criterion was established before the 67B implant was added to the list of study devices. The 67B implant has an expected greater cell loss than that associated with the 96F, 96S, 50D, and 50F modified capsule tension rings because it requires a larger incision for implantation. Thirty one (48.4%) of the 64 patients were implanted with the 67B device.)</description>

    <measure>Need to Explant or Exchange a Morcher Iris Diaphragm (Secondary Safety Measure)</measure>
    <time_frame>Preoperatively and 1 year postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>Another secondary safety measure of the study was the need to explant or exchange a Morcher iris diaphragm within 1 year of implantation. Explantation in &lt; 25% of patients was considered to be clinically acceptable.</description>

        <description>The primary efficacy measure of the study was the change in corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) under glare conditions. A transilluminator light was held just in front of the distance corrected study eye in one of four quadrants (above, below, nasal, or temporal) to the line of sight to evoke a glare response. The direction that produced the worst CDVA was called the CDVA with glare. A ≥ 2 line improvement in Snellen CDVA with glare following Morcher device implantation was considered a positive clinical change (glare sensitivity better). A ≥ 2 line worsening of Snellen CDVA with glare following Morcher device implantation was considered a negative clinical change (glare sensitivity worse). A change of &lt; 2 Snellen lines following Morcher device implantation was considered to be a neutral change (glare sensitivity the same).</description>

        <description>A secondary safety measure of the study was the change in endothelial cell count. A loss of &gt;10% of central corneal endothelial cells was considered clinically significant at the onset of the study. (Note, the 10% loss criterion was established before the 67B implant was added to the list of study devices. The 67B implant has an expected greater cell loss than that associated with the 96F, 96S, 50D, and 50F modified capsule tension rings because it requires a larger incision for implantation. Thirty one (48.4%) of the 64 patients were implanted with the 67B device.)</description>

The 67B implant has an expected greater cell loss than that associated with the 96F, 96S, 50D, and 50F modified capsule tension rings because it requires a larger incision for implantation. Thirty one (48.4%) of the 64 patients were implanted with the 67B device.)</description>
          <population>This group consisted of all patients implanted with Morcher iris diaphragms, for whom simultaneous corneal transplantation was not performed, and in whom endothelial cell counts could be obtained preoperatively and postoperatively.</population>
