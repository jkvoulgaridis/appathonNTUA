  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this surveillance is to collect information about 1) adverse drug reaction
      not expected from the LPD (unknown adverse drug reaction), 2) the incidence of adverse drug
      reactions in this surveillance, and 3)factors considered to affect the safety and/or efficacy
      of this drug.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All the patients whom an investigator prescribes the first Mycobutin® should be registered
      consecutively until the number of subjects reaches target number in order to extract patients
      enrolled into the investigation at random.

    <description>An adverse drug reaction (ADR) was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to MYCOBUTIN Capsules in a participant who received MYCOBUTIN Capsules. A serious ADR was an ADR resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Relatedness to MYCOBUTIN Capsules was assessed by the physician.</description>

          <description>Clinical response rate was defined as the percentage of participants who achieved clinical response over the total number of assessable effectiveness analysis population, was presented along with the corresponding 2-sided 95% CI. Clinical efficacy of MYCOBUTIN Capsules were determined by the investigator at the final observation point based on clinical symptoms and examinations, according to the following categories: (1) markedly improved, (2) improved, (3) slightly improved (4) unchanged, (5) aggravated, or (6) indeterminable. The participants assessed as (1) markedly improved and (2) improved were considered to have achieved clinical response. Participants who achieved clinical response by diagnosis were counted to assess whether it contributed to clinical response.</description>
          <population>The effectiveness analysis set comprised of participants in the safety analysis set who had effectiveness evaluation (overall evaluation by the physician based upon change in clinical symptoms and laboratory findings) at the final observation point. Participants assessed as &quot;indeterminable (n=10)&quot; at the final observation were excluded.</population>
