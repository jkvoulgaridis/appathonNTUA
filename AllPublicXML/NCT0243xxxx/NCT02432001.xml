  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to better understand how cancer treatment may affect cancer
      cells. The research will involve genetic, molecular, cellular, and immunologic experiments
      using blood and tumor specimens. It is hoped that the information gained from these studies
      will lead to a greater understanding of castrate-resistant prostate cancer and potentially,
      improvements in cancer treatment.

      This is a tissue collection protocol requiring image-guided biopsies of metastatic,
      castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). The investigators will focus on enrolling
      patients with metastatic CRPC who have progressed while receiving novel AR-targeted
      therapeutics such as abiraterone and enzalutamide. This population of patients was selected
      because resistance develops relatively rapidly following potent inhibitors of AR activity and
      the mechanisms of resistance have to be better understood. Without comprehensive analysis of
      mCRPC tumor, the investigators will never gain a full understanding of the biology driving
      resistance in human disease and developing rational co-targeting approaches will not be
      possible.

    <description>Image-guided biopsies will be performed at the Dream Team Site enrolling the patient. Lesions will be chosen based upon the strength of the evidence suggesting the presence of metastasis and with the goal of minimizing patient risk. Soft tissue lesions and lesions with documented radiologic progression should be prioritized for biopsy. If the Radiologist in charge of the procedure cannot identify a lesion amenable for biopsy, the patient will be considered a screening failure.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  History of histologically confirmed prostate cancer. Patients without histologically
             confirmed prostate cancer are eligible if both the treating physician and the study PI
             agree that the patient's history is unambiguously indicative of advanced prostate
             cancer (e.g. high PSA responsive to Androgen Deprivation Therapy.)

          -  Radiographic evidence of metastatic disease amenable to image-guided biopsy of a
             metastatic site. Soft-tissue as well as bony metastatic lesions will be considered
             acceptable. Patients with locally advanced disease only (where the biopsy would be of
             a prostatic mass) are not eligible. Biopsy of newly emerging radiographic metastases
             is desired and preferable to the biopsy of previously existing lesions whenever
             possible.

          -  Platelets &gt;75,000/μl within 14 days prior to biopsy

          -  PT or INR and a PTT &lt; 1.5 times the institutional ULN within 14 days prior to biopsy.

          -  Patients on warfarin, aspirin, or other anti-coagulants are eligible provided they are
             deemed able to tolerate discontinuation of anti-coagulation for one week prior to the
             biopsy. Conversion to low molecular weight heparin prior to biopsy is permitted per
             local standard operating procedures, provided there is agreement regarding the
             procedure between the treating physician, the interventional radiologist and the PI.

          -  Castrate levels of testosterone (testosterone &lt;50ng/dL) within 28 days prior to
             biopsy.

          -  Patients with significant congenital or acquired bleeding disorders (eg von
             Wildebrand's disease, acquired bleeding factor inhibitors) are not eligible.

          -  If no prior orchiectomy, medical castration therapy must continue while on study.

          -  PSA level obtained within 28 days prior to biopsy.

          -  Patients currently on first generation oral anti-androgens (flutamide, bicalutamide,
             nilutamide) must have progressed after at least 4 weeks of anti-androgen
             discontinuation.

          -  Patient's disease is currently progressing (in setting of testosterone &lt; 50 ng/dl),
             defined by any of the following criteria:

          -  PSA Progression: PSA level of at least 2 ng/ml which has risen on at least 2
             successive occasions, at least one week apart. If the confirmatory PSA (#3) value is
             less (i.e., #3b) than the screening PSA (#2) value, then an additional test for rising
             PSA (#4) will be required to document progression for the purposes of eligibility.

          -  Soft tissue progression: by RECIST v1.1

          -  Bone scan progression: the appearance of ≥ 2 new lesions. Symptomatic progression in
             an area of radiologically evident diseas

          -  One of the following criteria must be met:

          -  Evidence of disease progression (as defined above) following treatment with at least 2
             months of abiraterone acetate, enzalutamide, or ARN509 - based therapy.

          -  Enrollment on a high priority clinical trial conducted by the WCDT. Examples include
             trials with biopsy obtained before abiraterone or enzalutamide therapy, and following
             development of resistance to those agent(s). This list is maintained by the lead site.

          -  Evidence of disease progression (as defined above) in patients with &quot;aggressive
             phenotype&quot; mCRPC with at least one of the following clinical features

          -  Visceral or brain metastases

          -  Known small cell or neuro-endocrine subtypes (by IHC or serum markers)

          -  Primary ADT resistance defined as a nadir PSA of &gt; 4 ng/dl after 7 months of primary
             androgen deprivation (with Testosterone &lt; 50 ng/dl.)

          -  Prior chemotherapy for Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer is not allowed

          -  Age &gt; 18 yrs

          -  ECOG Performance status 0-3 (see appendix A)

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document
