  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of ustekinumab, in adult anti-TNF(alpha)
      refractory participants with active radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (AxSpA), as measured
      by the reduction in signs and symptoms of radiographic AxSpA.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a
      medical research study), randomized (study medication assigned to participants by chance),
      double-blind (neither the researchers nor the participants know what treatment the
      participant is receiving), placebo-controlled (an inactive substance; a pretend treatment
      [with no drug in it] that is compared in a clinical trial with a drug to test if the drug has
      a real effect) study. The study consists of 3 phases; Screening (up to 8 weeks), Treatment
      phase: placebo-controlled (Week 0 to 24) and active treatment (Week 24 to Week 52), and
      Safety Follow-up (up to 12 weeks). Participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment
      groups: placebo, ustekinumab 45 mg and ustekinumab 90 mg. The total duration of study will be
      up to 64 weeks. Participants will be primarily assessed for Assessment of SpondyloArthritis
      International Society (ASAS) 40 response at Week 24. Participants' safety will be monitored
      throughout the trial.

    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>BASDAI is used to measure the ankylosing spondylitis (AS) disease severity. It consists of 6 questions: fatigue, spinal pain, arthralgia (joint pain) or swelling, enthesitis (inflammation of tendons and ligaments), morning stiffness(MS) (2 questions: duration and severity). Each question is an easy to answer 10 cm visual analog scale (VAS), with 0 being none, and 10 being very severe and for the last question related to MS duration: 0(0 hours), 10(2 or more hours). In order to give each of 5 symptoms equal weight, mean of 2 questions about MS will be added to total of remaining 4 scores, final BASDAI score (ranging 0-10) is average of overall total score. Higher BASDAI score indicates more severe AS symptom. 50% improvement in response based on imputed data using treatment failure(consider non-responders at and after treatment failure),early escape rules(consider non-responder at Week 20 and 24),non-responder[NRI] (missing responses at post baseline visit imputed as non-responder).</description>

    <description>The BASFI is composed with 10 questions (each question is answered with a visual analogue scale 0-10 cm) to assess the disease severity, including the first 8 questions regarding to functional anatomy related activities and the remaining 2 questions related to daily activities of AS participants. Each question is a 10cm VAS with a value between 0 (easy) and 10 (impossible). The final BASFI score is the mean of the 10 scores. The BASFI score is the average of the 10 responses and has a possible minimum value of 0 and a possible maximum value of 10. Higher BASFI score indicates more severe functional limitations of the participant due to AS. Missing data were imputed using early escape rule (consider non-responder at Week 20 and 24).</description>

          <description>Participants received placebo subcutaneous (SC) injection at Weeks 0, 4, and 16. At Week 16, participants who met early escape (EE) criteria were administered open-label golimumab 50 mg SC administrations at Week 16 and every 4 Weeks (q4w) thereafter through Week 52. At Week 24 all participants (with the exception of participants who qualified for EE) were re-randomized to receive either ustekinumab 45 or 90 mg SC injection at Weeks 24 and 28 followed by every 12 weeks (q12w) dosing, with the last administration of study agent at Week 52.</description>

        <description>BASDAI is used to measure the ankylosing spondylitis (AS) disease severity. It consists of 6 questions: fatigue, spinal pain, arthralgia (joint pain) or swelling, enthesitis (inflammation of tendons and ligaments), morning stiffness(MS) (2 questions: duration and severity). Each question is an easy to answer 10 cm visual analog scale (VAS), with 0 being none, and 10 being very severe and for the last question related to MS duration: 0(0 hours), 10(2 or more hours). In order to give each of 5 symptoms equal weight, mean of 2 questions about MS will be added to total of remaining 4 scores, final BASDAI score (ranging 0-10) is average of overall total score. Higher BASDAI score indicates more severe AS symptom. 50% improvement in response based on imputed data using treatment failure(consider non-responders at and after treatment failure),early escape rules(consider non-responder at Week 20 and 24),non-responder[NRI] (missing responses at post baseline visit imputed as non-responder).</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved at Least a 50% Improvement From Baseline in BASDAI at Week 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20</title>
        <description>BASDAI is used to measure the ankylosing spondylitis (AS) disease severity. It consists of 6 questions: fatigue, spinal pain, arthralgia (joint pain) or swelling, enthesitis (inflammation of tendons and ligaments), morning stiffness(MS) (2 questions: duration and severity). Each question is an easy to answer 10 cm visual analog scale (VAS), with 0 being none, and 10 being very severe and for the last question related to MS duration: 0(0 hours), 10(2 or more hours). In order to give each of 5 symptoms equal weight, mean of 2 questions about MS will be added to total of remaining 4 scores, final BASDAI score (ranging 0-10) is average of overall total score. Higher BASDAI score indicates more severe AS symptom. 50% improvement in response based on imputed data using treatment failure(consider non-responders at and after treatment failure),early escape rules(consider non-responder at Week 20 and 24),non-responder[NRI] (missing responses at post baseline visit imputed as non-responder).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in BASFI Total Score at Week 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20</title>
        <description>The BASFI is composed with 10 questions (each question is answered with a visual analogue scale 0-10 cm) to assess the disease severity, including the first 8 questions regarding to functional anatomy related activities and the remaining 2 questions related to daily activities of AS participants. Each question is a 10cm VAS with a value between 0 (easy) and 10 (impossible). The final BASFI score is the mean of the 10 scores. The BASFI score is the average of the 10 responses and has a possible minimum value of 0 and a possible maximum value of 10. Higher BASFI score indicates more severe functional limitations of the participant due to AS. Missing data were imputed using early escape rule (consider non-responder at Week 20 and 24).</description>
