  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      IBS is a disorder of movement in the gut. People who have IBS may have diarrhea,
      constipation, or alternating bouts of both. IBS is not caused by injury or illness. Often the
      only way doctors can diagnose it is to rule out other conditions through testing.

      Probiotics, particularly Bifidobacterium infantis, Sacchromyces boulardii, Lactobacillus
      plantarum and combination probiotics may help regulate how often people with IBS have bowel
      movements. Probiotics may also help relieve bloating from gas. Research is continuing to
      determine which probiotics are best to treat IBS.

      PX0612

      PX0612 is a probiotic which is composed of the following ingredients contained in a veggie
      capsule, being one dose:

      Bacillus coagulans 200 million colony forming units 16.0mg Bacillus subtilis 100 million
      colony forming units 4.8mg Enterococcus faecium 100 million colony forming units 0.6mg
      Fructo-oligosacharride a nutrient for the packaged product 600.0mg Total 621.4 mg Bacillus
      coagulans is a non-pathogenic, Gram positive, spore forming bacteria that produces lactic
      acid. Though not normally found in the gut. Bacillus coagulans strains have been used as
      general nutritional supplements and agents to control constipation and diarrhea in humans and
      animals.

    <measure>Change in the Bowel Movements (Stool Frequency) Between the 'Intervention' Group and the 'Placebo' Group Over the Study Period.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (days 1-14) compared to Weeks 10 and 11 of treatment (days 78-91)</time_frame>
    <description>For each patient stool frequency was measured as a number of bowel movements per day. To compare stool frequency before and after the treatment, the average for the first 2 run-in weeks (day 1 - day 14) and the last 2 weeks (day 78 - day 91) was calculated.
A higher mean score indicates a better outcome, a greater reduction in bowel movements/day and is a positive change.

    <measure>Changes in the Patient's Assessment of Their Quality of Life Using Short Form(SF)-36 Health Survey PCS (Physical Component Score)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline compared to Week 12 (end of study)</time_frame>
    <description>Differences in quality of life phusical component score using SF-36 between the 'intervention' group and the 'placebo' group over the study period. Baseline PCS scores were compared to the end of the study time point. The mean difference between the 2 time points was measured.
The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability. Scoring is based on software program.
Placebo group- Min: -16.16 Max: 6.25
Treatment group- Min: -16.42 Max: 5.46

    <description>Outcome measure is the mean change of abdominal pain, on a scale of 0-4 (0= no pain, 4= incapacitating pain), between baseline and Weeks 10 and 11. A larger change in average abdominal pain indicates a greater reduction in mean abdominal pain score, better outcome.
Min=-.067 for treatment group Min= -.99 for placebo group Max= 1.14 for treatment group Max= 1.63 for placebo group The total number of participants analyzed in each group differs as a result of the number of participants that either withdrew or were withdrawn in the study.

    <description>The stool consistency before and after the treatment was compared, the average for the first 2 run-in weeks (day 1 - day 14) and the last 2 weeks (day 78 - day 91) was calculated. A higher mean outcome indicates a greater reduction in loose stool/diarrhea (better outcome).
Bristol Stool Chart (1=severe constipation to 7 =severe diarrhea) was the scale used for measurement. The participant reported outcomes were averaged at above time points for comparison.
Min for placebo group: -.70 Max for treatment group: 2.57 Max for placebo group: 1.88

        <title>Change in the Bowel Movements (Stool Frequency) Between the 'Intervention' Group and the 'Placebo' Group Over the Study Period.</title>
        <description>For each patient stool frequency was measured as a number of bowel movements per day. To compare stool frequency before and after the treatment, the average for the first 2 run-in weeks (day 1 - day 14) and the last 2 weeks (day 78 - day 91) was calculated.
A higher mean score indicates a better outcome, a greater reduction in bowel movements/day and is a positive change.

          <title>Change in the Bowel Movements (Stool Frequency) Between the 'Intervention' Group and the 'Placebo' Group Over the Study Period.</title>
          <description>For each patient stool frequency was measured as a number of bowel movements per day. To compare stool frequency before and after the treatment, the average for the first 2 run-in weeks (day 1 - day 14) and the last 2 weeks (day 78 - day 91) was calculated.
A higher mean score indicates a better outcome, a greater reduction in bowel movements/day and is a positive change.

        <description>Differences in quality of life phusical component score using SF-36 between the 'intervention' group and the 'placebo' group over the study period. Baseline PCS scores were compared to the end of the study time point. The mean difference between the 2 time points was measured.
The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability. Scoring is based on software program.

          <description>Differences Between the 'Intervention' Group and the 'Placebo' Group Over the Study Period. Mean change in FBDSI score between baseline and week 12 between the two groups.
A higher mean value indicates a greater reduction in bowel disease severity, better outcome.
Functional Bowel Disease Severity Index was the scale used to determine this outcome. The range on this scale is from 0-500, with 500 indicating the most severe functional bowel disease.
This measure represents the total number of participants that had a 30% or greater reduction in FBDSI score.</description>
