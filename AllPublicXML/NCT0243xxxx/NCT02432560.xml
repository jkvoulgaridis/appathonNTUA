    <textblock>
      The MIDAS study aims to follow LAM patients who are currently taking, have previously failed
      or been intolerant of, or may (at some time in the future) take mTOR inhibitors (sirolimus or
      everolimus) as part of their clinical care. Adult female TSC patients may also enroll, with
      or without lung cysts.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is an uncommon disease affecting women. It is associated with
      cystic lung destruction and progressive respiratory failure. The Multicenter International
      LAM Efficacy of Sirolimus (MILES) Trial, led by the investigators' research team,
      demonstrated that mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) inhibition with sirolimus was an
      effective therapy that stabilized decline in FEV1 (forced expiratory volume). However, lung
      function decline resumed when the drug was stopped at the one year point in MILES, suggesting
      that therapy is suppressive rather than remission-inducing, and may need to be lifelong. The
      investigators therefore need to know whether long-term therapy with sirolimus is safe and
      effective. To accomplish this goal, the investigators will conduct the Multicenter
      International Durability and Safety of Sirolimus in LAM Trial (MIDAS). This is an
      observational &quot;registry&quot; trial. The investigators propose to enroll 600 LAM patients who are
      on, have previously failed or been intolerant of or are considering taking sirolimus or
      everolimus for clinical reasons in a longitudinal observational study. This registry will
      follow lung function tests and adverse events over periods of at least 2 years. The mTOR
      inhibitor therapy will be initiated and managed by the participant's clinician. The study is
      planned to use the collected data from standard of care. This study will help us to refine
      treatment for patients with LAM and determine if long term suppressive therapy with sirolimus
      can prevent progression to later stages of disease. This research will be accomplished as
      part of the Rare Lung Disease Clinical Network Consortium, with data stored and analyzed by
      the Database Management Coordinating Center (DMCC) as part of the NIH-supported Rare Disease
      Consortium.
