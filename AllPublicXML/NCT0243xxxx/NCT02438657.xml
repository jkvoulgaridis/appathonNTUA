  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ultrasound guidance can reduce the required local anesthetic volume for successful peripheral
      nerve block.

      The aim of the study is to determine the minimum volume of local anesthetic to achieve an
      ultrasound-guided median nerve block with a dextrose 5% hydrodissection approach.

    <description>An ultrasound-guided nerve block with dextrose 5% hydrodissection is performed in each case. The first patient will receive a 2 mL local anesthetic solution. For following patients, the volume of local anesthetic depends on the clinical result of the previous patient:
increase of the volume (0.5 mL) in case of failure,
no change or decrease (0.5 mol) in case of success; a randomization is made in this case (BCD method, Stylianou M, Flournoy N. Dose finding using the biased coin up-and-down design and isotonic regression. Biometrics 2002;58:171-7)</description>
