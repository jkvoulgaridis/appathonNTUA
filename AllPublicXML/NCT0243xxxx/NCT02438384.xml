  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Pain Score</measure>
    <time_frame>ED visit and 30 days post-ED visit</time_frame>
    <description>Change in Pain from emergency department (ED) visit to 30 day follow-up phone call will be measured by calculating the difference between the maximum pain score in the ED and the patient reported average overall pain severity in the past week using the 0-10 numeric rating scale for both measures.Change in pain will be reported as a negative number if the pain decreases (i.e., 10 to 8 = -2). Higher scores indicate a worse outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Experiencing Medication Side Effects</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days after ED visit</time_frame>
    <description>Patients were asked if they experienced any of the following side effects: fatigue, drowsiness, trouble sleeping, trouble thinking, dizziness, unsteadiness, nausea, vomiting, constipation, abdominal pain, black or bloody stool, trouble urinating, loss of appetite, itching or shortness of breath. Patients were also queried about any other side effects they had that were not on the list.
Participants reporting at least one side effect were included.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Average Overall Pain at One Month</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days after ED visit</time_frame>
    <description>Determined using 0-10 numerical rating scale to answer the question &quot;What is the average amount of pain you have experienced over the last week on a scale of 0-10. where 0 means no pain and 10 means pain as severe as it could possibly be.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Physical Function Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days after ED visit</time_frame>
    <description>Using a measure of higher-level physical function based on walking, climbing stairs, and carrying bags - scores range from 0 to 12 with higher score indicating higher function.</description>

          <title>Change in Pain Score</title>
          <description>Change in Pain from emergency department (ED) visit to 30 day follow-up phone call will be measured by calculating the difference between the maximum pain score in the ED and the patient reported average overall pain severity in the past week using the 0-10 numeric rating scale for both measures.Change in pain will be reported as a negative number if the pain decreases (i.e., 10 to 8 = -2). Higher scores indicate a worse outcome.</description>
