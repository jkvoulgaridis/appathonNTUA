  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endometrial cancer is the most common gynaecological cancer in developed countries with more
      than 75% of the patients surviving for at least five years. However, most endometrial cancer
      survivors are overweight and obese and do not meet the current nutrition and physical
      activity recommendations. This can lower their quality of life and increase their risk for
      chronic diseases. Behaviour change interventions can help them feel better about themselves
      and improve their quality of life. Applying them shortly after treatment seems ideal as
      cancer survivors feel motivated to make changes about their lifestyle at this time point.

      This study is to see if the investigators can design a project to measure how well a
      psycho-educational healthy eating and physical activity programme tailored to the survivors'
      needs works. Sixty-four endometrial cancer survivors diagnosed during the previous three
      years, and are all clear will be put by chance into one of two groups. One will receive the
      program. The other will receive usual care until the end of the trial and, then, a discussion
      and a self-help guide about eating well and being active following cancer treatment. This
      will help us to see if the programme makes a difference compared with usual care. The results
      will inform a larger study to test if a lifestyle program can improve the quality of life of
      uterine cancer survivors compared with usual care. The investigators will change the
      programme materials in response to the investigators' findings, making them available to
      services. The results will inform practice and research.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low physical activity, poor diet and obesity are risk factors for the development of
      endometrial cancer. A growing body of evidence suggests that they may be linked with quality
      of life after cancer treatment. However, only about 1% of endometrial cancer survivors seem
      to meet the current fruit and vegetable, physical activity, and non-smoking recommendations;
      while 57% meets only the non-smoking recommendations, and 22% meet none of the
      recommendations,

      These behaviours exist despite cancer diagnosis being perceived as a &quot;teachable moment&quot;.
      Capitalising the &quot;teachable moment&quot; of cancer, behaviour change interventions in high-risk
      populations might be more effective than those targeting the general population.

      Theory-based behaviour change interventions suggest that improving diet and physical activity
      is safe, acceptable, and feasible and can help cancer survivors improve their quality of
      life. In contrast, there are only limited studies to support these data in the United Kingdom
      to allow generalisability of these results. However, the majority of these interventions were
      long-term and resource intensive which may render them inappropriate for wide dissemination.
      Therefore, feasible and effective interventions are needed to promote implementation of the
      nutrition and physical activity guidelines.

      The intervention is based on the Shape-Up eight-week weight management programme. This
      programme is based on &quot;Social Cognitive Theory&quot; and &quot;Control Theory&quot;. A version of this
      program has been favourably evaluated in terms of acceptability, physical, and psychological
      outcomes. We have tailored this programme (Shape-Up following cancer treatment) to help
      endometrial cancer survivors improve their diet, and activity pattern. The focus of the
      programme lies on self-control, self-efficacy, and relapse prevention in terms of healthy
      eating and physical activity. Behavioural techniques will include self-monitoring of
      behaviour with the use of food and physical activity diaries, behavioural goal setting,
      action planning, graded tasks, problem solving, self-reward, and review of behavioural goals.
      It will also provide information about health consequences and emotional consequences, pros
      and cons, behavioural practice, habit formation, reducing exposure to cues for the behaviour,
      behaviour substitution, distraction, social support (unspecified), demonstration of behaviour
      (for resistance exercises), instructions on how to perform the behaviour (for resistance
      exercises), and reframing.

      The DEUS pilot trial is an eight-week, two-arm, individually randomised, controlled pilot
      trial comparing the use of the &quot;Shape-Up following cancer treatment&quot; programme to usual care.
      According to Medical Research Council guidance for complex interventions, this is a Phase 2
      feasibility study. Randomisation will be performed with minimisation using a 1:1 allocation.

    <description>In addition to usual care, cancer survivors in the intervention group will participate in a behaviour change programme, called &quot;Shape-Up following cancer treatment: a self-help programme on eating well and being active&quot;. Participants will be allocated to groups of eight to ten. These groups will meet every week for eight weeks and each session will last approximately 90 minutes. The programme focuses on strategies for improving diet and physical activity in a self-help and peer education format. Each week, one participant will volunteer to present a new concept (e.g. regular eating, being active, eating a balanced diet, keep an eye on portion sizes, and manage internal and external triggers, and understanding food labeling) to the rest of the group.</description>

During the course of their participation in the trial, participants will be contacted only for the assessments. After the completion of the 24-week follow-up, participants will receive the booklet &quot;Healthy living after cancer&quot;; a brief self-help manual produced by the World Cancer Research Fund. Providing only this information aims to match the currently offered usual care as accurately as possible but also meet ethical standards.</description>

Participants will be allocated to groups of eight to ten. These groups will meet every week for eight weeks and each session will last approximately 90 minutes. The programme focuses on strategies for improving diet and physical activity in a self-help and peer education format. Each week, one participant will volunteer to present a new concept (e.g. regular eating, being active, eating a balanced diet, keep an eye on portion sizes, and manage internal and external triggers, and understanding food labeling) to the rest of the group.
Shape-Up following cancer treatment: The programme is based on “Social Cognitive Theory” and “Control Theory”. The focus of the programme lies on self-control, self-efficacy, and relapse prevention.</description>

            <description>In addition to usual care, cancer survivors in the intervention group will participate in a behaviour change programme, called &quot;Shape-Up following cancer treatment: a self-help programme on eating well and being active&quot;. Participants will be allocated to groups of eight to ten. These groups will meet every week for eight weeks and each session will last approximately 90 minutes. The programme focuses on strategies for improving diet and physical activity in a self-help and peer education format. Each week, one participant will volunteer to present a new concept (e.g. regular eating, being active, eating a balanced diet, keep an eye on portion sizes, and manage internal and external triggers, and understanding food labeling) to the rest of the group.
Shape-Up following cancer treatment: The programme is based on “Social Cognitive Theory” and “Control Theory”. The focus of the programme lies on self-control, self-efficacy, and relapse prevention.</description>

            <description>In addition to usual care, cancer survivors in the intervention group will participate in a behaviour change programme, called &quot;Shape-Up following cancer treatment: a self-help programme on eating well and being active&quot;. Participants will be allocated to groups of eight to ten. These groups will meet every week for eight weeks and each session will last approximately 90 minutes. The programme focuses on strategies for improving diet and physical activity in a self-help and peer education format. Each week, one participant will volunteer to present a new concept (e.g. regular eating, being active, eating a balanced diet, keep an eye on portion sizes, and manage internal and external triggers, and understanding food labeling) to the rest of the group.
Shape-Up following cancer treatment: The programme is based on “Social Cognitive Theory” and “Control Theory”. The focus of the programme lies on self-control, self-efficacy, and relapse prevention.</description>

            <description>Participants in the control group will be offered usual care until the 24-week follow-up. Quantifying usual care is challenging, but preliminary qualitative work suggested that most survivors do not received any unsolicited advice about healthy eating and physical activity from their health care professionals after treatment.
During the course of their participation in the trial, participants will be contacted only for the assessments. After the completion of the 24-week follow-up, participants will receive the booklet “Healthy living after cancer”; a brief self-help manual produced by the World Cancer Research Fund. Providing only this information aims to match the currently offered usual care as accurately as possible but also meet ethical standards.</description>
