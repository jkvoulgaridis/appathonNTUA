      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of a Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)
      intervention compared to a Supportive Psycho-educational Control (SPC) condition in reducing
      the frequency and intensity of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in Veterans with Substance Use
      Disorders (SUDs) over a two-year follow-up period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The project is a multi-site randomized controlled trial of the CBT intervention versus the
      SPC condition for 300 suicidal Veterans seen in Veterans Health Administration (VHA)
      intensive outpatient substance treatment programs (SUD IOP). Participants will be screened
      for current suicidal ideation and other conditions by completing a self-report survey
      questionnaire. Eligible participants will complete a baseline assessment which will include a
      self-report survey questionnaire, a research staff administered interview, and a voluntary
      urine drug screen. Participants will be randomized to either a Cognitive Behavior Therapy
      (CBT) or Supportive Psycho-education Control (SPC) condition. Both conditions will involve
      receipt of 8 one-on-one sessions lasting approximately one hour over a period of
      approximately 3-4 weeks in addition to their standard SUD IOP treatment of care they may be
      receiving at the VAMC. The intervention is designed to augment their current treatment, not
      to take the place of current treatment. Participants will be re-assessed immediately after
      receiving the study interventions (at 1-month) and then again at 3-, 6- 12-, 18-, and
      24-month post-intervention follow-ups by completing a series of self-report surveys,
      researcher administered interviews, and a voluntary urine drug screen. To ensure adequate
      monitoring of suicidal ideation, additional telephone follow-up assessments will occur 2-,
      4-, and 5-months post-intervention.

    <description>The CBT condition will cover topics such as orienting the patient to the cognitive model of suicidal thoughts, plans and behaviors and the role of substance use in increasing the likelihood of suicidal behaviors and presenting tools to help patients better manage responses to suicide-related triggers.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>The SPC condition is designed to match the CBT condition in terms of level of attention and the non-specific aspects of receiving support for a suicidal crisis and substance misuse. Specific content related to suicide risk will consist of general information about suicide-related resources available, while content related to substance use is based on a modified psycho-educational attention control treatment for alcoholism. The sessions will help patients to better understand the resources available during a suicidal crisis and how substance use impacts in their life. However, topics related to identifying thoughts and behaviors associated with suicidal crises and possible coping mechanisms will not be a part of the formal content of these SPC sessions.</description>
