    <textblock>
      Limiting brain death-induced organ injury through a systemic anti- inflammatory medical
      management should allow for improvement in the quality of transplanted organs, and as a
      result, clinical improvement in post-transplant outcomes represented by a decrease in the
      incidence of delayed graft function (DGF) after transplantation.

      The specific aim is to evaluate the effect of C1INH (CINRYZE) as a donor pre-treatment
      strategy to decrease systemic inflammation and decrease the incidence of DGF in Expanded
      Criteria Donors (ECD), currently identified as donors with Kidney Donor Profile Index (KDPI)
      greater than or equal to 60%.

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, single-center double-blinded study.

      Donor Pre-treatment Strategy:

      The main objective is to identify the lowest dose that will allow an at least 80% decrease in
      the activity of classic pathway and Mannose-Binding Lectin (MBL) pathway of complement. The
      main objectives parallel observations in non-human primates in which animals receiving
      kidneys from donors in which activity of both classic and MBL pathways of complement were
      reduced by at least 50% with the use of C1 inhibitors displayed very mild or no delayed graft
      function after transplantation.

      This trial has specifically been designed to evaluate the beneficial effect of C1INH in
      kidneys from deceased donors which have a high rate of delayed graft function. The selection
      of potential donors to be part of this study will be limited to the population of donors with
      a KDPI over 60%.

      A total of 36 brain dead donors and 72 kidney recipients will be included in the study.

      Most of the donors with a Kidney Donor Profile Index (KDPI) &gt;60%, due to the fact that they
      are considered &quot;extreme&quot; donors, are not likely to be able to donate organs other than
      kidneys. They would certainly not be pancreas donors, and it is unlikely they would be lung
      donors. There is a small possibility that donors with a KDPI &gt;60% could be potential liver
      donors. In the event that a donor liver is available for transplant, we will obtain written
      consent from the liver recipient, as we will from the kidney recipient(s) before the donor is
      dosed with the CINRYZE/placebo.

      For this study:

      All donors will come from within our service area. All kidney and livers will be allocated to
      be transplanted at the UW.

      Stage 1: Collection of initial safety data prior to expanding the study to a broad cohort of
      patients.

      3 non-randomized donors: Step 1: Two kidney only donors treated with 200 units/kg C1INH and
      heparin at 20 units/kg/h IV maintenance until organ recovery Step 2: Two donors of both liver
      and kidneys, treated with 200 units/kg C1INH and heparin at 20 units/kg/h IV maintenance
      until organ recovery The 8 kidneys and 2 livers in Stage 1 will be allocated to be
      transplanted only at UW.

      Stage 2: PK Study, Safety and Outcome Data

      36 donors will be randomized into 3 groups:

      Group 1: Control group: standard donor management + vehicle treatment (n=12) Group 2:
      Standard donor management + C1INH at a dose of 200 U/Kg IV single dose (n=12) Group 3:
      Standard donor management + C1INH at a dose of 200 units/kg IV single dose and heparin at 20
      units/kg/h IV maintenance until organ recovery (n=12)

        The criteria for enrollment in the study was originally limited to kidney donors with KDPI
        &gt;85%. Over the last five years however, we have only transplanted a handful of those
        patients If we further restrict our patient pool to those who are not liver donors, our
        pool of possible donors will become even smaller, making the study very difficult, if not
        impossible, to complete. Furthermore, our knowledge of the pathophysiology of the
        complement system suggests that use of C1Inhibitor will improve liver outcomes by blunting
        the inflammatory response which can cause liver fibrosis and reperfusion injury. Since we
        have seen no negative effects on the liver in our preliminary non-human primate data, there
        is no need to exclude possible liver donors from our treatment.

        Therefore, in order to increase feasibility of the study, we have now expanded the trial to
        include donors with a KDPI above 60% (rather than &gt; 85%), since the rate of DGF in
        recipients of kidneys from KDPI between 60% and 85% is similar to the group &gt;85%. In
        addition, we are now including liver recipients in the study, and will consent them if the
        donor has a viable liver in addition to the kidney(s). If we were to only include patients
        with KDPI above 85%, and kidney only donors, this trial would not be feasible.
