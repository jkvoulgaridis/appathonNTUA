  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of an electronic health record based
      strategy in promoting safe use of opioid medications after an Emergency Department (ED)
      visit. The electronic health record (EHR)-based strategy was designed to enhance provider
      counseling about opioids and to standardize and simplify the information that patients
      receive.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Research has shown that patients frequently leave the emergency department without sufficient
      knowledge about how to safely use their newly prescribed opioid pain relievers. Additionally,
      educational interventions have the ability to increase patient knowledge about medications.
      In this study, education interventions will be implemented at the level of the EHR and prompt
      increased provider counseling with a goal of improving patient knowledge and safe use of
      opioids after ED discharge.

      The investigators will conduct a three-arm provider randomized controlled trial among
      English-speaking adults prescribed hydrocodone-acetaminophen to evaluate the effectiveness of
      the EMC2 strategy, with and without Short Message Service (SMS) text reminders, to improve
      patient understanding and safe use of their medication compared to usual care. This study
      will be conducted at an urban, academic emergency department (annual volume &gt;85,000 patient
      visits) in Chicago, Illinois. English speaking patients will be recruited and assessed in
      person at baseline, and by phone at 2-4 days, 7-14 days, and 1 month after recruitment.

    <measure>Safe Medication Dosing (Prescription Understanding)</measure>
    <time_frame>7-14 days after enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Patient's ability to demonstrate correctly dosing their prescription opioid-acetaminophen pain reliever will be assessed through a series of questions. Correct dosing will be scored for each medication as yes/no reflecting having demonstrated all of the following: proper dose (# of pills), appropriate spacing (hours between doses), and total daily dose (not exceeding recommended daily dose).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Medication Knowledge</measure>
    <time_frame>7-14 days after enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>The identification of the medications purpose, side effects, risks, warnings and benefits will be assessed through a structured questionnaire. Patients will be asked about each of the above via structured, open-ended items. Additionally, select questions from the validated Patient Opioid Education Measure and patient satisfaction questions will be included. The Patient Knowledge Score was developed from these questions, with a score range of 0 to 10. A higher score on the scale represents better patient knowledge.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proper Medication Use (Medication Diary)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 day medication diary</time_frame>
    <description>Patients medication use will be assessed through a combination of a home medication diary (collected at 7-14 days post enrollment), pill count, and patient report of medication use.</description>

    <measure>Current Opioid Misuse Measure (COMM)</measure>
    <time_frame>7-14 days after enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Select questions from the Current Opioid Misuse Measure (COMM) will be used to assess if patients are safely taking their prescription opioids.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Score</measure>
    <time_frame>7-14 days after enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Pain scores through structured questions about use in the past 24 hours were collected from participants. Pain Score was assessed on a scale from 0 to 10, where higher numbers represent higher pain scores.</description>

These prompts include: 1) An automated prompt to the ED physician upon signing the order; 2) an automated message to the PCP (if an in-system PCP) notifying them of the ED visit, new prescription, and counseling request; and 3) a request for the pharmacist to counsel patient printed on the prescription.</description>
