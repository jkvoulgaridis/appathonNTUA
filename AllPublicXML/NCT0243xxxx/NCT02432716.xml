    <textblock>
      This study is a single center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over pilot
      study designed to assess the safety of intranasally (IN) delivered glulisine versus placebo
      in patients with DS. Subjects will be randomized into this cross-over study and within
      subject comparisons conducted between single treatment of intranasal insulin glulisine and
      single treatment of intranasal placebo. All subjects will also receive a single treatment of
      placebo prior to randomization to ensure adherence to study procedures.

    <measure>Cognitive Change Measured by Fuld Object-Memory Evaluation (FOME)</measure>
    <time_frame>20 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>During the examination, a patient is presented with ten common objects they are asked to identify by touch. The test uses distraction to test recall. For all, a higher score indicates a better outcome.
Learning curve is the number of objects the difference in the number of items they are able to correctly identify from the greater of trials 4 or 5 compared to trial 1. Range: 0-10
Total immediate recall is the number of objects recalled over all of the trials. Range: 0-50
Total delayed recall is the number of objects recalled after 5 minutes. Range: 0-10
Recognition memory is the number of items correct from a multiple choice list of three when unable to correctly identify items from delayed recall. Range: 0-10
Retention estimate is the number of items recalled after 5 minutes or being reminded with multiple choice. Range: 0-10</description>

    <description>Memory retention is the percentage of items correctly identify during the delayed recall trial compared storage trial 5. Range: 0-100 percent. A higher percentage indicates a better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Cognitive Change Measured by Rivermead Behavioral Memory Test (RBMT-C)</measure>
    <time_frame>20 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The RBMT-C provides an objective measure of everyday memory problems reported and observed in subjects with memory difficulties. The test is standardized for use with children ranging in age from 5 to 10 years. Here, we used it for evaluation of Down Syndrome subjects. The story recall subtests involves immediate free recall, cued recall, and delayed recall of short story material which is presented orally to subjects by the examiner. The RBMT-C is appealing for use in this population because the task is engaging, simple, and has been shown in other studies to be an effective measure of memory functions. For all, a higher score means a better outcome.
Immediate Recall is the number of story elements recalled right after the story is complete. Range: 0-31
Delayed Recall is the number of story elements recalled after a delay. Range: 0-31</description>

Total immediate recall is the number of objects recalled over all of the trials. Range: 0-50

        <title>Cognitive Change Measured by Rivermead Behavioral Memory Test (RBMT-C)</title>
        <description>The RBMT-C provides an objective measure of everyday memory problems reported and observed in subjects with memory difficulties. The test is standardized for use with children ranging in age from 5 to 10 years. Here, we used it for evaluation of Down Syndrome subjects. The story recall subtests involves immediate free recall, cued recall, and delayed recall of short story material which is presented orally to subjects by the examiner. The RBMT-C is appealing for use in this population because the task is engaging, simple, and has been shown in other studies to be an effective measure of memory functions. For all, a higher score means a better outcome.
Immediate Recall is the number of story elements recalled right after the story is complete. Range: 0-31
Delayed Recall is the number of story elements recalled after a delay. Range: 0-31</description>

          <title>Memory Retention Measured by Rivermead Behavioral Memory Test (RBMT-C).</title>
          <description>The RBMT-C provides an objective measure of everyday memory problems reported and observed in subjects with memory difficulties. The test is standardized for use with children ranging in age from 5 to 10 years. Here, we used it for evaluation of Down Syndrome subjects. The story recall subtests involves immediate free recall, cued recall, and delayed recall of short story material which is presented orally to subjects by the examiner. The RBMT-C is appealing for use in this population because the task is engaging, simple, and has been shown in other studies to be an effective measure of memory functions. Memory retention is the percentage of story elements recalled after a delay compared to right after the story is complete. Range: 0-100. A higher score means a better outcome.</description>
