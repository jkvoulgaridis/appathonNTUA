    <textblock>
      In this study, a computer-assisted adaptation of SafeCare, an evidence-based home visiting
      program, will be developed and tested in child welfare. This approach will assist home
      visitors with the delivery of SafeCare to families, with the goal of improving provider
      fidelity and implementation success. In the computer-assisted SafeCare sessions, a portion of
      the session will be delivered on a tablet computer that the home visitor brings to the
      family's home. The computer software will deliver the educational piece, or explain a piece
      of each session, along with modeling videos of the skills. The home visitor will follow up
      with the practice and feedback portions of the session. A randomized feasibility trial will
      be conducted to test the technology-based approach against the standard SafeCare
      implementation approach in terms of feasibility of implementation, provider job demands, and
      resources, as well as client outcomes such as skill acquisition and mental health.

      SafeCare contains three, six-session modules that target risk factors for child physical
      abuse and neglect, including (1) child health, (2) home safety, and (3) parent-child
      interaction. The focus of the child health module is to train parents to make effective
      decisions related to child health, to prevent child illness and injury, and assist parents in
      seeking appropriate health treatment for children when an illness or injury occurs. Parents
      are also taught to use health reference materials, including a validated SafeCare health
      manual. Home safety focuses on making the home a safe place where the risk for child injury
      is reduced. Parents identify and eliminate common household hazards and learn the appropriate
      levels of supervision for children across developmental stages. The parent- child interaction
      module focuses on the parent-child relationship, with the goal of improving interactions
      between the child and parent as well as child behavior by teaching parents structured skills
      to use in a consistent and predictable way with children across daily routine activities.
      Each of the three SafeCare modules is structured according to an assess-train-assess
      approach, with six sessions each. Session 1 is a pretest of baseline skills and knowledge of
      the particular module. Sessions 2-5 are training sessions, which include explanation of
      target skills, modeling of target skills by the provider, practice of the target skills by
      the parent, and feedback from the provider about the parent's mastery and competence in
      skills. Session 6 is a second assessment session, which allows the provider to examine parent
      mastery of target skills across each module. Providers train the parents in each module to a
      level of mastery, which is the demonstration of at least 80% of target skills at the Session
      6 assessment.

      Conditions:

      SafeCare-Implementation as Usual (SC-IU): The SC-IU condition followed the protocol used in
      standard SafeCare implementation, which includes the following phases: (1) Agency readiness -
      NSTRC reviews the requisite organizational communication, service system and SafeCare funding
      plan, implementation requirements, and budgetary information with interested agencies to
      ensure fit of SafeCare within the organizational context of the agency, (2) SafeCare workshop
      training —This includes a 4-day classroom-based training that involves didactic
      presentations, modeling of the instruction, and role-playing for SafeCare trainees as well as
      structured assessments of the skills taught, (3) SafeCare provider certification process
      —Providers receive support from NSTRC as they begin SafeCare delivery with families. The
      support includes the SafeCare trainers listening to audio recordings of the providers'
      SafeCare sessions, assessing these sessions for fidelity, and then providing a follow-up
      coaching session to provide feedback to the provider. Once trainees demonstrate mastery of
      SafeCare, defined as meeting session fidelity of _ 85% , in three sessions per module (nine
      total), they are certified as a SafeCare provider, (4) SafeCare postcertification support and
      sustainability - Once a provider achieves certification, the provider moves into this phase
      that consists of monthly submissions of one SafeCare session recording monitored for fidelity
      by an NSTRC trainer or trained SafeCare coach at the implementing agency.

      SafeCare-Tech-Assisted (SC-TA). This implementation followed the four phases described above,
      but the delivery of SafeCare was adapted to include technology assistance delivered on a
      tablet via a web-based SafeCare program entitled SafeCare Takes Care. SafeCare Takes Care
      includes a combination of video, audio narration, and engaging questions and was developed
      through an alpha and beta testing process with parenting experts and parents similar in
      education and socioeconomic status to the parents served with the SafeCare program. The
      videos are presented in a manner similar to a talk show. For each module and session, the
      host of SafeCare Takes Care presents a new topic (i.e., the session content for that day)
      with video modeling of the skills from &quot;at-home viewers.&quot; For example, in the parent-child
      interaction module, a video begins with the talk show host explaining the skills being
      covered in the session, followed by a video of a parent (i.e., an at-home viewer) modeling
      these skills, and the host may take some questions from studio audience members or from fans
      on the &quot;street cam.&quot; SafeCare Takes Care uses an open-source systems and languages to input
      text, picture, and video-related content into website interventions. All text was narrated to
      minimize literacy requirements. The architecture is based on the Python programming language
      using a Django web framework and Foundation an advanced responsive front-end framework, to
      ensure mobile friendliness. This framework consists of Cascading Style Sheets and Javascript
      to ensure proper display of the web application across multiple devices with differing screen
      sizes and resolutions. SafeCare Takes Care was hosted at Oregon Research Institute (ORI) on a
      Linux server with MySQL, an open-source language for relational database development. Data
      collection components were securely transmitted to ORI servers using Secure Sockets Layer
      protocol. This platform has been successfully used for the delivery of other evidence-based
      parenting programs to highrisk parents (see Baggett et al., 2010). SafeCare providers
      assigned to the SC-TA condition participated in the standard SafeCare workshop and also
      received training in the technology-mediated approach to SafeCare delivery. The technology
      training took approximately 2 hr and focused on how the provider utilizes the technology in
      each session. Specifically, after greeting the parent, the provider was instructed to connect
      the parent to the web-based program, during which the parent participates in the multimodal
      learning (e.g., explanation and modeling of skills) of SafeCare target skills. When the
      parent completes the web-directed portion of the session, the provider is prompted by the
      web-based program to take over the session delivery, revisit any explanation and modeling the
      parent has questions about, and then engage the parent in live practice of the skills
      presented in the web program. Lastly, the provider offers positive and constructive feedback
      about the practice and closes the SafeCare session. In addition to the technology-mediated
      delivery, there were some slight adaptations to the scoring instructions of the Safe- Care
      Fidelity checklist for the SC-TA to accommodate the use of the web-based program into the
      session. Specifically, fidelity items pertaining to explanation and modeling were scored as
      completed by a coach if it was clear in the audio recording of the session that the provider
      connected the parentparticipant to the web-based program. All other fidelity items on the
      SafeCare Fidelity Checklist remained the same. That is, SafeCare providers were fully
      expected to deliver the session opening, SafeCare target skills practice and feedback, and
      session closing. Additionally, if parents had questions about the explanation or modeling
      components reviewed in the webbased program, providers were trained to address these
      concerns, and fidelity was rated as it would be in standard implementation for these items.
      Lastly, SafeCare coaches were instructed to include the providers' technology equipment under
      their scoring of &quot;has materials ready&quot; on the fidelity checklist. Providers in both groups
      participated in coaching calls with their assigned SafeCare coach following the coach's
      scoring of fidelity, as is the protocol for SC-IU. These calls serve as an opportunity for
      the coach to provide positive and constructive feedback to the provider regarding their
      session delivery.

      Provider demographics and professional background factors were measured by a form developed
      for the project and asked questions regarding provider age, education, race/ethnicity, and
      field experience. SafeCare delivery time demands: Time diaries were completed by providers
      who were delivering SafeCare to families. Providers were instructed to complete a time diary
      following each Safe- Care session and submit them to the research team on a monthly basis.
      Information reported on the time diary form included the specific amount of time in minutes
      spent on SafeCare-related activities prior to, during, and following each session. These
      activities were determined by the research team in consultation with SafeCare trainers who
      are familiar with the common activities conducted by SafeCare providers. Provider fidelity:
      Fidelity was measured utilizing the SafeCare Provider Fidelity Checklist. The checklist
      includes a number of concrete behaviors providers should perform during the SafeCare session.
      Providers submit audio recordings to NSTRC and expert coders rate fidelity using this
      checklist based on the verbal behaviors performed by the provider in the SafeCare session.
      Provider implementation progress: SafeCare provider implementation progress was documented by
      research team members based on the implementation record review. Records were maintained by
      the NSTRC trainer who noted the progress of each provider through the training and
      certification process. To meet certification, the provider has to achieve 85% fidelity on
      three sessions in each SafeCare module (parent-child interaction, child health, and child
      safety), for a total of nine sessions. Provider implementation progress was coded as
      &quot;workshop only&quot; if the provider completed the training workshop but did not begin working
      with families. Providers were coded as &quot;Began certification, SafeCare inactive,&quot; if they
      began certification after workshop training but discontinued SafeCare delivery before
      reaching certification. Providers coded as &quot;Began certification, SafeCare active&quot; were still
      delivering SafeCare services at the end of the study period but had not yet achieved
      certification. Lastly, providers coded as SafeCare certified achieved at least 85% fidelity
      on nine SafeCare sessions during the study period. SC-TA qualitative interview: A
      semi-structured qualitative interview was conducted upon completion of the study to gather
      feedback on satisfaction and recommendations for SC-TA and learn how the SC-TA implementation
      delivery approach compared to SC-IU.

      Data Analysis Plan: Quantitative and qualitative data were analyzed using a convergence
      mixed-methods approach. Quantitative data were analyzed using Fisher's exact tests,
      chi-square tests, and independent samples t tests. Data for qualitative analyses included
      transcripts of audio recorded semi-structured interviews among providers. Thematic analysis
      was used to analyze all transcripts by the principal investigator and two other members of
      the research team. Derived codes from these transcripts were compared for consistency and
      overlap. Codes were grouped into themes. Differences in coding were explored and discussed
      until 95% agreement was reached across all transcripts. Periodic checks were made for
      intercoder agreement. Interrater discrepancies in coding were reviewed and discussed until
      100% consensus was reached.

    <time_frame>The average of up to 9 scores across 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The SafeCare fidelity checklist measures 30+ clinical behaviors that SafeCare providers are expected to deliver during an hour long SafeCare session. Fidelity on each behavior is scored as a + if occurs and a - if does not occur. Percentages are computed for the number of +'s divided by the number of total behaviors. Scores range from 0 to 100%, with higher numbers indicating higher fidelity. A score of 85% or greater is indicative of high competence with SafeCare delivery. SafeCare providers receive fidelity monitoring for nine sessions (three in each of three modules) until they reach certification and once per month thereafter. All fidelity scores for the participants will be collected from baseline assessment to six-month follow-up in order to assess the effect of implementation condition on fidelity scores. The frequency of fidelity assessment will vary depending on the caseload of each home visitor participant.</description>

        <title>SafeCare Fidelity</title>
        <description>The SafeCare fidelity checklist measures 30+ clinical behaviors that SafeCare providers are expected to deliver during an hour long SafeCare session. Fidelity on each behavior is scored as a + if occurs and a - if does not occur. Percentages are computed for the number of +'s divided by the number of total behaviors. Scores range from 0 to 100%, with higher numbers indicating higher fidelity. A score of 85% or greater is indicative of high competence with SafeCare delivery. SafeCare providers receive fidelity monitoring for nine sessions (three in each of three modules) until they reach certification and once per month thereafter. All fidelity scores for the participants will be collected from baseline assessment to six-month follow-up in order to assess the effect of implementation condition on fidelity scores. The frequency of fidelity assessment will vary depending on the caseload of each home visitor participant.</description>

        <title>SafeCare Time Diary</title>
        <description>Provider participants documented their time spent on SafeCare session preparation, completion, and follow-up using a time diary. This form was used to document the time home visitors spend on job-related activities such as preparing for home visits, conducting home visits, and completing notes, among other activities. All participants completed the form following each SafeCare session they complete during the six months of the study. The total number of time diaries completed will vary depending on the home visitor's caseload. Means were computed based on an average of the time diaries submitted per study arm and wer compared for differences.</description>

          <title>SafeCare Time Diary</title>
          <description>Provider participants documented their time spent on SafeCare session preparation, completion, and follow-up using a time diary. This form was used to document the time home visitors spend on job-related activities such as preparing for home visits, conducting home visits, and completing notes, among other activities. All participants completed the form following each SafeCare session they complete during the six months of the study. The total number of time diaries completed will vary depending on the home visitor's caseload. Means were computed based on an average of the time diaries submitted per study arm and wer compared for differences.</description>
