  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TME (Total mesorectum excision) is the golden standard of radical resection for mid-low
      rectal cancer. However, the damage of pelvic autonomic nerve following with TME principle
      will lead to high incidence of urinary and sexual function disorder. PANP (pelvic autonomic
      nerve preservation) surgery played a role in decreasing incidence of urinary and sexual
      function disorder. However, 32%-44% patients still suffered from urinary and sexual function
      disorder when underwent open (O-PANP-TME) or laparoscopic PANP TME surgery (L-PANP-TME).

      In the early stage of work, the investigators performed preservation of Denovilliers' fascia
      in L-PANP-TME to discuss the protection of urinary and sexual function of male mid-low rectal
      cancer patients. The results showed that preservation of Denovilliers' fascia in L-PANP-TME
      significantly decreased incidence of urinary and sexual function disorder. In order to
      further confirm the early work, the investigators design a multicenter randomized controlled
      clinical trial to compare differences in urinary and sexual function protection and long-term
      outcomes between preservation and excision of Denovilliers' fascia in L-PANP-TME.
