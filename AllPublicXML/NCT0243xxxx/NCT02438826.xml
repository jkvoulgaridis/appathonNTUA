    <measure>Overall Mean Change From Baseline in Weekly Cluster Headache Attack Frequency</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 1 through Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Number of cluster headache attacks was recorded daily by study participants in their ePRO Diary, Baseline and 12 weeks of daily data during double-blind treatment phase will be converted into 14-calendar day intervals: the baseline 14-day interval, Weeks 1/2, 3/4, 5/6, 7/8, 9/10, and 11/12. Next, the biweekly interval results were adjusted to 7-day (weekly) interval in order to report the outcome as weekly frequency. Overall mean change from baseline is derived from mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis. Least Square (LS) means were calculated using MMRM model with treatment, sex, verapamil use, pooled investigative site, week, baseline, and treatment by week as fixed effects.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With a 50% or Greater Reduction From Baseline in the Weekly Number of Cluster Headache Attacks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 1 through Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>A 50% responder is any participant who has a ≥50% reduction from baseline in the weekly number of cluster headache attacks in a 14-day interval: Weeks 1/2, Weeks 3/4, Weeks 5/6, Weeks 7/8, Weeks 9/10, and Weeks 11/12. Mean percentage of participants is derived from the average of weeks 1/2 to weeks 11/12 from generalized linear mixed model repeated measures method with treatment, sex, verapamil use, week, treatment by week, and baseline as fixed effects.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With a Sustained Response of 50% or Greater Reduction From Baseline in the Weekly Number of Cluster Headache Attacks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 3 through Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Sustained Response is defined as a 50% or greater reduction in the weekly cluster attack frequency from baseline to Weeks 3/4 and maintained at Weeks 5/6, Weeks 7/8, Weeks 9/10, and Weeks 11/12. Percentage of participants with a sustained response was analyzed using Koch's nonparametric randomization-based analysis of covariance method. This method adjusted for pooled investigative site by including it as a stratification variable. It also adjusted for sex, verapamil use and baseline value.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With a 30% Reduction in the Weekly Number of Cluster Headache Attacks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 1 through Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>A 30% responder is any participant who has a ≥30% reduction from baseline in the weekly number of cluster headache attacks in a 14-day interval. Weeks 1/2, 3/4, 5/6, 7/8, 9/10, and 11/12. Mean percentage of participants is derived from the average of weeks 1/2 to weeks 11/12 from generalized linear mixed model repeated measures method with treatment, sex, verapamil use, week, treatment by week, and baseline as fixed effects. .</description>

    <description>PGI-I requests participants to mark the box that best describes their cluster headache condition since they started taking the medicine. The options in the displayed boxes are represented on a 7-point scale, with 1 = very much better, 2 = much better, 3 = a little better, 4 = no change, 5 = a little worse, 6 = much worse, and 7 = very much worse. Percentage of participants were derived with a generalized linear mixed model repeated measures method with treatment, sex, verapamil use, baseline cluster headache attack category, month, and treatment by month as fixed effects.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Suicidal Ideation Assessed by Columbia - Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1 through Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>C-SSRS captures the occurrence, severity, and frequency of suicide-related thoughts and behaviors during the assessment period. The scale includes suggested questions to solicit the type of information needed to determine if a suicide-related thought or behavior occurred. Some questions are binary responses (yes/no) and some are on a scale of 1 (low severity) to 5 (high severity). Suicidal ideation: a &quot;yes&quot; answer to any of 5 suicidal ideation questions: wish to be dead, non-specific active suicidal thoughts, active suicidal ideation with any methods without intent to act, active suicidal ideation with some intent to act without specific plan, active suicidal ideation with specific plan and intent.</description>

        <title>Overall Mean Change From Baseline in Weekly Cluster Headache Attack Frequency</title>
        <description>Number of cluster headache attacks was recorded daily by study participants in their ePRO Diary, Baseline and 12 weeks of daily data during double-blind treatment phase will be converted into 14-calendar day intervals: the baseline 14-day interval, Weeks 1/2, 3/4, 5/6, 7/8, 9/10, and 11/12. Next, the biweekly interval results were adjusted to 7-day (weekly) interval in order to report the outcome as weekly frequency. Overall mean change from baseline is derived from mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis. Least Square (LS) means were calculated using MMRM model with treatment, sex, verapamil use, pooled investigative site, week, baseline, and treatment by week as fixed effects.</description>

        <description>C-SSRS captures the occurrence, severity, and frequency of suicide-related thoughts and behaviors during the assessment period. The scale includes suggested questions to solicit the type of information needed to determine if a suicide-related thought or behavior occurred. Some questions are binary responses (yes/no) and some are on a scale of 1 (low severity) to 5 (high severity). Suicidal ideation: a &quot;yes&quot; answer to any of 5 suicidal ideation questions: wish to be dead, non-specific active suicidal thoughts, active suicidal ideation with any methods without intent to act, active suicidal ideation with some intent to act without specific plan, active suicidal ideation with specific plan and intent.</description>
