  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test whether vaccination with viagenpumatucel-L combined with strategies to
      modulate the immune response is safe for patients with non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma or
      squamous cell carcinoma for incurable or metastatic disease. These methods collectively use
      the body's immune system to target the patient's own tumor. Immunosuppression hinders that
      response, and may develop in NSCLC patients in a variety of ways, such as activation of
      checkpoint pathways in the tumor microenvironment. Drugs that disrupt checkpoint molecule
      signaling like anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies nivolumab, may release this brake on the
      immune system. Tumor expression of PD-L1 plays an important role in patient response to
      checkpoint inhibitors; in general, clinical response to checkpoint inhibitors requires tumor
      expression of PD-L1 and presence of Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TIL). Combining
      viagenpumatucel-L with anti-PD-1 agents may enhance the vaccine's anti-tumor activity while
      prolonging or increasing the efficacy of the checkpoint inhibitor.
