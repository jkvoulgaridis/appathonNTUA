  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A large number of veterans suffer from distress-based conditions, such as anxiety and
      depression, putting them at high risk of experiencing persistent pain and prolonged opioid
      use following surgery. These connections are based on strong and consistent evidence from the
      literature and our preliminary data. The proposed study adds a 1-day workshop of Acceptance
      and Commitment Therapy (ACT), followed by an individual &quot;booster&quot; session, to treatment as
      usual (TAU) to reduce veterans' risk of persistent pain and prolonged opioid use following
      surgery. ACT has been shown to be effective in reducing chronic pain, anxiety and depression.

      This pilot study will establish the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of incorporating ACT
      into treatment as usual (TAU) to preoperatively target distress-based risk factors. Aim 1 is
      to establish the feasibility of successfully delivering ACT to at-risk veterans before and
      after surgery. Aim 2 is to test the preliminary efficacy of ACT on the length and/or amount
      of pain and opioid use after surgery. Veterans who are anxious or depressed before surgery
      will be randomly assigned to receive ACT plus TAU or TAU. Outcomes between the two groups
      will be compared. Aim 3 is to see if PROMIS modules, developed by the National Institute of
      Health, are useful for assessing pain and other symptoms in veterans. Findings from this
      study will be used to inform the design and implementation of a larger, well controlled,
      randomized clinical trial that will evaluate the efficacy of ACT plus TAU for at-risk
      veterans.

      This study will take place at the Iowa City VA Health Care System (VAMC). Veterans scheduled
      for orthopedic or open abdominal surgery in 1 to 3 months who score high for anxiety or
      depression will be randomly assigned to attend a 1-day ACT workshop preoperatively, with an
      individualize &quot;booster&quot; session postoperatively, or to have TAU. Veterans who receive ACT and
      trainers who provide the treatment will be interviewed to identify barriers and facilitators
      to providing ACT to at-risk veterans before and after surgery. Other primarily outcomes are
      pain and opioid use after surgery. Factors that may affect these outcomes will also be
      measured, including anxiety, depression, substance use disorder, post-traumatic stress
      disorder, and use of other pain meds.

      The investigators expect to gain important knowledge about ways to best include ACT as part
      of routine care for veterans requiring surgery and about the preliminary efficacy of ACT for
      the prevention of persistent pain and prolonged opioid use following surgery.

    <textblock>
      A large number of veterans suffer from distress-based conditions, such as anxiety and
      depression, putting them at risk of experiencing persistent pain and prolonged opioid use
      following surgery. Preventing these problems (our long term goal) for the thousands of
      veterans who undergo surgery each year can have a dramatic impact on quality of life and
      productivity, including positive effects on mood, daily activities, sleep, cognitive
      functions, social life and decreased risk of suicide (1, 2). In addition to these benefits
      for individual veterans, prevention of these problems can significantly reduce the estimated
      billions of dollars associated with veterans' utilization of the healthcare system as well as
      costs associated with lost work productivity, including unemployment and disability benefits
      (3).

      Building on strong and consistent evidence showing that high anxiety and depression put
      veterans at risk for persistent pain and prolonged opioid use following surgery (4, 5), this
      proposal tests the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of implementing a 1-day training
      session with Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) in veterans identified to be at-risk
      prior to surgery. ACT has been shown to significantly lower distress and disability in
      patients with chronic pain (6-8) and is particularly valuable intervention for the 80% of
      veterans who experience some level of psychological distress prior to surgery (9) and the 50%
      of veterans who report they experience pain on a regular basis (10, 11). Current practice
      does not include psychological interventions specifically aimed at addressing distress-based
      conditions prior to surgery. This study is a necessary first step in evaluating the efficacy
      of this novel intervention during a critical juncture in care to benefit veterans and prevent
      the devastating consequences of persistent pain and prolonged opioid use following surgery.

      This project is based on our interdisciplinary team's research on psychological factors
      predicting persistent pain after total knee replacement (12) and the effect of ACT on
      depression and pain in depressed migraine sufferers (13). The design of this 1-day workshop
      was developed based on feedback given by patients who received ACT during co-I Dindo's
      preliminary study. The rationale for this research is that, once we determine the feasibility
      and preliminary efficacy of incorporating this 1-day workshop into treatment as usual (TAU)
      to preoperatively target distress-based risk conditions, findings from this study will be
      used to inform the design and implementation of a larger, well controlled, randomized
      clinical trial that will evaluate the efficacy of ACT plus TAU (ACT + TAU) for at-risk
      veterans. The following specific aims will be achieved:

        -  Aim #1: The primary aim of this pilot study is to determine the feasibility of
           successfully delivering a 1-day ACT intervention with at-risk veterans prior to surgery
           and an individualized &quot;booster&quot; session after surgery. The following aspects of the
           intervention will be assessed: 1) the number of at-risk veterans who are willing and
           able to receive the ACT workshops and individual &quot;booster&quot; sessions; 2) veteran
           identification of barriers and facilitators to receiving the ACT intervention and
           utilizing the skills taught; 3) trainer identification of barriers and facilitators to
           providing the ACT intervention with at-risk veterans before and after surgery; and 4)
           veteran and trainer suggestions about ways to improve the intervention. These aspects
           will be assessed primarily through guided open-ended interviews after the ACT workshop
           and 3 months postoperatively.

        -  Aim #2: To determine if a 1-day preoperative ACT workshop with an individualized
           &quot;booster&quot; session postoperatively reduces the length and/or amount of pain and opioid
           use following surgery when compared to treatment as usual (TAU). Participants will be
           randomized to ACT + TAU or TAU and record pain and opioid use daily after surgery.

        -  Aim #3: A secondary, exploratory aim is to determine the usability and utility of the
           Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) modules for assessing
           pain and associated symptoms in veterans. We will compare modules to the Brief Pain
           Inventory (Pain Interference), the State/Trait Anxiety Inventory (Anxiety), and the
           Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9 (Depression).

      This project has the potential to infuse what is known about effective treatment of chronic
      pain into the acute care environment to benefit veterans and improve surgical outcomes. It
      incorporates an interdisciplinary approach to the care of veterans that attends to the
      psychology of pain.

    <description>Participants randomized to receive ACT will be scheduled to attend a 1-day training session before their preoperative clinic visit. The intervention will incorporate both experiential learning and didactic content, will include a summary of the main concepts at the end of the day, and a manual of the main concepts will be sent home with participants so they can practice the exercises prior to and after surgery. Participants will also receive an individualized phone call &quot;booster&quot; intervention 2 weeks after surgery to address any issues and reinforce the information that was given during the workshop. This will be done to facilitate the participant's use of the skills during the postoperative period.</description>

    <description>Current pre-surgery treatment includes a nurse-led patient education class covering the post-operative course and what to expect for pain control and recovery. Patients may be taking analgesia (i.e. opioids and/or non-opioids) preoperatively for a chronic pain condition and are prescribed analgesics, sedatives and/ or anxiolytics immediately prior to surgery. Intraoperatively, regional (i.e., spinal and femoral) anesthesia and analgesia is given and patients receive opioids, non-opioids, anticonvulsants and/or anxiolytics during the immediate postoperative period. Other pain treatments may be used, such as cryotherapy, music therapy, relaxation, imagery, etc. Patients are sent home with analgesia (often a combination medication of an opioid and acetaminophen) for breakthrough pain.</description>

    <description>The 1-day training session with ACT proposed for this study is designed to reduce behavioral avoidance and to enhance acceptance-based coping. The intervention includes: 1) Behavioral Change Training (2.5 hours) involving a) teaching patients how to recognize ineffective patterns of behavior and habits, b) exploring and setting life goals and goals related to mental and physical health, and c) promoting effective and committed actions to achieve these goals despite the urge to do otherwise; 2) Acceptance and Mindfulness Training (2.5 hours) emphasizing new ways of managing troubling thoughts, feelings, and physical sensations (e.g., learning how to recognize, and develop cognitive distance from, unhelpful thoughts and learning how to willingly face experiences that cannot be changed.</description>

        <description>Participants will record all pain medications (i.e. opioids and non-opioids) taken on a computerized pain medication form (or hardcopy log if participant does not have computer access available) until 3 months after surgery. The computerized pain medication form will list the drug name, route, dose, number taken, and date/time of each dose. When 0 doses of opioids have been recorded for 5 consecutive days, the first date in the series will be used as the point of cessation and the length of time from surgery to this date will be calculated as the length of opioid use.</description>
