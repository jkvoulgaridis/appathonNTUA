  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a study of INCB054329 given to patients with advanced malignancies that were
      conducted in three treatment groups. Each treatment group had a dose escalation (Part 1) and
      a dose expansion (Part 3), two of the treatment groups also had an intra-patient dose
      titration (Part 2).

    As of 31 JAN 2018, the study was terminated by the sponsor due to PK variability.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pharmacodynamics (PD) Analysis - Total c-Myc % Inhibition Versus INCB054329</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 15 in all cohorts</time_frame>
    <description>The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of INCB054329 was measured. The maximal inhibition of total c-Myc was correlated to the level of drug exposure and demonstrated a high degree of interparticipant variability, parallel to the PK data.
The measure was performed as a value across all cohorts. The entire dose escalation data set was used to create the relationship curve. Analysis of individual cohorts contained too few subjects and was biased toward one region of the curve so that the relationship was poorly defined.
Individual data points from all subjects were subjected to a nonlinear least squares regression analysis with no weighting, resulting in a sigmoidal dose response curve defining the relationship. The numerical value given is the projected INCB0054329 concentration in nM that produced 50% inhibition of c-myc expression.</description>

        <title>Pharmacodynamics (PD) Analysis - Total c-Myc % Inhibition Versus INCB054329</title>
        <description>The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of INCB054329 was measured. The maximal inhibition of total c-Myc was correlated to the level of drug exposure and demonstrated a high degree of interparticipant variability, parallel to the PK data.
The measure was performed as a value across all cohorts. The entire dose escalation data set was used to create the relationship curve. Analysis of individual cohorts contained too few subjects and was biased toward one region of the curve so that the relationship was poorly defined.
Individual data points from all subjects were subjected to a nonlinear least squares regression analysis with no weighting, resulting in a sigmoidal dose response curve defining the relationship. The numerical value given is the projected INCB0054329 concentration in nM that produced 50% inhibition of c-myc expression.</description>
