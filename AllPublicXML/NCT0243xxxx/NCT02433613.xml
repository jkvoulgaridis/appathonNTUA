      Prospective, multi-center, single-arm, non-interventional and open-label registry. The
      purpose of the registry is to document use of Phased Radio Frequency Ablation (RFA)
      (hereafter &quot;Phased RFA&quot;) System in a real world patient population with atrial fibrillation
      (AF) and evaluate its performance.

      Gold AF will enroll a minimum of 1,000 patients who undergo Phased RFA in approximately 38
      sites in Western, Central Europe, Israel and South Korea.

    <textblock>
      This registry will collect data prospectively on patients with paroxysmal, persistent and
      longstanding persistent atrial fibrillation (hereafter &quot;AF&quot;) undergoing Phased RFA treatment.
      Phased RFA will be applied according to the 'Intended Use' in CE mark (European Conformity)
      release and product packaging.

      The treatment will be performed according to routine hospital practice and no additional
      tests are required specific to the registry. This registry will serve as a tool to collect
      clinical data in order to expand the knowledge base of safety, effectiveness and
      functionality of the Medtronic Phased RFA System in a real world patient population.

      The key measures collected for the patients will be inclusive of, but are not limited to,
      clinical data pertaining to AF and individual disease state(s) characterized by form of AF
      and underline diseases, Phased RFA procedure details including timing and catheters in use,
      procedure and system related adverse events, AF recurrence, re-ablations and left atrial
      flutter rate after the index Phased RFA procedure. Additionally, this study will provide
      further information in the evolving anticoagulation strategies (e.g. continuous versus
      bridging and vitamin K antagonist versus novel oral anticoagulants) in the setting of AF
      ablations. Patients will be followed minimum for 12 months and maximum for 14 months after
      the Phased RFA ablation procedure. The twelve month follow-up can be done by telephone if it
      is not standard of care in the hospital's practice. During the twelve month follow-up
      patients will be interviewed with a quality of life questionnaire and results will be
      compared to the quality of life questionaire completed before the procedure.

    <time_frame>Patient will be followed for minimum 12 months, maximum 14 months, 12 month reported</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life will be captured using the Atrial Fibrillation Effect on Quality of Life (AFEQT) questionnaire. It is a standardized, disease-specific, reliable and responsive measure of health-related quality of life in subjects with AF. The AFEQT is a self-reported questionnaire with responses on a 7-point Likert scale. The 20-item instrument is divided into three domains (4-item symptom score, 8-item daily activities score, 6-item treatment concerns score) plus two treatment satisfaction questions.In countries where no validated version is available yet (e.g. Israel, Portugal), the AFEQT questionnaire will not be applied or will be additionally validated for the country official languages according to local requirements and regulations.
Overall or subscale range from 0 to 100. A score of 0 corresponds to complete disability (or responding &quot;extremely&quot; limited, difficult or bothersome to all questions answered), while a score of 100 corresponds to no disability).</description>

The INR is derived from prothrombin time (PT) which is calculated as a ratio of the patient's PT to a control PT standardized for the potency of the thromboplastin reagent developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) using the following formula: INR = Patient PT ÷ Control PT. INR can be used to assess the risk of bleeding or the coagulation status of the patients.</description>

        <title>Quality of Life Dynamic - AFEQT Score at 12 Months</title>
        <description>Quality of life will be captured using the Atrial Fibrillation Effect on Quality of Life (AFEQT) questionnaire. It is a standardized, disease-specific, reliable and responsive measure of health-related quality of life in subjects with AF. The AFEQT is a self-reported questionnaire with responses on a 7-point Likert scale. The 20-item instrument is divided into three domains (4-item symptom score, 8-item daily activities score, 6-item treatment concerns score) plus two treatment satisfaction questions.In countries where no validated version is available yet (e.g. Israel, Portugal), the AFEQT questionnaire will not be applied or will be additionally validated for the country official languages according to local requirements and regulations.
Overall or subscale range from 0 to 100. A score of 0 corresponds to complete disability (or responding &quot;extremely&quot; limited, difficult or bothersome to all questions answered), while a score of 100 corresponds to no disability).</description>

        <description>Characterize anticoagulation therapy: international normalized ratio (INR). Correlate anticoagulation therapy with thromboembolic events and bleeding the peri -procedural thromboembolic events and bleeding. The INR is derived from prothrombin time (PT) which is calculated as a ratio of the patient's PT to a control PT standardized for the potency of the thromboplastin reagent developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) using the following formula: INR = Patient PT ÷ Control PT. INR can be used to assess the risk of bleeding or the coagulation status of the patients.</description>
