  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The time between birth and age 24 months provides a unique opportunity to impact the
      long-term health and development of children through improved infant and young child feeding
      practices. In Burkina Faso, the prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding is currently around 25%
      in infants younger than six months.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the Alive &amp; Thrive intervention package,
      consisting of interpersonal counselling and community mobilisation activities, can increase
      the exclusive breastfeeding rate among infants younger than six months to at least 50% using
      a cluster randomised design.

      <pre_assignment_details>Rural communes were randomised in this study. There are 47 communes in Boucle du Mouhoun; 6 urban communes were excluded leaving 41 rural communes to be randomised to either the intervention or control arm. Of these, 2 intervention and 2 control communes were excluded due to co-intervention.</pre_assignment_details>
