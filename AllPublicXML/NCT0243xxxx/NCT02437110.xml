  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - Some people with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) have a high level of the virus HERV-K
      in their blood. Researchers do not think this virus causes ALS. But they don t know why some
      people with ALS have a high level of it. They want to know if HERV-K can be suppressed by
      drugs that are used to treat HIV infection.

      Objectives:

      - To learn how drugs usually taken for HIV infection affect people with Amyotrophic Lateral
      Sclerosis (ALS).

      Eligibility:

      - Adults at least 18 years old with ALS and high levels of HERV-K but no HIV.

      Design:

        -  Interested participants can contact the study team and, if eligible, the study team will
           arrange for a screening blood draw to determine the HERV-K level.

        -  Participants with a high HERV-K level will be screened with medical history, physical
           exam, questionnaires, nerve conduction test, lumbar puncture, and blood and breathing
           tests.

        -  After screening, participants will start taking the 4 study drugs..

        -  Participants will have study visits at Weeks 1and then every 4 weeks until Week 24. They
           will be asked how they are feeling and have an exam and blood drawn. At 3 visits, they
           will have tests of nerve conduction, breathing, and their ALS symptoms.

        -  At Week 24, they will stop taking the study drugs and have a repeat lumbar puncture.

        -  After the Week 36 visit, their participation is finished.

      Objective:

      In this Phase I, proof-of-concept study, we aim to determine whether an antiretroviral
      regimen approved to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection would also suppress
      levels of Human Endogenous Retrovirus-K (HERV-K) found to be activated in a subset of
      patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We propose to measure the of blood levels
      of HERV-K by quantitative PCR before, during, and after treatment with an antiretroviral
      regimen. We will evaluate the safety of the antiretroviral regimen for participants with ALS
      and also explore clinical and neurophysiological outcomes of ALS symptoms, quality of life,
      and pulmonary function.

      Study Population:

      We will study a subset of ALS patients who have a ratio of HERV-K:RPP30 greater than or equal
      to 13. About 30% of ALS patients may have detectable levels of HERV-K; about 20% of patients
      with ALS have a level &gt;1000 copies/ml. To show whether the HERV-K could be suppressed, we
      will recruit from the approximately 20% of patients with the high levels so that the
      antiretroviral effect can be determined.

      Design:

      This is an open-label study of a combination antiretroviral therapy for 24 weeks in 20
      HIV-negative, HTLV-negative ALS patients with high ratio of HERV-K:RPP30. The study duration
      for each participant will be up to 60 weeks. Participants will be followed regularly for
      safety, clinical, and neurophysiological outcomes.

      Outcome Measures:

      The primary outcome measure will be the percent decline HERV-K concentration measured by
      quantitataive PCR. Percent decline for a patient is measured by: 100 x (screening visit -
      week 24 visit measurement) / screening visit. The safety of antiretrovirals in volunteers
      with ALS as measured by the frequency and type of AEs, the ability to remain on assigned
      treatment (tolerability), physical examinations, laboratory test results, vital signs, and
      weight/body mass index (BMI). Efficacy will be explored by measuring the change in mean
      scores of: the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R), the ALS Specific Quality of
      Life Inventory-Revised (ALSSQOL-R), the ALS Cognitive Behavioral Screen (ALS-CBS), vital
      capacity and maximal inspiratory pressure as measured by handheld spirometer, electrical
      impedance myography (EIM), the change in neurofilament levels in blood and/or CSF, and the
      change in uring p75ECD levels.
