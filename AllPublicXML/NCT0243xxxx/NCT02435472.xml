  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a PI initiated, randomized clinical trial of exercise vs. usual care among men opting
      for active surveillance for prostate cancer. The AS RCT study is a randomized controlled
      trial of 16-weeks aerobic exercise (e.g., brisk walking) vs. usual care among men with
      prostate cancer on active surveillance. After obtaining written informed consent, enrolled
      subjects will be scheduled for the baseline assessments. The men randomized to the
      Intervention Arm will engage in an individually tailored aerobic exercise program following
      the principles of aerobic exercise training guidelines for adults as recommended by the
      American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM). The men in the Control Arm will be asked to
      continue their typical exercise practices for 16 weeks. Men in both arms will be asked to
      complete questionnaires at baseline and at week 16, months 12 &amp; 24. Blood urine, and tissue
      will be collected and biomarkers of exercise and prostate cancer will be assessed pre/post 16
      weeks.

      There is also a non-randomized observational component to the study where we will collect
      biospecimens, survey, data, and administer one CPET. Individuals who will be enrolled to this
      group include those who do not meet all eligibility criteria for the RCT, or those who do not
      wish to be in a RCT, but are interested to participate in some lifestyle research. This group
      also provides us with a larger more heterogeneous population to follow long term to examine
      associations between exercise, biomarkers, fitness metrics, and clinical and psychosocial
      outcomes.

    <description>Arm A will engage in up to 4 aerobic sessions per week at 55% to 75% of the individually determined exercise capacity (VO2peak; determined from the cardiopulmonary exercise test performed at baseline) for 16 weeks. This exercise prescription will be achieved through ~ 4 sessions / week. Men are provided with a heart rate monitor to help ensure they exercise in their target zone. At baseline &amp; week 16, all patients will complete: (1) lifestyle and quality-of-life questionnaires, (2) measurement of weight (3) collection of research fasting blood sample, (4) collection of urine sample, and (5) cardiorespiratory fitness testing. We will also request archival biopsy tissue samples from before and after the intervention.</description>
