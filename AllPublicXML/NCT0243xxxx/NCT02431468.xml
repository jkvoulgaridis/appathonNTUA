  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study comparing different doses of
      bryostatin for the treatment of moderately severe to severe Alzheimer's disease. The study is
      15 weeks in duration, including a safety and efficacy evaluation 30 days after the last dose
      of study drug.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will enroll 150 moderately severe to severe Alzheimer's disease subjects. Subjects
      will be randomly assigned 1:1:1 to treatment with two different doses of bryostatin 1 or
      placebo. The primary analysis will take place after 12 weeks of treatment (7 doses).

    <time_frame>Primary analysis at Week 13 (day 91) after 12 weeks of treatment (up to day 107)</time_frame>
    <description>The primary statistical objective for efficacy was to estimate the effect of bryostatin on the mean change in the total SIB score after 12 weeks of treatment, assessed at Week 13 (day 91). Efficacy analyses were conducted according to randomized groups. The SIB is used to assess cognition in subjects with moderate and severe AD. It is divided into nine subscales that include attention, language, orientation, memory, praxis, visuospatial ability, construction, social skills, orienting head to name. Non-verbal responses are allowed, thus decreasing the need for language output. Forty questions are included with a point score range of 0-100. Lower scores indicate greater cognitive impairment.</description>

    <description>Change from baseline in the Severe Impairment Battery (SIB) at Weeks 5 and 9. Assesses cognition. Score range 0-100. Lower scores indicate greater cognitive impairment.
Change from baseline in Alzheimer Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living Inventory-Severe Impairment Version (ADCS-ADL-SEV) at Weeks 5, 9,13. A 19-item test of the performance of activities of daily living. Total score range 0-54; lower scores indicate greater functional impairment.
Change from baseline in MMSE-2 at Weeks 5, 9 and 13. Tests selected aspects of cognition on a scale of 0-30. Lower scores indicate greater cognitive impairment.
Change from baseline in Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) at Weeks 5, 9,13. Caregiver interview assesses 12 behavioral disturbances. Scores range from 0-144; higher scores indicate greater behavioral disturbances.
Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I) at Weeks 5, 9, 13. A 7-point scale range from (1) very much improved to (7) very much worse.</description>

        <title>Efficacy: Change From Baseline in Severe Impairment Battery (SIB) in the Full Analysis Set (FAS)</title>
        <description>The primary statistical objective for efficacy was to estimate the effect of bryostatin on the mean change in the total SIB score after 12 weeks of treatment, assessed at Week 13 (day 91). Efficacy analyses were conducted according to randomized groups. The SIB is used to assess cognition in subjects with moderate and severe AD. It is divided into nine subscales that include attention, language, orientation, memory, praxis, visuospatial ability, construction, social skills, orienting head to name. Non-verbal responses are allowed, thus decreasing the need for language output. Forty questions are included with a point score range of 0-100. Lower scores indicate greater cognitive impairment.</description>
