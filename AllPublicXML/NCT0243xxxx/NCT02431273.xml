      This study will evaluate the hypothesis that intravaginal rings (IVRs) can safely and in a
      sustained fashion, deliver the antiretroviral (ARV) drugs - tenofovir disoproxil fumarate
      (TDF), emtricitabine (FTC), and maraviroc (MVC), in healthy women when used in the following
      drug combinations: 1) TDF (&quot;Single&quot; IVR); 2) TDF-FTC (&quot;Dual&quot; IVR) and; 3) TDF-FTC-MVC
      (&quot;Triple&quot; IVR).

      TDF = tenofovir disoproxil fumarate; FTC = emtrcitabine; MVC = maraviroc

      The broad long term goal of this project is to empower women to protect themselves from HIV
      through woman-controlled sustained local delivery of ARTs via intravaginal rings. The
      short-term general investigational plan is to evaluate IVRs releasing TDF, TDF-FTC and
      TDF-FTC-MVC in healthy women for up to 7 days in an open-label study to determine safety and
      drug concentrations in plasma and cervicovaginal lavage and secretions. Additional
      exploratory studies will be considered and planned based in part on the results obtained in
      this study. The long-term investigational plan is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      sustained release TDF, TDF-FTC and TDF-FTC-MVC for their ability to decrease HIV transmission
      to vulnerable women.

    <description>Number of Adverse Events (AEs) was recorded. Safety parameters were monitored for each IVR combination and the grading scale for each parameter followed the Female Genital Grading Table for Use in Microbicide Studies. AEs not included in that table were graded using the Division of AIDS (DAIDS) Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events (DAIDS AE Grading Table), Version 2.0, November 2014 (Grade 1 = mild, Grade 2 = Moderate, Grade 3 = Severe, Grade 4 = Potentially Life-Threatening).</description>
