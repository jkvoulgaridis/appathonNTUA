    <textblock>
      A study evaluating the safety, preliminary efficacy and pharmacokinetics of ipatasertib in
      combination with atezolizumab and docetaxel in participants with mCRPC previously treated
      with second-generation AR (Androgen Receptor)-targeted therapy. The study consists of two
      parts: [1] Part A: Safety run-in cohort of approximately 12 participants; [2] Part B:
      Expansion cohort of approximately 38 participants. All participants in this study will
      continue to be treated until progression of disease, loss of clinical benefit, unacceptable
      toxicity or withdrawal of consent.

    <description>Part A (Safety Run-In): 12 Participants will be administered Ipatasertib orally once a day [QD] from Day 1 to Day 14 in combination with Atezolizumab administered by intravenous (IV infusion) every 3 weeks (Q3W) on Day 1 of each cycle (a cycle being 21 days) and Docetaxel administered by IV infusion (Q3W) on Day 1 of each cycle. Docetaxel will be administered for a maximum of 10 cycles (approximately 7 months), after which Atezolizumab and Ipatasertib will be administered as a doublet until disease progression. During Part A, a staggered recruitment will be applied to the first and potentially first 6 participants to enrol a participant only once the former one has safely overcome the safety time window (Cycle 1).
Part B (Expansion): 38 Participants will be administered Ipatasertib, Atezolizumab and Docetaxel as described above, though without a staggered enrolment or safety assessment window.</description>
