    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well daratumumab, azacitidine, and dexamethasone work in
      treating patients with multiple myeloma that has come back (recurrent) or has not responded
      to treatment (refractory) and was previously treated with daratumumab. Daratumumab is an
      antibody made up of immune cells that attaches to a protein on myeloma cells, called CD38.
      CD38 is found in higher levels on tumor cells than on normal cells. Daratumumab prevents the
      growth of tumors who have high levels of CD38 by causing those cells to die. Chemotherapy
      drugs, such as azacitidine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either
      by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.
      Dexamethasone is a steroid that helps decrease inflammation and lowers the body's normal
      immune response to help reduce the effect of any infusion-related reactions. Giving
      azacitidine may help increase the levels of CD38 on the tumor cells to increase the function
      of daratumumab to attach to those tumor cells to help destroy them.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the efficacy of adding azacitidine to daratumumab and dexamethasone, as
      measured by the overall response rate in patients with relapsed refractory multiple myeloma
      (RRMM) previously treated with daratumumab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the duration of response per International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG)
      criteria.

      II. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of azacitidine in combination with daratumumab
      and dexamethasone.

      III. To evaluate progression free and overall survival in patients treated with azacitidine
      in combination with daratumumab and dexamethasone.

      IV. To assess the changes in CD38 expression on plasma cells after treatment with azacitidine
      and correlate this change with the depth and duration of response of azacitidine in
      combination with daratumumab and dexamethasone.

      OUTLINE:

      PRE-INDUCTION (CYCLE 0): Patients receive azacitidine intravenously (IV) on days -7 to -3 in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      INDUCTION PHASE (CYCLES 1-2): Patients receive azacitidine IV on days 22-26 and dexamethasone
      IV or orally (PO) and daratumumab IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Treatment
      repeats every 28 days for up to 2 cycles in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      CONSOLIDATION PHASE (CYCLES 3-6): Patients receive azacitidine IV on days 22-26 of cycle 3
      and on days 1-5 of cycles 4-6 and dexamethasone IV or PO and daratumumab IV over 30-60
      minutes on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 4 cycles in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      MAINTENANCE PHASE (CYCLES 7+): Patients receive azacitidine IV on days 1-5 and dexamethasone
      IV or PO and daratumumab IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 4 weeks for up to 1 year.

                            discontinuation of azacitidine, and for 3 months after last daratumumab
                            dose

                              -  Note: If the risk of pregnancy changes (e.g., a woman who is not
                                 heterosexually active becomes active), a woman must begin a highly
                                 effective method of contraception, as described throughout the
                                 inclusion criteria

                                   -  If reproductive status is questionable, additional evaluation
                                      should be considered

                         -  Agrees to not breast feed for the duration of the study (including
                            during dose interruptions), and for 4 weeks following discontinuation
                            of azacitidine, and for 3 months after last daratumumab dose

         10. Women must agree not to donate eggs (ova, oocytes) for the purposes of assisted
             reproduction during the study (including during dose interruptions), and for 4 weeks

             after the last dose

         11. Due to the teratogenicity of azacitidine and the lack of adequate reproductive
             toxicity data for daratumumab, in addition to the user independent highly effective
             method of contraception, a male or female condom with or without spermicide,
             diaphragm, or cervical cap is required. Male condom and female condom should not be
             used together (due to risk of failure with friction)

             discontinuation of azacitidine, and for 3 months after the last daratumumab dose, in
             addition to the user independent highly effective method of contraception (even if he
             has undergone a successful vasectomy), a man

               -  Who is sexually active with a woman of childbearing potential must agree to use a
                  barrier method of contraception (i.e., latex or synthetic condom with spermicidal
                  foam/gel/film/cream/suppository)

               -  Who is sexually active with a woman who is pregnant must use a latex or synthetic

             the best interest of the subject (e.g., compromise their well-being) or that could
             prevent, limit, or confound the protocol-specified assessments

         12. Contraindications to the use of daratumumab, azacitidine or dexamethasone per local
             prescribing information

         13. Taken any disallowed therapies before the planned first dose of study drug

         14. Received any therapy to treat cancer (including radiation, chemotherapy, biologics,

             first dose of study treatment, whichever is shorter.

         15. Participated in an interventional clinical trial(s) and received an investigational
             drug (including investigational vaccines) or used an invasive investigational medical

             administration. Note: Subjects with planned surgical procedures to be conducted under
             local anesthesia may participate. Kyphoplasty is not considered a major surgery.
