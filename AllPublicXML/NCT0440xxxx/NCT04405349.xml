    <textblock>
      This phase IIa study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of multiple dosing with
      VB10.16 immunotherapy in combination with atezolizumab in patients with advanced or recurrent
      non-resectable HPV16-positive cervical cancer, who failed or are not eligible for current
      standard of care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will receive up to 11 intramuscular (i.m.) vaccinations of VB10.16, for up to 48
      weeks from first vaccination. Patients will receive 5 vaccinations of 3 mg VB10.16 during the
      first 12 weeks, followed by vaccination every 6 weeks for up to 48 weeks from first
      immunisation (total of 11 vaccinations). Patients will receive up to 17 infusions of
      atezolizumab for up to 48 weeks from first treatment. Atezolizumab (1200 mg) will be
      administered as an intravenous (i.v.) infusion every 3 weeks. A follow-up period of up to 12
      months will follow the 48 week treatment period.

      Response to the VB10.16 and atezolizumab combination will be assessed by computed tomography
      (CT)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at every 9 weeks throughout the treatment period
      according to the RECIST 1.1 criteria.

         15. Has received vaccination against infections within 30 days before study entry.

         16. Has had prior treatment with CD137, anti-PD-1, or anti-PD-L1 therapeutic antibody or
