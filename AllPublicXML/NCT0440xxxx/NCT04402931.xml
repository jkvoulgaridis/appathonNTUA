  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transcatheter valve-in-valve implantation has emerged as a valid alternative to redo surgery
      for patients with surgical bioprosthetic dysfunction. Nowadays, transcatheter, transeptal
      mitral valve-in-valve replacement (TsMViV) has been adopted in many centers worldwide. Some
      studies report low rates of periprocedural morbidity and mortality and favorable hemodynamic
      parameters of valve performance. However, medium and long-term data on TsMViV as compared to
      redo surgical mitral valve replacement (rSMVR) is not yet established. Studies of
      cost-effectiveness and cost-utility comparing both strategies were also not reported. In
      particular, late prosthesis durability and hemodynamic performance after TsMViV are largely
      unknown and need to be elucidated before widely indicated, especially among younger and
      low-risk surgical candidates with failed mitral bioprostheses.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, randomized, controlled trial of transeptal, transcatheter mitral valve-in-valve
      versus redo surgical mitral valve replacement.

      After multidisciplinary, heart team discussion, patients meeting inclusion criteria will be
      randomized 1:1 to receive either transcatheter, transeptal mitral valve-in-valve replacement
      (TsMViV) with the SAPIEN 3 transcatheter heart valve (THV) or redo, mitral valve replacement
      with 3 commercially available surgical bioprosthetic valves. A sub-randomization in the
      surgical group will define which bioprosthetic valve will be used. Patients will be seen for
      follow-up visits at discharge, 30 days, 6 months and annually through 10 years.
