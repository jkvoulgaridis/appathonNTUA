  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a cross over randomized study which aims to compare the effect of 2 modes of
      noninvasive ventilation on the occurence of central apnea, as measured by electrical activity
      of the diaphragm

             criteria of the American Academy of Pediatrics)

          -  Having presented at least 1 apnea objectified by the parents or by a health care
             professional, as previously described (1), with one or more of the following
             characteristics: 1/Associated with bradycardia &lt; 80 / min, 2/Associated with
             desaturation &lt; 85% or 3/Duration more than 10 seconds

          -  Informed consent signed by at least one of the two parents + oral agreement from the
             second parent before the intervention of the study (2nd signature to be collected as
             soon as possible)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  With chronic respiratory insufficiency requiring home ventilation (NIV or under
             long-term oxygen therapy, initiated at least 14 days before the start of the study)

          -  Ventilated in NIV for more than 48 hours before inclusion
