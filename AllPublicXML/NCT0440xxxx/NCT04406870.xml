    <textblock>
      Infantile hepatic hemangioendothelioma (IHHE) is an infantile hemangioma involving the
      liver.Since 2008, propranolol has been used for the treatment of hemangioma, and some
      researchers have also started to report the use of propranolol for the treatment of infantile
      hepatic hemangioma in children. Sirolimus can be used in patients with vascular malformations
      such as hemangiomas. IHHE is also an infantile hemangioma involving the liver,thus sirolimus
      may paly the role in treatment of IHHE.The clinical trial explores the efficacy of sequential
      treatment of sirolimus to refractory IHHE patients resistant with propranolol, to improve the
      therapeutic effect, reduce the side effects of traditional treatment methods (hormones,
      interferon), and reduce the number of operations and interventions and to provide a clinical
      basis for the application of the new therapeutics model of IHHE of &quot;propranolol + sequential
      sirolimus treatment&quot;.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to the World Health Organization(WHO) classification of digestive system tumors in
      the fourth edition in 2010, infantile hepatic hemangioendothelioma (IHHE) is an infantile
      hemangioma involving the liver. It is a benign tumor, which can be subgrouped into focal,
      multifocal, and diffusing in children, as well as combining vascular malformations of the
      skin, brain, digestive tract and other organs.Since 2008, propranolol has been used for the
      treatment of hemangioma, and some researchers have also started to report the use of
      propranolol for the treatment of infantile hepatic hemangioma in children.And more and more
      clinicians unanimously recommend propranolol as first-line medication for the treatment of
      IHHE.However, there are few solutions to propranolol-resistant IHHE. Sirolimus is a
      serine/threonine kinase which plays a pivotal role in cell mortality, angiogenesis and cell
      growth. Sirolimus can be used in patients with vascular malformations such as hemangiomas.
      Children with vascular malformations received 0.1mg/kg of sirolimus orally every day and
      maintained the blood concentration at 8-15ng/ml. The lesions gradually disappear with time
      going on. Therefore, sirolimus can be used as a second-line medicine for refractory
      hemangioma and vascular malformation.Interestingly, the investigator's previous study which
      is retrospective analysis of 30 patients has indicated the effective rate of propranolol
      alone in treating infantile hepatic endothelial tumor (IHHE) was 57.7%, while that of
      sequential treatment combined with sirolimus was 84.6%.So, this clinical trial is going to
      explore the efficacy of sequential treatment of sirolimus to refractory IHHE patients
      resistant with propranolol,to improve the therapeutic effect,furtherly, reduce the side
      effects of traditional treatment methods (hormones, interferon), as well as the number of
      operations and interventions and to provide a clinical guide for the novel therapeutics model
      of propranolol combined with sirolimus for sequential treatment of infantile hepatic
      hemangioendothelioma.
