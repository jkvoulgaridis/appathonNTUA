  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Esophageal cancer is still a serious threat to human life and health. China in particular.
      Relapse and metastasis are important causes of treatment failure. Immunotherapy is a new
      treatment method, which can be used in combination with chemotherapy to improve the
      therapeutic effect. However, the role of immunotherapy combined with chemoradiotherapy in
      concurrent chemoradiotherapy of recurrent esophageal cancer has not been clearly studied. Our
      team will study it in detail.

      The purpose of this study was to compare and analyze the effect of Camrelizumab in concurrent
      chemoradiotherapy of locally recurrent esophageal cancer.

    <textblock>
      In this study, patients with local recurrence of esophageal carcinoma without distant
      metastasis were randomly divided into experimental group and control group by Block
      randomization. In the experimental group, patients with local recurrence were treated with
      Camrelizumab combined with concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Followed up for 3 years to observe
      the objective remission rate and disease-free survival. In the control group, patients with
      local recurrence were treated with placebo combined with concurrent chemoradiotherapy.
      Followed up for 3 years to observe the objective remission rate and disease-free survival.
