  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project proposes to perform a pilot study of fMRI targeted Dorsomedial Prefrontal Cortex
      repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (DMPFC-rTMS) on individuals diagnosed with
      Bulimia Nervosa (BN) and Anorexia Nervosa (AN). The DMFPC is a novel target for rTMS, is
      heavily implicated in the regulation of mood and affect, and has been suggested to be
      involved in AN, BN, major depression, OCD, and PTSD. Improved function in this area might
      lead to reduced AN and BN symptoms, such as bingeing, purging, and over-activity, perhaps by
      improved regulation of mood and affect. Improvements in important areas of comorbidity might
      allow for better response to intensive treatment for AN and BN, and reduce relapse rates
      after such treatment. The DMPFC may be a more appropriate target for compared to the
      Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (DLPFC), which has typically been the focus of stimulation in
      the past. Our initial preliminary pilot work has noted unexpected and significant
      improvements in some core ED symptoms (bingeing and purging) and in important areas of
      comorbidity (OCD and PTSD), along with expected improvements in mood. These changes have
      allowed some treatment resistant patients to either complete intensive treatment or be
      successful in maintaining their progress post intensive treatment. Subjects will receive up
      to 30 sessions of bilateral DMPFC-rTMS. Response will be evaluated clinically, via
      psychometric measures, and pre and post fMRI.
