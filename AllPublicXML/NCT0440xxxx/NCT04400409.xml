  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of a multidisciplinary
      vascular care team utilizing an intensive guideline-based lipid reduction program in
      improving risk factor modification as measured by LDL-C reduction at 12 months in patients
      with peripheral artery disease (PAD). An additional objective is to understand the potential
      reach and impact if this program were extended across the University of Colorado Healthcare
      (UC Health) System.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with PAD and elevated LDL-C who are cared for at the University of Colorado (UC) and
      who provide consent will be randomized 1:1 to Intervention A, a vascular care team approach
      including pharmacy and healthcare provider assistance with medication adherence, versus
      Intervention B consisting of standard care augmented with a single consultation with a
      Vascular Medicine physician who will provide the treating doctor with a personalized risk
      assessment for the patient and a summary of the 2018 American College of Cardiology
      (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) Guideline on Management of Blood.1 There will also be
      an observational cohort (registry) to understand current practice patterns and outcomes in a
      non-interventional PAD population within the UC Health system in order to assess the
      potential impact of Intervention A after conclusion of the randomized study.

    <description>consists of multiple strategies related to improving lipid management, starting with a referral to the vascular care team. The subject will undergo a visit with a vascular care team, including a Vascular Medicine specialist who will obtain a patient history and prescribe a lipid lowering therapy regimen. The subject will also meet with a pharmacist to answer questions related to access to medications, drug side effects, and potential interactions with the subject's other medications.</description>
