  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Assisted living residents who have sleep disturbances are at great risk of developing
      cognitive impairments. The identification of factors that increase sleep problems in this
      population is the first step towards improving sleep disorders and reducing and/or delaying
      the occurrence of cognitive impairments in this population. Physical activity has been
      proposed to improve sleep quality in older individuals, but there is currently no scientific
      evidence of how sleep mediates the relationship between physical activity and cognition in
      assisted living residents. This is a cross-sectional study that investigates the relationship
      between sleep quality, functional/physical capacity, and cognitive performance. Participants
      will be recruited through a non-probabilistic sampling method (convenience) as this is a
      feasibility study that aims to identify, for the first time, sleep disorders in assisted
      living residents using objective measures of sleep. Sleep quality will be measured with
      polysomnography, actigraphy, and questionnaire. Functional and physical capacity will be
      assessed through walking tasks and actigraphy. Cognitive tasks will be used to assess memory.
      This study will bring new insights into the factors that affect the quality of life and sleep
      in assisted living residents. The evidence-based knowledge acquired on-site will be
      translated and shared with the local and global scientific community to raise awareness of
      the factors that contribute to increasing institutionalization and dependent living. Results
      obtained from objective and subjective measures of sleep will be of great importance to
      develop specialized clinical expertise and behavioral interventions that will meet residents'
      needs.

      Specific Objectives and Hypotheses:

        1. To test the feasibility of using polysomnography to identify the severity of sleep
           disorders in assisted living residents.

           The implementation of objective measures of sleep in assisted living residents is
           practical and provides accurate information on sleep architecture parameters.

        2. To investigate the association between functional capacity and physical activity and
           sleep quality in assisted living residents using functional tests and actigraphy,
           respectively.

           There is a positive association between functional capacity and sleep quality and
           physical activity will improve sleep quality in the efficiency and duration domains.

        3. To investigate the association between sleep quality, measured through actigraphy, and
           cognitive performance, specifically in the memory domain, in assisted living residents.

           There is a positive association between sleep quality, especially sleep efficiency, and
           cognitive performance.

        4. To compare the sleep quality (measured with polysomnography, actigraphy, and
           questionnaire) in assisted living residents with older individuals of the same age and
           cognitive performance (Montreal Cognitive Assessment; MoCA score &gt; 26) who live
           independently.

      Sleep quality will be lower in assisted living residents in comparison with older individuals
      who live independently and the use of various methods to assess sleep quality will provide a
      better estimation of the differences in sleep quality between these populations.

    <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) will be used to subjectively measure sleep quality and disturbances in the past few months. The self-related questions include the assessment of seven different sleep domains: sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medications, and daytime dysfunction. The participant should score each of the seven areas from 0 (no difficulty) to 3 (severe difficulty). Final score â‰¥ 5 indicates poor sleep quality.</description>

    <description>The target population will be inactive men and women residents of the Brenda Strafford Foundation (&gt; 50 yrs. old). We expect the participants to be classified as inactivity, which will be defined as an engagement in &lt; 3 sessions/week of 20 min or more of vigorous exercise. Participants should be able to move independently without the assistance of a wheelchair.</description>

    <description>Volunteers from the Brain in Motion II (BIM II) study (NCT03035851). The BIM II study aims to examine the mechanisms whereby exercise may improve sleep and cognition in men and women aged 50 to 80 years old. As the baseline measurements of the BIM II study are similar to the assessments proposed in this study, the assisted living residents will be matched with older individuals of the same age and cognitive performance who live independently to answer the last research question.</description>

    <description>The first visit will consist of screening measurements. Participants will be asked to complete the following questionnaires: InterRAI Self Report Quality of Life Survey for Long Term Care Facilities (interRAI SQoL), Resident Assessment Instrument (RAI)-MDS 2.0, Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ), Memory Complaint Questionnaire (MAC-Q), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). At the end of this visit, the participants will be asked to wear the ActiWatch-2 (AW-2) as a wristwatch for 14 days. In the second visit, participants' height and weight will be measured and the participants will perform the following cognitive and functional tests: MoCA, Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised (BVMT-R), Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R), Time up and Go (TUG), and Cognitive TUG (TUGcog). Finally, visit 3 will consist of on-site PSG recordings.</description>
