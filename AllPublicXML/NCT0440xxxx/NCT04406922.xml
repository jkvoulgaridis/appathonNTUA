  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate whether maximum cold-induced non-shivering thermogenesis (e.g.
      thermogenesis as a consequence of BAT activity) differs between morning and evening.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Brown adipose tissue (BAT) recently emerged as a novel player in energy expenditure (EE) in
      humans as it combusts fatty acids and glucose towards heat. Human BAT can be activated by
      sympathetic stimulation resulting from cold exposure or treatment with sympathomimetic drugs.
      Short-term acclimation to mild cold was shown to reduce fat mass in obese subjects and
      decrease peripheral insulin resistance of patients with T2DM. Recently, in preclinical
      studies the investigators showed that BAT has a circadian rhythm. It is currently unknown
      whether this is also the case in humans. The investigators postulate that BAT activity should
      display a circadian rhythm that adapts to changes in circadian behavior, and may determine
      glucose/lipid levels throughout the day.

    <intervention_name>Personalized cooling protocol</intervention_name>
    <description>As an intervention, a personalized cooling protocol will be used in order to activate BAT and induce non-shivering thermogenesis. During the cooling procedure, subjects will be exposed to mild cold (approx. 14°C) for 150 min. Since the onset temperature of shivering shows a high interindividual variation, we will use a personal cooling protocol to ensure maximum non-shivering EE (and thus an equal maximum activation of BAT). The right temperature will be determined via a subjective method, e.g. to ask the subject if he or she experiences shivering. The time needed to achieve the right temperature is approximately 30-60 minutes. Then, the stable cooling period of 90 min is started. During this time the subject will be asked every 15 minutes whether he is experiencing shivering. If so, temperature will be increased with 2-3°C so that shivering just stops.</description>
