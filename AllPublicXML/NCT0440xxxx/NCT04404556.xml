  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Type 1 diabetes (T1D) treatment adherence is complex and involves glucose monitoring,
      counting carbohydrates, and intensive insulin delivery via injections or insulin pump in
      response to food intake, exercise, and illness to achieve near-normal blood glucose levels.
      Evidence demonstrates that adhering to T1D treatment is challenging, especially during
      adolescence. Non-adherence leads to suboptimal glycemic levels that severely compromise
      health and quality of life. Suboptimal adherence to T1D treatment regimen is common in &gt;50%
      of adolescents and directly related to suboptimal glycemic control, increased risk of
      hospitalizations for diabetic ketoacidosis, and decreased health-related quality of life
      (HRQOL). The maximum benefits of current diabetes technology are limited by the knowledge,
      skills, adherence barriers, and non-adherence behaviors.10-14 Ultimately, adolescents have to
      overcome these barriers in order to benefit from technological advances. Thus, there is a
      clear need for behaviorally focused interventions to identify and reduce adherence barriers.
      The overall objective of this study is to identify adolescents with elevated adherence
      barriers and provide novel tailored mHealth intervention (Diabetes Journey) targeting these
      barriers. This study is two phases and includes a small pilot of up to 12 adolescents with
      type 1 diabetes (Phase 1) and a randomized controlled clinical trial (Phase 2). The
      randomized controlled clinical trial will examine feasibility, acceptability and preliminary
      efficacy of Diabetes Journey versus enhanced standard of care (control group) in
      approximately 256 adolescents with type 1 diabetes. Primary and secondary outcomes include
      adherence barriers, adherence, health-related quality of life and A1C. Satisfaction and
      acceptability will also be examined. Mediators and moderators will include executive
      functioning, diabetes distress, family conflict, depressive symptoms, fear of hypoglycemia
      and sleep.

    <description>Diabetes Journey is a web-based intervention to address key adherence barriers. Participants randomized to this arm will first receive the mandatory Introduction and Problem-Solving Module. Based on their elevations on the Barriers to Diabetes Adherence measure, participants will receive up to 7 modules in total. Participants will navigate through the web-based theme park map and complete modules independently and then will have accompanying Zoom telehealth sessions with a therapist.</description>

    <ipd_time_frame>The NIDDK Data Repository will serve as the primary data repository for the current proposal. In addition, data sets may also be distributed via clinicaltrials.gov. Should individuals or organizations request the dataset directly from the principal investigators, those requests will be directed to the NIDDK Data repository to retrieve the data.
Per NIDDK guidelines on resource sharing for intervention studies, baseline data will be shared within 2 years after study recruitment is complete or within six months of the publication date of the baseline data, whichever comes first. An analytic dataset for the baseline publication will be provided within 6 months of the publication date (when the publication appears online).</ipd_time_frame>
    <ipd_access_criteria>The investigators agree that they will identify where the data will be available and how to access the data in any publications and presentations that the investigators author or co-author about these data, as well as acknowledge the repository and funding source in any publications and presentations. Since the investigators will be using the NIDDK Data Repository, this repository has policies and procedures in place that will provide data access to qualified researchers, fully consistent with NIH data sharing policies and applicable laws and regulations.</ipd_access_criteria>
