  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A study to characterize the single-dose and steady-state pharmacokinetics of tofacitinib
      Modified Release (MR) formulation as well as to compare the extent of absorption of the MR 11
      mg formulation (once daily) to that of the Immediate Release (IR) 5 mg formulation (twice
      daily) of tofacitinib in Chinese healthy subjects under fasted conditions.

    <intervention_model_description>Subjects will be randomized to one of the two treatment sequences. Each treatment sequence will consist of two periods, separated by a washout phase of no less than 72 hours from the AM dose on Day 7.
Treatment A (Test): Single oral dose of tofacitinib MR 11 mg, administered as 1 x MR 11 mg tablet, in a fasting state on Day 1 followed by once daily dosing (QD) on Days 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7.
Treatment B (Reference): Two separate oral doses (12 hours apart) of tofacitinib IR 5 mg, administered one in the morning in a fasting state and one in the evening at least 2 hours after dinner on Day 1 followed by 5 mg IR every 12 hours on Days 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7.</intervention_model_description>

          -  Any condition possibly affecting drug absorption (eg, gastrectomy, colon resection,
             etc.).

          -  Use of CYP3A4 inhibitors (eg, ketoconazole, ciprofloxacin, diltiazem) or inducers (eg,
