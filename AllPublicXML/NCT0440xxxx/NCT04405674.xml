      This is a phase II, open-label, multicenter, single-arm, prospective clinical study designed
      to investigate the efficacy and safety of Tislelizumab (anti-PD1 antibody) combined with
      carboplatin plus Nab-paclitaxel in Non-squamous NSCLC patients with EGFR sensitizing mutation
      who failed EGFR TKI therapy. The primary endpoint of the study is measured by 1-year PFS rate
      in efficacy analysis population.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically or cytologically confirmed, locally advanced (Stage IIIB/C) not
             amenable to curative surgery or radiotherapy, or metastatic (Stage IV) non-squamous
             NSCLC according to American Joint Committee on Cancer, 8th Edition.

          2. Documentation of tumor EGFR sensitizing mutation before EGFR TKI treatment, including
             19del, L858R, G719X, S786I and L861Q.

          3. Disease progression after treatment with an EGFR TKI therapy: 1) Patients previously

             abdominal tapping for drainage within 2 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment.

          5. Active leptomeningeal disease or uncontrolled brain metastasis.

             other immunosuppressive medication that may affect study treatment estimated by
             investigator.

         11. Severe chronic or active infections requiring systemic antibacterial, antifungal or
             antiviral therapy.

         12. With a history of interstitial lung disease, non-infectious pneumonitis, or
             uncontrolled systemic diseases, including diabetes, hypertension, pulmonary fibrosis,
             acute lung diseases, etc.

         13. Any major surgical procedure requiring general anesthesia ≤ 28 days before initiation
             of study treatment.

         14. Underlying medical conditions (including laboratory abnormalities) or alcohol or drug
             abuse or dependence that would be unfavorable for the administration of study drug or
             affect the explanation of drug toxicity or AEs (Adverse Events) or result in
             insufficient or might impair compliance with study conduct.
