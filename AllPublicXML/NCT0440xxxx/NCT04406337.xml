      To compare the effects of low intensity pulsed ultrasound with high intensity continuous
      ultrasound in knee osteoarthritis
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Knee osteoarthritis is a common disorder affecting elderly and obese. Currently, there are 3
      types of treatment; pharmacological, non-pharmacological and surgery. Though ultrasound, a
      non-pharmacological treatment, is increasingly used in knee osteoarthritis, the advantages
      and disadvantages of low intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) and high intensity continuous
      ultrasound (HICUS) are yet to be clarified. Therefore, a randomized control trial will be
      done to compare LIPUS and HICUS in participants with knee osteoarthritis presenting to
      Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Yangon General Hospital, Myanmar.

    <description>This index measures clinically important symptoms of pain, stiffness and function. It consists of 23 questions (5 pain, 2 stiffness and 16 physical function) and the maximum score is 100, indicating the worst outcome while the minimum score is 0, indicating the best outcome.</description>
