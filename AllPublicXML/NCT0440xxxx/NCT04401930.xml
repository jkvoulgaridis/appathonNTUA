  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aging is characterized by low-grade inflammatory state, supported by impairment oxidative
      balance and endocrine changes, leading to changes in: body composition, such as decrease in
      lean body mass and increase in adipose tissue; resting metabolic rate; immune function;
      cognitive impairment. According to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics all subjects over
      the age of 60 should be able to access to adequate nutrition and appropriate nutritional
      services.

      In order to ensure healthy aging and to reduce effects of specific diseases, recommendations
      are needed for illness and disability in this population, as well as adequate physical
      activity and specific support programs, culturally accepted.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate eating habits in term of food consumption, health state
      and lifestyle in a sample of free-living elderly over the age of 65, living in Milan and
      surroundings.

      In particular, profiling of the elderly population is performed using a survey in which
      information are collected on methods, contexts, time and ability to buy, prepare, consume and
      dispose of and recycle food. Eating habits and knowledge about food are detected through the
      analysis of food consumption frequencies, and lifestyle by assessing the level of physical
      activity, quality of sleep, smoking habit. Weight status and health status are evaluated
      through anthropometric measurements, body composition (bioelectrical impedance) and strength
      test.

      Other information relating to social participation and other socio-demographic variables
      (age, gender, family composition, socio-economic status) are collected to have a completed
      profiling of target population.

      Achieved results will help us to identify factors on which acting to ensure healthy aging and
      counteract inflammaging, the chronic low-grade systemic inflammation characteristic in the
      aging process.

      Moreover, the study allows increasing the knowledge related to the needs and requirements of
      the target population to determine a good food policy and to increase the elderly
      empowerment.

    <textblock>
      The study concerns the elderly population of the Milan Metropolitan Area. The aim is to
      identify and interpret the nutritional needs of the target population and thus implement the
      quality of life and the nutritional status of citizens through the evaluation of the dietary
      habits, health status and lifestyle of the elderly free-living.

      The information is collected through a questionnaire consisting of 6 sections and includes
      batteries of questions and scales already validated in the literature: i) access to the
      points of sale; ii) consumer behavior; iii) eating habits; iv) opinions regarding
      accessibility; v) state of health, physical activity and sleep quality; vi) other
      socio-demographic information. The collected data will allow to identify different profiles
      of elderly people with respect to the investigated dimensions and to estimate the influence
      of different factors on eating habits and health status.

      To complete the information collected with the questionnaire, functional and anthropmetric
      parameters are detected which are useful to complete the nutritional assessment of the target
      population. Specifically, the muscle strength, body composition, body weight, height, body
      circumferences, plicometry are measured, and the antripometric indices waist-height
      circumference ratio, waist-hip circumference ratio and arm muscle area are calculated.

      SAMPLE SIZE: Based on the data on the population residing on 1 January 2017 from an Istat
      source, the residents of the metropolitan city of Milan aged 65 and over are 722703. The
      sample size was defined with the choice of a confidence level of 95% and of a confidence
      interval of 4%.

    <description>Eating habits: evaluated with the Food Habit (FHQ) section of questionnaire by Turconi et al. (2003), to investigate the eating habits related to daily number of meals, consumption of the main food groups (fruit, vegetables, etc) and soft drinks or alcoholic beverages. Each question has the following response: always, often, sometimes, never. The score assigned to each response ranged from 0 to 3, with the maximum score assigned to the healthiest one and the minimum score to the least healthy one according to the Italian National Dietary Guidelines (2018).</description>
