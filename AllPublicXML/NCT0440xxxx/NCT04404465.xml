  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (also known as AFib or AF) is the most common abnormal heart rhythm and
      results in an irregular beating of the heart. Currently, there is no way of identifying
      patients at most risk for the development or progression of AFib or those that will best
      respond to treatment. The purpose of this study is to improve our understanding of AFib and
      to find new ways of identifying those patients most at risk for developing AFib, have
      progressive AFib or be less responsive to treatment. For this reason, the investigators are
      studying imaging, blood, and digital markers that may contribute to AFib

      Subjects will receive mobile devices (such as an AliveCor or similar device) for remote
      electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring. Additionally, subjects will use features using a
      smartphone research app (on the Eureka Research Platform) to monitor other important things
      such as activity, sleep, heart rate and others as they are developed. All subjects will
      receive serial blood draws and saliva sample collections once a year. Subjects will also
      undergo annual imaging in the form of an echocardiogram (Echo). Evaluations will be taken at
      baseline and once a year for three years from the baseline visit. Additionally, electronic
      surveys will be administered periodically (eVisits occurring every 3-6 months) using the
      mobile app.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, longitudinal, observational cohort study. 3000 subjects are planned
      to be enrolled. Each subject will be consented, enrolled and assigned to a group based on AF
      diagnosis (AF Group, AF Risk Group and Control Group). All subjects will be given mobile
      devices (such as an AliveCor or similar device) for remote ECG monitoring. Additionally,
      sleep and activity can be monitored through a smartphone app (on the Eureka Research
      Platform). All subjects will receive serial blood draws and saliva sample collections to
      collect serum, plasma, whole blood, DNA and RNA in order to observe/identify any changes in
      blood-borne AF markers. Subjects will also undergo serial imaging in the form of an Echo to
      observe/identify markers and/or changes in cardiovascular structure and functioning.
      Evaluations will be taken at baseline and once a year for three years from their baseline
      visit. Additionally, electronic surveys will be administered periodically (eVisits occurring
      every 3-6 months) using the mobile app to observe any changes in participant reported
      symptoms.

      Any participant who receives an AF ablation as part of clinical care will additionally
      receive one in-person follow-up three months post-ablation procedure and an electronic survey
      one month post-ablation procedure to observe changes in symptoms after ablation.

      Subjects will be followed for at least 3 years. The total duration of the study is expected
      to be at least 10 years. It is expected that it will take 3-4 years for subject recruitment
      and at least 3 years for subject follow-up (3 yearly in-person visits), but anticipate the
      digital follow-up to go beyond that (at least 10 years of digital follow-up)

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Incident AF [At Risk Group]</measure>
    <time_frame>10 years</time_frame>
    <description>Incident AF is defined as the development of a new onset AF in subjects who do not have a previous AF diagnosis. This will be evaluated by detection of arrhythmias by use of ambulatory ECG monitoring and will be diagnosed by an automated algorithm that detects irregularly irregular rhythms. A random 50% of events will be overread by a cardiologist.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression of AF [AF Group]</measure>
    <time_frame>10 years</time_frame>
    <description>Progression of AF is defined as increase in AF burden which is the amount of time spent in AF over the course of one month as determined by use of ambulatory ECG monitoring and will be diagnosed by an automated algorithm that detects irregularly irregular rhythms. A random 50% of events will be overread by a cardiologist.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Recurrence of AF after treatment with direct current cardioversion (DCCV) or AF ablation [AF Group]</measure>
    <time_frame>10 years</time_frame>
    <description>Recurrence of AF will be evaluated by use of ambulatory ECG monitoring and will be diagnosed by an automated algorithm that detects irregularly irregular rhythms. A random 50% of events will be overread by a cardiologist.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Symptom Burden [AF Group]</measure>
    <time_frame>10 years</time_frame>
    <description>Symptom Burden will be scored by use of the University of Toronto Atrial Fibrillation Symptom Severity Scale (AFSS) which includes seven questions for subjects to report severity of symptoms (i.e. palpitations, chest pain/discomfort, shortness of breath at rest/physical activity, exercise intolerance, fatigue at rest, and lightheadedness/dizziness) on a Likert scale from 0 (subject did not have this symptom) to 5 (symptom bothers subject a great deal). Total Symptom Burden score is a sum of these seven questions and can range from 0 to 35 with a higher score indicating greater burden.</description>
