      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of ropidoxuridine and how well it
      works when added to the usual chemotherapy treatment (capecitabine) during radiation therapy
      for the treatment of patients with stage II-III rectal cancer. Ropidoxuridine may help
      radiation therapy work better by making cancer cells more sensitive to the radiation therapy.
      Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as capecitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth
      of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping
      them from spreading. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink
      tumors. This study is being done to find out whether ropidoxuridine in addition to
      capecitabine and radiation therapy works better in treating patients with rectal cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of twice daily (BID) oral (PO)
      ropidoxuridine (IPdR) when administered with capecitabine (825 mg/m^2 BID) and radiation
      therapy (RT) (50.4 Gy in 28 fractions).

      II. To determine the toxicities Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)
      version (v) 5 of the combined modality therapy, IPdR + capecitabine + RT.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To establish the pharmacokinetics (PK) of BID IPdR when combined with capecitabine.

      II. To evaluate iododeoxyuridine (IUdR) incorporation in circulating granulocytes and
      correlate these levels with IPdR plasma PK and clinical/laboratory toxicities.

      III. To assess IUdR incorporation in tumor cells obtained from the surgical resection
      specimen and correlate IUdR incorporation in tumor cells with IPdR PK.

      IV. To assess IUdR incorporation in tumor cells obtained from the surgical resection specimen
      and correlate IUdR incorporation in tumor cells with tumor response as measured by
      pathological complete response (pCR) rate and neoadjuvant rectal (NAR) score.

      V. To determine the pCR rate of IPdR + capecitabine + RT at the IPdR MTD as a measure of
      anti-tumor activity.

      VI. To determine the NAR score of IPdR + capecitabine + RT at the IPdR MTD.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase IA, dose-escalation study of ropidoxuridine followed by a phase IB
      study.

      Patients receive ropidoxuridine PO BID over 7 days per week and capecitabine PO BID over 6
      days per week for 6 weeks. Patients also undergo radiation therapy over 1 fraction per day
      for 5 days per week (Monday-Friday) during weeks 1-5 and for 3 days during week 6 in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Approximately 8-12 weeks after
      completion of treatment with ropidoxuridine, capecitabine, and radiation therapy, patients
      undergo standard of care surgery.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 and 8-12 weeks following
      chemoradiation therapy.

             are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP)* and men must
             agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control;
             abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. WOCBP
             must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to
             enrollment. If urine pregnancy results are positive or cannot be confirmed as
             negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required. Should a woman become pregnant or
             suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she
             should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this
             protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the
             duration of study participation, and 4 months after completion of IPdR administration

               -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) is defined as any female who has
                  experienced menarche and who has not undergone surgical sterilization
                  (hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy) or who is not postmenopausal. Menopause
                  is defined clinically as 12 months of amenorrhea in a woman over 45 in the
                  absence of other biological or physiological causes

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.
             Participants with impaired decision-making capacity (IDMC) who have a
             legally-authorized representative (LAR) and/or family member available will also be
             eligible

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have not recovered from adverse events due to prior mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy
             (i.e., have residual toxicities &gt; grade 1) with the exception of alopecia

          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents

          -  Patients with impaired gastrointestinal (GI) function or GI disease that may
             significantly alter the absorption of oral IPdR and capecitabine (e.g. ulcerative
             disease, uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption syndrome, or small
             bowel resection). Patients with active inflammatory bowel disease (i.e., patients
             requiring current medical interventions or who are symptomatic) or have a history of
             abdominal surgery or other medical condition that may, in the opinion of the treating
             physician, interfere with GI motility or absorption. Patients with colostomies are
             allowed unless colostomy is for one of the precluded reasons above

          -  Treatment with warfarin is not allowed. However, therapy with heparin, low molecular
             weight heparin (LMWH), and DOACs (direct oral anticoagulating agent) such as
             dabigatran (Pradaxa), rivaroxaban, and apixaban (Eliquis) is allowed

          -  Patients who have received pelvic RT for rectal cancer, or prior pelvic RT for any
             other malignancy that would prevent the patient from receiving the required RT for
             this study

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to IPdR or capecitabine

          -  Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness

          -  Patients with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because IPdR may have the potential for
             teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk
             for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with IPdR,
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with IPdR. These
             potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study

          -  Patients that received live vaccines within 30 days prior to the first dose of trial
             treatment and while participating in the trial. Examples of live vaccines include, but
             are not limited to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster, yellow
             fever, rabies, bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal flu

             Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a
             form of systemic treatment

          -  History of active TB (Bacillus tuberculosis)

          -  Active or chronic infection requiring systemic therapy

          -  Diagnosis of immunodeficiency or receiving systemic steroid therapy or any other form
             of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of study therapy.
             The use of physiologic doses of corticosteroids may be approved after consultation
             with the study principal investigator (PI)

          -  Active seizure disorder uncontrolled by medication

          -  Synchronous colon cancer
