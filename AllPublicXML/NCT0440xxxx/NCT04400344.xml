      Podimetrics is a care management company with a temperature-based foot monitoring solution to
      help prevent diabetic foot ulcers, one of the most debilitating and costly complications of
      diabetes.

      Diabetes educators within the AADE/ADCES encompass a wide array of medical disciplines
      including nurses, physicians, dieticians, and pharmacists. Diabetes researchers want to
      better understand the degree to which diabetic foot care and prevention is incorporated into
      the diabetes education curriculum. To what extent are these topics discussed between diabetes
      educators and the patients they interact with? And how comfortable are educators in
      discussing these topics?

      To gain insight into these questions Podimetrics researchers have designed an online
      questionnaire survey for completion by AADE members. The general purpose of the survey is to
      assess the knowledge base, role in management, and resources available to diabetes educators
      regarding foot complication prevention within a variety of healthcare settings.

      The specific aim is to collect generalizable data to characterize the current state of
      diabetic foot education and identify any gaps in knowledge that may be present. Furthermore,
      if it is found that educators are lacking important knowledge which supports ample diabetic
      foot health education, approaches to bridge these gaps may be suggested through published
      recommendations.

    <ipd_description>To protect the respondent's identity, respondent name and email address will not be recorded within the survey results. No demographic data other than relevant profession, work environment, and number of years as a certified educator will be collected. Additionally, the AADE will not share respondent's name or email addresses with Podimetrics, and the AADE will not have access to the individual survey results, effectively detaching individual results from respondents' identities.</ipd_description>
