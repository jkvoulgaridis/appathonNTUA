  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Trichloroacetic acid 85% =TCA is an investigational device intended to achieve a complete
      histologic remission in individuals with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 1/2.
      The device system is to be used only in accordance with the approved Investigational Plan on
      subjects, who have given written informed consent.

      High remission and regression rates are expected after a single topical treatment with 85%
      TCA. After a single topical treatment with 85% TCA for CIN 1-2 (Expected 70% or higher; null
      hypothesis: not higher than 55%). Regression is defined as improvement from high grade lesion
      (CIN 2) at baseline to low grade lesion (CIN 1) after TCA treatment. Regression from CIN 1
      normal squamous epithelium after the TCA treatment is equal to remission and will be counted
      as a remission in combined analysis. Remission is defined as complete histologic remission of
      CIN back to normal squamous epithelium after the TCA treatment, i.e., no cervical dysplasia
      is detectable by histology or cytology after the TCA treatment. Type-specific HPV Clearance
      is defined as disappearance of the HPV type detected at screening.
