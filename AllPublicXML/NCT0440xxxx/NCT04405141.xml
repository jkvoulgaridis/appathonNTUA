  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aimed to evaluate the relationship between LUTS and vitamin D with
      uroflowmetry parameters in female patients. They found no relation between vitamin D levels
      and LUTS in respect to uroflowmetry. However, in low vitamin D patients, Ca is related with
      urologic problems. The investigators believe that there is a need for studies emphasizing
      serum Ca levels in addition to vitamin D levels in patients with LUTS.

      This retrospective cohort study included 186 female patients who admitted to LUTS.
      Demographic characteristics, medical history, calcium (Ca) and vitamin D including laboratory
      studies and uroflowmetry results as maximum urine flow rate (Qmax), average urine flow rate
      (Qav), and voided volume (V) were recorded. Patients were divided into two groups according
      to age (18-50 and ≥51) and vitamin D levels (&lt;20 and ≥20).

      Laboratory parameters, uroflowmetry results, were compared between groups.

      The study was approved by the local ethics committee
      (approval#22/06/2018-09.29-54132726-000-14136). The study was conducted in accordance to the
      Helsinki Declaration and Good Clinical Practices Guidelines.
