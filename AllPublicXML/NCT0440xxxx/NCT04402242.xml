  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Physiological Monitoring Device (PMD-200™) system is comprised of a monitor and a
      designated finger probe containing 4 sensors. The sensors included are Photoplethysmography
      (PPG), Galvanic Skin Response (GSR), Accelerometer for movement (ACC) and Thermistor for
      peripheral temperature (TMP).

      The PMD-200 is intended to be used for assessing the nociception level in anesthetized
      patients.

      The purpose of the study is confirmation of a reduction in the dosage of remifentanil allowed
      by the monitoring of nociception by the NOL which could open the way to a double control of
      the administration of anesthetic agents: control of the administration of hypnotics by the
      bispectral index (BIS) and control of the administration of opiate by the NOL.

      The Physiological Monitoring Device (PMD-200™), MEDASENSE® Biometrics Ltd, Ramat Gan, Israel)
      is comprised of a monitor and a designated finger probe containing 4 sensors. The sensors
      included are Photoplethysmography (PPG), Galvanic Skin Response (GSR), Accelerometer for
      movement (ACC) and Thermistor for peripheral temperature (TMP).

      The PMD-200™ is intended to be used for assessing the nociception level in anesthetized
      patients. The device is European Conformity (CE) marked and commercially available.

      Meier et al. recently published a randomized trial involving 80 patients for major abdominal
      surgery, one group receiving routine care and the other NOL-guided analgesia. In the latter
      group, the remifentanil concentration was reduced when NOL values were below 10 or increased
      when NOL values were above 25 for at least 1 minute. In both groups, propofol was titrated to
      have bispectral index values between 45 and 55. Remifentanil administration was reduced in
      the NOL-guided group: 0.119 ± 0.033 vs 0.086 ± 0.032 μg.kg.min (p &lt; 0.001). In the NOL-
      guided group, 2 out of 40 (5%) patients had hypotension (mean blood pressure less than 55 mm
      Hg) compared to 11 out of 40 (28%) in the control group (p = 0.006) and 16 out of 40 (40%)
      patients received vasoactive drugs vs 25 out of 40 (63%) (p = 0.044).

      Previous results cover a small number of patients treated in a single center. They need to be
      confirmed by a multicenter study involving a larger group of patients. That is the purpose of
      this study. Confirmation of a reduction in the dosage of remifentanil allowed by the
      monitoring of nociception by the NOL will open the way to a double control of the
      administration of anesthetic agents: control of the administration of hypnotics by the
      bispectral index (BIS) and control of the administration of opiate by the NOL.
