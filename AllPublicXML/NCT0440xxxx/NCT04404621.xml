  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate and compare how 18-weeks of computer-based brain
      training and physical exercise together can improve physical performance, cognitive function
      and mood in older adults in a cross-over design with participants randomized to receive the
      intervention first and then be assessed before and after an 18 week period without
      intervention, or the reverse sequence.

      The aim of this study is to investigate and compare how 18-weeks of computer-based brain
      training and physical exercise together can improve physical performance, cognitive function
      and mood in older adults in a cross-over design with participants randomized to receive the
      intervention first and then be assessed before and after an 18 week period without
      intervention, or the reverse sequence. 80 adults between the ages of 65 and 105 years old
      will be invited to participate. After providing informed consent, in the case of subjects who
      are living on units for individuals with memory or other cognitive compromise, after assent
      from the individual and approval from facility staff, subjects will be randomly assigned to
      either receive the intervention for 18 weeks and then be followed for an additional 18 weeks,
      or to be followed for 18 weeks without intervention and then do the intervention for 18
      weeks. The intervention will consist of 18 weeks of 60-minute PE sessions 3-4 times/week and
      25-minute CBB training sessions 3-4 times a week.

      There will be 3 assessments of participants: before and after the first 18-week period and
      then again after the second 18-week period. Assessments will be done in 2 sessions over a
      total of 90 minutes and will include demographic, health, physical activity and social
      activity questionnaires as well as the self-report measures of cognitive function, emotional
      state and weekly activities; quantitative assessments of physical balance, strength,
      flexibility blood pressure and heart rate; and tests of cognitive function. Subject
      medications will be recorded at each assessment. The wait-list control group will receive the
      same assessments at the same time points.

    <description>Composite from: Flanker Test of Attention; Go/No-Go Test of Response Inhibition; List Sort Working Memory Test; Logical Memory Story Recall; Digit symbol coding; Digit Span Forwards and Backwards; Hopkin's Verbal Learning Test; Trail Making B; Stroop Color Word; Category Verbal Fluency; Reaction Time.
A composite score will be calculated for each participant at baseline and after training and waitlist periods by first determining Z-scores for each test for each participant at each time point based on means and standard deviations for the entire sample at baseline, and then averaging the individual's Z-scores at that time point.</description>
