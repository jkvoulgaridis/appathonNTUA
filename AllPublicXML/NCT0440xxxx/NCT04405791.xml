  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The non-invasive type ultrasonography system is applied to patients with major depressive
      disorder to evaluate their effectiveness and safety. Brain Computer Tomography(CT) and
      Magnetic Resonance Image(MRI) are taken to induce images before transcranial low intensity
      focused ultrasonic stimulation.

      Through random extraction, the group is divided into treatment group and placebo group. The
      treatment is started by targeting left Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex(DLPFC) region according
      to assigned groups. As for women, considering mood change during menstrual cycle, the
      treatment is taken place 1 week after the menstruation has initiated. The treatment group and
      the placebo group will be treated three times a week for two weeks.

      To evaluate clinical symptoms, Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report,
      Scale for Suicidal Ideation, state-trait anxiety scale, frontal lobe management function
      test, memory test, and continuous performance test are performed before, during, and after
      treatment. For the assessment of side effects, Systematic Asseseement for Treatment Emergent
      Events-General Inquiry(SAFTEE) are conducted for treatment presentation events every week
      during the treatment implementation period and every two weeks after the treatment is
      completed.

    <description>&quot;low intensity transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) stimulation&quot;The acoustic intensity output of the FUS transducer was validated at the maximum intensity area using a calibrated needle hydrophone (HNR-500, Onda). The incident acoustic intensity and pressure at the FUS focus were 3W/cm2 spatial-peak pulse-average acoustic intensity (Isppa) and a peak negative pressure (Pr) of 300 kPa. The incident acoustic intensity and pressure at the FUS focus were 3W/cm2, and tone burst duration was 1 ms at 50 % duty cycle (thus, pulse repletion frequency was 500 Hz) for the duration of 300 ms, according to the studies in humans. Each sonication was delivered every 6 s for the duration of 20 min (a total FUS stimulation per each session was therefore 200 times). With a derating factor of 55% reduction in pressure transmission by the human skull, estimated in situ Pr was ~135 kPa with an in situ acoustic intensity of 600 mW/cm2 Isppa .</description>

    <description>Participants are randomly assigned to either treatment group or sham group for application of transcranial low intensity focused ultrasound stimulation. For sham group, transducer is surrounded by rubber band in order to block the transmission of ultrasonic wave.
Before initiating transcranial low intensity focused ultrasonic stimulation, in order to identify anatomical structure of the brain, Brain Magnetic Resonance Image(MRI) and Computer Tomography(CT) will be taken. For image coordination, multi-modal stick(fiducial marker, PinPoint) will be attached to the participant.
With acquired brain images of the participant, researchers identify participant's dorsolateral prefrontal cortex(DLPFC) region, and design focused ultrasound focus targeting, image-guidance method.
The treatment is started by targeting left DLPFC region according to assigned groups. Both the treatment and sham group will be under procedure for 2 weeks, 3 times a week.</description>
