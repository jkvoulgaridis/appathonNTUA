    <textblock>
      Depression during pregnancy can cause fetal and maternal problems such as growth restriction,
      preterm labor, low birthweight, poor compliance and suicide. Since antidepressant medications
      have the potential to harm the baby, but since treatment of intrapartum depression is
      essential to maternal and fetal wellbeing, a non-pharmacological approach would be ideal.
      This project seeks to apply infrared light noninvasively to depressed patients during
      pregnancy in order to treat their depressive symptoms through alteration of mitochondrial
      function and modulation of neural cell receptors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression is common in pregnancy and affects about 70% of women and, for many women,
      pregnancy can lead to their first episode of major depression. Complications of intrapartum
      depression include intrauterine growth restriction, preterm labor, low birthweight,
      gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, decreased prenatal follow-up and suicide. For this
      reason, the standard of care has been to screen for depression during pregnancy and treat
      this illness, reducing maternal and fetal morbidity. Unfortunately, many first-line
      pharmacological approaches, such as serotonin reuptake inhibitors, may cause fetal
      malformations, persistent pulmonary hypertension and withdrawal syndrome. Thus, a
      non-pharmacological approach, without risk of fetal complications, would be ideal. We propose
      here a photobiomodulation based approach that uses non-ionizing near-infrared light (IRL) to
      upregulate mitochondrial function (through modulation of cytochrome c oxidase activity),
      which in-turn increase neurosteroid production and modulates GABAA receptor activity, thus
      alleviating depression. We will perform a pilot study using IRL for the treatment of
      intrapartum depression. While other trials have shown success using IRL for depression in
      non-pregnant patients, we will confirm that photobiomodulation can modulate mitochondrial
      function and mitigate depressive symptoms compared to untreated controls in pregnancy by
      using real-time app-based depression scoring system and neuroimaging.
