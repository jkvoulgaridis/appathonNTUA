  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the work is to evaluate, in the French health care system, the
      performance of early ultrasound screening for severe heart disease between 11 and 14SA in
      high-risk populations.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Numerous studies have shown a link between increased nuchal translucency and heart disease.
      Although high-risk fetal populations are identified between 11 and 13 SA on clinical and
      biological criteria and by screening ultrasound (Echo T1), cardiac morphology analysis is
      routinely performed only during 2nd trimester fetal morphology ultrasound between 18 and 22
      SA (EchoMorpho-T2) inducing a difficult wait for the couple.

      The development of increasingly efficient ultrasound probes has made it possible to explore
      the foetal heart at an earlier stage. International learned societies recommend an early
      morphological examination with heart-centered slices before 14 weeks in high-risk situations.
      This practice is not systematic in France and no study has evaluated its feasibility and
      impact in a French care network.

    <description>Women whose fetus is at high risk of congenital heart disease at the end of the 1st trimester screening ultrasound (EchoT1), will benefit from an early heart-centered morphological ultrasound (EchoMorpho-T1) by a referring sonographer between 11 and 14 SA +/- an early fetal cardiac ultrasound (EchoCoeur-T1) between 11 and 15 SA by a cardio-paediatrician in case of EchoMorpho-T1 abnormality.
The results of the early morphological and cardiac ultrasounds will be compared with those of the 2nd trimester ultrasound at 18-22SA (EchoMorpho-T2) and +/- of the fetal cardiac ultrasound between 18SA and 24SA (Gold standard) or, failing this, with the anatomopathological examination when it is available if a medical termination of pregnancy took place before the EchoMorpho-T2.</description>
