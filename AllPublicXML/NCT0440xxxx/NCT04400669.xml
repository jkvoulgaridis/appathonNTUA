  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This RCT aims to investigate the real surgical effects of MBP prior to the gynecological
      laparoscopic surgeries. Those effects include lowest pneumoperitoneum pressure, lowest
      Trendelenburg inclination angle, the ease of the surgical view and the preferences of the
      patients with objective measures.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mechanical bowel preparation (MBP) has been routinely used prior to minimally invasive
      gynaecologic procedures (MIGP) hypothetically to improve intraoperative bowel handling and
      visualization of the surgical field, and also to reduce faecal contamination in the setting
      of bowel injury and/or resection.

      The studies investigating the effect of MBP on MIGP are limited and most of existing data are
      extrapolated from the reports of colorectal and urological surgery studies.

      Besides, evaluation of the surgical workspace visualization and intraoperative bowel handling
      are far from being objective since they were mostly measured by a 4/5/10-point Likert scales
      or rated verbally on scales of excellent to poor by the operating surgeons.

      In contrary, it is planned to use objective visualize index, and objective surgical
      conditions to measure whether MBP has any effect or not.

    <time_frame>After the introduce of first left lateral port</time_frame>
    <description>A scale title as &quot;Objective Visual Indexing (OVI)&quot; will be used for assessing the visibility of the Douglas pouch and adnexa. The assessment of the visibility of Douglas pouch and adnexa will be performed under standard pneumoperitoneum pressure (12mmHg) and Trendelenburg inclincation angle (30). After the first Inspection, scale of VI scoring will be calculated by adding up the points obtained from optical inspection. Higher scores mean better visuality of the surgical field.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The lowest pneumoperitoneum pressure (PP) at standard Trendelenburg inclination angle (TIA).</measure>
    <time_frame>In the initial phase of the surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The PP will be increased to 15 mmHg while keeping the TIA same, at 30o. The surgeon will displace the bowel beginning from the cecum followed by the last ileal loop above the sacral promontory. Once the bowel was displaced out of the pelvis, the PP will be stepwise decreased by 1 mmHg during 1 min intervals to the lowest pressure where the bowel is to descend towards the pelvis over the pelvic brim and/or where the surgical workspace is not adequate to proceed safely with the planned operation. This value will be recorded as the lowest PP adequate to proceed safely with the planned surgery at standard TIA (30 degree).</description>

    <time_frame>In the initial phase of the surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The PP obtained in outcome 2 will be readjusted to the standard 12 mmHg keeping the TIA same, at 300. Then, the surgeon will replace the bowel beginning from the cecum followed by the last ileal loop above the sacral promontory. Once the bowel is displaced out of the pelvis, the TIA will be gradually decreased by 1o with 15 seconds intervals to the degree where the bowel is to descend towards the pelvis over the pelvic brim. This value will be recorded as the lowest TIA adequate to proceed safely with the planned surgery at standard PP (12 mmHg).</description>

    <description>Patients will be interviewed in the preoperative holding area or in the patient's room about the acceptability of the intervention (MBP / diet) and adverse pre-operative events, including: nausea, insomnia, headache, thirst, weakness, tiredness, discomfort, abdominal cramps, sleep disturbances. These symptoms will be scored with using a 10-cm &quot;Visual Analog Score&quot; (VAS). Higher scores mean worse outcome.</description>
