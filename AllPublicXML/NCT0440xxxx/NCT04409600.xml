  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Exertional Compartment Syndrome (CECS) in the lower leg is a debilitating condition
      in highly active individuals. Pain occurs in 1 or several leg compartments upon an exertional
      activity, typically running, that quickly dissipates once the activity stopped. Surgical
      fasciotomy is the standard for treating lower leg CECS, but success is variable.
      Complications may occur post-surgery and there is a potential for a repeat procedure.
      Recovery times post-surgery also vary greatly. Conservative treatments, such as gait
      retraining and botulinum toxin injections, are emerging as non-surgical options for the
      treatment of CECS with success through published case reports and case series. This study
      aims to evaluate the use of these non-surgical treatment options for CECS in the anterior and
      lateral leg compartments with a follow up for at least 2 years across multiple study sites.
