  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective, randomized comparative study using a mixed methods design. The
      primary objective is to compare the effect of self-regulated simulation training (SRST) to
      instructor-regulated simulation training (IRST) in basic laparoscopic skills. The study
      population is first-year trainees in the specialties General Surgery, Urology and Obstetrics
      and Gynaecology within the postgraduate training region of northern Denmark. 46 first-year
      trainees will be randomized into two groups, one receiving SRST and one receiving IRST in
      basic laparoscopic skills.

    <description>Participants allocated to the SRST arm train basic laparoscopic skills at home. Participants train by themselves using a portable box training model (BT). Training is conducted and structured through an online application-based training platform. Training is instructed by online instructional videos and texts. The BT is connected to a laptop and the participants can submit videos of their training exercises for assessment through the online training platform.</description>
