  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II study to evaluate efficacy of Acalabrutinib as a maintenance therapy
      following blood or marrow transplant (BMT) in patients who have been diagnosed with mantle
      cell lymphoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is one of approximately 100 different types of non-Hodgkin's
      lymphoma (NHL). Due to the aggressive and heterogeneous nature of MCL, majority of patients
      are diagnosed with advanced stage disease that requires immediate, diverse and aggressive
      courses of therapy to improve the outcome of the disease. The addition of blood or bone
      marrow transplantation (BMT) to the chemotherapy regimens is a critical factor to prolong
      duration of response in patients, however, the benefit of combination chemotherapy followed
      by BMT is often temporary as patients experience disease progression and mortality and this
      underscores the need for novel therapies as well as additional maintenance therapy strategies
      to prevent relapse post-BMT.

      Acalabrutinib, a selective, irreversible small molecule inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase
      (BTK) is approved for the treatment of adult patients with MCL who have received at least 1
      prior therapy

      This study is a single arm, multi-center, phase 2 study of subjects who will receive
      acalabrutinib as maintenance therapy post-BMT. Subjects will undergo a standard of care BMT
      with conditioning regimen determined by the treating physician per institutional
      guidelines.The BMT is not considered part of this study. Following completion of the BMT,
      Maintenance therapy with acalabrutinib will begin on Day 100 in 28-day cycles. Subjects will
      self-administer 100 mg acalabrutinib BID until they reach 2 years post-BMT (approximately 22
      cycles).Subjects will be followed for up to 5 years post-BMT for Progression Free Survival.
