  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The association of diabetes mellitus type 2 (T2DM) with sarcopenia has not been adequately
      investigated. Sarcopenia is characterized by progressive and generalized loss of skeletal
      muscle mass which may affect performance.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The relationship between DM and sarcopenia has not been extensively investigated. Skeletal
      muscle is the primary site of glucose deposition, and decreased muscle mass plays a role in
      impaired glucose metabolism in patients with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Skeletal
      muscle resistance to insulin action appears to be the link between type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and
      sarcopenia. Hyperglycemia is a metabolic dysfunction which can potentially damage muscle
      cells. Insulin deficiency leads to marked muscle catabolism that can be reversed by exogenous
      insulin administration.

      The metabolic disorder in diabetics may be reversible.Thus, it may be possible to restore
      physical ability by restoring the musculoskeletal system.Therefore, the diagnosis of
      sarcopenia if made can lead to interventions which may prevent the deterioration of body
      composition and the subsequent deterioration of quality of life. According to the results of
      the aforementioned studies it is still inconclusive if the metabolic disorder in diabetes may
      be related to sarcopenia, or sarcopenia may be a consequence of diabetes.

        A group of 36 patients, aged 20-80 years old, 18 male and 17 female with type 2 diabetes
        mellitus, and a control group with the same demographic characteristics, participated in
        the study. All were previously examined by an endocrinologist (in a public hospital,
        private or university outpatient clinic) from March to July 2018. The control group
        consisted of 14 community people who visited the endocrinology outpatient hospital clinic
        for a routine checkup, or with a non-related to diabetes disease.
