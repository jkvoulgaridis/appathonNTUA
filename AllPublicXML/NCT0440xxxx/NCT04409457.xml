  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study examines the influence of acute fasting and eating on self-control in adult
      females with and without bulimia nervosa (BN). Specifically, the study team is investigating
      whether differences in behavior and brain activation in response to computer tasks after
      fasting and after eating a meal could help to explain the symptoms of bulimia nervosa. Data
      will be collected using questionnaires and a technology called magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment-resistant binge eating and purging may be perpetuated by self-control deficits
      linked to reduced activation in frontostriatal circuits. To date, however, neurocognitive
      studies of BN have not assessed the dynamic computational processes underlying inhibition or
      considered the fact that individuals with BN oscillate between two extremes—under-controlled
      and over-controlled intake. The proposed study combines neuroimaging with computational
      modeling to investigate the influences of acute fasting and eating (i.e., metabolic states)
      on how the brains of women with bulimia nervosa (BN) adaptively prepare for and exert
      inhibitory control. More specifically, the study has the following main objectives: 1) To
      determine whether eating and fasting affect adaptive inhibitory control and related
      frontostriatal activation abnormally in BN; 2) To identify associations of BN severity with
      state-specific frontostriatal activation and behavior.
