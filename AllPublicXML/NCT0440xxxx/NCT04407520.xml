  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the survival of direct anterior and/or posterior composite
      restoration placed in general anesthesia in permanent teeth of adult patients with
      intellectual and/or physical disabilities. Further aim is to identify potential risk factors
      predicting repeated dental treatment under general anesthesia.

      Survival of composite restorations placed under general anesthesia in adult patients with
      intellectual and/or physical disabilities between 2011 and 2019 will be retrospectively
      analysed. Failure is defined as the need for replacement of at least one surface of the
      original restoration or extraction of the tooth. Individual-, tooth- and restoration-related
      factors are obtained from digital and paper-based dental records. Mean annual failure rates
      (mAFR) and median survival time will be calculated (Kaplan-Meier statistics). The effect of
      potential risk factors on failure will be tested using univariate log-rank tests and
      multivariate Cox-regression analysis.

      Adult patients with intellectual and/or physical disabilities who received dental treatment
      under general anesthesia between 2011 and 2017 will be retrospectively analyzed. Demographic,
      anamnestic, oral health and treatment factors will be obtained from digital and paper-based
      dental records. Duration of intervals without a subsequent dental treatment under general
      anesthesia will be assessed using Kaplan-Meier statistics. Potential predictive factors will
      be tested using log-rank tests and multi-variate Cox-regression analysis.
