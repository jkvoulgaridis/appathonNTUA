    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects of infliximab and vedolizumab and to see how
      well they work in treating inflammation of the colon (colitis) caused by immune checkpoint
      inhibitor therapy in patients with cancer of the genital and urinary organs (genitourinary)
      or melanoma. Monoclonal antibodies, such as infliximab or vedolizumab, may help to treat
      immunotherapy induced colitis/diarrhea. This study may help to identify the optimal treatment
      strategy for immune checkpoint inhibitor-related colitis in patients with genitourinary
      cancer or melanoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the efficacy of infliximab and vedolizumab for clinical remission/response of
      immune-related diarrhea/colitis (immune-mediated colitis [IMC]).

      II. To assess the safety and tolerability of IMC treatment.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the efficacy of infliximab and vedolizumab for clinical remission/response of
      IMC at 4 weeks.

      II. To assess the success of corticosteroid tapering. III. To measure the recurrence rate
      after corticosteroid taper.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the efficacy of infliximab and vedolizumab to achieve endoscopic remission of
      immune-related diarrhea/colitis.

      II. To assess the efficacy of infliximab and vedolizumab to achieve histological remission of
      immune-related diarrhea/colitis.

      III. To assess the time duration to achieve the clinical remission/response. IV. To assess
      the long term outcome of cancer. V. To assess immunological, molecular and microbiome changes
      in tissue/blood/stool.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive infliximab intravenously (IV) over 1 hour once at week 0, 2, 6 for a
      total of 3 doses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive vedolizumab IV over 1 hour once at week 0, 2, 6 for a total of 3
      doses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed up weekly for 1 month and then at 2 and 3 months after the treatment.
