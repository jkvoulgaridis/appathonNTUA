  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to evaluate the effect of voxelotor on daily physical activity and sleep
      quality, as measured by a wrist-worn device in participants with sickle cell disease (SCD)
      and chronic moderate anemia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All participants will receive Voxelotor as treatment. There will be approximately 10 sites in
      the US.

      Participant safety and tolerability will be monitored during the study using standard
      measures, including physical examinations, vital signs (including temperature, blood
      pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate and peripheral oxygen saturation [SpO2]), clinical
      laboratory tests, and adverse event (AE) monitoring.

      Screening Period (up to 4 weeks in duration): During this period, participants will sign the
      informed consent form (ICF), after which they will complete the screening assessments as
      detailed in the Schedule of Assessments (SOA).

      Run-in Period (2 weeks in duration): During this period, participants will enter a 2-week
      run-in period (Day 14 to Day -1) during which baseline actigraphy measures of physical
      activity and sleep quality, overnight pulse oximetry assessments of oxygen saturation, and
      PRO assessments will be collected before initiating treatment with voxelotor.

      Treatment Period (24 weeks in duration): After completion of the 14-day Run-in Period,
      participants will enter the open label treatment period and receive voxelotor 1500 mg once
      daily for 24 weeks. Repeat actigraphy assessments of physical activity and sleep quality, and
      overnight pulse oximetry will be performed during the treatment period (Weeks 10 to 12 and
      Weeks 22 to 24). PRO and Clinical Global Impression (CGI) assessments will be completed at
      scheduled study visits. The open-label treatment period is considered the continuous 24 weeks
      of voxelotor treatment from date of first dose (Day 1).

      Follow-up Period (4 weeks in duration): Immediately following the 24-week treatment period,
      participants will enter a 4-week Follow-up Period.
