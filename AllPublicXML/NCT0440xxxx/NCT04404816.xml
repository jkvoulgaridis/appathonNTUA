  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of a mixture of helium with oxygen (heliox) as a breathing gas may be beneficial due
      to its unique physical properties, such as low density and high carbon dioxide (CO2)
      diffusion coefficient. In previous studies in neonates with respiratory failure, conventional
      ventilation with heliox was associated with improved oxygenation and selected respiratory
      parameters. The use of heliox may increase the effectiveness of intermittent nasal positive
      pressure ventilation (NIPPV), but knowledge about the effects of such therapy on newborns is
      limited.The use of non- invasive neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NIV-NAVA) allows
      synchronization and assessment of electrical activity of the diaphragm (EaDI) during heliox
      administration in premature babies with respiratory failure.

      Aim of the study was to assess of the impact of non-invasive ventilation with heliox on
      respiratory function, diaphragm bioelectrical activity, cerebral oxygenation and selected
      vital signs in premature neonates with respiratory failure. 23 neonates â‰¤32 weeks gestational
      age (GA) were enrolled in the study. Patients were eligible for inclusion when ventilated due
      to respiratory failure, and in group 1 (n=12) on NIV as primary modality with oxygen
      requirement of 0.25-0.4 in the first 72 hours of life, or in group 2 (n=11) ready to extubate
      according to the given criteria. Newborns were ventilated with NIV NAVA and standard
      breathing gas (air-oxygen) at baseline. Heliox was introduced for 3 hours, followed by 3
      hours of air-oxygen. NAVA level was kept constant and pulse oximeter oxygen saturation (SpO2)
      kept in range of 90-95%. Recorded parameters included heart rate (HR), SpO2 and cerebral
      tissue oxygenation (StO2). Selected ventilation parameters: peak inspiratory pressure (PIP),
      positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), mean airway pressure (MAP), air leakage during NIV,
      fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) as well as electrical activity of the diaphragm (EaDI
      mean, minimum and maximum) were also acquired. Blood gas analysis was performed in each
      period of the study. Statistical analysis was completed with ANOVA Friedman's test and
      single-factor repeated-measures analysis of variance.
