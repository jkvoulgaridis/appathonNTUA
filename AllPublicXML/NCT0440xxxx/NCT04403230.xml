      The purpose is to evaluate the clinical and biological behavior of full coverage restorations
      on teeth prepared without finish line.

      This prospective study included 149 teeth treated using biologically oriented preparation
      technique (BOPT). The sample (149 teeth) was divided into two groups: Seventy four teeth
      restored with crowns, and 75 teeth supporting fixed partial dentures (FPD). Restorations were
      fabricated with zirconium oxide cores and ceramic coverings. Patients attended regular annual
      check-ups when probe depth, presence of inflammation with bleeding on probing, presence of
      plaque, gingival thickness, marginal stability, biological or mechanical complications, and
      the patient's level of satisfaction were registered.

          -  periodontally healthy or periodontally managed.

          -  patients who had undergone restoration with fixed prostheses (one-piece crowns or
             fixed partial dentures FPDs) in the aesthetic zone (incisors, canines, premolars,
             first molars), which needed to be replaced due to biological, esthetic or some other
             type of problem.
