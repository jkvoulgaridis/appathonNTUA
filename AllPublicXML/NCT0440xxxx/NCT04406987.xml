  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Age related changes in the lumbar spine can lead to narrowing of the spinal canal (spinal
      stenosis) causing leg and back pain. Spinal stenosis can be associated with a misalignment of
      the spine caused by forward slippage of a vertebrae over another. This instability is
      diagnosed using diagnostic imaging. With signs of instability the spine surgeon might choose
      a fusion of the vertebrae. This is a more complex procedure in relation to the simpel
      decompression preformed without instability for spinal stenosis.

      The purpose of this study is to identify characteristics of instability of the lumbar spine
      on diagnostic imaging, and investigate associations with surgical data and patient reported
      outcomes from the National Spine databases from Denmark and Sweden.

      This will support spine surgeons in providing evidence-based surgical treatment for spinal
      stenosis with or without signs of instability

      A multicenter retrospective cohort study of prospectively collected data from national spine
      surgery databases in Denmark and Sweden. This project is a collaboration between sector for
      spine surgery and research Middelfart Hospital and spine surgeons at Örebro Hospital and Lund
      Hospital in Sweden.

      Data subtracted from Danish national spine surgery database, DaneSpine, from Middelfart
      Hospital, and Swedish Spinal Register, SweSpine, from hospitals in Malmö, Lund, Trelleborg
      and Karlskroga.

      Both databases are clinical quality databases with a high responsrate. DaneSpine is
      administered by Danish Society of Spine Surgeons and is managed by secretary of DaneSpine.
      SweSpine is administered by Swedish Society of Spinal Surgeons and managed

      Patients are invited to register when scheduled for surgery. Patients signs informed constent
      and recieves follow-up questionaires 3 and 6 months, one, two, 5 and 10 years post-surgery.
      Questionaires are validated PROM (patient reported outcome measures) and PREM (patient
      reported expirence measures).

      The surgeon is responsible for registering surgical data, including complications and
      reoperations.

      Data relevant for present study will be applied for at the respective societies and managed
      and stored in compliance with General Data Protection Regulation.

      The EasyWiz software (Medical Insight, Chicago, IL, USA) is used for analysis of all MRIs and
      radiographs.

      All imaging will be analyzed by 2 independent examiners. The interobserver reliability will
      be calculated.

      Missing data such as variables reported as missing or non-reported will not be included in
      statistical analyzis.

      Statistics: significance of difference in mean values between groups for continuous normally
      distributed data unpaired t-test. Categorical variables normally distributed:
      Chi-squared/Fishers exact test. Multivariable regression analysis. Kappa statistics for
      interobserver reliability presented in the article.
