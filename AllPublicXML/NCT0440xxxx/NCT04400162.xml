  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a highly prevalent and debilitating mental disorder with a
      high lifetime prevalence of 16-20%. Particularly for people with low socio-economic status,
      the existing and effective treatment options are hard to reach and show weaker effectivities.
      There is a potential to ameliorate depressive symptoms and improve quality of life in persons
      with mild-to-moderate depression by providing access to stimulating computerized trainings.
      Single computerized trainings that target depressive symptoms have been tested in laboratory
      and clinical settings so far. To date, innovative market access and confirmatory studies are
      missing for a large-scale implementation of such trainings. Thereby, the present work will
      foster a digitalized training paradigm (Paced-Auditory Serial Addition Task; PASAT) which was
      previously shown to reduce depressive symptoms, but in a novel innovative and gamified form
      on a tablet-PC handed out to participants. Different versions of the same training paradigm
      that comprise additional game elements will be compared. The feasibility study will gather
      data on effect size estimates of symptom severity reduction, user experience and usage in an
      ecological valid setting.
