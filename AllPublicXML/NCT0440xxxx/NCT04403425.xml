      Evaluating the microcirculation and determining possible correlation of central and
      peripheral measures of tissue perfusion in patients with intraoperative hemodynamic
      challenges undergoing emergency laparotomy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Personalized hemodynamic management, an emerging concept, ensures consistency of
      perioperative hemodynamic targets according to individual physiological status and may be
      managed by computer-based algorithms.

      By identifying incoherence between macro- and microcirculation, we could elaborate the idea
      of an individualized fluid and vasopressor therapy by establishing optimal hemodynamics for
      any given patient.

      Patients undergoing emergency laparotomy for obstruction or perforation of the
      gastrointestinal tract are at a high risk for complications.

      Often suffering from hypovolemia/septicemia and low flow states, effecting the central and
      peripheral perfusion. this patient group frequently receives vasoconstrictors as part of the
      resuscitation strategy and are as such an ideal group in which to study perioperative
      microcirculation and diagnostic changes in the intravascular system.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the microcirculation and to determine possible
      correlation of central and peripheral measures of tissue perfusion in patients with
      intraoperative hemodynamic challenges undergoing emergency laparotomy.

        pathology, in need of intraoperative Noradrenaline infusion to maintain predefined
        normotension.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Adults (18 years or over) undergoing emergency laparotomy/laparoscopy for following
             abdominal pathology:

               1. Perforated viscus

               2. Intestinal obstruction

          2. Emergency re-operations after elective surgery owing to paralytic/obstructive ileus,
             anastomotic leakage

          3. Provided verbal and written informed consent

          4. Must speak and understand the Danish language

          5. Intraoperative indication for Norepinephrine infusion

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Appendectomies, cholecystectomies, negative diagnostic laparoscopies/laparotomies,
             herniotomies without bowel resections, sub-acute internal hernias after gastric bypass
             surgery, sub-acute surgery for inflammatory bowel diseases.

          2. Reoperation owing to fascial separation with no other abdominal pathology identified
             and sub-acute colorectal cancer-surgery will be excluded from the cohort. Sub-acute
             surgery is defined as surgery planned within 48 hours.

          3. Intestinal Ischemia

          4. intraabdominal bleeding

          5. Traumas, gynecological, urogenital and other vascular pathology, pregnant patients.

          6. Dementia and/or cognitive dysfunction (diagnosed). If the patient is not awake, alert,
             and oriented, times three (to person, place, and time), this also qualifies as an
             exclusion criterion.
