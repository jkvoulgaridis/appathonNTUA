  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Professionals and residents of nursing homes are one of the most vulnerable groups in this
      public health crisis of COVID-19, since they have the highest rate of positives for COVID-19,
      despite the restriction measures carried out, such as prohibition of family visits to these
      centers, the infection occurs by cross transmission with the care staff of the centers, or
      with other residents.

      At the moment, there are no clinical trials to test the hypothesis that hydroxychloroquine is
      effective in coronavirus treatment. Although what has been observed is a better prognosis in
      infected patients, since this drug inhibits the replication of the virus and its expansion to
      other tissues.

      This study is a clinical trial to test the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine as a
      preventive drug for SARS-CoV-2 infection. This drug will be applied to 1050 people residing
      in nursing home care and 880 professionals who work in close contact with these people and
      who have not yet contracted the infection.

      This project will be carried out in the territories of Madrid, Navarra, Aragon and Andalusia
      (Spain).

      Hydroxychloroquine is a widely known drug that is used in two scenarios, against autoimmune
      diseases, such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis, and as an antimalarial drug.

      It is also intended to demonstrate that the presumed reduction in viral load that would be
      obtained with hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis, would have no effect in development of immunity
      against the virus. This fact can create a new paradigm for the de-escalation of the
      confinement to which the population has been subjected to stop the virus spread, allowing the
      development of general immunity in controlled populations until reaching total immunity.

      In addition to testing the effect of this drug, a non-pharmacological intervention based on a
      safety record will be tested in the management of infection on nursing home, to assess its
      effectiveness in detecting risk areas or bad practices carried out in this vulnerable
      environment.

      The study is led by researchers of the Institute of Biomedicine of Malaga (Spain), and has
      obtained a financing of 1,024,199 euros from Carlos III Health Institute (Spain).

      The period of execution of the clinical trial is one year, and with this intervention, the
      intention is to reduce cross-infection in residents by a minimum threshold of 15%, as well as
      to decrease infection in the professionals.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine
      chemoprophylaxis in healthcare personnel and residents:

        1. the incidence of secondary cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in residents

        2. the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the staff. To assess the effect of measures to
           promote infection control. Design: Cluster randomized controlled stepped-wedge
           multicentre trial. Subjects: Institutionalized older people and nursing homes staff in
           four Autonomous Communities.

      Sample: 880 professionals, 1050 residents in 84 residences. They will be given 800mg of
      hydorxychloroquine the first day and 400mg in the subsequent four days. Nasopharyngeal
      exudate will be taken for baseline RT-PCR, and at six and 14 days after the adminsitration of
      hydroxychloroquine.

      Mortality, compliance, safety, symptoms, and hospital admission will be evaluated
      secondarily.

      The highest risk group for SARS-CoV-2 infection is that of people over 60 years of age, with
      cardiovascular disease, diabetes, COPD and immunosuppression, reaching up to 32% of those
      infected. But, in addition, the impact is especially insidious among institutionalized older
      people. The Spanish MInistry of Health has developed some regulations with measures to curb
      the impact in this context. WHO places institutionalized people as a very vulnerable group
      due to their permanent close contact with other people in the residence, the abundance of
      group activities, the presence of people with cognitive impairment and the need for help for
      their activities of daily living, which involves close physical contact with healthcare
      personnel. Even the interventions for preventing and controlling the infection could
      seriously affect the mental health and well-being of this vulnerable people, even if they do
      not contract the infection. In the province of Malaga (Spain), a checklist has been developed
      consisting of 13 items related to knowledge and compliance with the rules of prevention,
      self-protection, isolation and circuits, carried out by case management nurses. This
      instrument contains many of the WHO recommendations and may be an element that could make a
      difference in this context.

      A significant proportion of those infected are known to have had close contact with probable
      or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases. In institutionalized people, the main source of contact (once
      family visits have been eliminated) is caused by cross-contamination with the care staff who
      provide direct care or other infected residents. In nursing homes, staff ratios are much more
      limited than in acute care hospitals (aggravated by the demand for professionals due to the
      epidemic). Furthermore, the possibility of isolation of infected patients is very limited: On
      average, residences only have 15% of their rooms prepared for isolation.

      Among the various therapeutic strategies being tested, the use of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ)
      emerges as a viable option, albeit with limitations in the studies. This use has already been
      proposed for a long time due to its potential antiviral action, since it alkalinizes the
      cellular pH necessary for binding of the virus to the host cell and interferes with
      glycosylation of ECA2 receptors and blocks endosomatic transport of the virus. HCQ
      administered in a safe dose range is distributed throughout the body, including the lung
      parenchyma after oral administration, with few adverse effects. Compared to the antivirals
      under study for SARS-CoV-2 infection, it is much more feasible in real clinical practice
      conditions to access HCQ, a drug on which, in addition, there is enormous experience, its
      safety is well known, It is funded by the National Health System (NHS), it is cheap and
      accessible on the NHS. There are currently several clinical trials underway and a consensus
      has been developed that recommends their use in patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Regarding
      the prophylactic use of HCQ, another trial in Spain has just started to use it in a &quot;test and
      treat&quot; strategy in patients among the general population, but it does not directly affect the
      institutionalized population. Our study aims to explore whether the administration of
      chemoprophylaxis in nursing homes is a protective strategy for both institutionalized people
      and the professionals themselves.

      This is an open-label, randomized, randomized controlled study. This design is a pragmatic
      approach, under real clinical practice conditions, that allows the sequential inclusion of
      subjects in established periods of time in which, in the end, all the subjects of the
      participating clusters will end up receiving the intervention. Its advantage lies in the fact
      that it allows logistical restrictions to be addressed in scenarios that are difficult to
      implement in parallel studies. The primary target population of the study consists of
      professionals who provide direct care in nursing homes (nursing assistants and nurses) and
      institutionalized older people.

      The sampling frame will be integrated by the Communities of Andalusia, Madrid, Aragon and the
      Autonomous Community of Navarra. A conservative sample calculation has been designed, due to
      the current uncertainty regarding incidence. The incidence of Andalusia has been taken as the
      lower limit and the incidence provided in the study by Kimball et al. as an upper limit, and
      bearing in mind that many nursing homes are taking measures to isolate and relocate
      residents. To decrease the minimum infection rate in residents from 25% to 10% (delta =
      -0.15), with an alpha of 0.05, a power of 80%, assuming a minimum of 13 residents per cluster
      with a CCI of 0.1, with a replacement rate of losses of 25%, a total of 1050 residents would
      be necessary, with 7 clusters in each step, distributed in a total of 84 nursing homes.
      Regarding workers, taking the references from Andalusia and the study by McMichael et al. to
      decrease the minimum infection rate in professionals from 18% to 5% (delta = -0.13), with the
      same power parameters, assuming a minimum of 10 professionals per cluster with a CCI 0.1, and
      a replacement rate of 5% 880 professionals with the same number of clusters and nursing homes
      are required.

      The stepped-wedge procedure will be followed by clusters. The randomization unit will be the
      residences. The RCT will have a total of 3 steps. In each step, 7 residences will be
      randomized step by step every week to compute 28 in a month, which will be treated and
      followed for 4 weeks. This process will be repeated over 3 months to reach a total of 84
      residences. Every month 364 residents and 280 professionals participate, who start the study
      as their own controls and progressively receive the HCQ prophylaxis intervention and the
      non-pharmacological intervention. Some more residences will be arranged to replace possible
      losses. Variables: Sociodemographic, adjustment and control of confounders (Cluster,
      follow-up time, hours worked by each professional during the study, gradient of application
      of non-pharmacological measures); Primary endpoints: Number of secondary cases of SARS-CoV2
      infection among residents, and SARS-CoV-2 infection in caregivers who provide direct care;
      Secondary endpoints: mortality, compliance with treatment, symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection,
      hospital admission of personnel and adverse events.

      All the nursing homes in the province will be invited to participate and after randomization,
      the phased inclusion of residences will begin, requesting the consent of professionals to be
      included and proceeding to collect basal exudate and study variables. In the randomized
      nursing homes in each step as an intervention, the HCQ regimen will be provided and the
      nasopharyngeal exudate follow-up will be performed for RT-PCR at 6 and 14 days. In those in
      the control group step, a weekly exudate will be collected until they enter into the
      intervention group step. Adverse events will be monitored at each weekly visit using a
      standardized procedure (gastrointestinal disorders, appetite disturbances, hypoglycemia,
      weight loss, decreased visual acuity, photophobia, impaired visual accommodation with
      symptoms of blurred vision, deafness, tinnitus, and vertigo, muscle weakness, symptoms of
      liver and kidney disorders, neurological disorders). Serious and non-serious adverse events
      will be distinguished and will be notified by means of a standard procedure to the Research
      Ethics Committee, and to the Spanish Agency for Medicines and Health Products. An insurance
      policy has been contracted for risk coverage.

      The study will comply with all the precepts of the Declaration of Helsinki and its subsequent
      revisions, as well as the Standards of Good Practice. Participants will be informed of the
      characteristics and purpose of the study and will be asked for informed consent in accordance
      with the regulations in force in Spain using the form and the corresponding information
      sheet. The study has been approved by the Malaga Provincial Research Ethics Committee and the
      Spanish Agency for Medicines and Health Products, as well as the participating institutions.

      All the trial monitoring process and pharmacovigilance will be carried out by the Clinical
      Trial Units of the Spanish Clinical Research Network of the participating Centers.

      Exploratory data analysis, bivariate analysis (chi square, Student t, ANOVA or their
      non-parametric equivalents in case of non-normality) will be performed and the main
      hypothesis will be tested using generalized linear binomial and Poisson models, also taking
      the cluster, as random effects factor, and time as a fixed factor. Intrasubject analyzes will
      be carried out using mixed generalized linear models. All the analyses will be performed by
      intention to treat, using multiple imputation models.

      The total estimated duration is a maximum of 12 months.

    <intervention_model_description>Cluster, randomized controlled stepped-wedge study. The stepped-wedge design involves the collection of observations during a baseline period in which no clusters are exposed to the intervention though they will be receiving placebo. Following this, at regular intervals, a group of clusters will be randomized to receive the intervention, being all participants measured regularly. This process continues until all the clusters have received the intervention.
Thie trial has a pragmatic approach under real clinical practice conditions, which allows the sequential inclusion of subjects in established periods of time in which, in the end, all the subjects of the participating clusters will receive the intervention.
Furthermore, this design allows additional analysis such as modeling the effect of time on the effectiveness of the intervention developed.</intervention_model_description>
