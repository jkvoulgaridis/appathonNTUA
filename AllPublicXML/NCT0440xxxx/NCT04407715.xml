  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Different amounts of anesthetic gas can be used in the obstetric gynecological surgery
      operations to be performed with open method. Researchers aimed to compare the effect of gas
      changes on intraocular nerve diameter by ultrasonography.

      A total of 80 patients who underwent laparotomic gynecological surgery were divided into two
      groups prospectively: high flow of 2 L/min and minimal flow of 0.5 L/min. Anesthesia was
      maintained with 50% oxygen-50% air at 2 L/min and desflurane at 1.1 MAC in Group 1 (n=40) and
      with 50% oxygen-50% air at 2 L/min and desflurane at 1.1 MAC in Group 2 (n=40). After 10-15
      minutes, group 2 was administered minimal flow with 50-60% oxygen-40-50% air at 0.5 L/min and
      desflurane, and 10 minutes before the end of the surgery, the patients were switched to high
      flow with 50% oxygen-50% air at 2 L/min.

    <description>Optic nerve sheath diamater measurements of the patients were recorded before and during the surgery at specified time points (T0: awake, T1: High fresh gas flow after induction at the 10th min., T2: Inhalation anesthesia at the 30th min., T3: Inhalation anesthesia at the 60th min., T4: Inhalation anesthesia at the 90th min., T5: Before extubation).A typical optic nerve sheath is generally less than 5 mm in diameter, and diameters greater than 5.5 mm predict an ICP of ≥20 cm H2O with 100% sensitivity and specifity</description>

    <description>. The patients were randomly allocated to one of the two groups of fresh gas flows using the closed-envelope technique: 2 L/min high flow and 0.5 L/min minimal flow. Group 1 (n = 40) was operated under high flow anesthesia with 50% O2 - 50% air at 2 L/min and desflurane at 1.1 MAC for the duration of the surgery. For anesthesia maintenance, Group 2 (n=40) was administered 50% oxygen - 50% air at 2 L/min and desflurane for 10-15 minutes. After reaching 1.1 MAC, it was switched to minimal flow with 50-60% oxygen- 40-50% air at 0.5 L/min and desflurane. 10 minutes before the end of the surgery, it was switched to high flow with 50% oxygen -50% air at 2 L/min.</description>

    <description>Optic nerve sheath diameter measurements were performed by an experienced and the same anesthetist. In the measurements, the GE Healthcare Logiq e series USG device and 12-MHz linear probe were used. Longitudinal and transverse axis images were obtained on both eyelids while the patient was in the supine position. Measurements were taken 3 mm behind the optic nerve head</description>
