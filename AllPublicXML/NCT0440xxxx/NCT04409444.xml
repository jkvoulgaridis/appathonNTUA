  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Manchester Lung Health Study (qUEST) will assess the uptake of a community-based lung
      cancer screening service and its impact across a deprived area of North and East Manchester,
      which has high rates of lung cancer. One measure will be to compare the number and stage of
      lung cancers detected through screening to those detected outside of screening. In addition
      we will investigate the potential of a blood and nose test to detect lung cancer or to help
      decide who would benefit from screening. We will also see if these samples can help with the
      interpretation of CT scans. One of the problems with lung cancer CT screening is that you
      detect lung nodules in which we are not sure if they are benign or cancerous. Therefore we
      are also looking to see if a biomarker can help us work out which are cancerous and which are
      benign.
