      What are the differences between patients prescribed a new maintenance treatment for Chronic
      Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) with tiotropium/olodaterol (TIO/OLO) or Inhaled
      Corticosteroids (ICS)-containing regimens in terms of sociodemographic, anthropometric and
      clinical characteristics?

        The source population are COPD patients starting a new maintenance COPD treatment with
        TIO/OLO or with an ICS-containing regimen in the primary care setting.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Aged ≥ 40 years at the date of COPD diagnosis.

          2. Diagnosis of COPD confirmed by the investigator. A spirometry confirming the diagnosis
             (FEV1/forced vital capacity [FVC] ratio &lt;0.7) and performed within the three years
             prior to the inclusion visit must be available in the patient's medical records.

          3. Prescription of a new maintenance COPD treatment with TIO/OLO or ICS-containing
             regimens (not including TIO/OLO) 3 months (-7/+30 days) prior to the inclusion visit.
             The COPD treatment may have been prescribed at primary care sites or at the hospital.

          4. Written informed consent prior to participation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        1. Respiratory disorders other than COPD, such as asthma-COPD overlap or asthma (prior to
        or at the index date).

        2a. For treatment naïve patients (i.e., those who have never started a maintenance therapy
        for COPD [with either short- or long-acting bronchodilators or ICS]) - no data on the GOLD
        2019 group at the index date is available in the medical records. Patients may still be
        included if the determination of the GOLD 2019 group is possible based on the medical
        records' data and/or patient interviews (e.g. by using information on exacerbation history
        in the 12 months prior to the index date, and data on mMRC and COPD Assessment Test (CAT)
        at the index date).

        2b. For treatment experienced patients - no data on the predominant treatable trait to
        target at the index date (dyspnea, exacerbation or both) is available in the medical
        records. Patients may still be included if this information is obtained based on patient
        interviews.

        3. Participation in a clinical trial within the 3 months prior to the inclusion visit.
