  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the clinical setting, it is difficult to obtain effective rehabilitation during the acute
      phase, the reasons may include insufficient awareness of early rehabilitation due mainly to a
      limitation in number and variety of rehabilitation professionals in Low- and middle-income
      countries. It is necessary to shift tasks to other healthcare providers who are trained to
      provide rehabilitation like nurses. The purpose of this study is to examine the feasibility
      and effectiveness of a modified Barthel Index based rehabilitation nursing program on acute
      stroke inpatients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ischemic stroke is the main cause of disability in the world. More than 70% of stroke
      patients show various degrees of neural function impairment. Early rehabilitation in acute
      phase is beneficial for improving patient's activity of daily livings and motor function.
      However, it is difficult to obtain effective rehabilitation during the acute phase of stroke
      because of the insufficiency of professional rehabilitation therapists in stroke wards in
      China. The investigators assume that implementing program based on modified Barthel Index can
      realize nursing-directed motor rehabilitation during acute phase of ischemic stroke. The
      present study is to conduct quasi-experimental research to confirm the feasibility and
      effectiveness of nursing-directed precision rehabilitation in acute stroke patients.
