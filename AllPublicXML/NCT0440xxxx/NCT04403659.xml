  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      &quot;La Casa nel Parco&quot; (CANP) Project is a multidisciplinary project funded by the European
      Union and Regione Piemonte aimed to explore innovative technology application in the care of
      older subjects. In this context, MONTEROSA is a monocentric randomized controlled open-label
      clinical trial evaluating the use of a telemonitoring/telemedicine (TM) suite (including a
      sphygmomanometer, pulse oximeter, weight scale, thermometer, glucometer, electrocardiograph)
      as a support to the routine clinical care of patients admitted to a Hospital at Home service
      for acute decompensated heart failure.

      The main objective of the study will be to evaluate the impact of TM on number of daily
      physician's visits. Secondary objectives will be to evaluate the impact of TM on number of
      daily nurse visits, on overall in-hospital mortality and on patient's and caregiver's quality
      of life.

    <description>The couples patient/caregiver will receive and trained to use a suite of TM instruments including: sphygmomanometer, pulse oximeter, weight scale, thermometer, glucometer, electrocardiograph. During the intervention phase (i.e. from allocation to exit from the study), the caregiver/patient will be asked to measure twice daily, at prespecified times, the following parameters using TM devices: arterial blood pressure, peripheral arterial haemoglobin saturation, tympanic temperature. Body weight will be evaluated once daily.
The TM glucometer and TM electrocardiograph will be used exclusively by healthcare staff in case of patients in need of capillary blood glucose testing and according to clinical needs, respectively. All data will be automatically sent to a central interface and made readily available to physicians and nurses, to enable a prompt clinical response. In case of malfunctioning, a technical support will be ensured.</description>
