      This study analyse the effectiveness of auricular therapy vs. kinesio tape treatment for pain
      management of women with primary dysmenorrhoea.

    <textblock>
      Pharmacological treatments are not effective for all women and therefore, the objective of
      this study was to assess and compare the effectiveness of kinesio tape and auricular therapy
      to decrease pain and drug intake in women with primary dysmenorrhoea.

      A randomized controlled trial was conducted. 114 university women from 18 to 30 years old
      were randomized to 5 groups: control, kinesio tape, placebo kinesio tape, auricular therapy
      and placebo auricular therapy. The study was carried out during 4 menstrual cycles of
      pre-treatment phase, 4 menstrual cycles of treatment phase and two follow up phases (first
      and third cycle after the treatments were completed). During the treatment phase, the
      techniques were applied during 72h in each cycle.

      The primary outcome measures were: Mean pain intensity of the 3 first days of bleeding,
      maximum pain intensity, number of painful days and dose of drug intake measured with the
      Visual Analogue Scale.

    <intervention_model_description>Double-blind randomized clinical controlled trial.

    <masking>Double (Participant, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>The participants in the different intervention groups received real and placebo auricular therapy and kinesio tape treatment.
The kinesio tape placebo group had the application of three elastic bandages that were shorter than the used in the kinesio tape group. In addition, the tape was adhered with no tension and not place in the treatment area. The auricular therapy placebo group had adhesive tapes without seeds displaced from the treatment points.
The outcome assessor was independent to the study and was not aware of the treatments applied or the objective of the therapy.</masking_description>

    <description>The auricular therapy group received an intervention based on the bilateral application of 7 adhesive tapes with vaccaria seeds. The points were located with a retractable 250 gr. pressure palpator (SedatelecÂ®). An experienced health professional trained on acupuncture techniques applied the vaccaria seeds.</description>

    <description>Before the tape application, the skin surface was removed of hair when needed and cleansed. The tapes were applied at 25% of tension and were placed horizontally covering the area between the antero-superior iliac spines and the postero-superior iliac spines and vertically from the navel to the symphysis pubis. All bandages were adhered to the skin with a technique type I with a space augmentation. The centre of the tape was removed and applied at 25% of tension. Afterwards, the rest of the protector were removed and the laterals anchors of the tape were adhered with no tension. The participant maintained a slight extension of the trunk while the tape was applied on the anterior aspect of the truck and a slight flexion while the tape was applied in the posterior aspect of the trunk.</description>
