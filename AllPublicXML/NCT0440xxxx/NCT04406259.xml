    <textblock>
      Verapamil is a calcium channel blocker widely used to treat cardiovascular diseases however
      it is also the first line treatment in the prevention of cluster headaches. In France, its
      prescription in that indication is based on compliance with the Temporary Recommendation for
      Use (RTU) that insists on the possible the cardiac side effects that can occur as the doses
      required for cluster headache are significantly higher than the doses used in cardiology.

    <description>Patients in groupe A require verapamil initiation as a preventive treatment and patients in group B are patients already undergoing a verapamil treatment for their Cluster Headache.
The doses of verapamil are increased for the patients in group A, after a clinical examination an electrocardiogram, and a blood test.</description>
