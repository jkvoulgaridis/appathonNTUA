      This study aims to evaluate the effect of the single-injection adductor canal block in
      patients receiving total knee arthroplasty under spinal anesthesia. The effect of the
      single-injection adductor canal and continuous adductor canal block in patients receiving
      total knee arthroplasty under general anesthesia has been well established. However, due to
      the residual effect of spinal anesthesia, the effect of the single-injection adductor canal
      block needs to be determined. The investigators hypothesize that the single-injection
      adductor canal block will decrease the total sum of 2h, 6h, 12h, and 24h pain score.

Assisted by the high-frequency linear ultrasound transducer, we target the mid-thigh level and the 22-gauge/8cm needle is introduced in plain through the sartorius muscle. the correct position for the tip of the needle in the adductor canal is checked and a bolus injection of 0.5% ropivacaine 15ml is given.</description>
