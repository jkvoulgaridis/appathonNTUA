  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Dentin hypersensitivity (DH) is defined as high sensitivity of the vital dentin
      when exposed to thermal, chemical or tactile stimuli. Two mechanisms are required for the
      occurrence of DH: 1) the dentin must be exposed and 2) the dentinal tubules must be open and
      connected to the pulp. Molar-incisor hypomineralization (MIH) is a qualitative abnormality of
      a genetic origin that affects tooth enamel and, in most cases, is accompanied by DH. The
      control of tooth sensitivity is fundamental to the successful treatment of MIH.

      Objective: The aim of the proposed randomized, controlled, clinical trial is to evaluate the
      effectiveness of different protocols for the control of DH in patients with teeth affected by
      MIH.

      Methods: One hundred forty patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be allocated to four
      groups. Group 1 will be the control group (placebo). In Group 2, sensitive teeth will be
      sealed with Permaseal (Ultradent). In Group 3, sensitive teeth will receive low-level laser
      (LLL) (AsGaAl) at a wavelength of 780 nm (Laser XT Therapy, DMC, São Carlos, SP, Brazil). In
      Group 4, sensitive teeth will be treated with both LLL and Permaseal (Ultradent). DH will be
      evaluated 15 min after the application of the treatments and the patients will be reevaluated
      one week, one month, three months and six months after the treatments.

      Discussion: This study will enable the determination of differences in the effectiveness of
      the proposed treatments as well as differences among the evaluation times for each proposed
      treatment.

    <description>The researcher will assess the sensitive tooth using cold air from the triple syringe (2 s of compressed air at a pressure of approximately 40 psi with the syringe perpendicular to the tooth surface at a distance of approximately 0.5 cm). Neighboring teeth will be protected with cotton rolls or the examiner's fingers9. The volunteer will then indicate a whole number between 0 (absence of pain) to 10 (worst pain possible) on the 10-cm VAS scale that best describes his/her perception of pain.</description>

    <description>The volunteers in this group will receive the same hygiene instructions as the other groups and will undergo both treatments, except that water will be used instead of the sealant and the laser device will be set to a power of 0 W. In other words, the same irradiation procedure will be performed but without the emission of light.</description>

    <description>Two weeks prior to the onset of the study, the volunteers will undergo a wash-out period, in which they will only use oral hygiene products donated by the researchers. These products will be used through to the end of the study. The oral hygiene kit will contain a soft-bristle toothbrush (Professional Lab Series, Colgate Palmolive), fluoride toothpaste with no desensitizing agent (Elmex) and dental floss (Colgate). The participants will be extensively trained with regards to all procedures involved in the experiment.</description>

    <description>The teeth to be sealed will be isolated and 35% phosphoric acid will be applied for 20 seconds, followed by rinsing and drying the dental surfaces. A thin layer of PermaSeal will be applied to the tooth surface for 5 seconds and photopolymerized for 20 seconds. The occlusion will then be evaluated.</description>
