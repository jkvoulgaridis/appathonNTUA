  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the ability of SPGB in the management of PDPH. Transcranial
      Doppler is also used as an measure to assess the block success by detecting the variability
      in the cerebral hemodynamics before and after the block.

      This clinical trial is performed in postoperative orthopedic unit. In this study, 44 patients
      were enrolled who had an epidural anesthesia; 22 patients who developed PDPH joined the
      treatment group (A) and received the SP block. They are assessed before the procedure by NRS
      and at 30 mins, 2h, 4h, 6h, 12h, and 24h after the procedure. Patients are also assessed by
      TCD before and after the block. The control group (B) included 22 patients with no PDPH.

    <intervention_model_description>This study is carried out in the Orthopedic unit and included 44 patients divided into two groups: the treatment group (A) and the control group (B). Group A recruit 22 patients with a past history of epidural anesthesia who suffered from of PDPH within five days after the dural puncture. Group B included twenty two patients with a history of epidural anesthesia with no PDPH.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>Before the block and at 30 minutes, 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, 8 hours, 12 hours, and 24 hours after the block</time_frame>
    <description>Pain score changes are assessed before and after the block using NRS in which zero is no pain and ten is worst pain imagined. pain was assessed throughout 24 hours after performing the block and Pain relief is considered when NRS â‰¤ 4.</description>

    <measure>Detecting the changes in cerebral vessels caliber after doing SPGB</measure>
    <time_frame>TCD measurements are performed before SPGB is given to both groups, it is repeated again within an hour after the block for group (A) only.</time_frame>
    <description>Siemens Acuson X300 ultrasound with P 4-2 phased array 2MHz probe was utilized. For all patients, both middle cerebral arteries were insonated through the transtemporal window over the zygomatic arch in front of the tragus of the ear at a depth of 50-60 mm. Tracings were also recorded for at least 10 cardiac cycles</description>

    <description>Sphenopalatine Ganglion Block is performed by a hollow culture swab that is connected with a 21-gauge syringe filled with three ml 4% lidocaine, inserted parallel to the floor of the nose until resistance is felt. The swab is at the posterior pharyngeal wall superior to the middle turbinate. The applicator was kept in the nostril for five to ten mins. The same procedure is done also in the second nostril. The patients are then examined by TCD.</description>
