  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Behcet's disease (BD) is a chronic systemic inflammatory disease which is characterized by
      oral and genital ulcers, uveitis and skin lesions. Musculoskeletal involvement such as
      arthritis, arthralgia, enthesitis and sacroiliitis can be seen in the course of BD. Familial
      Mediterranean fever (FMF) is the most frequent autoinflammatory disease (AID) and
      characterized by selflimited episodes of fever and polyserositis. It is the most common
      monogenic periodic fever syndrome that affects mainly the people of Mediterranean descent.
      Regular physical activity involving aerobic and strengthening programs in inflammatory
      rheumatic diseases has a long-term anti-inflammatory effect. Eccentric exercises cause an
      acute increase in TNF alpha level and should be avoided especially at the beginning. It has
      been stated that patients should be encouraged about aerobic exercise programs where the
      intensity is gradually increased, starting with low intensity. Pilates method is the mind and
      body centering technique developed by Joseph Hubertus Pilates, based on providing lumbopelvic
      stability. FMF and BH have common characteristics such as ethnicity, etiopathogenetic
      mechanisms, symptoms, and treatment. When we look at the literature, there is no study on the
      effectiveness of exercise applications in FMF and Behçet patients. The purpose of our study;
      It is the comparison of the effectiveness of physical activity in patients diagnosed with
      Behçet and FMF and healthy individuals. In this context, with the short form of the
      International Physical Activity Evaluation Questionnaire, Behçet's patients whose physical
      activity level is inactive will be Group 1, FMF patients Group 2 and healthy controls with
      similar demographic characteristics will be Group 3. Pilates based exercise program will be
      applied to all 3 groups for 8 weeks, 2 times a week.

    <measure>international physical activity questionnaire- short form Web sonuçları International Physical Activity Questionnaire - Short Form</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline to 8 weeks, follow up at two months</time_frame>
    <description>This short questionnaire, consisting of seven questions, evaluates the amount of walking done in the last week and the amount of moderate and difficult physical activities performed in work, transportation, housework, gardening and leisure activities.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>six minute walk test</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline to 8 weeks, follow up at two months</time_frame>
    <description>It is a simple test that measures the distance an individual can walk at a fast pace on a flat, hard floor in 6 minutes.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Biodex balance system (BBS)</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline to 8 weeks, follow up at two months</time_frame>
    <description>The BBS has a round foot platform that moves in all planes. It grants 20 degrees of foot platform motion in different directions. The platform has foot angles and heel coordinates for proper foot placement before starting the balance test trial. The foot angles range from 0° to 45° and heel coordinates are expressed as the intersection of letters from A to P and numbers from 1 to 21. The participants were asked to centralize their body while they placed their feet in the most comfortable position and their feet 10 cm apart with eyes open. They were asked to hold the rails in case they felt unbalanced. The machine measured the magnitude of their postural sways: higher scores for postural sway indicate impaired balance, and a lower score indicate excellent balance</description>

    <measure>Berg Balance Scale (BBS)</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline to 8 weeks, follow up at two months</time_frame>
    <description>The BBS is a 14- item balance test recognized as the gold standard tool for assessing balance (higher scores indicate better balance)</description>

    <measure>Hamilton Depression Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline to 8 weeks, follow up at two months</time_frame>
    <description>The scale was prepared as 21 items, but the last four items were not included in the scoring. The total score is determined on 17 items.</description>

    <description>The key elements of Pilates during supine, prone, side-lying and standing positions will be taught. These key elements are: breathing (diaphragmatic), focusing (neutral position), rib cage placement, shoulder placement, head and neck placement (neutral position). Then, Pilates based 'mat' exercises will be performed by the physiotherapist in the clinic for 8 weeks, 2 days / week, 16 sessions. Each session will be programmed to be 45 minutes. During all exercises, including warm-up and cooling, patients will be asked to provide key elements and protect them during movements. Depending on the condition of the patients, the exercises will be advanced from easy to difficult.</description>
