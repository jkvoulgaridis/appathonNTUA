      Immunotherapy for PD-L1 positive patients is still ineffective in some patients，which may be
      related to the complex immune microenvironment.In view of this bottleneck, further refinement
      of immunotyping and in-depth study of drug resistance mechanism are the most important tasks.
      In this observational study, we evaluated the difference of gene mutation and immune
      microenvironment and therapeutic effect in primary NSCLC.

      There are still some patients with PD-L1 positive who are ineffective in immunotherapy, which
      may be related to the complex immune microenvironment. In view of this bottleneck, further
      refinement of immunotyping and in-depth study of drug resistance mechanism are the most
      important tasks.

      Recently, studies have shown that the core elements of tumor microenvironment that have a
      significant impact on immunotherapy are:1. Infiltration abundance of specific killer T cells;
      2. PD-L1 expression dependent on IFN - γ pathway, down-regulation of various active molecules
      and up-regulation of inhibitory molecules; 3. Activation and clearance of various inhibitory
      T cells.

      Although the classification has achieved further refinement of immune cells and molecular
      level, there are still some problems to be solved urgently: first, the classification of TIL
      cells needs further refinement, and different types of TIL infiltration have different
      guiding significance for prognosis; second, the subjective second-order semi quantitative
      scoring is often used for til count scoring, with low repeatability and different centers It
      is not easy for different pathologists to reach an agreement on the results of reading and
      interpretation. Thirdly, conventional methods are difficult to meet the requirements of tumor
      microenvironment analysis. In conclusion, it is urgent to develop a multi molecular marker
      landscape analysis system for tumor microenvironment, and establish a standardized detection
      process for each molecule to meet the needs of clinical positioning, quantitative and
      qualitative analysis for key molecular markers of immune microenvironment.

      In this observational study, we evaluated the difference of gene mutation and immune
      microenvironment and therapeutic effect in primary NSCLC.
