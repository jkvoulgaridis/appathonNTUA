  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying to see whether bevacizumab may treat chronic bleeding and
      iron deficiency anemia in Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT).

      Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) is a disorder that causes abnormal blood vessel
      formation. In HHT, there is a mutation in the TGF-β pathway, which results in an increase of
      vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels. An increase in VEGF levels can result in
      poorly formed blood vessels that have a higher rate of bleeding than normal blood vessels.
      Bevacizumab is designed to block VEGF activity. It is believed that targeting increased VEGF
      levels may be able to treat HHT.

      This research study involves the following study drug:

      - Bevacizumab

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this research study, the investigators are studying the study drug, bevacizumab.
      Researchers would like to see whether bevacizumab effectively treats Hereditary Hemorrhagic
      Telangiectasia (HHT) and what side effects occur.

      - The research study procedures include: screening for eligibility, pretreatment period,
      study treatment, end-of-study visit, and follow-up visit.

        -  Participants will be observed for 12 weeks and then receive study treatment for 24 weeks
           and will be followed for 30 days after ending study treatment.

        -  This research study involves the following study drug: Bevacizumab

        -  It is expected that about 20 people will take part in this research study.

      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating
      Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT). &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being
      studied.

      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved bevacizumab for Hereditary
      Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT), but it has been approved for other uses.

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  All laboratory test criteria for study inclusion may be obtained at any point in the
             30-day screening period.

          -  A clinical diagnosis of &quot;possible/suspected&quot; or &quot;definite&quot; hereditary hemorrhagic
             telangiectasia, as defined by presence of 2 or more of the Curacao criteria
             (spontaneous and recurrent epistaxis, telangiectasias at characteristic sites,
             visceral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), first degree relative with HHT).

          -  Age ≥18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the
             use of bevacizumab for HHT in participants &lt;18 years of age, children are excluded
             from this study, but will be eligible for future pediatric trials.

          -  Red blood cell transfusion and/or iron infusion dependence, as defined by a
             hematologic support score (HSS) of ≥3 in the 3 months prior to consent. HSS is
             calculated by dividing the total milligrams of elemental iron infused by 250 and
             adding to this the number of red cell units transfused.

          -  ECOG performance status ≤2 (see Appendix B).

          -  Participants must have adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:

               -  leukocytes ≥2,500/mcL

               -  absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/mcL

               -  platelets ≥75,000/mcL

               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤3 × institutional ULN*

               -  creatinine ≤ 2.5 mg/dL OR

               -  glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ≥45 mL/min/1.73 m2

          -  Except AST and/or ALT elevation related to HHT-associated hemolytic anemia or liver
             AVMs, in the opinion of the investigator. Bilirubin thresholds are not included as
             mild chronic hyperbilirubinemia is common in HHT, likely related to subclinical
             hemolysis in AVMs. Patients with clinically advanced liver disease should be excluded
             from participation per 3.2.16.

          -  The effects of bevacizumab on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason
             and because anti-angiogenic agents are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing
             potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method
             of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study
             participation. Women should additionally use adequate contraception for the 6 months
             after discontinuation of bevacizumab. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is
             pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform
             her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also
             agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study
             participation, and 4 months after completion of bevacizumab administration.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

          -  Exclusion Criteria Exclusion Criteria Exclusion Criteria

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Participants who have received intranasal or systemic bevacizumab, systemic
             ramucirumab, or systemic ziv-aflibercept in the 6 weeks prior to consent.

          -  Participants who have received oral anti-angiogenic agents, including pazopanib,
             axitinib, sorafenib, thalidomide, lenalidomide, or pomalidomide in the 6 weeks prior
             to consent.

          -  Participants receiving oral tranexamic acid, epsilon-aminocaproic acid, or doxycycline
             unless they are on a stable dose for at least 2 weeks prior to consent to be continued
             at that same dose over the entire duration of the study.

          -  Participants receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents unless they are on a stable
             dose for at least 4 weeks prior to consent to be continued at that same dose over the
             entire duration of the study.

          -  Participants receiving oral iron preparations must discontinue these preparations
             within 2 weeks prior to the initiation of the study. Multivitamins or other
             pharmaceuticals containing iron are allowed if the daily dose of elemental iron does
             not exceed 25 mg per day.

          -  Participants receiving systemic estrogen or testosterone preparations unless they are
             on a stable dose for at least 4 weeks prior to consent to be continued over the entire
             duration of the study. Use of non-prescription testosterone preparations (e.g. illicit
             anabolic steroids) in the 4 weeks prior to consent is exclusionary.

          -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  History of allergic reactions to bevacizumab.

          -  Participants with uncontrolled intercurrent illness, in the opinion of the
             investigator.

          -  Participants with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance
             with study requirements, in the opinion of the investigator.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because bevacizumab is an anti-angiogenic
             agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with bevacizumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the
             mother is treated with bevacizumab. Pregnancy status will be assessed with a serum
             B-HCG pregnancy test (see Section 10 for timing). Women who are menopausal or
             perimenopausal will have follicle-stimulating hormone levels drawn to confirm
             menopausal status.

          -  Known diagnosis of a hypoproliferative anemia (e.g. myelodysplastic syndrome).
             Nonimmune hemolytic anemia associated with HHT is not exclusionary.

          -  Significant proteinuria, as defined by a urine protein of &gt;2.0 grams per day (on
             24-hour urine protein collection or spot urine protein:creatinine ratio). 24-hour
             urine protein collection or spot urine protein:creatinine ratio is necessary during
             screening to quantify urine protein only in patients with screening urine
             dipstick/urinalysis demonstrates 3+ protein or higher.

          -  Poorly-controlled hypertension, as defined by a systolic blood pressure &gt;160 mm Hg or
             diastolic blood pressure &gt;100 mm Hg refractory to medical management.

          -  Serious or non-healing wound, ulcer or bone fracture.

          -  Unwillingness to receive red blood cell transfusions and/or intravenous iron infusions
             according to the hematologic support protocol (HSP) while on study (see Section 5.8).

          -  Any other medical condition or factor that, in the opinion of the investigator, is
             likely to interfere with completion of the study.
