  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the analgesic effects of thoracal paravertebral block
      in the patients undergoing percutaneous nephrolitotomy. Paravertebral block was applied to
      the study group. Conventional analgesia methods were applied to the control group.

    <textblock>
      Randomization was divided into two groups by using closed envelope method. Postoperative pain
      scores at rest at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 24 hours with VAS (0 = no pain, very severe pain
      = 10) using Visual Analogue Scale was made. VAS at rest and movement (coughing and taking a
      deep Breath) were evaluated. Patients with VAS&gt; 4 received additional analgesics.

    <description>Paravertebral group at Thoracic 9-10 vertebrae level with an in-plane technique advanced ultrasound guided 10 ml bupivacaine hydrochloride (Marcaine 0.5%, Astra Zeneca) in 20 ml volume was enjected in the paravertebral area with real-time visualisation It was observed that the local anesthetic drug spread on the pleura and the pleura was pushed. All blocks were performed by the same experienced anaesthesiologist.</description>

      <textblock>
        ASA I, II, III patients aged 18-65 who consented to undergo unilateral percutaneous
        nephrolithotomy were eligible for the study. 53 patients were eligible and assesed.Informed
        consent was signed by all patients. Patients under 18 years of age, pregnant, with known
        hypersensitivity to local anesthetics, bleeding diathesis, depression and / or anxiety
        disorder, obesity (BMI&gt; 35kg / m2), history of pneumothorax, phrenic nerve paralysis,
        severe aortic stenosis were excluded. Also who did not want to participate the study.
