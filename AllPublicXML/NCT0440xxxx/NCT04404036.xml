  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to test the safety, efficacy and potential mechanism of action of the
      SinuSonic device on adults with eustachian tube dysfunction (ETD) or facial pain/pressure.
      SinuSonic is a medical device that utilizes sound and pressure combined with normal
      breathing. The study will have 3 aims. Aim 1 will examine healthy controls with no signs of
      upper respiratory infection, inflammation, or ETD to determine if exhaled nasal Nitric Oxide
      is increased. Nitric Oxide is a compound in the body that acts as a blood vessel relaxant.
      Acoustic energy (humming) has been shown to increase nasal Nitric Oxide dramatically, thus
      equalization of gas pressures between the middle ear, the paranasal sinuses and the nasal
      cavity may very well explain any efficacy noted. Aim 2 will be performed to examine
      therapeutic efficacy for ETD. Aim 3 will be performed to examine therapeutic efficacy for
      sinus pain/pressure.

    <description>Symptoms severity will be assessed on Visual Analogue Scale (on the scale of 1-10). Visual Analogue Scale is a psychometric response scale which can be used in questionnaires. It is a measurement instrument for subjective characteristics or attitudes that cannot be directly measured.</description>

    <measure>McGill Pain Questionnaire - Short Form</measure>
    <time_frame>2 to 4 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The MPQ-SF is a well-validated pain measure that permits separation of the sensory and affective components of pain, which are averaged to compute a total score. The scale ranges from 0-10 (0=no pain, 10=the most pain).</description>

    <measure>Mean Change in Overall ETDQ-7 Score</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Mean change from baseline to 6 weeks in the overall ETDQ-7 score. The 7-item Eustachian Tube Dysfunction Questionnaire (ETDQ-7) is a validated patient-reported tool measuring ETD symptoms and severity. The 7 items are: pressure in the ears, pain in the ears, a feeling that the participant's ears are clogged or underwater, ear symptoms when the participants have a cold or sinusitis, cracking or popping sounds in the ear, ringing in the ears, and a feeling that the participant's hearing is muffled. Each item is rated from 1 (no problem) to 7 (severe problem) and a mean is calculated for the overall score (range from 1-7). Scores of 1-2 indicate no to mild symptoms, 3-5 moderate, and 6-7 severe symptoms.</description>
