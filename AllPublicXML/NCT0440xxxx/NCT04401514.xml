    <textblock>
      Background: Delirium among patients admitted to an ICU is a common condition associated with
      increased morbidity and mortality. To this point no evidence-based prevention or treatment
      exist for delirium. Non-pharmacological interventions such as early mobilization and
      systematic bundle of care have been suggested to decrease the number of days of delirium. So
      far there exist no studies exploring if delirious patients benefit or not when mobilized to a
      rocking chair with music therapy.

      Objectives: To assess if rocking chair therapy can decrease the burden of delirium in adult,
      critical ill patients admitted to an ICU.

      Design: A clinical initiated multicenter randomized non-blinded trial, of delirious patients
      mobilized to a rocking chair versus no rocking chair.

      Inclusion and exclusion criteria: Inclusion criteria: Adult intensive care patients (18 years
      and above) diagnosed with delirium with a validated screening tool. Exclusion criteria: if
      the patient is evaluated not to be mobilized to a rocking chair and expressing discomfort and
      do not wish to be mobilized, a patient with critical illness neuropati, patients with lever
      coma, patient in ECM treatment, patients that are mentally permanently incompetent, not
      receiving active life support if needed, weight more that 130 kg, if informed consent cannot
      be obtained, if the patient is admitted because of suicide attempt and is the patient have
      delirium tremens.

      Intervention: The experimental intervention is a 20 min. long rocking chair with music
      therapy. Control intervention is also transferred to the rocking chair, but the therapy
      program will not be turned on. Standardized pharmacological and non-pharmacological
      interventions for delirium will continue for both groups. Delirium and consciousness will be
      evaluated twice a day.

      Outcomes: Primary outcome: number of days alive without coma and delirium in the ICU.
      Secondary outcome: Number of days admitted to the ICU and number of patients with at least
      one difference in RASS score before end after the experimental intervention.

      Trial size: A power calculation have estimated that a total number of 76 patients with
      delirium should be included in each study group.

      Time schedule: We estimate that the inclusion period and follow up will as long as 1 year
      from the time the first patient is randomized.

      The intervention is a 30 min long transfer to a rocking chair with music cure therapy. For
      the intervention group, the intervention will be turned on and for the control, the rocking
      and music function will not be turned on.
