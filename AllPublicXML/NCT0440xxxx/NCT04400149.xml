      The aim of this study is to evaluate the amniotic fluid and serum progesterone level and
      pregnancy outcome

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Studies have investigated the relationship between maternal serum progesterone level and low
      birth weight baby birth, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, and early pregnancy bleeding.
      In some cases, patients are supported by oral or vaginal progesterone treatments during
      pregnancy. We also measure the relationship between maternal serum progesterone by measuring
      the level of amnion progesterone; We aimed to analyze the effects on pregnancy outcomes by
      observing preterm birth, premature rupture of membranes, low birth weight, baby gender,
      maternal problems that may occur during pregnancy, fetal problems.

    <description>amniotic fluid progesterone (this group will be evaluated by the amniotic fluid which was received via amniocentesis). This group consisted of pregnant women who had high risk in the antenal test and give consent to perform amniocentesis. Notwithstanding, amniocentesis detects chromosome abnormalities, neural tube defects, and genetic disorders for the fetuses. İn a routine amniocentesis, 1-2 ml amniotic fluid which was taken in the first place was discarded in order to prevent maternal contamination. Then 15-20 ml amniotic fluid was taken from all of the patients to diagnose genetic disorders of the fetuses. İn this study we evaluate the amniotic fluid progesterone in this 1-2 ml amniotic fluid which was discarded and throw away. Therefore, we are not performing an extra invasive procedure for pregnant women</description>

    <description>amniocentesis will be performed to the pregnant women at 16-20 weeks who had a high-risk antenatal test. Furthermore, these women also give a blood sample (at 16-20 weeks) to compare the amniotic fluid and serum progesterone levels in association with pregnancy outcomes. We perform amniocentesis to evaluate genetic disorders in pregnant women who had his risk in the antenal test.</description>
