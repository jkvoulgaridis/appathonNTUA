  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our hypothesis is that cycling DBS stimulation would be superior or non-inferior to regular
      DBS stimulation in Parkinson's disease patients with gait impairment. The objective of this
      study is compare gait disorders in patients with Parkinson's disease and DBS in 4 different
      scenarios: 1) regular continuous high frequency (&gt;130Hz) stimulation, 2) cycling high
      frequency (&gt;130Hz) stimulation (40sec on, 2sec off), 3) low-frequency (80Hz) continuous
      stimulation and 4) cycling low frequency (80Hz) stimulation (40sec on, 2sec off)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gait disorders such as falls, freezing of gait, reduction of speed, shuffling, and
      multi-stepped turning are common in patients with moderate and advanced Parkinson's disease.
      Compared to appendicular symptoms (bradykinesia, tremor, and rigidity), gait disorders tend
      to be more resistant to medical and regular deep brain stimulation treatment, and greatly
      impairs patients' quality of life and daily living activities. Some stimulation strategies
      have been tried to improve gait in Parkinson's disease patients, but so far most of them
      resulted in concomitant worsening of appendicular symptoms. However, new stimulation
      strategies such as cycling stimulation can potentially improve gait disorders without
      impairment of appendicular symptoms.

    <time_frame>Baseline + after 2 weeks + after 4 weeks + after 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The part II of the Unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS II) is a self-reportable questionnaire consisting of 13 items that measure functionality (motor experiences of daily living). Scores vary from 0 - 52. Higher scores mean a worse outcome.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline + after 2 weeks + after 4 weeks + after 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The New Freezing of Gait Questionnaire (NFOG-Q) is a self-reportable questionnaire consisting of 9 items that measure freezing of gait (FOG). Scores vary from 0 - 28. Higher scores mean a worse outcome.</description>

    <measure>Change in Falls Efficacy Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline + after 2 weeks + after 4 weeks + after 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Falls Efficacy Scale (FES) is a sixteen-item test rated on a 10-point scale from not confident at all to completely confident. It is correlated with difficulty getting up from a fall and level of anxiety. Scores vary from 16 - 64. Higher scores mean a worse outcome.</description>

    <measure>Change in The Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline + after 2 weeks + after 4 weeks + after 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire assesses how often people affected by Parkinson's experience difficulties across 8 dimensions of daily living. The 39 item questionnaire offers a patient reported measure of health status and quality of life and is the most frequently used disease-specific health status measure.Scores vary from 0 - 156. Higher scores mean a worse outcome.</description>

    <measure>Change in Activities-Specific Balance Confidence Scale (ABC scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline + after 2 weeks + after 4 weeks + after 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The ABC scale is a self-report measure of balance in performing various activities without losing balance or experiencing a sense of unsteadiness. Scores vary from 0 - 100. Higher scores mean a better outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of falls</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline + after 2 weeks + after 4 weeks + after 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be questioned about number of times they experienced falls in the last 2 weeks. Higher numbers mean a worse outcome.</description>
