      The patients diagnosed with pelvic pain will be included in the study. Orthopedic tests for
      pelvic pain were performed after routine gynecological examinations. After perineometer
      measurement, pelvic floor muscle sensitivity grading, ultrasound, and pain score evaluation,
      participants will be randomized and divided into 3 groups. According to a randomization plan
      the first group will be instructed by a physiotherapist to receive an internal myofascial
      trigger point release technique, the second group receive an external myofascial trigger
      point release technique, and the third group receive a video of relaxation exercises related
      to pelvic pain. After the application, measurement of perineometer and pelvic floor muscle
      sensitivity grading, ultrasound, and pain evaluations will be repeated.

    <textblock>
      Turkey has been affected country from a busy and stressful lifestyle in our changing world
      and that leads to pelvic floor dysfunction has increased rapidly in Turkey. Pelvic pain that
      has in 1 out of every 7 women causes overactivity of pelvic floor muscles with increasing
      stress factors. In addition, it becomes chronic due to both the diagnosis process and the
      time-out of the right treatment and deteriorates the quality of life of women. There is no
      special pelvic floor physiotherapy for the management of pelvic pain in our country, which
      also causes psychosocial problems. On the other hand, myofascial trigger point release
      technique, which is proposed in addition to medical treatment alone or in pelvic floor
      physiotherapy, has been one of the current research areas in the world. However, there is no
      study in the national and international literature comparing internal and external myofascial
      trigger point relaxation techniques and also evaluating transperineal ultrasound. This study
      is unique in terms of comparing two different applications (internal and external trigger
      point relaxation technique) with ultrasound measurements in the literature.

      33 women diagnosed with pelvic pain between the ages of 18-55 will be included in this study.
      Orthopedic tests for pelvic pain will be performed after routine gynecological examinations.
      After perineometer measurement, pelvic floor muscle sensitivity grading, ultrasound and pain
      score evaluation, participants will be randomized and divided into 3 groups. The first group
      will receive internal myofascial trigger point release technique, the second group will
      receive external myofascial trigger point release technique, and the third group will be
      shown a video of relaxation exercises related to pelvic pain. After the application,
      measurement of perineometer and pelvic floor muscle sensitivity grading, ultrasound and pain
      evaluations will be repeated.

    <description>Transperineal ultrasound (Voluson E8 Expert from GE Healthcare with a convex RM6C probe ranging from 2 to 6 Megahertz) will be used to measure the function of the pelvic floor muscles indirectly through morphometry at rest, valsalva and at maximum contraction. This imaging will measure the position of the bladder neck relative to the pubis, the anorectal angle formed by the anus and rectum, the angle formed by the pelvic floor muscles and a horizontal reference line (parallel to the ground ) in addition to the dimensions of the urogenital hiatus which is delimited by the puborectal muscle and which includes the urethra, the vagina and the anus. This method has been evaluated in several studies and demonstrates good intra- and inter-rater fidelity</description>

    <description>Before starting the assessments as suggested by the International Continence Society, the physiotherapist will check via vaginal palpation the participant's ability to contract and relax the pelvic floor muscles. Afterwords, pelvic examination vaginal manometry (using a Peritron perineometer; Cadio Design, Australia) will be performed to measure resting and maximum contraction of the PFMs</description>

    <description>Tenderness of each of the PFMs (pubococcygeus, iliococcygeus, coccygeus, and obturator internus muscles) was assessed using a nonvalidated scale from 0 to 4 (0, no pressure or pain; 1, pressure but no pain; 2, pressure with discomfort; 3, moderate pain intensified with muscle contraction; 4, severe pain or inability to perform muscle contraction because of pain). Manometry and the tenderness assessments will be repeated after 60 minutes from the first assessments</description>

Patients were instructed in internal myofascial release techniques. Experienced pelvic health physiotherapist (A.B.) to use her fingers with a lubricated glove when the finger could easily reach internal trigger points and follows these steps: (a) finding internal and external trigger points associated with pelvic muscles, especially around sensitive areas of the vagina, anus, and/or pelvic floor; (b) releasing with the fingers the trigger point associated pelvic muscle tension by carefully pressing on the trigger point. Releasing pelvic muscle tension includes applying varying amounts of pressure, sometimes gradually stroking and strumming the muscle region while systematically contracting and relaxing the affected muscles to aid in a trigger point release.</description>
