      A phase 2/3 study to determine the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of the candidate
      Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 in healthy UK volunteers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There will be 8 study groups and it is anticipated that a total of 10,560 volunteers will be
      enrolled. Groups 1 &amp; 7 are adults aged 56-69 years; groups 2 &amp; 8 are adults 70 years and
      over; group 3 is children aged 5-12 years; groups 4 and 6 are adults over the age of 18;
      group 5 is adults aged 18-55 years.

      All subjects will undergo follow-up for a total of 1 year post enrolment. Additional visits
      or procedures may be performed at the discretion of the investigators, e.g., further medical
      history and physical examination, or additional blood tests and other investigations if
      clinically relevant

        serostatus for the duration of the study.

        Note: Disclosure of serostatus post enrolment may accidently unblind participants to group
        allocation. Participation in COV002 can only be allowed if volunteers are kept blinded to
        their serology results from local/national serological surveys

          -  Continuous use of anticoagulants, such as coumarins and related anticoagulants (i.e.
             warfarin) or novel oral anticoagulants (i.e. apixaban, rivaroxaban, dabigatran and
             edoxaban)

          -  Suspected or known current alcohol or drug dependency.

          -  Any other significant disease, disorder or finding which may significantly increase

        paracetamol chronically

        Additional Exclusion Criteria to Group 3

          -  Chronic medical conditions such as chronic lung disease, chronic liver disease,
             chronic renal failure, chronic heart disease, congenital genetic syndromes (e.g.
             Trisomy 21)

          -  Fulfil any of the contraindications to vaccination as specified in The Green Book

        Re-vaccination exclusion criteria (two-dose groups only)
