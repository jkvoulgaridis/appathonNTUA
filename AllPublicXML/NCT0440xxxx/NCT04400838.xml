      A phase 2/3 study to determine the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of the candidate
      Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 in healthy UK volunteers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There will be 8 study groups and it is anticipated that a total of 10,560 volunteers will be
      enrolled. Groups 1 &amp; 7 are adults aged 56-69 years; groups 2 &amp; 8 are adults 70 years and
      over; group 3 is children aged 5-12 years; groups 4 and 6 are adults over the age of 18;
      group 5 is adults aged 18-55 years.

      All subjects will undergo follow-up for a total of 1 year post enrolment. Additional visits
      or procedures may be performed at the discretion of the investigators, e.g., further medical
      history and physical examination, or additional blood tests and other investigations if
      clinically relevant
