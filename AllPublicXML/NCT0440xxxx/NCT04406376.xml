  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bell's palsy [BP] is defined as acute idiopathic peripheral facial palsy or paralysis.

      Additional symptoms frequently include pain around or behind the ear, impaired tolerance to
      ordinary levels of noise and disturbed sense of taste on the same side. It affects men and
      women more or less equally.

      There is a consensus in the literature regarding the importance of steroid treatment for
      improving recovery rates and sequela of BP. Moreover, there is increasing level of high
      quality of evidence in recent years for a combined antiviral and steroids treatment for
      severe BP (House Brackmann [HB] 5-6).

      Adverse effects (AEs) were reported in 1-12% of patients treated with steroids, antivirals or
      placebo. The AEs reported were dyspepsia, loss of blood sugar control, headache, fatigue,
      dizziness and insomnia, recurrent duodenal ulcers, mood swings, and acute psychosis. All
      effects resolved when treatment was stopped.

      Although steroid and antivirals are widely used for BP, there is a high variability of
      steroids treatment, both in the dosage given and in the way of tapering down.

      Among the different steroid regimens used were: prednisone 1 mg/kg for 5 days tapered to 10
      mg/day for remaining 5 days; prednisone (1 mg/kg for 10 days then tapered to zero over the
      next 6 days); prednisolone 60 mg for 5 days, 30 mg for 3 days, and 10 mg for 2 days.

      House-Brackmann (HB) system is widely used for facial function assessment. It is based on a
      six-grade score, where grade I is normal function, grade VI is complete absence of facial
      motor function, and grades II to V are intermediate.

      Steroid-induced side effects generally require tapering of the drug as soon as the disease
      being treated is under control. Tapering must be done carefully to avoid both recurrent
      activity of the underlying disease and possible cortisol deficiency resulting from
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) suppression. However, according to a review by
      Furst et al (2019), a patient who has received any dose of glucocorticoid for less than 3
      weeks or patients treated with alternate-day prednisone at a dose of less than 10 mg (or its
      equivalent) are unlikely for HPA suppression. They concluded that short-term glucocorticoid
      therapy (up to three weeks), even if at a fairly high dose, can simply be stopped and need
      not to be tapered..

      According to the above, the investigators assume that a rapid withdrawal of steroids after
      short course of treatment for BP should neither influence the efficacy or safety of
      treatment.

      Finally, steroid regimen may be hard to follow for some patients and can results in confusion
      and frustration. Simplifying steroid regimen, such as skipping withdrawal if not necessary,
      may solve this problem.

      The objective of our study is to determine the effectiveness and safety of prednisone
      treatment with no tapering down for Bell's Palsy.

      A prospective randomized controlled trial of adult patients diagnosed with BP in the
      otolaryngology emergency department within 72 hours of symptoms onset.

      Patients will be randomized to receive one of the following steroids regimens:

        1. Prednisone 1 mg/kg (max. 60 mg) daily for 7 days, 40 mg for 2 days, 20 mg for 2 days
           (Total 11 days)

        2. Prednisone 1 mg/kg (max. 60 mg) daily for 7 days (Total 7 days)

      In addition, both groups will receive the following treatment when indicated:

        -  Mosturizing eye drops for 14 days or until complete recovery (HB-1)

        -  Mosturizing eye gel for 14 days or until complete recovery (HB-1)

        -  Omepradex once daily during prednisone treatment (unless the patient receives chronic
           treatment with any proton pump inhibitor).

        -  Acyclovir for 7 days in cases of severe BP (HB 5-6).

      Patients' follow-up visits: 14 days, 1 month, 3 months. If recovery will be completed before
      1 month, no more follow up visits will be taken.

      In addition, side effects of prednisone use will be assessed as well as compliance to therapy
      and duration of additional symptoms.
