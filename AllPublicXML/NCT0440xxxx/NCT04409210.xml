  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronary heart disease and stroke are belong to the atherosclerotic vascular disease (ASCVD).
      When both occur at the same time, the mortality rate is 19%-37%. Especially when ischemic
      stroke occurs in patients with acute myocardial infarction, the mortality rate is as high as
      36.5%. At present, there is a lack of co-management for the cardio-cerebrovascular diseases.
      Some studies have explored the disease management based on Internet +, but there are still
      challenges in personalized management and improving adherence. Based on Internet + 's
      &quot;co-prevention and co-management&quot; model of cardio-cerebrovascular diseases, this study plans
      to provide personalized intervention by smartphone App to improve the patients'
      self-management, in order to reduce the incidence and mortality of atherosclerotic
      cardio-cerebrovascular events in the high-risk population of cardio-cerebrovascular diseases.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The open label, cluster randomized, controlled clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of
      smartphone App in the management of the high-risk population of cardio-cerebrovascular
      diseases. The trial with 2 main objectives: (1) to provide personalized intervention by
      smartphone App to improve the patients' self-management at least 6 months and (2) to
      determine whether the &quot;co-prevention and co-management&quot; model based on Internet + for at
      least 3 years is superior to routine management model at least 3 years on the outcomes of the
      incidence and mortality of atherosclerotic cardio-cerebrovascular events in the high-risk
      population of cardio-cerebrovascular diseases.

      The trial plans to enroll around 8840 patients in four family physician teams. The four teams
      will be randomly assigned at 1:1 to the intervention group or the control group. Patients are
      assigned related group according to their family physician. All patients need to complete the
      questionnaire and clinical examination. Family physicians and patients in the intervention
      group need to use the smartphone App of this study, doctors use App to provide personalized
      health education, risk assessment, follow-up and reminders to patients. At the same time,
      patients could upload self-test data (such as blood pressure, blood glucose, heart rate and
      weight) and medical institution examination data (such as blood lipids, ECG,
      echocardiography, etc.) through App, while receiving routine treatment. Patients in the
      control group just receive routine treatment and routine management.

Mild cognitive impairment mainly includes the following four indicators:
1) cognitive impairment was reported by patients or insiders, or by experienced physicians; 2) objective evidence of impairment of one or more cognitive domains (from cognitive tests); 3) the complex instrumental ability of daily life can be slightly impaired, but the ability of daily living can be maintained independently; and 4) the diagnosis of dementia has not been reached.</description>

It is convenient for patients to have a clear understanding of their health management, and if there are outliers, they can intervene in time.</description>

    <description>The China-PAR risk prediction tool can be used to stratify the 10-years atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk. Those with predicted risks of &lt;5%, 5-10%, and ≥10% could be classified into categories of low-, moderate-, and high-risk for ASCVD, respectively. It is a risk prediction tool for Chinese developed by the team of Professor Gu Dongfeng of Fuwai Hospital of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. When patients are aware of their risk of cardio-cerebrovascular diseases, it is helpful for patients to take the initiative to manage their cardio-cerebrovascular health.</description>

    <description>Health education is divided into nine modules, such as introduction of cardio-cerebrovascular diseases, diet, exercise, sleep, psychology, medicine, cardiopulmonary resuscitation and cardiac self-rescue technology. The presentation of health education includes three modules: text, video and voice. Video and voice modules are more suitable for illiterates or people are inconvenient to read text. It mainly takes into account the fact that most of the high-risk population of cardio-cerebrovascular diseases are the elderly.</description>

If abnormal data is found, it will inform the patient in red font and remind the patient to consult the doctor in time. Patients can consult their family doctors directly online through App or go to the hospital.
Medication reminder After patients upload their own medication information, the App will automatically generate a medication alarm clock to remind patients to take the drugs.
Follow-up reminder According to the clinical diagnosis and conditions of patients, make personalized follow-up time. Family physicians could use the App to remind patients to fill in the follow-up form or go to the hospital.</description>
