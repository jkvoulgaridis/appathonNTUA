  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will focus on effectiveness and safety of rivaroxaban (Xarelto) when given together
      with acetylsalicylic acid (combination therapy) to patients suffering from coronary artery
      disease (a condition that affects the blood vessels supplying the heart) and / or peripheral
      artery disease (a condition that affects the blood vessels of the lower limbs) in the routine
      clinical practice. The study will help to collect data for prevention cardiovascular death,
      myocardial infarction (MI), stroke and major adverse limb events in adult patients. The study
      will focus on information on when and why physicians are starting to treat patients with
      combination therapy, treatment duration, reasons to discontinue treatment and previous
      therapies. The study will also investigate treatment outcomes for patients being treated with
      a combination therapy by their physicians.
