    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, single-arm, phase II clinical trial to evaluate to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of first line atezolizumab in combination with paclitaxel
      and bevacizumab (Avastin®) in patients with advanced or metastatic triple-negative breast
      cancer (mTNBC)
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Men and women age ≥ 18 years with previously untreated unresectable locally advanced or
      metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) that is not amenable to resection with
      curative intent regardless of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) status.

      The number of patients to be included is 100 patients. The primary objective is to evaluate
      the efficacy -in terms of progression-free survival (PFS)- of first line atezolizumab in
      combination with paclitaxel and bevacizumab (Avastin®) in patients with unresectable locally
      advanced or metastatic TNBC.

      After signing the ICF and confirmed eligibility, patients will begin treatment on 28 days
      cycles: Atezolizumab (840 mg) intravenously on days 1 and 15; Paclitaxel (90 mg/m2) via IV
      infusion on days 1, 8 and 15; Bevacizumab (Avastin® 10mg/kg) intravenously on days 1 and 15.

      Patients will receive treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, death, or
      discontinuation from the study treatment for any other reason.

      Patients discontinuing the study treatment will enter a post- treatment follow-up period
      until death, withdrawal of consent, patient is lost to follow-up, or study termination.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Signed informed consent form (ICF) prior to participation in any study-related
             activities.

          2. Male or female patients ≥ 18 years at the time of signing ICF.

          3. Ability to comply with the study protocol, in the investigator's judgment.

          4. Histologically confirmed TNBC -regardless of PD-L1 status- per American Society of
             Clinical Oncology (ASCO)/College of American Pathologists (CAP) criteria based on
             local testing on the most recent analyzed biopsy. Triple-negative is defined as &lt;1%
             expression for estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PgR) as determined by
             immunohistochemistry (IHC) and negative for HER2 (0-1+ by immunohistochemistry [IHC]
             or 2+ and negative by in situ hybridization [ISH] test).

          5. Unresectable locally advanced or metastatic disease documented by computerized
             tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that is not amenable to
             resection with curative intent.

          6. No prior chemotherapy and/or targeted therapy and/or immunotherapy and/or
             antiangiogenic agent for MBC. Patients who have received (neo)adjuvant taxane-based
             chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy and/or an antiangiogenic agent are required to have
             a disease-free interval (DFI) of at least 12 months after completion of each of these
             treatments. For (neo)adjuvant non-taxane-based chemotherapy, a DFI of at least 6
             months is required.

          7. Resolution of all acute toxic effects of prior anti-cancer therapy to grade ≤ 1 as
             determined by the NCI-CTCAE v.5.0 (except for alopecia, grade ≤ 2 peripheral
             neuropathy, or other toxicities not considered a safety risk for the patient at
             investigator's discretion).

          8. Evidence of measurable disease or non-measurable disease as per RECIST v.1.1. Patients
             with only bone lesions are also eligible.

          9. Willingness and ability to provide the most recent tumor biopsy since last progression
             from either metastatic or primary tissues at the time of the inclusion to perform
             exploratory studies. If not feasible, patient eligibility should be evaluated by a
             Sponsor's qualified designee. An additional tumor biopsy from either metastatic or
             primary (only if metastatic biopsies cannot be obtained for inaccessible lesion or
             subject safety concern) tissues would be collected at disease progression or study
             termination whenever it is feasible.

             Note: Patients for whom tumor biopsies cannot be obtained (e.g., inaccessible tumor or
             safety concern) may submit archived pathological material from either metastatic or
             primary sites, but the most recent tumor biopsy from the patient should be obtained
             when available.

         10. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0 or 1.

         11. Life expectancy of ≥12 weeks.

                  count (ANC) &gt; 1.5 X 109/L (without granulocyte colony- stimulating factor [G-CSF]
                  support within 2 weeks prior to Cycle 1 Day1); Lymphocyte count 3 0.5 x 109/L
                  (500μL); Platelet count 3 75.0 x 109/L (without transfusion within 2 weeks prior
                  to Cycle 1 Day 1); Hemoglobin &gt; 9.0 g/dL (Patients may be transfused or receive
                  erythropoietic treatment to meet this criterion).

                  Note: Patients cannot be transfused platelets within 14 days prior to C1D1 to
                  meet this criterion. The use of G-CSF within 14 days prior to C1D1 is also
                  prohibited.

                  urinalysis (trace proteinuria is allowed). In cases of proteinuria at least 1+ by
                  urinalysis, proteinuria should be less than 500 mg by 24-hour urine collection.

               5. Coagulation: For patients not receiving therapeutic anticoagulation: Partial
                  Thromboplastin Time (PTT) (or activated Partial Thromboplastin Time [aPTT]) and

         17. Extracranial radiotherapy or limited-field palliative radiotherapy within seven days
             prior to study enrolment, or patients who have not recovered from radiotherapy-related
             toxicities to baseline or grade ≤ 1.

         18. Treatment with investigational therapy within 28 days prior to initiation of study
             treatment.

         19. Treatment with systemic immunosuppressive medication within 2 weeks prior to
             initiation of study treatment (including, but not limited to, corticosteroids,
             cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, methotrexate, thalidomide, and anti-TNF-a agents) or
             anticipation of need for systemic immunosuppressive medication during study treatment,
             with the following exceptions:

             Note 1: Patients who have received acute, low-dose systemic immunosuppressant
             medication or a one-time pulse dose of systemic immunosuppressant medication (e.g., 48
             hours of corticosteroids for a contrast allergy) are eligible for the study after
             Medical Monitor approval has been obtained.

             Note 2: Patients who are receiving mineralocorticoids (e.g., fludrocortisone), inhaled
             corticosteroids for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma, or
             low-dose corticosteroids for orthostatic hypotension or adrenal insufficiency are
             eligible for the study.

         20. Chronic daily intake of antiplatelet drugs (e.g., aspirin doses of 325 mg/day or
             higher or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication known to inhibit platelet
             function).

         21. History of severe allergic anaphylactic reactions to chimeric or humanized antibodies
             or

         22. Any other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical condition that would, in the
             investigator's judgement, contraindicate patient participation in the clinical study.

         23. Concurrent participation in other interventional clinical trials.
