  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mounting evidence suggests that closed-loop brain-training, commonly known as neurofeedback
      (NFB), may represent a new therapeutic opportunity for patients with Attentional
      Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), which manifests as difficulties with attention and
      inhibitory control. In this context, the investigators have focused on an attention-enhancing
      form of NFB based on the EEG alpha rhythm, known to influence sensory detection and
      attention. In light of recent evidence showing that both attention and impulsivity can be
      modified with a single-session of alpha-NFB, the objective is to determine whether these
      effects stabilize in the long-term, after multiple, daily sessions of training at home.

      A short- (single-session) and a long-term (multi-session) experimental design will be used to
      collect EEG, behavioral, and clinical data pre-to-post NFB. The single-blind study will
      recruit 48 adult ADHD participants randomly assigned to either NEUROFEEDBACK or CONTROL
      groups. Each participant will undergo individual at home sessions of 45-minute video-replay
      of popular television (TV) series while recording their 1-channel EEG (30 sessions, 5
      sessions/week, 6 weeks total). In the NEUROFEEDBACK group, self-regulation of alpha rhythm
      will be reflected in the dynamically varying opacity of the video-replay window, i.e. the
      window would turn lighter/darker and reveal/obscure video content during episodes of low/high
      alpha amplitude, respectively. In the CONTROL group, the recording will be passive without
      real-time EEG neurofeedback (i.e. constant brightness and volume). Before and after at home
      training, each participant will have two visits in the lab: (1) complete clinical and
      neuropsychological evaluation and (2) EEG session including resting state and task-related
      EEG before and after a short NFB intervention (30 minutes). For the CONTROL group
      participants, the latter will be replaced by a sham intervention utilizing non-contingent
      feedback.

      Given that stronger alpha rhythmicity is associated with increases in inhibitory/excitatory
      balance, it is expected that alpha-NFB (i) will homeostatically normalize alpha rhythm power
      and (ii) the degree of normalization will be a dimensional predictor of individual
      improvement in behavioral and clinical measures of executive function, impulsivity and
      inattention. These results should lay the foundation for building neurocognitive treatments,
      by harnessing neuroplasticity mechanisms intrinsic to the brain.
