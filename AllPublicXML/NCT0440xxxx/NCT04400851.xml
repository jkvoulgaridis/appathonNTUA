      This is a single center, single arm, open-label and phase I clinical study. The standard 3 +
      3 group design was performed. Patients were enrolled by the design of phase I study standard.
      Sintilimab was divided into three dose levels: 1 mg / kg, 3 mg / kg, and 10 mg / kg. Dose
      escalation was carried out from the first level of sintilimab. The study is to evaluate the
      safety, including dose limited toxicity (DLT) in the treatment of advanced, recurrent, and
      refractory childhood cancer.

      Malignant tumors are the second leading cause of death in China after accidental casualties,
      which is consistent with developed countries in Europe and America.

      Sintilimab is a human monoclonal antibody against PD-1 receptor which was developed in China.
      It can block the binding of PD-1 of T-lymphocyte and PD-L1 on the surface of tumor cells,
      release the immunosuppression of tumor cells on immune cells, making immune cells play the
      role of anti-tumor cell immunity again and kill tumor cells. In the past, the development of
      immunocheckpoint drugs mainly focused on adult cancer. Immunocheckpoint inhibition has
      achieved many successes in the adult population, including metastatic melanoma, non-small
      cell lung cancer, Hodgkin's lymphoma, bladder cancer and head and neck cancer.

      In the past, the development of immunocheckpoint drugs mainly focused on adult cancer.
      Immunocheckpoint inhibition has achieved many successes in adult population. However, some
      results of the clinical trials of immunocheckpoint inhibitors in children are also promising
      especially in Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      The investigators aimed to determine the maximum tolerable dose and effectiveness in
      pediatric malignant tumors, so as to lay the foundation for the future phase II / III
      clinical research.
