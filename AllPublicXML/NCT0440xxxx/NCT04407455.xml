      The study will investigate to verify whether pediatric dentists could determine chewing
      performance level by using Karaduman Chewing Performance Scale in children.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The KCPS was developed by physical therapists who had expertise in pediatric swallowing
      disorders. This scale could be used as a practical tool to define chewing disorders as a
      common language for professionals due to its quick and easy to use features. However, its
      reliability in other professions has not been verified. The study will investigate to verify
      whether pediatric dentists could determine chewing performance level by using Karaduman
      Chewing Performance Scale in children.

    <description>The Karaduman Chewing Performance Scale is a 5 level ordinal scale between 0 to 4. Level 0 indicates Normal chewing, level 4 means No biting and chewing. Higher levels mean worse chewing performance level.</description>
