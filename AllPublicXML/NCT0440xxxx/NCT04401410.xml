  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SARS-CoV2-specific T cell lines have been made at Baylor College of Medicine from healthy
      donors who have made a full recovery from COVID19. The cells are then frozen.These cells will
      be used to treat patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who are at high risk of
      requiring mechanical ventilation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Earlier, a healthy donor provided blood cells to generate donor SARS-CoV2-specific T cell
      product. These cells were grown and frozen for later use. Before being treated, the patient
      will receive a series of standard medical tests:

        -  Physical exam and history including height and weight

        -  SARS-CoV-2 test

        -  Blood tests

        -  Chest X-ray or chest CT Scan if not already done in the past 48 hours.

        -  A urine pregnancy test, when applicable

      These tests are done to assess the patient's eligibility to receive the cells. On the day
      that the patient is scheduled to receive the cells they will be pre-medicated with Benadryl
      and Tylenol. If a match is identified from the bank, the SARS-CoV-2 T cells will be thawed
      and given to the patient through an intravenous line. All participants on this study will be
      infused with the same number (dose) of cells and monitored for infusion side effects for up
      to 14 days or until infusion side effects have completely resolved, whichever is longer. To
      learn more about the way the cells are working in the patient's body, up to an extra 30-40 ml
      (6-8 teaspoons) of blood may be taken before the infusion and then up to daily for 14 days or
      until the patient is discharged from the hospital. We also may collect samples from the
      patient at later timepoints (2 and 3 months after infusion) but these are optional.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by PCR from a nasopharyngeal swab or other accepted
             specimen type &lt; 5 days before planned T cell infusion

          2. Currently hospitalized adult patient (≥ 18 years of age) requiring medical care for
             COVID19, who provides informed consent (informed consent maybe obtained
             electronically)

          3. Peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) ≥ 92% on room air

          4. Hgb ≥ 7.0 gm/dl

          5. Available SARS-CoV2- specific T lymphocyte line

          6. Negative pregnancy test (if applicable)

          7. Patient or parent/guardian capable of providing informed consent

          8. Evidence of radiographic pulmonary infiltrates. Any chest radiographic findings which
             would be consistent with COVID19 would qualify (Eg: ground glass opacities, multifocal
             infiltrates etc.)

          9. High risk of requiring mechanical ventilation as defined by at least two of the
             following:

               2. Hypertension

               3. Chronic cardiovascular disease other than HTN that in the investigators opinion
                  would worsen potential adverse effects of T cell therapy

               4. Diabetes Mellitus

                  syndromes, prior treatment with chemotherapy &gt; 3 months ago but per investigators
                  discretion could have lingering effects on the immune system, eg: chemotherapy
                  regimens for lymphomas, ALL or AML etc.

        Exclusion Criteria:
