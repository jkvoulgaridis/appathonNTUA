  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase Ⅰ study of Donafenib, an oral multikinase inhibitor that targets Raf kinase and
      receptor tyrosine kinases, is to assess safety and pharmacokinetics in patients with Relapsed
      AML.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Donafenib is a multikinase inhibitor which is acting on various cellular pathways involved in
      the genesis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Donafenib is therefore a promising candidate for
      improvement of chemotherapy results in AML. This clinical trial evaluates the safety and
      pharmacokinetics of Donafenib combination with Cytarabine/Daunorubicin for AML in patients
      between 18 and 55 years of age.
