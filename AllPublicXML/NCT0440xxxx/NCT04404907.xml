  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to: a) identify enablers and barriers to deliberate ultraviolet
      light exposure by young sexual minority men (SMM), and b) quantify the extent of their
      deliberate ultraviolet light exposure.

      Aim 1: To develop survey items to assess tanning attitudes and behaviors Nine survey items
      used by the PI in previous deliberate tanning research were adapted with the expert consensus
      of members of Northwestern's Institute for Sexual and Gender Minority Health and Wellbeing.
      Discussions with the PI, research personnel and members of the institute developed the
      hypothesis that in addition to the previously reported appearance motivations young SMM may
      be engaging in tanning (indoors or outdoors) as a social activity. A tenth survey item was
      developed to assess deliberate tanning as a social activity.

      Aim 2: Analyze the tanning attitudes and behavior data acquired in an online survey of young
      adult sexual minority males, who regularly participate in the RADAR study.

      RADAR is a longitudinal study with cohorts from the greater Chicago region recruited between
      2008 and 2015. The 10 survey items about tanning attitudes and behaviors were added to the
      online survey that examines SMMs' behavior in the prior 6 months. This is a secondary
      analysis of registry data acquired by the RADAR study.

    <description>For test-retest reliability of the 10 items, 50 participants would allow a two-category kappa to be estimated to within Â±0.15 using 95% confidence intervals assuming that Cronbach's alpha values were 0.6 or higher.</description>

    <description>The demographic characteristics of the population will be compared for never purposely tan vs ever purposely tan with chi square tests. The primary analysis will be analysis of variance (ANOVA) for the mean Likert scale values of the 10 self-reported survey items. Multiple logistic regression will be used to determine the odds ratio (OR) and independence of predictors of deliberate ultraviolet light exposure to get a tan.</description>
