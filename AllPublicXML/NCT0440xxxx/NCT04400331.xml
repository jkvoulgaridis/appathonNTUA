  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, open-label study to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of
      valbenazine, and to provide subjects continued access to valbenazine for the treatment of
      chorea associated with Huntington disease.

    <description>The TMC is part of the motor assessment of the UHDRS and measures chorea in 7 different body parts including the face, oral-buccal-lingual region, trunk and each limb independently. The TMC score is the sum of the individual scores and ranges from 0 to 28. A decrease in score indicates improvement in chorea.</description>
