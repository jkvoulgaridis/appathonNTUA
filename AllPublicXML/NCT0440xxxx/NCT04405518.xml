  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is a national multicentre clinical study, where 3 hospitals are involved: Bellvitge
      University Hospital, Clinic Hospital of Barcelona and Cruces Hospital of Bilbao). It is a
      randomized study based on the Hemoglobin value of the patient with a 1:1 ratio, parallel
      groups, controlled and single blind, in patients undergoing an orthotopic liver transplant,
      confirming previously that the participants fulfill all the inclusion criteria and none of
      exclusion.

      A total of 176 patients will be included (88 per group) and each center can not include more
      than 40% of the sample to avoid bias.

      Blood samples will be analyzed at different times of the surgical intervention by an
      electronic device called thromboelastogram. It evaluates the blood clot characteristics and,
      depending on the results, assesses the need to correct values by the administration of
      fibrinogen or platelets.

      One of the coagulation parameter evaluated and corrected by thromboelastogram is called
      A10FIBTEM. In a previous study, the investigators have seen that maintaining some specific
      ranges in the A10FIBTEM, results in a decrease of the use of blood products. That's why the
      investigators have created 2 groups:

        -  The control group will be corrected up to a value of A10FIBTEM = 8mm.

        -  The intervention group will be corrected up to a value of A10FIBTEM = 11mm.

      Subsequently, results between groups will be compared. The investigators have to consider
      that the drug used in this study (Riastap) is an authorized and commercial drug.

      The main objective is to demonstrate that the administration of fibrinogen in the
      intervention group compared to the control group changes the administration of red blood
      cells pack during the liver transplant and in the first 24 hours after.

      Secondary objectives consist in demonstrate that in the intervention group, there is also a
      change in the administration of other blood products, a change in acute renal damage, a
      change in hours of mechanical ventilation, no changes in thrombotic events in the hepatic
      graft or in the patient in the first 90 days of the liver transplant and no changes in re
      operations, re-transplantation, or mortality during the first 90 days of the liver
      transplant, compared to the control group.

Thromboelastometry value (A10 FIBTEM) of 11mm (study group) or
Thromboelastometry value (A10 FIBTEM) of 8mm (control group) The doses of fibrinogen will be calculated acording to the formula based on previous study (AJT2017), rounded to the higher value according to the presentation format of the drug.
