  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study design is a prospective, randomized, controlled trial evaluating the cosmetic and
      functional outcomes of nail bed repairs with and without eponychial stents. Patients
      presenting to a single institution with a finger tip injury requiring a nail bed repair will
      be initially evaluated in the emergency department. The purpose of the study will be
      explained to the patient, and informed consent for participation will be obtained. Patients
      will be randomly assigned to either the eponychial stent or no eponychial stent group based
      on the last digit of their assigned medical record number. Even-numbered patients will be
      randomized to the stent group and odd-numbered patients will be randomized to the no stent
      group. Demographic data will be obtained and recorded (age, gender, hand dominance, mechanism
      of injury, and past medical history). All patients will undergo a thorough clinical exam
      under digital nerve block followed by removal of the nail plate and thorough irrigation and
      debridement of devitalized tissue. The nail bed repair will be performed with 6-0 chromic
      suture material. After the nail bed repair, a stent (native nail, suture container foil, or
      nonadherent gauze) will or will not secured under the eponychial fold with suture depending
      on randomization. Laceration characteristic and time required to perform the procedure will
      be recorded. A nonadherent sterile dressing will be applied to the digit, and each patient
      will be discharged with a 5-day course of cephalexin for prophylaxis against infection.
      Follow-up evaluation will occur at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months. A each follow-up
      visit, patient-perceived functional outcome, cosmetic outcome, and level of pain will be
      assessed using a 10-point analog scale. Cosmetic results will also be evaluated by the
      examining physician using a validated physician-based outcome tool.

    <description>The nail bed repair will be performed with 6-0 chromic suture material. After the nail bed repair, an eponychial stent will be secured under the eponychial fold with suture. The stent can be the native nail plate, suture container foil, or nonadherent gauze (i.e. Xeroform). If the injury avulsed the nail plate and the patient presents without it, either the foil from the suture wrapper/container or a piece of nonadherent gauze (i.e. Xeroform) will be used as a stent. A nonadherent sterile dressing will be applied to the digit, and each patient will be discharged with a 5-day course of cephalexin for prophylaxis against infection.</description>
