  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to design, implement, and evaluate the impact of an adapted
      health information technology(IT)-enabled practice model for asthma symptom monitoring using
      patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in a primary care setting. Adults over 18 years of age with
      asthma will be recruited at four primary care clinics and randomized to either 1) asthma
      symptom monitoring via the mobile health (mHealth) app; or 2) usual care. The investigators
      will collect data on patient-reported asthma quality of life and asthma-related healthcare
      utilization. We will also study barriers and facilitators to implementation of the mHealth
      app and health IT-enabled practice model.

      The specific aims of this study are:

        1. Adapt our existing health IT-enabled practice model for asthma symptom monitoring using
           PROs to a primary care population. The health IT-enabled practice model is comprised of
           the following: an mHealth app that can be installed on patients' smartphones that
           integrates into clinical workflow; and an asthma PRO dashboard in the electronic health
           record (EHR) for clinicians.

        2. Implement the adapted health IT-enabled practice model in 4 primary care community
           clinics, identify a cohort of eligible asthma patients to participate, and train
           clinicians and clinical staff.

        3. Rigorously evaluate the impact of this new health IT-enabled practice model using a
           randomized controlled trial study in which we enroll 500 asthma patients (250
           intervention, 250 usual care) by primary care clinician. We will measure
           patient-reported asthma quality of life and asthma-related healthcare utilization
           (defined as urgent care and emergency room visits and hospitalizations) as our primary
           and secondary outcomes, respectively. We will use mixed methods to identify barriers and
           facilitators to implementation and factors that affect sustainable spread and scale as
           per the Non-adoption, Abandonment, Scale-up, Spread, and Sustainability (NASSS)
           framework.
