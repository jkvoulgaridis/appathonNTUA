      The purpose of this investigator-initiated trial is to compare the effect of a daily
      injection of insulin degludec vs. basal insulin delivery via Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin
      Infusion (CSII), both in combination with bolus insulin delivery via the patient's usual
      insulin pump with insulin aspart, on glycemic variability, overall blood glucose control and
      incidence of hypoglycemia, all assessed by continuous glucose monitor (CGM), as well as
      patient satisfaction, in patients with type 1 diabetes currently using CSII.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to determine whether insulin degludec will provide an
      equally stable and consistent basal glycemic profile with lower glycemic variability as
      determined by Continuous Glucose Monitoring compared to insulin aspart delivered by
      Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion in patients with type 1 diabetes experienced in use
      of insulin pump therapy. Specifically, this study will determine if the percent time in the
      target glycemic range (70 to 180 mg/dl) by Continuous Glucose Monitoring is superior using
      insulin degludec than continuously infused insulin aspart, and if degludec is associated with
      lower glucose variability as assessed by the standard deviation (SD) of the mean daily
      glucose by Continuous Glucose Monitoring. Particular attention will be given to the nocturnal
      glucose profile (from midnight to 6 am) which most closely reflects basal insulin action as
      it is typically the time of day least affected by bolus insulin, food intake or exercise.
      Quality of life questionnaires regarding treatment preference will be used to capture patient
      preference for method of basal insulin delivery.

      RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

      Study hypothesis:

      It is anticipated, based on the low glycemic variability of insulin degludec shown in glucose
      clamp studies and seen in clinical practice, that insulin degludec will provide more stable
      24 hour basal insulin action than insulin aspart by Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion
      (CSII) in patients with type 1 diabetes.

      Primary endpoint:

      Percent time in euglycemia (BG 70 to 180 mg/dl) by Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) during
      the final 14 days of each treatment period during steady state (with basal insulin delivery
      as either one daily injection of insulin degludec or as insulin aspart via CSII).

      Study type:

      This will be a randomized, cross-over, open label, single-center study consisting of a 20
      week period on each of two basal insulin delivery methods, both in combination with insulin
      aspart with boluses taken by insulin pump. Each 20 week period will consist of a 4 week
      insulin optimization period for titration of basal and bolus insulin doses, followed by a 16
      week maintenance period. The final 2 weeks of the maintenance period during each treatment
      arm will be used for endpoint data collection. The treatment sequence will occur in random
      order. The study population will include patients with type 1 diabetes with good baseline
      glycemic control who are experienced in the use of both CSII and CGM; the cross-over design
      allows each subject to serve as his or her own control.

    <masking>None (Open Label)</masking>
    <masking_description>This is an unblinded study as the two basal insulin delivery methods (degludec via injection vs. aspart via CSII) cannot be blinded. One group of patients will first use degludec for 20 weeks then switch to CSII for 20 weeks. As all eligible patients who sign the IRB consent form are identified, a random number will be generated to determine the treatment with which they begin first. The other group of patients will start with CSII and after 20 weeks switch to Tresiba for 20 weeks. Randomization sequence will be determined by computerized randomization program. All patients will receive both treatments unless they drop out. Dropouts are unlikely since the participants are all regular continuing patients of the site's clinical practice.</masking_description>

    <description>In the aspart-Only group, the subject will only take aspart through the their pump. This study population will have an established expertise in diabetes self-management with previous knowledge of insulin pump therapy and Dexcom Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM). Allowing the subjects to use their insulin pumps for bolus insulin delivery, as they are accustomed, will minimize the chances of skipping meal boluses and correction doses. Aspart is put into their pump and delivered to their body through a small tube placed under your skin. In this NovoLog®-only treatment group, the subject will take aspart with each meal while your pump also gives you a slow, continuous dose of aspart for basal insulin. This treatment group is very similar (or even identical) to the treatment the subject was receiving prior to starting the study.</description>

    <description>This study population will have an expertise in diabetes self-management with their insulin pump and Dexcom CGM. In the Novolog® and Tresiba® group, the subject will still take aspart via their pump for meals and correction boluses, but they will reduce the slow trickle (basal insulin) programmed in their pump to almost zero. Instead of receiving their normal basal insulin via CSII, the subject will injected degludec once or twice daily from an insulin pen for your basal insulin.</description>

    <description>A population of well controlled patients with type 1 diabetes who are experienced in the use of both Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion (CSII) and Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM) was chosen in order to assess the effect of the change in glycemic profile using two different methods of basal insulin delivery. Allowing the subjects to use their insulin pumps for bolus insulin delivery, as they are accustomed, will minimize the chances of skipping meal boluses and correction doses.
Replacing basal insulin delivery by CSII with a single daily injection of degludec will add minimal, if any, treatment burden which will be offset by potential therapeutic benefits. These benefits include the potential for reduced glycemic variability and the elimination of the risk of hyperglycemia and DKA with basal insulin interruption which can occur with infusion set occlusion or disgorging inherent to Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion.</description>
