      This 6-month, naturalistic cohort study examines male and female inpatients aged 18 to 75
      years i) with any form of unipolar depressive episode (cohort 1); ii) clinical diagnosis of a
      moderate or severe unipolar depressive episode and suicidal tendencies who agree to
      participate in a prospective study (cohort 2); and moderate or severe unipolar depressive
      episodes validated by research interviews and and suicidal tendencies that persist for at
      least 48 hours after admission who are followed up for 6 months (cohort 3).

    <textblock>
      Epidemiological cross-sectional study in over 3000 inpatients with a clinical diagnosis of
      major depressive disorder, validation of the clinical diagnosis in 520 patients, and
      prospective naturalistic 6-month follow-up study of 260 adults with a research
      interview-confirmed major depressive disorder, with data collection at the following points:
      at T0 = time of hospitalization (epidemiological study population 1 with data from clinical
      routine practice), at time T1 of baseline survey in patients with persistent suicidal
      tendencies, i.e. at least 48 hours after T0 (study population 2 as a subgroup of study
      population 1, with study information and consent), and in study population 3 (subgroup of
      study population 2, with study information and consent) at the time of discharge (T2), 3
      months after admission to hospital (T3/ by telephone) and 6 months after inpatient admission
      (T4).

      The aim of the study is to characterize the remission or recurrence of suicidal symptoms in
      the context of a depressive episode. It is expected that the results will help to improve the
      understanding of the disease process and the further development of effective intervention
      options.
