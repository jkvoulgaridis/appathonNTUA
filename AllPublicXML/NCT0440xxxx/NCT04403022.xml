      To confirm the safety and performance of the da Vinci SP Surgical System, Instruments and
      Accessories in a complex colorectal procedure such as low anterior resections.

      Primary Performance:

        -  The primary performance endpoint will be assessed as the ability to complete the planned
           da Vinci SP-assisted colorectal procedure without conversion to an alternate approach.
           Conversion* to an alternate approach comprises conversion to open, multiport
           laparoscopic**, multiport robotic or hand-assisted§ approach requiring undocking of the
           da Vinci SP Surgical System in order to complete the planned procedure using the
           alternate approach.

             -  Performing an extracorporeal anastomosis is not considered a conversion ** Use of
                additional assistant laparoscopic port(s) is not considered a conversion §
                Laparoscopic or robotic with hand assistance

      Primary Safety:

      • The primary safety endpoint will be assessed as the incidence of all intraoperative and
      post-operative adverse events that occur through the 42-day follow-up period
