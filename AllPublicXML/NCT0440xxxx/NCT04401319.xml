  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Severe brain injury could cause chronic disorders of consciousness (DOC). Treating DOC
      patients to improve recovery remains very challenging. A few randomized controlled studies
      have been published in the recent years, focusing on non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS)
      treatments to improve patients' neurobehavioural functioning. Among NIBS, repetitive
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique that
      can modulate cortical excitability, enhance neural plasticity, and induce strong
      neuromodulatory effects that outlast the period of stimulation. It is thought to modulate
      cortical activity and could therefore be effective for treating DOC patients. Currently,
      there is no unified protocol for rTMS in DOC patients and studies vary in many aspects.

      In this study, the investigators aim to improve the functional recovery of DOC patients
      following severe brain injury using rTMS in two multi-center double-blind studies.

      Methods/design:

      The investigators will recruit 90 DOC patients. Patients will have three rTMS sessions that
      will be randomized within patients in a crossover design: (i) one real stimulation on the
      left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC); (ii) one real stimulation on the left angular
      cortex (AG) and (iii) one sham stimulation. Sessions will be separated by at least 5 days
      washout period. Each stimulation session will last 20 minutes with a frequency of 20Hz (train
      duration: 4s; inter-train interval: 26s; 3200 pulses at 80% of the resting motor threshold -
      RMT). The RMT, i.e., the minimum stimulus intensity that generated a motor evoked potential
      response of at least 50μV at rest for 5 out of 10 trials, will be calculated for the
      stimulation target using single-pulses on the right abductor pollicis brevis muscle.

      After an interval of one week, a parallel design study will begin. Ninety patients will be
      randomly divided in two experimental groups and one sham group (30 patients per group).
      Stimulation will be performed for 20 working days once a day with the same stimulation
      parameters as in the crossover study.

      Primary outcome will be determined as behavioral response to treatment as measured using the
      Coma Recovery Scale - Revised (CRS-R). Resting-state high-density EEG will be also recorded
      to investigate the neurophysiological correlates by rTMS.

      Discussion:

      This study will contribute to define the role of rTMS for the treatment of DOC patients and
      characterise the neural correlates of its action. In addition, the investigators will define
      the responders' profile based on patients' characteristics and functional impairments and
      develop biomarkers of responsiveness using machine learning to categorize EEG signals
      according to clinical responsiveness to the treatment.

    <description>The Coma Recovery Scale - Revised is a non-invasive behavioural examination. It contains 23 items hierarchically presented and divided in 6 sub-scales (auditory, visual, motor, oro-motor/verbal, communication and arousal). The score is based on presence or absence of behaviours in response to sensory stimulations. The quantitative score can be calculated by adding the best observed response in each sub-scale. The diagnosis is obtained from the quality of observed behaviours (e.g., the ability of visual tracking means that the patient is minimally conscious). The total score ranges between 0 and 23. Higher scores mean a better outcome.</description>
