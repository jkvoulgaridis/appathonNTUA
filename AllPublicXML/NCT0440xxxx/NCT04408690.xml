  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, most patients with an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury undergo surgery.
      There is a general belief that surgical reconstruction is necessary to return to sport safely
      and to limit premature knee osteoarthrosis or additional meniscal damage. However, there is
      unsufficient scientific evidence for this belief. Moreover, several studies show that a
      reconstruction does not guarantee successful return to sports or the prevention of
      osteoarthritis or meniscal injuries at all. Therefore, an immediate surgery after an ACL
      injury is more and more questioned. The only qualitative RCT that exists (KANON trial) could
      not demonstrate that an immediate reconstruction is an added value (in terms of symptoms,
      knee function, activity level, osteoarthritis or incidental meniscal damage) compared to a
      conservative approach consisting of progressive rehabilitation and delayed surgery if there
      was persistent knee instability.

      In a future multicenter RCT the investigators want to 1) verify these results and 2) search
      for predictors that predict which patients from the conservative group do well without
      delayed surgery. This information is invaluable to physicians as it allows them to decide
      which treatment is best for the patient.

      Before performing a large, adequately-powered RCT that compares both treatment options, the
      investigators will run a pilot study that assesses the feasibility to recruit ACL patients
      for such RCT. This seems necessary, as many patients still believe that timely surgery is a
      prerequisite for restoring knee function, for returning to sports and for preventing
      cartilage degeneration. These preferences for surgery might affect recruitment and adherence
      to the protocol. Therefore, a pilot study will performed that demonstrates whether a large
      RCT is feasible with regard to 1) participant recruitment, 2) adherence to the treatment arm
      they were allocated to and 3) protocol feasibility. The findings of this pilot study will
      help deciding about progressing to a future definitive RCT.

    <description>No guidelines on type of ACL reconstruction will be imposed to keep the trial pragmatic. The decision of graft type and surgery technique is a clinical decision made by the orthopaedic surgeons of the participating centra.
This surgery will be performed within 12 weeks after the ACL injury.</description>

    <description>If a patient complains about persistent symptomatic instability of the knee or the inability to progress in rehabilitation, delayed surgery can be considered. ACL insufficiency induced instability in combination with a positive pivot shift and an additional MRI are needed to confirm the cause of instability.
This surgery will not be performed within the first 12 weeks after the ACL injury.</description>
