      A single dose of Reference product containing 200 mg favipiravir and a single dose of Test
      product containing 200 mg favipiravir or vice versa; administered with 240 mL of water at
      room temperature, in each period under fasting conditions with current pandemic precautions.

      Favipiravir is a drug with a mechanism of action different from that of the existing
      influenza antiviral drugs and effective against all types and sub-types of human influenza A,
      B and C viruses in vitro, showing anti-viral activity against various influenza virus strains
      including avian and swine viruses. Favipiravir also has shown anti-viral activity even
      against amantadine, oseltamivir and zanamivir-resistant influenza viruses in vitro. The
      mechanism of action of favipiravir is the selective inhibition of RNA polymerase by
      favipiravir ribosyl triphosphate formed by cellular enzymes in the influenza virus leading to
      antiviral activity.
