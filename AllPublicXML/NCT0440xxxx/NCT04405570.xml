      This is a phase IIa, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial, designed to compare
      the safety, tolerability, and antiviral activity of EIDD-2801 versus placebo as measured by
      infectious virus detection in symptomatic adult outpatients with COVID-19. The study is a
      multicenter trial that will be conducted in the United States.

      A total of 44 participants who start study treatment (approximately 22 in each treatment arm)
      will be followed on study for 5 days on treatment and an additional 23 days off treatment.
      Participants who do not start study treatment will be replaced . Participants will be
      randomized 1:1 to receive either EIDD-2801 at a dose of 200 mg twice daily for five days or
      matching placebo twice daily for five days.

      Randomization will be stratified by time (days) from symptom onset - &quot;early&quot; versus &quot;late&quot;
      presentation, where &quot;early&quot; and &quot;late&quot; presentation are defined by:

        -  Early presentation: enrollment 0 to ≤60 hours from symptom onset

        -  Late presentation: enrollment &gt;60 to ≤120 hours from symptom onset
