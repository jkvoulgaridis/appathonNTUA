  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our study is planned to investigate the effects of neck and trunk stabilization exercises,
      which are structured from Neurodevelopmental therapy method-Bobath concept (NDT-B)
      principles, on feeding and swallowing activity in children with Cerebral Palsy (CP) who take
      feeding and oral motor intervention strategies. The cases were divided into two groups, which
      is the group receiving feeding and oral motor intervention strategies+structured neck and
      trunk stabilization exercises (n=20) (Study Group) and those receiving feeding and oral motor
      intervention strategies (n=20) (Control Group).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Feeding and oral motor interventions address different aspects of feeding difficulties,
      reflecting the range in specific problems associated with feeding and nutrition in CP.

      The trunk plays an important role in the organization of postural control and balance
      reactions because it holds the centre of all body mass and holds therefore, the centre of
      gravity. The trunk also provides stable attachment points to those muscles that control the
      head and neck regions. &quot;Neck and trunk stabilization exercises&quot; were the basis of static and
      dynamic balance abilities, and that increased neck and trunk stability might have had a
      positive effect thereon.

      To achieve the alignment of the head with the trunk, the pelvis must be stabilized. This has
      important consequences for the entire process of swallowing. If the head is not stable, then
      the fine movements of the jaw and tongue needed for feeding will be impaired. With feeding
      and oral motor interventions and structured neck and trunk stabilization exercises, these
      parameters are positively affected.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>0. week (Baseline) at the beginning of the therapy.</time_frame>
    <description>Gross motor functions of children with CP were classified with GMFCS. GMFCS is a 5- level classification system. It uses gross motor skills such as head control, movement transition, walking and running, jumping and navigating inclined or uneven surfaces to define a child's accomplishment level. The aim is to present an idea of how self-sufficient a child can be at home, at school, and outdoor and indoor venues. GMFCS includes levels that reflect abilities ranging from unlimited walking (level I) to severe head and trunk control limitations. Requires extensive use of assisted technology and physical assistance, and wheelchair (level V).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>the Eating and Drinking Ability Classification System (EDACS)</measure>
    <time_frame>0. week (Baseline) at the beginning of the therapy.</time_frame>
    <description>EDACS describes the eating and drinking skills of children with CP from the age of 3. It is an ordered scale that defines the degree of assistance required during the meal and the individual's ability to eat and drink between five levels. Level I, safely and efficiently eating and drinking; at level V, it indicates unable to eat or drink safely, relies on tube feeding and is at high risk for aspiration.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>the Mini-Manual Ability Classification System (Mini-MACS)</measure>
    <time_frame>0. week (Baseline) at the beginning of the therapy.</time_frame>
    <description>Mini-MACS is a functional classification that determines how children with CP between the ages of 1 and 4 use their hands while holding objects in daily activities. Skill classes at five levels, based on the need for self-help and adaptation when children hold objects. I. Handles objects easily and successfully. V. Does not handle objects and has severely limited ability to perform even simple actions.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Trunk Impairment Scale (TIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>0. week (Baseline), 6. week (at the 6th-week).</time_frame>
    <description>TIS is a validated scale for CP that evaluates the trunk functionally in terms of strength in a sitting position. It also complies with the International Classification of Functionality, Disability and Health in terms of evaluating the static and dynamic balance and trunk coordination of the trunk and the relationship between body function and structures. TIS consists of three subsections: static, dynamic and coordination. For each item; sequential scales with 2, 3 or 4 values are used. The highest scores that can be obtained from the static, dynamic and coordination subheadings are; it is 7, 10 and 6 points. Total points are obtained by adding all sub-sections. The total TIS score ranges from 0 to 23. A high score indicates good trunk control.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Schedule for Oral Motor Assessment (SOMA)</measure>
    <time_frame>0. week (Baseline), 6. week (at the 6th-week).</time_frame>
    <description>SOMA is a reliable method and useful diagnostic tool in the evaluation of oral-motor function in children with dysphagia. SOMA is the only video recording tool and later assessing their feeding skills. Video recording is clinically significant because it is a more natural is tic representation of their performance during feeding and allows the professional to assess oral motor skills more precisely. SOMA has 7 sub-categories: 1) puree, 2) semi-solids, 3) solids, 4) bottle, 5) trainer cup, 6) cup and 7) cracker. Each subcategory is marked as &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;. Depending on the age and preference of the child, when a food type was found to be unsuitable for consumption, the test was carried out using the remaining food types. &quot;Yes&quot; in some options and &quot;no&quot; in some options indicate abnormal symptoms. If the sum of abnormal options is more than or equal to the cutoff score, there is dysfunction. Breakpoints vary in each category.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL)</measure>
    <time_frame>0. week (Baseline), 6. week (at the 6th-week).</time_frame>
    <description>The Quality of Life Scale for Children is a general quality of life scale which assesses the physical and psychosocial experiences independent of disease in children between the ages of 2 and 18 years. The scale is composed of 23 items. The items are scored between 0 and 100. The higher the score for the Quality of Life Scale for children, the better is the perception of health-related quality of life. In our study, the total score of the scale was used.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>A flexible endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES)</measure>
    <time_frame>1. week (After the first therapy session).</time_frame>
    <description>Instrumental evaluation of swallowing is a technique that allows the evaluation of swallowing physiology and anatomy in patients. The structures and functions related to swallowing are evaluated using a fiberoptic tube extending from the nose to the pharynx. FEES allows direct visualization of some aspects of the pharyngeal phase. It gives information about the physiological changes that occur before and after swallowing. Criteria for an instrumental swallowing study in children with CP include the following: 1) risk of aspiration (by history or observation), 2) prior aspiration pneumonia, 3) suspicion of a pharyngeal or laryngeal problem (for example, breathy or husky voice quality), 4) gurgly voice quality. In our study, FEES was performed by Otorhinolaryngologist in 8 children whose aspiration risk was observed in the SOMA assessment and nutritional information obtained from the families.</description>
