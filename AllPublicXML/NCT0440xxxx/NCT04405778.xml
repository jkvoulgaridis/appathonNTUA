      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of TAK-102 and to
      determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of TAK-102.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-102. TAK-102 is being tested to treat
      people who have GPC3-expressing previously treated solid tumors. This study will look at the
      safety and tolerability of TAK-102 and will determine the RP2D of TAK-102.

      The study will enroll approximately 14 participants, with a maximum of 18 participants.
      Participants will be assigned to 1 of the 3 treatment groups (dose cohorts) and dose
      escalation will be conducted in this study:

        -  Cohort 1: 1 × 10^7 CAR (+) cells/body [starting dose].

        -  Cohort 2: 1 × 10^8 CAR (+) cells/body.

        -  Cohort 3: 1 × 10^9 CAR (+) cells/body.

      In case Cohort 1 is not tolerable, the dose level will be de-escalated to Cohort -1: 3 × 10^6
      CAR (+) cells/body. Dose level(s) between planned cohorts and/or other dosing schedules may
      also be tested.

      This study consists of the Screening, Pretreatment, and Treatment and Primary Follow-up
      phases. In Treatment and Primary Follow-up phases, all participants will be asked to receive
      a single intravenous infusion of TAK-102 and administration of TAK-102 will continue up to
      Month 12.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Japan. The overall time to participate in this
      study is 15 years as a maximum including planned long-term follow-up study (the 12-month
      Treatment and Primary Follow-up and the 14-year Secondary Follow-up phases in another study).
      Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic and be hospitalized for at least 28 days
      to receive treatment with TAK-102 followed by a recovery period.

    <description>Toxicity will be evaluated according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), Version 5.0.

    <measure>Number of Participants With One or More Treatment-emergent Adverse Event (TEAE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) means any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product; the untoward medical occurrence does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product whether or not it is related to the medicinal product. This includes any newly occurring event, or a previous condition that has increased in severity or frequency since the administration of study drug.</description>

    <measure>Objective response based on the investigator's assessment using study-specific modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (ssmRECIST 1.1)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Objective Response will be assessed by the investigators with ssmRECIST 1.1 and disease response criteria are following; Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD. Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions. Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started.</description>

Responders without documentation of PD will be censored at the date of last response assessment that is SD or better. CR: Disappearance of all target lesions. PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD. PD: At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions.
