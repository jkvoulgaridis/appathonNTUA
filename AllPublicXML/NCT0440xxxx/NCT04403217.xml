  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dysbiosis of gut microbiota is associated with the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes.
      Mediterranean diet has been indicated as a dietary pattern that promote the integrity of gut
      barrier and that has positive impact in the metabolic control of subjects with type 2
      diabetes. This is a 12-week, single-arm clinical study that aims to evaluate if the effect of
      Mediterranean diet in metabolic control of these subjects is mediated by gut microbiota.
      Subjects will receive personalized nutrition counseling where Mediterranean diet will be
      promoted.

    <description>Mediterranean diet adherence will be evaluated using the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) from the PREvención com Dieta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) study. Responses that are favorable to the adoption of the Mediterranean diet are scored as 1 point, while responses that are unfavorable are scored as 0.
The final score ranged between 0 and 14 and a MEDAS score greater than 9 indicates high adherence to the Mediterranean diet.</description>
