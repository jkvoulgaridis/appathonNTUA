      In this study, we want to continuously record the interaction of 50 stroke survivors with
      their smartphones during the first 3 months after discharge. The linkage of smart phone use
      to function and quality of life will be assessed with standardized outcome measures at
      defined time points.

      People with stroke are among the most relevant target groups for unobtrusive monitoring.
      Worldwide, stroke is the second most frequent cause for lasting disability and causes a
      substantial burden for the individual, caregivers and society. Thanks to improved treatment,
      many stroke survivors can be discharged to their homes. However, many have to live with
      disabilities and are prone to declining function, cognitive impairment and depression. With
      the acquired data, we want to create a database where digital behavior is analyzed with
      advanced computational methods. In collaboration with the Department of Cognitive Psychology,
      University of Leiden, Netherlands, these data will be used to discover specific features for
      different health issues and to develop tools for the early detection of functional decline
      for different populations.

        We want to include a broad range of patients with stroke, incuding both ischemic and
        hemorrhagic strokes and different impairments due to stroke. Patients are recruited at two
        wards specialized in neurorehabilitation around 1 week before discharge to their home.
