    <textblock>
      This study examines heart rate monitoring variability for the early detection of pancreatic
      cancer. Pancreatic cancer is a very difficult disease to detect early. This study is being
      done to observe the heart rate variability in patients with pancreatic cancer compared to
      undiagnosed individuals with increased risk of developing pancreatic cancer. This may help
      researchers determine if pancreatic occurrences/recurrences (chance of coming back) can be
      detected sooner through monitoring heart rate and activity.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether heart rate variability (HRV) is reduced in patients with pancreatic
      ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) compared with individuals at increased risk of developing PDAC.
      (Stage I) II. To assess the feasibility of long-term compliance using a wearable device.
      (Stage II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess compliance with using a wearable device. (Stage I and II) II. To determine
      whether HRV is reduced in participants at high-risk of developing PDAC. (Stage II) III. To
      characterize timing and occurrence of PDAC among high-risk without disease. (Stage II) IV. To
      characterize timing and occurrence of PDAC among participants at high-risk of developing
      PDAC. (Stage II)

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate the relationship between changes in HRV relative to sarcopenia-related body
      composition characteristics in PDAC patients. (Stage I) II. To investigate the relationship
      between the pNN50 HRV measure and PDAC diagnosis (Stage I and II) III. To compare changes in
      sleep biometrics among all participants. (Stage I and II) IV. To evaluate changes in
      health-related quality of life assessments among all participants. (Stage I and II)

      OUTLINE:

      Participants undergo HRV monitoring using an activity monitor (WHOOP) for a minimum of 5 days
      weekly for up to 1 year in patients with newly-diagnosed PDAC and up to 5 years for patients
      in high risk group.
