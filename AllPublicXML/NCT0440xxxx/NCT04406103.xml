  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      New Brunswick has an aging population with Canada's highest rate of sleeping pill use. The
      rate of long-term (chronic) use among NB seniors is 25%, well in excess of the Canadian
      average of 10%. The rate of use is higher in women and increases with age, as do risks for
      serious harms.

      Sleeping pills risks are substantial and costly, especially to seniors. Research does not
      support their long-term use. Risk for falls causing injuries, including hip fractures, is a
      leading concern. They impair mental and physical functioning resulting in a loss of
      independence and cause impaired driving and a higher rate of serious crashes. The rate of
      near-fatal and fatal overdoses from mixing sleeping pills with other drugs is on the rise.
      Stopping treatment can be difficult due to physical dependence and withdrawal symptoms.

      Cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBTi) is recommended as the first-line treatment
      of chronic insomnia. Sleeping pills are only to be considered when CBTi fails. However, these
      recommendations are not reflected in primary care practice.

      Internationally, many educational interventions targeting prescribers have been tried, yet
      have failed to reduce sleeping pill use. However, a 12-page pamphlet (EMPOWER) given directly
      to seniors in a clinical trial was associated with a large reduction in sleeping pill use.
      Using a similarly persuasive approach, Sleepwell (mysleepwell.ca) was developed to reduce the
      use of sleeping pills and facilitate CBTi access and use. Sleepwell differs from EMPOWER by
      providing specific information and recommendations regarding CBTi in addition to guidance on
      how to stop sleeping pills.

      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of direct-to-patient interventions on long-term
      sleeping pill use.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are proposing to investigate direct-to-patient health promotion
      interventions that promote sleeping pill dose reduction and treatment discontinuation by
      enhancing self-efficacy through various behaviour change techniques embedded in printed
      information provided to patients. Seniors will be invited to participate via direct telephone
      contact, information sharing through seniors' organizations, education sessions for seniors,
      and public notices. Prospective participants will be given the option of which way they would
      like to participate in the research:

      Option 1: full participation including baseline interview, 6-month interview, and access to
      specific data from the participant's personal health record); Option 2: limited participation
      to baseline and 6-month interviews only; and Option 3: limited participation to baseline
      interview and access to specific data from the participant's personal health record.

      This will form two sets of participants; those who do and those who do not permit access to
      outcomes from their personal health record. Participants that select Options 1 or 3 will
      consent to their medication and health resources use being assessed objectively over a six
      month period. Participants that choose Options 1 or 2 will directly provide baseline
      information about their health, medication use, and use of health resources via
      communications with researchers. Similar information will be collected directly from
      participants in this group after six months.

      Random group allocation:

      Options 1 and 2: i) Sleepwell package; ii) Empower package; iii) No package Option 3: i)
      Sleepwell package; ii) No package

      The investigators will compare the rates of reducing and stopping sleeping pill use among the
      different groups over 6 months. Safety outcomes including falls and hospital visits will be
      measured. The investigators will also track participant access to online CBTi resources using
      Google Analytics.

      Encouraging results from this study of direct-to-patient health promotion regarding insomnia
      management and sleeping pill use can be utilized repeatedly over time to reach all
      individuals who could benefit from the intervention, leading a transformational change in
      insomnia management.
