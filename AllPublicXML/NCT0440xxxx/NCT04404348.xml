  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research has consistently found that cognitive impairment is common in persons with a history
      of substance abuse. The most commonly identified impairments across all substances are in
      attentional and working memory functioning and executive functioning; opioid-specific
      research finds that memory is an additional area of common impairment. Initial research in
      applying cognitive rehabilitation methods to substance abuse have shown it to be helpful
      overall.

      To develop a cognitive rehabilitation intervention that is effective for opioid abuse, this
      study will adapt a cognitive training program that has been shown to be effective in other
      patient groups. Patients in a residential opioid-abuse treatment program will undergo a
      cognitive evaluation and then be assigned to receive the 4-week cognitive intervention or the
      4-week placebo control arm. It is expected that the intervention group will show greater
      gains on the cognitive post test and will have higher rated treatment adherence and opioid
      treatment program completion rates.
