  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an expanded access protocol that will be conducted at sites qualified and approved to
      treat patients with lisocabtagene maraleucel. Sometimes when lisocabtagene maraleucel is
      manufactured the drug does not pass all the testing results to be called lisocabtagene
      maraleucel. When this happens the drug is called nonconforming lisocabtagene maraleucel. The
      expanded access protocol will be used to allow patients to receive nonconforming
      lisocabtagene maraleucel only if the potential benefit is better than the potential risk.
      This expanded access protocol is restricted to those patients who were prescribed
      lisocabtagene maraleucel as part of their routine care.

      Patients will first receive a lymphodepleting chemotherapy regimen and then be treated with
      nonconforming lisocabtagene maraleucel as the treatment plan.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient must understand and voluntarily sign an informed consent form prior to any
             study-related assessments/procedures being conducted.

          2. Patient is â‰¥ 18 years of age at the time of signing the informed consent form.

          3. Patient had a patient-specific batch of lisocabtagene maraleucel manufactured intended
             for commercial treatment; however, the final manufactured product was nonconforming
             and did not meet commercial release criteria.

          4. Remanufacturing (eg, repeat leukapheresis and manufacturing) is deemed not feasible or
             clinically inappropriate per assessment of the treating physician in discussion with
             the patient.

          5. Patient meets any other relevant medical criteria for lymphodepleting chemotherapy and
             infusion of a cellular therapy product as per Investigator's clinical judgement.

          6. Females of childbearing potential must:

               1. Have a negative pregnancy test as verified by the treating physician within 7
                  days prior to the first dose of lymphodepleting chemotherapy following
                  institutional testing methodology practices. This applies even if the patient
                  practices true abstinence from heterosexual contact.

               2. Either commit to true abstinence from heterosexual contact or agree to use, and
                  be able to comply with, effective contraception without interruption.
                  Contraception methods must include 1 highly effective method from screening until
                  at least 12 months after the nonconforming lisocabtagene maraleucel
                  administration.

               3. Agree to abstain from breastfeeding during study participation and for at least
                  12 months following nonconforming lisocabtagene maraleucel administration.

               4. There are insufficient exposure data to provide any recommendation concerning the
                  duration of contraception and the abstaining from breastfeeding following
                  treatment with lisocabtagene maraleucel. Any decision regarding contraception and
                  breastfeeding after infusion should be discussed with the treating physician.

          7. Male patients must:

               1. Practice true abstinence or agree to use a condom during sexual contact with a
                  pregnant female or a female of childbearing potential for at least 12 months
                  after nonconforming lisocabtagene maraleucel administration even if the patient
                  has undergone a successful vasectomy.

               2. There are insufficient exposure data to provide any recommendation concerning the
                  duration of contraception following treatment with lisocabtagene maraleucel. Any
                  decision regarding contraception after infusion should be discussed with the
                  treating physician

          8. Patient must agree to not donate blood, organs, tissue, sperm or semen and egg cells
             for usage in other individuals for at least 1 year following nonconforming
             lisocabtagene maraleucel administration.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient has a hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.

          2. Patient has a contraindication to lymphodepleting chemotherapy.

          3. Patient should not experience a significant worsening in clinical status that would,
             in the opinion of the treating physician, either increase the risk of adverse events
             associated with lymphodepleting chemotherapy, or exclude them from treatment with
             nonconforming lisocabtagene maraleucel.

          4. Patient has any significant medical condition, laboratory abnormality, or psychiatric
             illness that would prevent the patient from participating in the Expanded Access
             Protocol or complying with protocol requirements in the Investigator's judgement.

          5. Patient has any condition and/or laboratory abnormality that places the patient at
             unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the Expanded Access Protocol based
             on the Investigator's judgement
