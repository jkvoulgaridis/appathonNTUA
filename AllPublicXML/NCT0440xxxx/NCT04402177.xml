      The Aim of This Work is to Compare the Effect of Oral Methyl Prednisolone on Different
      Radiological Patterns of Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis and to Evaluate the Patient's Clinical
      and Functional Status After Taking the Required Dose of Methyl Prednisolone. Not All
      Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis Patients get the Same Therapeutic Effect after taking
      Corticosteroid so by Comparing the Effect of Methyl Prednisolone on Patients With Different
      Radiological Pattern we Will be Able to Select the Patient Who Really Need to Take
      Corticosteroid and Who Don't so we Will Protect the Patient Who Doesn't Need to Take Oral
      Corticosteroids From Its Numerous Side Effects All Patients Will Undergo the Following
      Assessment Before and After Taking 0.5 mg/kg/Day of Methyl Prednisolone for 8 Weeks : High
      Resolution CT (HRCT) of Chest , Chest X-ray , Spirometry, 6 Minute Walk Test to Evaluate the
      Patient's Functional Status and Oximetry to Measure Percentage of Oxygen in Blood

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      hypersensitivity Pneumonitis patients will be divided in two groups : non- fibrotic
      hypersensitivity Pneumonitis patients ( nfHP) and fibrotic hypersensitivity Pneumonitis
      patients ( fHP), based on HRCT findings.

      All patients will undergo the following assessment at the beginning of the study: High
      resolution CT (HRCT) of chest , Spirometry to assess forced expiratory volume in 1 second
      (FEV1), Forced vital capacity (FVC) and FEV1 to FVC ratio , 6minute walk test , Oximetry to
      measure percentage of oxygen in blood. Then all patients took methyl prednisolone 0.5mg/kg
      /day orally for 8 weeks .

      During the treatment period Pulmonary spirometry will be done every 2 weeks and 6 minute walk
      test will be done every 4 weeks as follow up At the end of the treatment period all these
      assessments will be repeated to compared the patients functional and clinical statues before
      and after taking methylprednisolone.
