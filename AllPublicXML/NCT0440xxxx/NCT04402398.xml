  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current methods to assess superficial size and area of pressure ulcers are either
      time-consuming (using Transparency Tracings techniques), costly (computers, softwares), or
      necessitating to touch the patient's skin (using commun rulers).

      A free smartphone application (for IOS or Android) has recently been developed to measures
      skin lesions. It is called imitoMeasure. It does not require any contact with the patient. A
      photograph is taken with the smartphone, the limits of the lesion is then drawn with the
      health carers' finger on the phone's screen. The application computes the length, width and
      surface of the ulcer.

      This technique has not yet been validated, although it has been used to measure various types
      of skin lesions.

      The objective of this study is to validate this measurement technique on a sample of pressure
      ulcer in a population of patients with spinal cord injury (SCI). Reliability is assessed by
      comparison to the currently most frequently used techniques (Transparency Tracings and
      ruler-based), and fiability is assessed by intra-rater and inter-rater correlations.

      imitoMeasure is a new smartphone application to measure wounds size. The present study
      assesses validity of the measure against common measures (ruler-based and transparency
      tracings), and the inter- and intra-rater reliability.
