  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oral naltrexone was initially FDA approved to treat opioid use disorder and alcohol
      dependence at doses from 50-100mg/day. At lower doses of 1-5mg/day, naltrexone has been used
      off-label with success in treatment of several dermatologic conditions including the scarring
      hair loss disease lichen planopilaris. A recent case series of four patients with lichen
      planopilaris and a subtype, frontal fibrosing alopecia, treated with oral low-dose naltrexone
      at 3mg daily showed reduction of itch, clinical evidence of inflammation of the scalp, and of
      disease progression. There were no reported adverse events.

      Based on the promising evidence, we propose using low-dose naltrexone at a daily dose of 3mg
      to treat lichen planopilaris and frontal fibrosing alopecia. The patients would be continued
      on their other medications for these conditions. The study would be open-label, so all
      participants would receive the low-dose naltrexone. Patients would be seen at 0,3,6 and 9
      months to monitor their progress.
