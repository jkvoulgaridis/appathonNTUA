  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a strong radiobiological and economic rationale for hypofractionated radiation
      therapy in head and neck cancer. Phase 1 of the trial aims to assess the acute toxicity and
      tolerability of hypofractionated radiation therapy in the post-operative setting, and to
      determine the dose/fractionation for Phase 2. Phase 2 aims to establish non-inferiority of
      swallowing-related quality of life and to assess the toxicity and efficacy of
      hypofractionated radiation therapy compared to conventionally fractionated radiation therapy
      in the post-operative setting.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial will assess the effects of aggressive hypofractionated radiation therapy in
      patients with oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, or larynx cancer after surgical resection
      with pathology showing intermediate risk factors requiring post-operative radiation therapy
      without concurrent chemotherapy. During Phase 1, the maximum tolerated dose/fractionation and
      tolerability will be determined. During Phase 2, patients will be randomized between
      conventionally fractionated radiation therapy (6 weeks) vs. hypofractionated radiation
      therapy (3-4 weeks depending on Phase 1 results) to establish non-inferiority of
      hypofractionated radiation therapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Inclusion criteria will be the same for Phase I and Phase II.

          1. Pathologically proven diagnosis of stage I-IVB squamous cell carcinoma of the oral
             cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, or larynx status post gross total resection with
             pathology showing one or more of the following intermediate risk factors: T3/4
             disease, positive lymph node(s), close margin(s), perineural invasion, and/or
             lymphovascular invasion

          2. Age ≥18 years

          3. ECOG performance status 0-2

          4. Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for
             the duration of study participation, and for 90 days following completion of therapy.

          5. Negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 2 weeks before registration for women of
             childbearing potential.

          6. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Phase I:

          1. Distant metastasis

          2. Stage I and II glottic squamous cell carcinoma

          3. High risk factors following surgical resection requiring concurrent chemotherapy:
             positive margin(s) and/or extranodal extension

          4. Feeding tube dependence at baseline assessment.

          5. Synchronous non-skin cancer primaries outside of the oropharynx, oral cavity, larynx,
             and hypopharynx except for low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer and synchronous
             well-differentiated thyroid cancer. For thyroid cancer, surgery may occur before or
             after treatment, provided all other eligibility criteria are met.

          6. Prior invasive malignancy with an expected disease-free interval of less than 3 years

          7. Prior radiotherapy to the region of the study cancer that would result in overlap of
             radiation fields

          8. Subjects may not be receiving any other investigational agents for the treatment of
             the cancer under study.

          9. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, would limit compliance with study requirements

         10. Subjects must not be pregnant or nursing due to the potential for congenital
             abnormalities and the potential of this regimen to harm nursing infants.

         11. History of severe immunosuppression, including HIV, and organ or autologous or
             allogeneic stem cell transplant

        Phase II:

        The exclusion criteria will be the same as Phase I except for feeding tube dependence.
        Patients who are feeding tube dependent are excluded from Phase I to accurately assess
        treatment associated toxicity affecting swallowing and oral intake. During Phase II,
        patients who are feeding tube dependent will be eligible to enroll and stratified at
        randomization.
