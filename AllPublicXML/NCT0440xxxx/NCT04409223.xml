        Inclusion Criteria:

          3. Histologically confirmed metastatic or untreatable gastrointestinal stromal tumors
             have at least one measurable lesion that meets the criteria of RECIST v1.1. Lesions
             that have undergone radiotherapy must be confirmed by imaging to show progression
             after radiotherapy

          4. Previous treatment with imatinib and eventual treatment failure (disease progression
             or toxicity intolerance during treatment)

          5. The subjects were able to provide 10 ml blood samples and fresh or archived tumor
             tissue, or to receive biopsy at baseline for biomarker analysis.

             Note: if there is no archived tumor tissue sample, those at high risk of receiving
             biopsy after assessment by the researcher, who can provide the previous c-kit /PDGFRA
             test report, may also be selected for inclusion.

          6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 1 or lower

          7. Expected survival ≥12 weeks

          8. Vital organs and body functions meet the following requirements (no blood products or
             cell agents are allowed to be used within 14 days before the first use):

             Bilirubin ≤ 1.5×ULN; ALT and AST ≤2.5×ULN serum creatinine≤1.5×ULN; Results of urinary
             protein &lt;2+; If urinary protein is ≥2+, 24-hour quantitative determination of urinary
             protein should be conducted, and no more than 1g/24 hour is qualified. Serum calcium,
             potassium, magnesium and phosphorus are within the normal range or have been corrected
             to the normal range before randomization. International standardized ratio INR≤ 1.5
             and activated partial thromboplastin time APTT≤1.5×ULN; QTc≤ 450 ms (male), 470 ms
             (female); Left ventricular ejection fraction LVEF≥50%.

          9. Use of a medically approved contraceptive method (e.g., intrauterine contraceptive
             device, contraceptive pill or condom) during the study period and within 90 days after
             the end of the study period for female patients of non-surgical sterilization or
             childbearing age; The serum HCG of female patients of childbearing age without
             surgical sterilization must be negative within 72 hours before randomization, and must
             be non-lactating to be enrolled; For male patients whose partners are women of
             childbearing age, effective methods of contraception should be used during the study
             period and within 90 days after the end of the study period.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Previously received molecular targeted therapy for gastrointestinal stromal tumor
             except imatinib

          2. The toxicity of previous imatinib or other treatments has not recovered or reached NCI
             CTC AE 5.0≤ 1

          3. For patients with clinical symptoms of ascites or pleural effusion, those requiring
             puncture drainage or those who had received thoracic or ascites drainage within 1
             month before signing informed consent were excluded, those with only small amount of
             ascites or pleural effusion on imaging but no clinical symptoms are qualified.

          8. Symptoms occurred within 12 months before randomization: myocardial infarction,
             severe/unstable angina pectoris, coronary/peripheral artery bypass grafting,

             arrhythmia requiring treatment or intervention

         10. Have hypertension, and cannot be well controlled by antihypertensive medication
             (systolic blood pressure ≥ 140mmhg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90mmhg, if the blood
             pressure was abnormal during the screening period, 2 consistent measurements must be
             done with an interval of more than 24h after medical correction); Previous
             hypertensive crisis or hypertensive encephalopathy;

             palliative radiotherapy for pain relief within the first 1 week of randomization;
             Molecular-targeted therapy (including oral targeted drugs in other clinical trials) is
             less than 5 drug half-lives away form randomization date

         15. Participated in clinical trials of other drugs in the first 4 weeks of randomization

         16. Digestive tract perforation occurred 3 months before randomization

         17. In the judgment of the investigator, a concomitant illness (severe diabetes, a clear
             history of neurological or mental disorders, e.g., epilepsy or dementia) that
             seriously endangers the patient's safety or prevents the patient from completing the
             study
