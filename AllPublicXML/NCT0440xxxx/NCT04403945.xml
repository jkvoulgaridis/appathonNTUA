  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic microangiopathy refers to the pathological changes of arterioles, capillaries and
      venules in diabetic patients. Due to the impacts including glycol-metabolism disorder,
      disturbance of lipid metabolism, cytokine, oxidative stress and hemodynamic changes, the
      structure and function of microvessels are damaged accordingly. Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is
      one of the most common and serious chronic microvascular complications of diabetes, and
      becomes a leading cause of end-stage renal failure(ESRF). Presently, urinary
      albumin/creatinine ratio (UACR) is a widely accepted and relatively reliable indicator for
      early diagnosis of DN, however, there are 2/3 DN patients with normal albuminuria have
      decreased glomerular filtration rate (glomerular filtration rate, GFR) and abnormal structure
      of the kidney, one the other hand, the presence of albuminuria is associated with other
      vascular dysfunction and kidney disease other than DN, therefore its accuracy is increasingly
      being challenged.

      Sidestream dark field(SDF) imagining technology, as an emerging way to visualize blood
      vessels, is evaluated in a semi-quantitative manner and provides an effective means to study
      structure and function of microcirculation. Different from biochemical markers like
      albuminuria, SDF provides a visual information about vessel structure, density, and quality
      of diffusion. At present the research of sublingual microcirculation by SDF technique is
      mainly applied to microcirculation monitoring in patients in the intensive care unit or
      laboratory animal models with acute hemorrhagic shock to assess the potential of being a tool
      of diagnosis and treatment prognostic indicator, no relevant research has been carried out to
      evaluate the predictive value of diabetic microangiopathy in literature so far.

      Herein, the investigators designed the study based on SDF imaging to collect scientific data,
      thus providing strong support for the early assessment and diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy
      and possibly guiding individual therapy in the future.
