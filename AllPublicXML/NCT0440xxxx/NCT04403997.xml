  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Single-blind (patient) randomized study to compare detection of neoplastic lesions between
      chromoendoscopy and NBI.

      Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease who are to undergo chromoendoscopy according to
      usual clinical criteria will be included. The endoscopic procedure is similar to the one
      usually performed. All patients will undergo colonoscopy according to the usual procedure,
      with Olympus HQ190 series endoscopes, with the same bowel preparation. During intubation, the
      faecal remains will be thoroughly washed.

      Patients will be randomly assigned to one of the two techniques: Chromoendoscopy with 0.1%
      methylene blue or New generation NBI with Near focus.

      Biopsies will be taken of all those lesions detected, instead of random biopsies.
