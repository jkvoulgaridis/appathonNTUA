      This phase III trial compares the Quit2Heal smoking cessation smartphone application (app) to
      the QuitGuide app in helping cancer patients quit smoking. Both apps provide tools to cope
      with urges to smoke, step-by-step guides for quitting smoking, help in planning for quitting
      and staying tobacco-free, and scientifically-based recommendations for how to select
      medications that aid in smoking cessation.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive the Quit2Heal app and are encouraged to use it frequently. During the
      entire 12-month follow-up period, the app will remain fully available anytime study
      participants wish to use it.

      ARM II: Patients receive the QuitGuide app and are encouraged to use it frequently. During
      the entire 12-month follow-up period, the app will remain fully available anytime study
      participants wish to use it.

      After randomization, patients are followed up at 3, 6, and 12 months.
