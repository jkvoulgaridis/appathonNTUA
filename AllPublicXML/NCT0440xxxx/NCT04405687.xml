  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this observational follow-up study, patients with type III-IV head and face soft tissue
      deformities/defects following reconstructive surgeries will be asked to fill out 3
      questionnaires, either through phone calls or video calls, in order to evaluate the
      post-operative outcomes such as morphological and functional recovery, quality of life and
      patients' return to the community.

      The objective of this follow up study is to evaluate the effectiveness and to analyze the
      limitations of the existing management and treatment of severe burn injuries. Investigation
      of the factors affecting the recovery and patients' return to the community in patients with
      severe burn injury may lead to effective amendments of the existing management, and thus
      aiding in the development of an integrated diagnosis and treatment guidelines.
