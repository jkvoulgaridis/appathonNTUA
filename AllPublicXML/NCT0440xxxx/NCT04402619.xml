  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal is to study the effects of internet-delivered cognitive behavioural therapy
      with minimum guidance for comorbid sleep problems in alcohol use disorder, in routine
      addiction care.

    <textblock>
      Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is highly prevalent and a major contributor to the global burden
      of disease. Insomnia symptoms are very common among individuals with AUD, including those in
      recovery, which may in turn promote alcohol relapse. Specialization and silo phenomena in
      healthcare organization, separating addiction from other types of psychiatric care, means
      that individuals with AUD and comorbid sleep problems often have difficulty accessing
      evidence-treatment for the latter. Offering online treatment for sleep problems to
      individuals enrolled in traditional routine addiction care is an attractive and pragmatic
      approach to offering parallel treatments covering the full clinical presentation, which has
      not yet been evaluated. This pilot and feasibility trial will recruit n=25 from patients in
      routine addiction care with comorbid sleep problems and AUD, who will complete an online,
      ten-module, CBT-based treatment program with minimum guidance for sleep problems, tailored
      for individuals with AUD.
