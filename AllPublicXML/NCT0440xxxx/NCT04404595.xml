      A Phase 1b, open label, multi-center, clinical study of Chimeric Antigen Receptor T Cells
      (CAR-T) targeting claudin18.2 in patients with advanced gastric or pancreatic adenocarcinoma

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, multi-center, Phase 1b clinical trial to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of autologous claudin18.2 chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy in patients with
      advanced gastric or pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

      Part A of the study will be Dose Escalation followed by Part B, an expansion cohort.
      Following consent, patients must have tumor tissue evaluated by CLDN18.2 IHC assay. Patients
      meeting all eligibility criteria will undergo a leukapheresis procedure to collect autologous
      mononuclear cells for manufacture of investigational drug product (CT041). Following
      manufacture of the drug product, subjects will receive preconditioning prior to CT041
      infusion. All subjects will be asked to continue to undergo long-term gene safety follow-up.
