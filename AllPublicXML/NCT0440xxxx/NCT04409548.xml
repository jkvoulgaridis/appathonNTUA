  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to assessment on the interaction of spatial and temporal gait
      parameters in patients with Lumbar Disc Herniation (LDH) before and 15 days after surgery.

    <textblock>
      The participants were divided into LDH and healthy control groups. The analysis of the
      spatiotemporal gait parameters was performed using the &quot;Win-Track&quot; gait analysis platform
      system for two groups. In addition, the analysis of spatiotemporal gait parameters of 60
      participants who had the planned lumbar discectomy surgery, was tested before and 15 days
      after surgery. The pain intensity of the patients was recorded by the Visual Analog Scale
      (VAS) immediately before performing the analysis. After then participants completed ten
      passes on the &quot;Win-Track&quot; Gait Analysis Platform at their self-selected walking speed. The
      arithmetic mean of the three flawless walking data was used for analysis.

    <measure>Visual Analog Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>The pain intensity of the patients was recorded immediately before performing the analysis.</time_frame>
    <description>Pain intensity was obtained using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS). VAS is usually a horizontal line, 10 cm in length, anchored by word descriptors at each end with &quot;No Pain&quot; (score of zero) on the left side up to &quot;pain as bad as it could be&quot; or the &quot;worst imaginable pain&quot; (Score of 100 [100-mm scale]) on the right side. The patient was asked to mark the line point that represented his or her current pain.</description>

    <measure>Step length (cm)</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from the step length at 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Step length is the distance between the heel contact point of one foot and that of the other foot. The step length (cm) was recorded separately for both extremities.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Gait cycle length (cm)</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from the gait cycle length at 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Gait cycle length is the distance between successive foot contacts of the same limbs. The gait cycle length (cm) was recorded separately for both extremities.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Cadence (step/min)</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from the cadence at 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Cadence is the number of steps per minute.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Velocity (cm/s)</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from the velocity at 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Velocity is the distance covered in a given period.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Gait cycle duration (seconds)</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from the gait cycle duration at 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Gait cycle duration is the time between successive foot contacts of the same limbs. The gait cycle duration (seconds) was recorded separately for both extremities.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Step duration (seconds)</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from the step duration at 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Step duration is the time between two consecutive heel strikes. The step duration (seconds) was recorded separately for both extremities.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Double stance duration (seconds)</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from the double stance duration at 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Double stance duration is the time over which the body is supported by both legs. The double stance duration (seconds) was recorded separately for both extremities.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Swing duration (seconds)</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from the swing duration at 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Swing duration is the time taken for the leg to swing through while the body is in single support on the other leg. The swing duration (seconds) was recorded separately for both extremities.</description>
