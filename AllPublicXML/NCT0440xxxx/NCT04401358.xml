  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies show that the change of smell and taste, also dry mouth are the most common symptoms
      in end stage renal disease patients, the accumulation of uremic toxins would damage the
      intrinsinc antioxidant systems of the olfactory epithelium and olfactory bulb, which leads to
      smell dysfunction compared to healthy group. Previous studies show different results about if
      getting rid of uremic toxins would help improve smell, even if they say olfactory
      identification is improved after hemodialysis episode, but there's no short term reliability
      of Sniffin'sticks to prove the credibility of the findings. Reduction of the whole saliva and
      unstimulated salivary flow rate cause dry mouth, also change oral environment, which makes
      dental plaque easily attach to teeth. And the accumulation of uremic in oral cavity causes
      oral odor, plus lack of zinc iron and reduction of saliva would affect the tastants
      transferred to its receptors which leads to taste dysfunction. Besides, when the patients has
      olfactory dysfunction, the taste will be affected as well, plus the accumulation of uremic
      toxin in the oral cavity also stops the conjunction of smell and taste receptors which
      affects taste. To understand smell, taste and oral condition in end stage renal disease
      patients, and due to there's no short term reliability of Sniffin'sticks, plus it's expensive
      and time-consuming to implement the taste assessment tool. Thus the main purpose of this
      study is: 1. To investigate smell and taste function, salivary secretion, oral condition,
      plaque index and dry mouth in end stage renal disease patients who haven't been under
      hemodialysis. 2. To investigate the short term reliability of Sniffin'sticks, the measuring
      tool of olfactory with 3-4 hours interval. 3. To investigate if Taste and Smell Survey could
      be the tool which detects abnormality of taste 4. To investigate the change of smell, taste
      and salivary secretion within 24 hours after the first episode of hemodialysis.

      This is a smell, taste and oral health in patients receiving before and after hemodialysis
      study. End stage renal disease patients who haven't been under hemodialysis will be screened
      for enrollment at the nephrology department in National Taiwan University Hospital. Patients
      have to be over 20 years old who are diagnosed with end stage renal
      disease(eGFR&lt;15ml/min/1.73m2) but haven't been under hemodialysis yet. Expected 85 patients
      will be enrolled according to power analysis, those who have the diseases such as Parkinson's
      disease, hypothyroidism, Sjögren's syndrome, under chemotherapy or radiotherapy, history of
      head and neck tumour and surgery, and patients who unable to response to evaluate protocal.

      We will first use Montreal Cognitive Assessment to screen patient's cognitive function, for
      those scored 23.5 and higher, a full evaluation will be conducted at two points in before
      dialysis and afterward. The full evaluation before dialysis include 1.The difference of
      smell, taste, salivary secretion, oral assessment guide, plaque index and xerostomia on end
      stage renal disease patients before and after hemodialysis. 2.Investigating the reliability
      of olfactory identification by using Sniffin'sticks within 2 to 4 hours. 3.Investigating the
      correlation between taste questionnaire and taste strips. 4.Salivary flow rate. 5.Oral
      Assessment Guide. 6.Plaque Index. 7.Taste threshold sensitivity.

      The evaluation after dialysis involved 1.The olfactory identification 2. Salivary flow 3.
      Taste threshold sensitivity.For patients who get score lower than 23.5 from Montreal
      Cognitive Assessment, we'll skip the test of olfactory and taste .Data will be analyzed with
      descriptive and inferential statistics using R studio statistic software.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Olfactory identification score in ESRD patients before the first dialysis</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 1 year.</time_frame>
    <description>The Sniffin' sticks identification test measured the patient's olfactory identification . The test consists of felt pens, the tips of which are impregnated with 4 mL of odorant fluid or odorant substance dissolved in propylene glycol, and an antibacterial agent. There were 16 odorant pens in the test, for each odorant pen, the subject must make a forced choice from a list of 4 written proposals. The test scored from 1 to 16, normosmia to be defined as a score higher than the 10th percentile of the distribution of normal values of the study population according to gender and age.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Sniffin' sticks identification retest</measure>
    <time_frame>The test will be done again 2 hours after the first outcome.</time_frame>
    <description>Though the sniffin'sticks test provided good reliability, but the time interval is 7-10 days, the short term of reliability hadn't been confirmed, hence we want to test a short term interval within 2 hours. The test will be done again 2 hours after the first outcome.</description>

    <description>There are 8 items in this guide, each has a 3 points scale to assess oral health condition and oral function, which includes: voice, swallowing, lips, tongue, saliva, buccal mucous membrane, labial mucous membrane, and gingiva. One point means normal, two means mild change, while three means moderate to severe change. The higher of the total score, the more serious of oral mucositis.</description>

All teeth assessed except third molars, score form 0 to 5 is given according to the scoring criteria, and each side of tooth gets a score, the total score divides the number of surfaces examined is the index.
