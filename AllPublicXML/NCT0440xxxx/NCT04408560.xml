      Interventional, randomised, prospective, monocentric study

      Primary objective :

      Demonstrate the interest of the homeopathic Protocol to reduce the onset or aggravation of
      joint pain as a result of the taking of AI compared to conventional care

      Secondary objective :

      Compare between the two treatment groups:

        -  Evolution of joint pain

        -  Evolution of joint stiffness-rate of onset of pain and joint stiffness-delay in onset or
           aggravation of pain-evolution of the number of painful locations-evolution of the impact
           of pain on the quality of the sleep-consumption of permitted concomitant treatments
           (analgesics)

        -  Evolution of symptoms of hormonal deprivation-adherence to AI treatment

        -  Tolerance to AI

        -  Change seen by patients

        -  Stop rate and switch of AI-rate of recurrence of breast cancer

      Describe in patients receiving homeopathic treatment:

        -  Adherence to homeopathic treatment

        -  Tolerance to homeopathic treatment

        -  Group A: Group of patients receiving conventional treatment (drug analgesic class 1) for
           joint pain + homeopathic treatment

        -  Group B: Group of patients receiving conventional treatment (drug analgesic class 1) for
           joint pain

      Schedule :

        -  Inclusions start at: 01/09/2018

        -  End date of inclusions: 01/09/2020 (duration to possibly adapt in order to obtain the
           number of required patients)

        -  End date of follow-up: 01/03/2021
