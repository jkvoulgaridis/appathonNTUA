      MAIN OBJECTIVE: Description of predicted markers of acute diverticulitis crisis, using
      bivariate and multivariate analyses. Analysis of acute diverticulitis predictor swings.

      SIDE OBJECTIVES: Descriptive analysis of HRQL in the different measurement periods to
      establish the evolution of the disease. Correlate HRQL values of systemic and local
      inflammatory markers in the diverticulitis group. Sub-analysis of patients with
      immunosuppression to evaluate disease virulence compared to a group of patients without
      immunosuppression.

      STUDY TYPE: Clinical, observational, prospective and multicenter study (8 hospitals) with
      three study groups: patients diagnosed with acute diverticulitis attending emergencies,
      diverticulosis patients and patients without diverticulums. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Age &gt; 18years
      and radiological diagnosis by abdominal CT acute diverticulitis. EXCLUSION CRITERIA:
      Rejection of the patient -severe diverticulitis requiring urgent surgery -an inability to
      understand HRQL questionnaire - IBD - pregnancy or breastfeeding - acute diverticulitis
      within the prior year of the study - Roma IV criteria fulfilment. VARIABLES: Main variables:
      local and systemic inflammatory markers- faecal calprotectin. Secondary variables: recurrence
      of acute diverticulitis -the persistence of symptoms - SF 12 and GIQLI questionnaires.

      STATISTICS: Sample size: alpha error 0.05; beta error 0.20; bilateral; proportion 0.9 in the
      control group; 500 subjects group diverticulitis, 200 group diverticulosis and not
      diverticulums.

      GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PROJECT:

      Despite being a benign pathology, colon diverticulitis represents the fifth most important
      gastrointestinal pathology and has a great clinical impact on the quality of life of patients
      and on health expenditure. Understanding a disease involves being able to make the correct
      diagnosis of the patient and most importantly for the patient, an adequate treatment of his
      symptoms. It is required to give accurate information to the patient and answer his doubts,
      although the pathophysiology of the disease is unknown. As it is a benign disease with
      heterogeneous behaviours and manifestations, it is difficult to make the decision related to
      undergo surgery. This decision could be facilitated if it is based on extensive information
      from the doctor. It is also important to be able to select those patients who have a higher
      risk of relapse in order to prioritize them on the waiting list for surgery. As a benign
      disease with occupational active patient involvement, acute diverticulitis has a major
      economic impact by leading to repeat leaves in some patients, who are even on a waiting list
      to operate.

      EXPECTED IMPACT:

      We believe that this project can respond to the management of a group of patients, in which
      there is currently no consensus in the Scientific Community. Therefore, our results are
      transferable, as we intend to establish the pathophysiology of the entity known as chronic
      diverticulitis and detect the predictors of that entity. Currently, there is no consensus on
      the therapeutic management of patients with recurrent episodes of diverticulitis or
      persistent symptoms, so that they are treated differently at the discretion of the surgeon,
      without any scientific basis. It is also unclear whether it is a maintained inflammatory
      disorder or a functional disorder, which differentiation is basic in order to indicate a
      correct treatment of the patients. In addition, there is an information gap, unable to
      respond if a patient with acute diverticulitis will have a high or low probability of
      recurrence and at what time. There are still no studies answering these questions, key to
      choosing the best treatment and to give an answer to the huge population of diverticulitis
      patients.

      HYPOTHESIS.

        1. Establish a therapeutic algorithm in patients diagnosed with acute diverticulitis who go
           to the emergency department, whose initial management is not an urgent surgical
           intervention.

        2. There is an inflammatory physiopathology underlying between acute episodes, which can
           play a role in the apparition of the new episode of acute diverticulitis.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Description of prognostic factors of new episodes of acute diverticulitis which can be
           easy detected in the outpatient clinic, and creation of a therapeutic algorithm that
           allows selecting patients who could benefit from early surgery

        -  Descriptive analysis of symptoms with Health Related Quality of Life questionnaires
           (HRQL), in order to establish the evolution of the disease and correlate symptoms with
           systemic and local inflammatory markers.

        -  Sub-analysis of patients with immunosuppression to assess the virulence of the disease.

      METHODOLOGY RECRUITMENT. All patients who meet the inclusion criteria, do not present any
      exclusion criteria and voluntarily agree to participate in the study after having been
      visited and diagnosed in the following hospitals will be included: Bellvitge University
      Hospital (Barcelona), Vall d 'University Hospital Hebron (Barcelona), University Hospital del
      Mar (Barcelona), Moises Broggi University Hospital (Barcelona), Joan XXIII University
      Hospital (Tarragona), Parc Taul√≠ University Hospital (Sabadell), Althaia Hospital (Manresa),
      Josep Trueta University Hospital (Girona). All patients will receive an information sheet and
      informed consent. Once the patients are considered eligible and have formulated their
      questions and/or doubts to the investigator, they will be included.

      ratio, lymphocyte-monocyte ratio, Modified Glasgow Prognostic Score. Faecal calprotectin (the
      collection tube that the patient must deliver after the first deposition will be delivered).
