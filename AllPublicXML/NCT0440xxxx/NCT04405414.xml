  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since its recent marketizing in France, the cannabidiol (CBD), a major component of cannabis,
      is used in many over-the-counter products in France. Some painful patients or patients
      suffering from addiction seem to use the CBD in search of therapeutic effects. Yet, there are
      no data available for patients in algology and addictology, particularly with regard to the
      prevalence of the use of CBD, the effects sought and felt. Faced with the emergence of the
      use of a substance with a therapeutic purpose but outside a medical framework and without
      monitoring of adverse effects, it becomes essential to characterize the use of CBD. The main
      objective of the study is therefore to assess the prevalence of CBD users in algology and
      addictology departments. Secondary objectives are to characterize the use of CBD as well as
      the users of CBD, and to evaluate the impact of the use of CBD on other psychoactive
      substances use or current drug treatments and the drug liking of CBD.

      Physicians from algology and addictology departments will propose the study to all patients
      who meet the inclusion criteria during a medical consultation (in hospitalization or
      ambulatory care). If the patient agrees to participate, the non-opposition will be collected
      and the physician will complete a short form with sociodemographic data, medical history and
      contact details of the patient.

      The form will be transmitted securely to the research staff that will perform a unique
      research evaluation face to face (when the patient is still hospitalized and available) or by
      phone (when the patient is not available during hospitalization or no longer hospitalized or
      in case of ambulatory care). The research evaluation includes data about the frequency and
      the duration of the use of all substances (CBD included) in the last 12 months and the
      frequency of current drug treatments. For patients with CBD use in the last 12 months,
      additional data regarding the use of CBD will be collected: the form, the route of
      administration, the effects sought and felt, the method of obtaining, the impact on other
      drugs and/or substances use and the drug liking of CBD.

      A descriptive analysis will be carried out. The CBD user group and the CBD non-user group
      will be compared on all the variables collected. A multivariate analysis will be carried out
      in order to identify factors associated to CBD use in algology and addictology patients.
