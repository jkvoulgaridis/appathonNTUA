      Brief Summary: Retrospective study to evaluate the clinical performance of two restorative
      materials - glass-ionomer (GI) and resin-modified glass-ionomer (RMGI) materials - in Class V
      carious and non-carious cervical lesions restored by dental students.

      The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the clinical performance of glass-ionomer
      (GI) and resin-modified glass-ionomer (RMGI) materials in Class V carious and non-carious
      cervical lesions restored by dental students. Ninety-six (96) restorations performed with
      either GI (Fuji IX) (n=39) or RMGI (Fuji II) (n=57) were evaluated using the modified USPHS
      (United States Public Health Systems) criteria by two independent investigators at two
      follow-up evaluations (two years apart). The Fisher statistical test was used to compare
      USPHS criteria and examine significant differences by setting p&lt;0.05 for statistical
      significance and the Kaplan-Meier algorithm was used to calculate the survival probability.

    <description>Cervical carious lesions were removed with burs and spoon excavators or non-carious cervical lesions were roughened with round carbide burs to remove part of the sclerotic dentin. RMGI (GC Fuji 2) were available in premeasured capsules to facilitate handling and optimize the powder-liquid ratio. Capsules were first activated with one click in the capsule applier, mixed for 10 seconds in an amalgamator and released directly into the cavity preparation, and light-curing was performed for 20 seconds, according to manufacturer's instructions.</description>
