      In the context of IVF treatment, it's a standard of care to use progesterone for endometrial
      synchronization and for luteal phase support after embryos transfer and until week 9-12 of
      pregnancy.

      In Israel, as in most european countries, vaginal insert of Micronised Vaginal Progesterone
      (MVP) is mostly prescribed.

      Dydrogesterone is a potent active progesterone receptor agonist that is well tolerated,
      orally administered and is considered to be sufficiently safe during pregnancy.

      Based on recent publications, single oral dydrogesterone treatment seems to be a good option
      in clinical practice for luteal phase support in IVF cycles with fresh embryos transfer.

      But, until now, there is no publication evaluating the effectiveness of an addition of
      Dydrogesterone to the standard of care.

      The aim of the study is to compare effectiveness of addition of dydrogesterone 20mg to the
      standard luteal phase support treatment after fresh embryos transfer.

      The trial is a randomized controlled study, open label. Participants will receive either
      standard treatment with an addition of oral 10mg dydrogesterone (Duphaston) 2 times daily or
      the standard treatment without Dydrogesterone, starting on the day of fresh embryos transfer
      until 10 weeks of gestation or until pregnancy test is negative.

      Study participation will be proposed to every woman going through fresh embryos transfer in
      Laniado IVF unit, who meets the inclusion/exclusion criteria.

      The investigators aim to include 150 patients in each arm of the study, during 2 years.
