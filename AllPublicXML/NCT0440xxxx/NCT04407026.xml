  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Trefoil factor family (TFF) consists of a group of small peptides that have key roles in host
      immune response and repair of tissue damage. Interleukin (IL)-1β is a regulatory
      proinflammatory cytokine in periodontal inflammation. This study aimed to investigate the
      levels of TFF-1, TFF-3 and IL-1β in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF), saliva and serum of
      patients with gingivitis, stage 3 periodontitis and healthy individuals.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of one hundred participants were enrolled for the study. All individuals were
      assessed clinically and radiographically. Full-mouth clinical periodontal examinations were
      performed by the measurements of probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL),
      gingival index (GI), plaque index (PI) and bleeding on probing (BOP). All these measurements
      were recorded at six sites around each tooth with a manual periodontal probe. The
      participants were categorized into three groups: healthy controls (n=25), patients with
      gingivitis (n=25) and patients with periodontitis (n=50). Gingival crevicular fluid, saliva
      and serum samples were collected from each participant one day after the clinical periodontal
      measurements. TFF-1, TFF-3 and IL-1β levels of these biofluids were determined using the
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

        Healthy controls included volunteers with clinically healthy periodontium who had BOP &lt; 10%
        and PD ≤ 3 mm, no sites with attachment loss or radiographic sign of alveolar bone
        destruction. Gingivitis patients showed PD ≤ 3 mm with BOP &gt; 50% in the entire mouth as
        well as no clinical attachment loss or alveolar bone loss. Periodontitis patients (Stage 3)
        had PD ≥ 6 mm, interdental CAL ≥ 5 mm affecting 30% of the teeth or more and showed
        radiographic bone loss. They showed also no more than 4 teeth loss due to periodontitis.
