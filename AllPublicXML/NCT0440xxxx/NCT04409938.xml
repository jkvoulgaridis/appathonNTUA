    <textblock>
      Background: The aim of this study was to determine the effect of PMR and nature sounds on
      nursing students' BPM skills, and anxiety levels and vital signs.

      Methods: This was a randomized controlled experimental study conducted at the nursing
      department of the faculty of health sciences of a university. PMR participants rested for ten
      minutes between the sessions and then practiced PMR for 15 minutes. PMR+NS participants
      practiced PMR accompanied by nature sounds.

      Methods: This was a randomized controlled experimental study conducted at the nursing
      department of the faculty of health sciences of a university. PMR participants rested for ten
      minutes between the sessions and then practiced PMR for 15 minutes. PMR consisted of taking a
      deep breath five times and then clenching fists, raising the shoulders, bringing the forearms
      towards the body, stretching the triceps muscle, and tensing and relaxing the forehead, eye,
      chin, neck, chest, abdomen, back, hips, thigh, and feet muscles. The investigators made a
      video of exercises in a certain order and uploaded it to the television in the lab prior to
      the intervention. The investigators turned on the video during the intervention and asked the
      participants to follow the instructions for PMR exercises. PMR+NS participants practiced PMR
      accompanied by nature sounds.

    <measure>The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The STAI consists of two parts; the State Anxiety Inventory (SAI) and the Trait Anxiety Inventory (TAI). The SAI measures anxiety about an event while the TAI measures anxiety level as a personal characteristic. The TAI and SAI each consists of 20 items. The SAI items are scored on a 4-point Likert scale of 1 to 4 (1= never, 2= sometimes, 3= often, 4= always). The SAI items are scored on a 4-point Likert scale of 1 to 4 (1= almost never, 2= sometimes, 3= often, 4= almost always). Ten SAI items (1, 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 15, 16, 19, and 20) and six TAI items (1, 6, 7, 13, 16, and 19) are reverse scored. Higher scores indicate greater anxiety.</description>

    <measure>The Blood Pressure Knowledge Test (BPKT)</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion for each group, an average of 4 hour</time_frame>
    <description>BPKT is a multiple-choice test consisting of 20 items on definitions, physiology, affecting factors, classification, measurement sites, planning, application auscultation/ palpation measurement, and evaluation. A correct response is scored 1, and therefore, the total score ranges from 0 to 20.</description>
