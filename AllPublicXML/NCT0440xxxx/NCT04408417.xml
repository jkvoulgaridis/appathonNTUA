  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a tensioning progress
      indicator light to achieve proper harness tensioning in child safety seats.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to determine whether a prototype convertible child
      safety seat with visual indication of successful tensioning technology reduces the amount of
      harness slack compared with a standard safety seat. The secondary objective of the study is
      to assess caregivers' perceptions of the quality, design, and ease of use of the prototype
      child safety seat tensioning progress indicator lights. Participants will be
      parents/caregivers aged 18 to 75 years of children between 6 and 24 months of age.
      Approximately 130 caregiver-child dyads will be enrolled. Participants will be asked to
      harness their child into two versions of a convertible child safety seat, twice in each car
      seat. The intervention seat will be equipped with the technology that gives visual indication
      of successful harness tensioning. Participants will be observed, assessed, and asked a series
      of survey questions after each harnessing period.

    <intervention_model_description>This study is a 2-treatment, 4-period, 4-sequence crossover design. Each enrolled dyad will experience the prototype seat two times and the control seat two times for a total of four harnessing periods. The order of the harnessing periods will be randomly allocated at the start of the study visit and counterbalanced across participants.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>The order of the harnessing periods will be randomly allocated at the start of the study visit and counterbalanced across participants. Participants will be aware that the order of the harnessing periods is randomly assigned. Assignment status will not be concealed from the research assistants enrolling the dyads or the participants, or the rest of the study team.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in harness tension</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>After each of the four harnessing periods, the tension force on the safety seat harness will be measured with a load cell in Newtons and/or a qualitative &quot;pinch&quot; test which provides a binary value of tight vs not-tight. Within-participant harness tension is compared.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Participant perceptions of usability of the tension progress indicator light technology: survey</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Participant perceptions of the usability of the technology will be collected and the control and prototype harnessing systems will be compared. Participants will be asked to complete a post-intervention survey that contains 4 items pertaining to the usability of the technology through Likert scales (range from Very difficult to Very easy). There is no overall score for these survey items.</description>
