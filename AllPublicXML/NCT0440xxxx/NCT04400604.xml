  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol-induced liver injury is made up of fatty liver, fibrosis and alcoholic hepatitis
      (AH), elementary lesions that may occur separately, simultaneously or sequentially in a same
      patient. Among these histological features, alcoholic hepatitis, a necro-inflammatory process
      is associated with the fastest fibrosis progression leading to cirrhosis in 40% of cases and
      a pivotal lesion driving increased risk of liver decompensation.

      The non-invasive methods for the diagnosis of fibrosis open new perspectives for a better
      understanding of the natural history of disease-progression from early injury to the
      cirrhotic stage, for the identification of subgroup patients at risk of developing cirrhosis
      at medium term and for proposing a strategy of screening of patients with extensive cirrhosis
      at risk of liver-threatening events. There is an urgent need to perform studies in
      asymptomatic heavy drinkers in order to identify cut-offs associated with significant risk of
      development of cirrhosis at medium term. Such objectives require large-scale screening of
      heavy drinkers. Each of non-invasive methods have been tested to predict with of extensive
      fibrosis with a high predictive performance as shown below.

      A screening policy cannot be accepted without answering the following questions: a) are the
      requirements of public health screening fulfilled? b) Is the group of patients undergoing
      screening defined? c) is there a reliable method for of testing? Indeed, the detection of a
      disease is subject to certain public health requirements and may be proposed to health
      authorities only if it modifies the management of subjects screened. In the specific case of
      mass screening of liver fibrosis in heavy drinkers, only the detection of extensive fibrosis
      could fulfill this criterion because of the potential survival benefit resulting from the
      screening of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with extensive fibrosis. Indeed,
      recent studies have found that the probability of receiving curative treatment of HCC was
      significantly higher in patients who received a six-month surveillance ultrasound. Therefore,
      the detection of extensive fibrosis seems reasonable in the light of these studies when
      considering that the yearly risk of development of HCC in the subgroup of heavy drinkers with
      extensive fibrosis is approximately 3%.

      Taking into account the above scientific arguments, the most recent EASL clinical practical
      guidelines on ALD recommend longitudinal studies using non-invasive tools to evaluate
      screening of extensive fibrosis and disease progression in heavy drinkers.

To increase the specificity, the LCR2 test was developed by combining the components of LCR1 to alpha‐fetoprotein. The predetermined cutoffs are &lt;0.015 for low‐LCR1, and &lt;0.044 for low‐LCR2 will be tested as the rule-out values to exclude a risk of hepatocellular carcinoma.</description>

    <description>The AUDIT-C (Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test) quantifies alcohol misuse, based on 3 questions posed to patients about their consumption habits. It was adapted from the first three questions of the AUDIT.
The AUDIT-C is scored on a scale of 0-12 (scores of 0 reflect no alcohol use). Each question has 5 answer choice.
In men, a score of 4 or more is considered positive; in women, a score of 3 or more is considered positive. Generally, the higher the AUDIT-C score, the more likely it is that the patient's drinking is affecting his/her health and safety.</description>
