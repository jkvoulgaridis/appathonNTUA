      This study will examine the efficacy of a clinical intervention for improving emotional
      processing in individuals with MS and TBI.(1)The main outcome measure will be changes in
      emotional processing measures from pre to post treatment.

      (2)This study will also assess the impact of the emotional processing intervention on changes
      in pre and post treatment depression and anxiety, as well as fatigue.(3) This study will
      additionally measure the impact of the emotional processing intervention on cognitive
      functioning, specifically processing speed, attention and executive abilities. This will be
      accomplished through the completion of a neuropsychological battery prior to and following
      the completion of treatment.(4)Finally, the investigators will measure the impact of the
      intervention on quality of life and social functioning, utilizing a pre and post treatment
      assessment consisting of measures of self-efficacy, quality of life, functional abilities,
      and awareness.
