    <description>Complete Response：
platelets counts is greater than 100×10^9/L. significant volume reduction is greater than 80%. Fibrinogen levels at 2-4g/L. The surface skin of the tumor is lighter or the tumor is softer significantly.
Partial Response:
platelets counts is greater than 40×10^9/L. significant volume reduction is greater than 50%. Fibrinogen levels at less than 50% reduction from baseline. The surface skin of the tumor and palpation of the tumor have no change or less change.
No Response:
platelets counts is less than 40×10^9/L. significant volume reduction is less than 50% or the tumor is bigger. Fibrinogen levels at grater then 50% reduction from baseline. The surface skin of the tumor is darker or the tumor is harder.</description>

    <description>If the intravenous prednisolone 4 mg / kg / d (one time in the morning and one time in the evening, 2mg / kg body weight each time) is effective, it will be gradually reduced to 2mg / kg / D (one time in the morning and one time in the evening, 1mg / kg body weight each time), gradually converted to oral prednisone of equal dose, and the hormone will be removed within 4-6 weeks. At the same time, the dosage of sirolimus oral liquid is 0.8 mg / m2 twice a day, with an interval of 12 hours, maintaining the blood concentration of 8-15 ng / ml. if there is no intolerable side effect, the treatment will last for 6 months</description>

    <description>Prednison is taken at a dose of 4mg/kg/d. If the hormone treatment is effective, it will be gradually reduced to 2mg / kg / d (one time in the morning and one time in the evening, 1 mg / kg body weight each time), and repeated after 2 months of continuous treatment and 1 month of drug withdrawal.</description>
