      Primary Objective:

      o To assess the effect of dupilumab on lung function and related changes in airway volumes
      detectable by functional respiratory imaging

      Secondary Objective:

        -  To evaluate the effect of dupilumab at Week 24 on bronchodynamics, hyperinflation,
           airway resistance, airway wall thickness, ventilation defects and mucus plugging derived
           from high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scans, patient-reported outcomes, FeNO
           and spirometry.

        -  To evaluate safety of dupilumab

      The study duration for each participant will be a total of minimum 29 weeks and up to 41
      weeks. This includes 4 weeks +/-1 week screening period, 24 weeks of treatment period and a
      follow-up period up to 12 weeks or until the patients switch to commercialized dupilumab (or
      other biologic products), whatever comes first.

        Inclusion criteria :

          -  18 to 70 years of age inclusive with the diagnosis of asthma based on Global Strategy
             for Asthma Management and Prevention (GINA) 2019 at the time of signing the informed
             consent

          -  History of ≥1 exacerbation (s) in the previous year

          -  Uncontrolled moderate to severe asthma (ACQ-5 ≥1.5) at V1 and V2, prior to
             randomization

          -  Pre-bronchodilator FEV1 ≤80% of predicted normal at V1 and V2, prior to randomization

          -  Exhibit bronchodilator reversibility (≥12% and 200 mL improvement in FEV1 post SABA
             administration) during screening, prior to randomization

          -  Blood eosinophil ≥300 cells /µL and FeNO ≥25 ppb during screening, prior to
             randomization

          -  Existing treatment with medium to high dose ICS in combination with a second
             controller (e.g. LABA, LTRA) ± a third controller. The dose regimen should be stable
             ≥1 month prior V1 and during screening.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Current smoker (cigarette or e-cigarette) or cessation of smoking within 1 year prior
             randomization

          -  Previous smoker with a smoking history &gt;10 pack-years

          -  Known hypersensitivity to dupilumab or any of its excipients

          -  Asthma exacerbation during the screening, prior to randomization

          -  Current acute bronchospasm or status asthmaticus

          -  Diagnosed pulmonary (other than asthma) or systemic disease associated with elevated
             peripheral eosinophil counts

          -  History or clinical evidence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) including
             Asthma-COPD Overlap Syndrome (ACOS) or any other significant lung disease (eg, lung
             fibrosis, sarcoidosis, interstitial lung disease, pulmonary hypertension,

          -  Active tuberculosis, latent untreated tuberculosis or a history of incompletely
             treated tuberculosis or non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection unless it is well
             documented by a specialist that the patient has been adequately treated and the
             treatment with a biologic agent can be initiated, in the medical judgment of the
             Investigator and/or infectious disease specialist. Tuberculosis testing would only be
             performed on a country by country basis according to the routine clinical practice and
             the local guidelines, if required by regulatory authorities or ethics committees

             non-respiratory system (e.g. cardiovascular, nervous system, gastrointestinal,
             endocrinological, rheumatological, dermatological), which, in the judgment of the
             Investigator, could interfere with the study or require treatment that might interfere
             with the study

          -  Current evidence of clinically significant oncological disease, which in the opinion

          -  Positive (or indeterminate) hepatitis B surface antigen (HBs Ag) or

          -  Positive Hepatitis B IgM core antibody (IgM HBc Ab) or

          -  Positive total hepatitis B core antibody (total HBc Ab) confirmed by positive HBV DNA
             or

          -  Positive hepatitis C antibody (HCV Ab) confirmed by positive HCV RNA

          -  History of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or positive HIV serology at V
             1

          -  Any biologic therapy (including experimental treatments and dupilumab) or any other
             biologic therapy/immunosuppressant within 3 months prior to V1

          -  Treatment with live (attenuated) vaccine within 12 weeks before V1

          -  Chronic treatment with oral corticosteroids (OCS) for more than 2 weeks before V1

          -  Enrolled in other ongoing studies regardless of the investigational product

          -  Treatment with an investigational drug within 8 weeks or within 5 half-lives (if
             known), whichever is longer, prior to V1

          -  Suspected or high risk of parasitic infection (helminthic infection), unless clinical
             and (if necessary) laboratory assessments have ruled out active infection prior to
             randomization

          -  Females who are lactating, breastfeeding, or who are pregnant

          -  Individuals accommodated in an institution because of regulatory or legal order;
             prisoners or subjects who are legally institutionalized

          -  Patients are dependent on the Sponsor or Investigator (in conjunction with Section
             1.61 of the ICH GCP Ordinance E6)

          -  Patients are employees of the clinical study site or other individuals directly
             involved in the conduct of the study, or immediate family members of such individuals

          -  Sensitivity to any of the study interventions, or components thereof, or drug or other
             allergy that, in the opinion of the Investigator, contraindicates participation in the
             study

          -  Any country-related specific regulation that would prevent the subject from entering
             the study

        The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's
