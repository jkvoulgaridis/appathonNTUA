  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Staphylococcus lugdunensis is a coagulase-negative staphylococcus belonging to the human
      commensal cutaneous flora, and has been little studied in the field of prosthetic joint
      infections. However, it shares many virulence traits with Staphylococcus aureus, including
      many adhesins and its ability to form biofilm, and the few series of cases reports a
      significant failure rate.
