  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the effectiveness of an evidence-based virtual reality therapy program
      as a non-pharmacological supplement to managing patients with pain due to chronic lower back
      pain. Outpatients will be randomized to receive one of three virtual reality (VR) programs:
      skills-based VR, distraction VR, or sham VR. All patients will receive a VR headset and
      Fitbit Charge 3 watch. Study devices will be delivered to the patient's home with
      instructions for use via FedEx; patients will receive remote technical support. Patients will
      be followed for 90 days and monitored for functional status, pain levels, use of pain
      medications (including opioids). Participants will also be asked to consent/authorization to
      access medical records from their treating facility.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial for individuals with chronic
      lower back pain. This study investigates the effect of at-home virtual reality (VR) pain
      reduction therapy on a set of outcome measures. The primary outcome is Patient-Reported
      Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Pain Interference version 8. This study will
      enroll 360 participants into one of three VR therapy groups. Data collection will occur at
      home via personal computer or smartphone (iphone/android), with baseline data collected one
      week before the intervention is mailed to the patient. The patient will have the VR headset
      for 90 days. A post-study survey will be sent to patients 30 days after the end of the study.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Pain Interference</measure>
    <time_frame>This will be measured weekly for the first 4 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint is the change from study baseline (Screening week, aka week -1) to week 4 in pain interference as measured by PROMIS-PI.</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome for this study will be self-reported pain interference using Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Pain Interference (PI) version 8. The pain interference scale measures the consequences of pain on relevant aspects of one's life. This includes the extent to which pain hinders engagement with social, cognitive, emotional, physical, and recreational activities. It is the 8 question version. The max score is 40 and the minimum is 8. The higher the score the worse the outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Catastrophizing Survey Short Form 6</measure>
    <time_frame>biweekly until week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Pain catastrophizing is a negative mental set regarding actual or anticipated pain, and includes aspects of rumination, magnification, and sense of helplessness. It will be measured using the Pain Catastrophizing scale (PCS) short form, which a 6-item questionnaire. The max score is 24 and the minimum is 0. The higher the score the worse the outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Anxiety 4</measure>
    <time_frame>biweekly until week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Anxiety is a commonly comorbid disease with chronic lower back pain. The PROMIS Anxiety scale will be used to assess it. This is the 4 question version of the scale. The max score is 20 and the minimum is 4. The higher the score the worse the outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Sleep Disturbance 6a</measure>
    <time_frame>biweekly until week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Given the impact of chronic pain on mental health there is also an impact on sleep. PROMIS Sleep Disturbance is a well-validated survey to assess sleep quality. This is version A of the 6 item scale. The max score is 30 and the minimum is 6. The higher the score the worse the outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Use of Opioids</measure>
    <time_frame>The average for 30 days before Day 1 and the 30 day average at 90 day will be compared within the study.</time_frame>
    <description>In order to capture use of opioids, we will link patient electronic health record (EHR) data to the other data sources using Medical Record Numbers and date of birth. We will also request access to the CURES database for research purposes. We will convert all opioid doses into a single metric using morphine milligram equivalents (MME).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Physical Function 6b</measure>
    <time_frame>biweekly basis until week 12</time_frame>
    <description>For patients with chronic pain, physical function is often diminished and patients seek return to normal function. The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Physical Function short-form 6b scale is a widely- validated instrument with excellent content validity, construct validity, and reliability in patients with spinal disorders and other conditions marked by diminished mobility. The instrument places patients on a continuum of function from extremely low to very high across activities that require physical actions, ranging from self-care to more complex activities that require a combination of skills. The max score is 30 and the minimum is 6. The higher the score the worse the outcome.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Depression 4</measure>
    <time_frame>biweekly until week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Depression is a commonly comorbid disease with chronic lower back pain. The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Depression scale will be used to assess it. This is the 4 item version of the scale. The max score is 20 and the minimum is 4. The higher the score the worse the outcome.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Biometric data from Fitbit Charge 3 - Physical Activity</measure>
    <time_frame>Continuously from week 1 to week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The total steps per day and active steps per day will be collected to assess physical activity.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Pain Interference 8</measure>
    <time_frame>biweekly from week 6 to week 12</time_frame>
    <description>PROMIS Pain Interference 8 will also be assessed after the first month of the study at a biweekly interval. As stated above the pain interference scale measures the consequences of pain on relevant aspects of one's life. The max score is 40 and the minimum is 8. The higher the score the worse the outcome.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Biometric data from Fitbit Charge 3 - Sleep Quality</measure>
    <time_frame>Continuously from week 1 to week 12</time_frame>

    <ipd_description>This study is part of the NIH Helping to End Addiction Long-term (HEAL) Initiative focused on understanding and developing new treatments for addiction and pain. Research gives us the best information and progresses more quickly when data is available from many studies and many individuals, and when many researchers can work with the data and samples and analyze them in different ways. Therefore, your data and samples will be used for this and other NIH Helping to End Addiction Long-term Initiative studies. Your stored data and samples will also be made widely available to other researchers. The shared data and samples may be used indefinitely for research not related to this study or the Helping to End Addiction Long-term (HELP) Initiative, without asking you for additional consent.</ipd_description>
