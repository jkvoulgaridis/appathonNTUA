      Analysis our Embryo transfer data, prospectively collected during the last 6 years (2014-
      2019), performed by the same operator YP, who has been doing embryo transfers since 1984. All
      factors that might impact the embryo transfer will be analyzed. We want to see which factors
      that influence the success rate are not related to the subjectivity of the operator and could
      be adjusted through different approaches.

      Most patients undergoing IVF or ICSI reach a blastocyst embryo transfer but less achieve
      pregnancy and live birth. Many reasons have been proposed to explain these results. Among
      them, the factor Embryo Transfer Procedure gained less of the attention since few papers have
      been published and most of them had a lot of biases. In order to eliminate possible biases,
      we wanted to analyze our Embryo transfer data, prospectively collected during the last 6
      years (2014- 2019), performed by the same operator YP, who has been doing embryo transfers
      since 1984. All factors that might impact the embryo transfer will be analyzed. We want to
      see which factors that influence the success rate are not related to the subjectivity of the
      operator and could be adjusted through different approaches.

      Primary outcomes: bhCG positive rate, pregnancy rate, ongoing pregnancy rate, live birth
      rate.

      Secondary outcomes: Full bladder, uterine ax orientation, Endometrial thickness, type of
      catheter, straightforward advancement of the preloaded catheter, use of a stiffer hard
      catheter to pass through the cervix and the orifice, the site of the uterine cavity that the
      embryo was released, single or double transfer due to blocked embryo in the catheter.

      In addition for each embryo transfer variables that may influence the pregnancy rates will be
      collected: age of the woman, number of oocytes harvested, sperm characteristics,
      fertilization rate, stage and grade of the embryos the day of transfer
