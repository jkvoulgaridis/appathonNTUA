  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anyone living with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) has an indication for annual
      influenza vaccination. (Vaccination schedule and vaccination recommendations 2019). Influenza
      is a viral infection that has a significant impact on the health care system. However,
      vaccination coverage in France is still insufficient with regard to the objectives set at 75%
      by the WHO and the European Commission. For the 2019-2020 seasonal influenza vaccination
      campaign, flu vaccination by volunteer pharmacists has become possible throughout the
      country. Studies that have estimated vaccination coverage among HIV-positive populations are
      rare and show very low rates.
