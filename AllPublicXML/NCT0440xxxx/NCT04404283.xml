  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to see if adding brentuximab vedotin helps two drugs work better to
      treat patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Participants in this study will
      have DLBCL that has come back or not gotten better with treatment.

      Patients will be randomly assigned to get either brentuximab vedotin or placebo. The placebo
      will look like brentuximab vedotin, but has no medicine in it. Since the study is &quot;blinded,&quot;
      patients and their doctors will not know whether a patient gets brentuximab vedotin or
      placebo. All patients in the study will get rituximab and lenalidomide. These are drugs that
      can be used to treat DLBCL.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants with relapsed or refractory diffuse and transformed large B-cell lymphoma
             (R/R DLBCL). DLBCL and cell of origin (GCB versus non-GCB) will be histologically
             determined by local pathology assessment for the purposes of study eligibility and
             stratification.

          -  Participants must have R/R disease following 2 or more lines of prior systemic
             therapy.

          -  Participants must be HSCT or CAR-T ineligible according to the investigator and must
             meet at least one of the following criteria:

               1. One or more co-morbidities, including cardiac, pulmonary, renal or hepatic
                  dysfunction that in the opinion of the Investigator make the subject medically
                  unfit to received HSCT or CAR-T therapy

               2. Active disease following induction and salvage chemotherapy

               3. Inadequate stem cell mobilization (for HSCT)

               4. Relapse following prior HSCT or CAR-T

               5. Unable to receive CAR-T therapy due to financial, geographic, or insurance issues

          -  Participants will need to have a formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue
             (obtained ≤4 weeks before Day 1) submitted to the central pathology lab.

          -  An Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of 0 to 2

          -  Participants must have fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avid disease by positron emission
             tomography (PET) and bidimensional measurable disease of at least 1.5 cm by computed
             tomography (CT), as assessed by the site radiologist within 28 days of Day 1.

          -  Participants must be registered into the mandatory lenalidomide REMS® program and be
             willing to comply with its requirements. Per standard lenalidomide REMS® program

             drugs

          -  Congestive heart failure, Class III or IV, by the NYHA criteria
