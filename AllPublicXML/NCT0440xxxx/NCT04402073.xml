  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medulloblastoma is a rare brain malignancy, mainly affecting children. Treatment of this
      rapidly growing tumor begins with maximal surgical removal plus radiation and chemotherapy.
      Treatment toxicity is high. Post-pubertal and pediatric medulloblastomas are biologically and
      prognostically different, which mandates age-adapted treatment strategies. Patients after
      puberty bear an intermediate to high prognostic risk. This means that a large number of these
      patients, are faced with death and/or disability (mainly neurocognitive). Therefore, the
      scientific and medical need is high. One of the genetic subgroups of medulloblastoma, the
      SHH-subgroup (Sonic HedgeHog- subgroup), is highly overrepresented in medulloblastoma
      patients after puberty. This subgroup can be treated with a targeted therapy. The
      investigators will therefore randomize patients and treat SHH-subgroup patients with
      sonidegib and a reduction of radiotherapy dose in the experimental arm of the trial. The
      hypothesis that this personalized risk-adapted therapy will improve outcomes in view of
      increased efficacy and decreased toxicity.

    <description>This study will use the International Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 5.0, for adverse event reporting (with neurological, kidney, auditory, endocrine and radiotherapy associated as AE of special interest). The highest CTCAE v. 5 grading per cycle and per patient will be computed at the EORTC HQ for analysis . Safety and tolerability analyses will be performed in the safety population. Severe grades (3/4) which did not resolve after treatment discontinuation or emerged during follow-up will be identified and listed.</description>

    <description>The primary HRQoL endpoint that is considered relevant for this study is social functioning. The other scales from the QLQ-C30 and BN20 will be considered as exploratory in nature.
A difference of 10 points on the 100-point QLQ-C30 social functioning scale between the two arms will be considered as clinically relevant.</description>
