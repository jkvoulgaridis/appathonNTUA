  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see how a diet that supplements fermented foods effects
      inflammation and quality of life in patients with mild to moderate Ulcerative Colitis (UC).
      There is a paucity of research and an enormous need for better understanding of diet and
      intestinal inflammation. Fermented food have been shown to positively influence inflammatory
      cytokines and intestinal microbial diversity in healthy volunteers.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical response as per partial Mayo score.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Data Collection 1) versus Week 10 (Data Collection 2).</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical response as per partial Mayo score is defined as a decrease from baseline in the partial Mayo Score of &gt;=2 points and either a rectal bleeding subscore of &lt;=1 or a decrease in the rectal bleeding subscore of &gt;=1 point (assessed at Data Collection 2). The partial Mayo score consists of the subscores for stool frequency, rectal bleeding, and PGA, omitting endoscopy. Each subscore is graded from 0 to 3 (3 being the worst situation and 0 the best) and the partial Mayo score is graded from 0 to 9 (0 being the best, 9 being the worst outcome).</description>

    <measure>Clinical remission as per partial Mayo score.</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at Week 10 (Data Collection 2).</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical remission as per partial Mayo score is defined as a partial Mayo score &lt; 2 points and no individual subscale score &gt;1 point (assessed at Data Collection 2). The partial Mayo score is graded from 0 to 9 (0 being the best, 9 being the worst outcome).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Symptomatic remission as per Patient Reported Outcome (PRO2) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at Week 10 (Data Collection 2).</time_frame>
    <description>Symptomatic remission is defined as as a Mayo stool frequency subscore of 0 or 1 and a Mayo rectal bleeding subscore of 0 (assessed at Data Collection 2). The partial Mayo score is graded from 0 to 9 (0 being the best, 9 being the worst outcome).</description>
