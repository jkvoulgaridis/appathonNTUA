      A rheumatology biorepository will be created to permit comparative analyses between the
      rheumatic diseases in order to increase the understanding of disease pathogenesis. Patients
      diagnosed with rheumatic diseases are invited to participate in this study. These rheumatic
      diseases include, but are not limited to: adult onset Still's disease, ankylosing
      spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, reactive arthritis, antiphospholipid syndrome, systemic
      lupus erythematosus, Behcet's disease, dermatomyositis, polymyositis, giant cell arteritis
      and other vasculitides, Lyme's disease, mixed connective tissue disease, polymyalgia
      rheumatica, rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis, systemic sclerosis (scleroderma), Sjogren's
      syndrome, and undifferentiated connective tissue disease. Healthy volunteers are also invited
      to participate in this study.

        The biorepository will consist of both new and established patients with a rheumatic
        autoimmune disease diagnosis who visit a Yale Rheumatology medical facility and agree to
        participate in this study. The biorepository will also consist of healthy volunteers who
        agree to participate in this study.
