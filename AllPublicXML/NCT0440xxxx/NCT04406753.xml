  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Restrictions on upper cervical spine are associated with cervical pain. The vast majority of
      upper cervical spine rotation occurs at the C1-2 segment. Flexion-rotation test is a valid
      measure that predominantly measures rotation in C1-2 segment, however upper cervical spine
      rotation also implies C0-1 and C2-3 due to ligament anatomy. Restriction in flexion-rotation
      may be due to direct restriction in C1-2, but also to a premature tightening of the alar
      ligament as a result of lack of movement in C0-1 or C2-3.

      The objective is to compare the effect of a 20-minutes single cervical exercise session with
      or without manual therapy of C0-1 and C2-3 segment in flexion-rotation test in patients with
      chronic neck pain and positive flexion-rotation test.

      To carry out the objective, the following will be designed a randomized controlled
      assessor-blind clinical trial with primary healthcare patients.

      This population will be patients with chronic neck pain and positive flexion-rotation test.
      These patients will be assigned in manual therapy + exercise group or in exercise group.

      Exercise will be focused on deep anterior cervical muscles. Manual therapy will combine
      techniques in C0-1 and C2-3 with this exercise. Flexion-rotation test, neck pain intensity,
      pain intensity during the flexion-rotation test and cervical range of motion will be measured
      before and after the intervention.

    <description>This test is used to see the amount of movement of the upper cervical spine and is the test most used in the literature. It is positive when there is a decrease of 10 degrees or more in the cervical rotation with maximum flexion, in a sense with respect to the contralateral or presents hypomobility of segment C1 with a mobility less than 33ยบ</description>

    <description>The Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) is a one-dimensional measure of pain intensity in adults. The NPRS is a segmented numeric version of the visual analog scale (VAS) in which a respondent selects a whole number (0-10 integers) that best reflects the intensity of his/her pain. The common format is a horizontal bar or line. Similar to the VAS, the NPRS is anchored by terms describing pain severity extremes.</description>

    <description>Manual Therapy + Exercise group will carry out 20-minute session of treatment. The techniques will be applied depending on the clinical findings in each patient and the objective will be to restore the function of C0-1 and C2-3 segments before applying cervical exercises. We will use manipulation (high velocity low amplitude) and/or mobilization (low velocity high amplitude) techniques of C0-1 and C2-3 segments with cervical exercise. Manipulations will be in the direction of traction, with the head in a neutral position. A maximum of two trials at each level on each side will perform (2-6 thrusts). Mobilization will be performed for 5 minutes using repeating cycles of 45 seconds of mobilization and 15 seconds of rest. The cervical exercise will perform by this group will follow the same methodology as the Exercise group.</description>

    <description>This group will perform the cervical stabilization exercise. They will be teach to perform the contraction of deep neck flexor muscle activity with the help of the Stabilizer Pressure Biofeedback Unit (Chattanooga, USA) in supine. Exercise will be always carry out without pain, because pain can be an inhibitor of muscle contraction.
The Exercise group will carry out one 20-minute session, composed of 2 sets of 10 repetitions, holding each repetition for 10 seconds, a 40-second rest between each repetition and 2 minutes between sets.</description>
