    <textblock>
      Although erector spinae plane (ESP) block reportedly provides postoperative pain relieve,
      controversy remains regarding the accuracy and consistency of analgesic success following ESP
      block. The goal of this study is to determine the extent and duration of clinical neural
      blockade following an ESP injection with different local anesthetic doses.

      Methods Twenty four healthy volunteers will be recruited, and each subject will make 2
      separate visits to the study centre to undergo intervention and assessment. The 2 study
      visits will be separated by an interval of at least 2 weeks to ensure complete washout of any
      residual effects and a return to baseline status.

      At each study visit, the subject will receive a unilateral ESP block with 1.5% lidocaine and
      5 mcg/mL epinephrine. Two different local anesthetic volumes will be investigated: 20 mL (300
      mg lidocaine) at one study visit and 30 mL (450 mg lidocaine) at the other study visit.
      Volunteers will be randomized to one of two intervention groups: (1) Group 20/30: A
      unilateral ESP block with 20 mL of local anesthetic at the first visit, and 30 mL of local
      anesthetic at the second visit; or (2) Group 30/20: a unilateral ESP block with 30 mL of 1.5%
      lidocaine with 1/200,000 epinephrine at the first visit, and 20 mL of the same local
      anesthetic solution at the second visit.

      There will be 2 study subgroups based on the vertebral level at which the ESP block is
      administered: (1) Volunteer subjects in subgroup TP4 will receive the ESP block injection at
      the T4 transverse process (TP4) level in order to evaluate the anesthetic effect on the chest
      wall. (2) Volunteers in subgroup TP8 will receive the ESP block injection at the T8
      transverse process (TP8) level in order to evaluate the anesthetic effect on the abdominal
      wall. The first 10 volunteer subjects recruited will receive ESP blocks at the TP4 level and
      the subsequent 10 subjects will receive ESP blocks at the TP8 level.

    <textblock>
      Erector spinae plane (ESP) block is a new regional nerve block technique that involves a
      percutaneous injection of local anesthetic as a bolus through a needle or catheter into the
      fascial plane between the erector spinae muscle and the transverse processes in the upper or
      mid back (Kot 2019) (De Cassai 2019) (Chin 2019). Injection at the level of the T4-5
      transverse process is indicated for chest wall pain relief while injection at the T8-9 level
      is for abdominal wall pain control. This block aims to relieve postoperative pain but is not
      intended to provide anesthetic blockade for surgery. Preliminary case reports and some
      randomized controlled trials show encouraging analgesic effect of ESP block for breast
      surgery (GÃ¼rkan 2018), rib fracture (Hamilton 2017), thoracotomy (Nath 2018) (Forero 2017),
      sternotomy (Krishna 2019), epigastric hernia repair (Abu Elyazed 2019), open abdominal
      surgery (Restrepo-Garces 2017), laparoscopic abdominal surgery (Tulgar 2018), radical
      retropubic prostatectomy (Tulgar 2018) and hip arthroplasty (Tulgar 2018). Although
      effective, controversy remains regarding the accuracy and consistency of analgesic success
      following ESP block.

      Currently, it is unclear whether block inconsistency is due to improper injection technique
      or the mechanism of action. Presumably, local anesthetic following an ESP block injection
      will find its way antero-medially through the costotransverse foramen and / or inter
      transverse ligaments to enter the thoracic paravertebral space (Vidal 2018) (Yang 2018) or
      epidural space (Schwartzmann 2018) to block the ventral rami of the thoracic spinal nerves.
      It may also spread laterally to reach the neighbouring intercostal nerves (Adhikary 2018).

      At this time, it is unclear whether cadaver injection studies showing dye spread to these
      anatomical spaces can fully explain the observed clinical neural blockade. Also a number of
      cadaver studies show inconsistent and conflicting dye spread results, i.e., failure to reach
      the thoracic paravertebral space (Ivanusic 2018) (Dautzenberg 2019). Although some suggest
      that an ESP block also provides sympathetic blockade thus may provide visceral pain relief,
      no study has evaluated the validity of such a claim or the extent of sympathetic blockade.

      The mechanisms of action for an ESP block are currently unclear. Although most case reports
      describe analgesic effects of ESP block for anterior chest and abdominal surgery presumably
      as a result of blockade of the ventral rami of the spinal nerves in the thoracic
      paravertebral spaces, it is more likely that local anesthetic injected in the ESP will
      reliably anesthetize the dorsal rami traversing the erector spinae muscle in the back. This
      is supported by preliminary clinical analgesic success of ESP block for thoracic spine
      surgery (Ueshima 2017) and lumbar spine surgery (Singh 2018) (Melvin 2018) (Chin 2018). The
      consistency of blocking the ventral and dorsal rami following an ESP block injection is
      unknown at this time.

      Investigators' clinical experience further confirms that an ESP injection provides variable
      analgesic results and an objective sign of sensory anesthesia to pinprick or ice is not
      consistently evident. Currently no study has examined the optimal technique of ESP block
      injection, peak blood local anesthetic level after injection, the effect of spine movement
      (i.e., gliding movement of erector spinae muscle on the transverse processes) on neural
      blockade, and the consistency of this block technique. Also, most case reports on surgical
      patients did not report the onset, progression or resolution of ESP blockade or the extent of
      sensory and sympathetic blockade. From a clinical perspective, it would be very helpful to
      determine the extent and duration of clinical neural blockade following an ESP injection with
      different local anesthetic doses and such detailed examination is possible only in a
      carefully conducted volunteer study.
