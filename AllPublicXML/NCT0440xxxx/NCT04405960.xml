  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Indonesian population's life expectancy has been increasing steadily in the last 3 decades.
      It potentially increases the prevalence of degenerative diseases, including osteoarthritis
      (OA). Serum Vitamin D (25(OH)D) level has been recognized as a risk factors for knee OA.
      Cartilage Oligomeric Matrix Protein (COMP) is cartilage degradation product can be used as a
      diagnostic marker for knee OA. This study aims to determine the effect of Vitamin D
      supplementation (Alphacalcidol) on pain based on WOMAC indicators and joint cartilage
      condition based on COMP serum markers in knee OA elderly patients.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vitamin D plays important role to enhance calcium absorption in intestine and promotes
      mineralization of bones. Several studies found that Vitamin D levels were low in patients
      with knee OA.

      Vitamin D deficiency were found in 50% of women age 45-55 years old and 35% of women age
      60-90 years old in Jakarta and Bekasi. Alphacalcidol is a vitamin D supplementation
      recommended to be used in patients with renal insufficiency, which is prevalent in elderly.
      Alfacalcidol does not need to undergo renal 1-alpha-hydroxylation which impaired in renal
      insufficiency, although it can still cause hypercalcemia.

      Current detection and diagnosis of knee OA relies on plain radiological examination, which is
      not really objective because it depends on radiological expertise and experience. Moreover,
      plain radiological diagnosis has limited ability to detect joint damage at an early stage.
      Therefore, knee OA is often diagnosed at advanced stage. For this reason, selecting accurate
      joint cartilage biomarkers is important to detect and predict the severity of OA objectively
      and at earlier stage. Cartilage Oligomeric Matrix Protein (COMP) is one of degradation
      products released into synovium fluid and bloodstream from cartilage matrix turnover process.
      Therefore, COMP can be used as a marker of diagnosis and cartilage injury severity of knee
      OA.

      Currently, there has been no study about the association of Vitamin D supplementation with
      pain level and cartilage matrix turnover process in Indonesia. Therefore, this study aims to
      determine the effect of Vitamin D supplementation (Alphacalcidol) on pain and joint cartilage
      condition in elderly patients with knee OA.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled trials. Elderly subjects with symptomatic knee OA visited our clinic in Jakarta were recruited. Medical history taking, physical examinations, knee radiology, blood test for Vitamin D (25(OH)D), calcium, and COMP serum were performed. Subjects were then randomly allocated to either intervention group to be given 1 µg Alphacalcidol or control group to be given placebo in 12 weeks.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>This study used Contract Research Organization (CRO) Equilab to ensure the quality. In this study, researchers, respondents, interviewers, supplement providers, radiology and laboratory staffs were blinded. The interviewers used a questionnaire that had been prepared previously and was used equally for the intervention and control groups.
Knee x-ray examination was performed to determine knee OA severity based on Kellgren-Lawrence grading system. It was carried out using the same method and technique between the intervention and control groups. X-ray examination was carried out at the same hospital's radiology unit and was interpreted blindingly by the same radiologist. Blood examination to measure 25(OH)D and COMP was carried out using the same methods and techniques between the intervention and control groups by staffs from the same certified laboratory.</masking_description>
