  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, suprainguinal fascia iliaca block (SFIB) has emerged as a reliable analgesic
      option for primary total hip arthroplasty (THA). In 2018, a new block was described, termed
      pericapsular nerve group block or PENG block, that selectively targets the articular branches
      of the femoral and obturator nerves while sparing their motor components. In this randomized
      trial, the investigators will compare US-guided SFIB and PENG block in patients undergoing
      primary THA. Since the main benefit of PENGB stems from its quadriceps-sparing effect, it was
      selected the incidence of quadriceps motor block (at 6 hours) as the primary outcome and the
      hypothesis that PENG block will result in significantly less motor block compared to SFIB.

    <description>Quadriceps motor function will be tested with the patient supine and with the hip and knee flexed at 45º and 90º, respectively. The subject will be asked to extend the knee first against gravity and then against resistance. Quadriceps strength will be graded according to a 3-point scale: normal strength = 0 point (extension against resistance); paresis = 1 point (extension against gravity but not against resistance); and paralysis = 2 points (no extension).</description>

    <description>Hip adduction will be evaluated by comparing it to baseline strength (i.e., prior to spinal anesthesia). A blood pressure cuff, inflated at 40 mmHg, will be inserted between the knees of the patient: the latter will then be instructed to squeeze the cuff as hard as possible and to sustain the effort.
