      Whereas diabetes mellitus is clearly a risk factor for the occurrence of stroke and for its
      poor prognosis, hyperglycemia per se is also linked to increased morbidity and mortality in
      stroke patients.Therefore, the objective of this work was to study the glycemic status of
      acute ischemic stroke patients and to assess its impact on stroke outcome.

      Using PASS program, setting alpha error at 5% and power of 80%, the total sample size was
      estimated to be 80 cases.

      The NIHSS was used as a primary outcome; 40 cases were needed in each group. Secondary
      outcomes were hemorrhagic transformation, hospital stay duration, mechanical ventilation,
      need for vasopressors, and 30-days mortality.

        This study included eighty acute ischemic stroke patients who presented within 24 hours of
        onset of symptoms. They were equally divided into two groups; group A included patients
        with normal (70-150 mg/dl) RBS on ICU admission and controlled blood sugar within 24 h,
        while group B included those with high RBS on ICU admission and uncontrolled blood sugar
        during first 24 h.
