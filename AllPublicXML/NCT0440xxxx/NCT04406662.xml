  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with incurable cancer often have complex individual needs, however there are several
      common themes encountered when considering this group.

      As cancer progresses there are series of interactions between the tumour and the patient,
      producing both local and systemic effects. This altered state of illness can have multiple
      ill effects including weight loss, fatigue, increased symptom burden and reduction in
      physical function which all contribute to a reduced quality of life.

      These areas are often studied in isolation, giving an incomplete picture. A detailed,
      holistic characterisation of this group of people does not exist.

      A robust characterisation of people with incurable cancer will allow identification and
      prioritisation of future research and has the potential to inform new therapeutics and
      provide justification for treatments.

      This study aims to collect information about symptoms and quality of life, weight loss and
      body composition, physical activity and the body's immune response to cancer.

      Participants with incurable cancer will be recruited to the study from oncology and
      palliative medicine services in the UK. Participants will answer questionnaires about quality
      of life and symptoms, have bloods taken for inflammatory marker and cytokine analysis and
      have their body composition measured by a variety of methods.

      Blood samples - samples sent for routine inflammatory markers, plasma retained for analysis
      of cytokine levels and stored in a biobank for use in future ethically approved studies
      including potential genetic DNA analysis.

      Archival tissue specimens (including fresh frozen and/or formalin fixed paraffin embedded
      biopsy/surgical specimens) that are no longer required by the local pathologist for
      diagnostic purposes, or are stored as part of ethically approved tissue collection/research
      studies, may be requested from patients in the course of establishing the biobank for further
      analysis in future studies

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with incurable cancer (metastatic cancer (Clinical, histological, cytological
             or radiological evidence) or receiving anti-cancer therapy with palliative intent).

          -  Aged 18-years and over

          -  Written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any concomitant medical or psychiatric problems which, in the opinion of the
             investigator, would increase the risk of complication for the participant and/or
             investigator.

          -  Participants will not be able to take part in bio-impedance analysis if they have a
             pacemaker or implantable cardiac defibrillator.
