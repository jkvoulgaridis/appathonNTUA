  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Emerging evidence indicates that circadian rhythms may be disrupted following cancer and its
      treatment, and that circadian rhythm disruption may be an underlying pathophysiological
      mechanism of cancer- and cancer treatment-related symptoms (CRS) such as fatigue, sleep
      disturbance, cognitive impairment, and depressed mood. Given the detrimental effect of CRS on
      cancer survivors' quality of life, and a pressing demand for effective interventions to treat
      CRS, there is a need for a comprehensive examination of circadian disruption related to
      cancer and its treatment, and its association with CRS. The study will prospectively examine
      circadian rhythms and a CRS composite score in recently diagnosed breast cancer patients from
      prior to surgery or chemotherapy to 12 months later. A matched healthy control group will
      serve as a comparison.
