      Product :Placebo solution, oral IMP Product : MGCND00EP1 (each ml of solution containing 100
      mg of cannabidiol and 5 mg of (-)-trans-Δ9- tetrahydrocannabinol as active substance) from
      MGC PHARMACEUTICALS D.O.O.

      Subjects on regular therapy with anti-epileptic medications who have evidence from clinical
      monitoring that current therapy is insufficient, following failure of at least two AEDs for
      at least during the last 2 months will be enrolled into this study. Upon subjects/parents
      have consented to participation in the study and after baseline examinations, subjects will
      continue with current antiepileptic treatment, as clinically needed, for another 28 days at
      the same dose as before entering the study; drug accountability will be performed for
      verification of treatment compliance, and diary will be used to record data on epileptic
      seizures. After that, participating patients will be randomly assigned to MGCND00EP1 or
      placebo and take it as add on to previous treatment for 6 weeks as titration period and 6
      weeks at maintenance dose, and then titrated down during next two weeks. Patients will
      continue previous anti- epileptic treatment throughout all the periods of the study.

      Day one - Screening and Enrollment Visit :

      Total 103 patients: Obtain informed consent from legal guardian. Screen potential subjects by
      inclusion and exclusion criteria. Visit 1: obtain medical and medication history, vital
      signs, physical and neurological exam, blood and urine tests, ECG, EEG, concomitant
      medications, questionnaires.

      Weeks 1-4 - AED Stabilization Period :

      Visit 2: vital signs, weight, physical and neurological exam, blood and urine tests,
      concomitant medications, questionnaires, monitor AEs, PK blood collection (subset of
      patients), randomize and dispense study drugs

      Patients will be randomized and will either get placebo or MGCND00EP1 (3:1 active:placebo)

      Weeks 5-10 - Dose titration period:

      Dose escalations (2 mg/kg body weight/day increments), as required, up to 25 mg/kg/day or 800
      mg/day, the lower of the two, until stable dose is reached.

      Visit 3: vital signs, weight, physical and neurological exam, blood and urine tests,
      concomitant medications, questionnaires, collect and issue diaries, dispense study drug,
      monitor AEs

      Weeks 11-16 - Maintenance Period :

      Visit 4: vital signs,weight, physical and neurological exam, blood and urine tests,
      concomitant medications, questionnaires, PK sample collection (subset of patients), collect
      and issue diaries, dispense study drug, EEG, monitor AEs

      Weeks 17-18 - Tapering-off and Follow-up Period:

      Weekly phone call to determine taper dose at physician's discretion

      Visit 5: vital signs,weight, physical and neurological exam, blood and urine tests,
      concomitant medications, questionnaires, monitor AEs, collect diaries and unused drug

      Weeks 19-20 - Follow-up Period:

      Weekly phone calls

      Visits 6: vital signs,weight, physical and neurological exam, concomitant medications,
      monitor AEs, collect diaries .
