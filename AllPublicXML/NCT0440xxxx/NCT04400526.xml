    <textblock>
      Hidden drug abuse remains a significant concern for public health. An appropriate
      intervention is necessary to encourage hidden drug abusers to report their situations and
      seek professional help. This project aims to develop a community-based network to identify
      and refer hidden drug abusers in Hong Kong, and assess its effectiveness.

      This study will be completed within 18 months, and be divided into 3 Phases, including (1) a
      video competition for anti-drug abuse, (2) development of a community-based network through
      training 150 peers aged 13-18 as anti-drug ambassadors (ADAs) to deliver anti-drug messages
      based on the AWARD model, and (3) a mass promotional campaign organized by ADAs in the
      community. A one-group pre-test and repeated post-test design will be adopted to evaluate the
      overall effectiveness of the community-based network. We will assess the knowledge, attitudes
      and practices regarding anti-drug abuse of the ADAs. Data collection will be conducted at
      baseline, post-training, 3 months and 6 months after the training workshop.

    <description>Phase 1 aims to increase the public awareness of hazardous effects of drug abuses and existing resources available for drug abusers through a video competition. We will co-organize a video competition for anti-drug abuse with C.H.O.I.C.E. The competition will appeal to the participation of all children (aged 13-18) living in the four targeted districts.</description>

    <description>Phase 2 aims to develop a community-based network through training anti-drug ambassadors (ADAs). We target to recruit a total of 150 children aged 13 - 18 as ADAs through secondary schools and community centres in the four targeted districts by sending invitation letters. The content of the workshop will be designed by our expert panel. The content of the workshop will include (1) hazardous effects of drug abuse especially less psychotropic drugs such as Cannabis, (2) signs and symptoms of drug abuse particularly less psychotropic drugs like Cannabis, (3) alternatives to drug abuse, (4) community resources available, and (5) how to refer drug abusers. Besides, all children will be taught to use the AWARD model for referrals in the workshop.</description>

The activities can be delivered by a group (a maximum of 5 ADAs per group) or by an individual. Types of activities can include but not limited to health talks, booths, outreaching activities, games, posters, leaflets and websites. Likewise, if the ADAs encounter any drug abuser in their social circles, the ADAs will be asked to deliver a brief advice based on the AWARD model.</description>
