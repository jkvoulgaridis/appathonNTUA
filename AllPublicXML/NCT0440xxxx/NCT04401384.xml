  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nausea and vomiting in pregnancy (NVP) is one of the most common symptoms of pregnancy
      affecting 50-85% of women during the first half of pregnancy. Maternal morbidity is common
      and includes psychological effects, financial burden, clinical complications from nutritional
      deficiencies, gastrointestinal trauma, and in rare cases, neurological damage. As the main
      means of alternative treatment, economical and easy to obtain; the clinical efficacy of
      acupuncture treatment of this disease has low level of evidence and needs to be reconfirmed.
      Doxylamine vitamin B6 sustained release tablets (Diclectin, combination of doxylamine
      succinate (10mg) and pyridoxine hydrochloride (10mg) are The American College of
      Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends with Level A evidence the use of vitamin B6 in
      combination with doxylamine as first-line pharmacotherapy for treatment of NVP. The efficacy
      and safety of Diclectin has been confirmed in many years of research, but there is no
      evidence of high-level evidence-based medicine for the Chinese population. The purpose of
      this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was to investigate the
      efficacy and safety of acupuncture versus Diclectin in the treatment of NVP.

      We hypothesis that: (1)Active acupuncture plus Diclectin (Arm A) or sham acupuncture combined
      with Diclectin (Arm B) or active acupuncture plus Diclectin placebo (Arm C) is more effective
      than the sham acupuncture plus Diclectin placebo (Arm D). (2)Sham acupuncture combined with
      Diclectin (Arm B) and active acupuncture plus Diclectin placebo (Arm C) will have similar
      treatment effects. (3)Active acupuncture plus Diclectin (Arm A) is no more effective than
      sham acupuncture combined with Diclectin (Arm B) and active acupuncture plus Diclectin
      placebo (Arm C).

      Subjects will be randomized into one of the four treatment arms: A) Diclectin (combination of
      doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride, 2 tablets/day at bedtime) + active
      acupuncture(30min once every other day); B) Diclectin (2 tablets/day at bedtime) + sham
      acupuncture (30min once every other day); C) Diclectin Placebo (2 tablets/day at bedtime) +
      active acupuncture(30min once every other day); D) Diclectin Placebo (2 tablets/day at
      bedtime) + sham acupuncture (30min once every other day). Participants will receive active
      acupuncture or sham acupuncture treatment every other day (or once every day if the symptoms
      are unrelieved (PUQE≧6)) for 2 consecutive weeks, 7-14 times in total, and receive Diclectin
      or placebo treatment every day (2 tablets at bedtime for the first day, if the symptoms are
      unrelieved (PUQE≧6), add one tablet in the morning, if the symptoms are still unrelieved
      (PUQE≧6), add another one tablet at three o 'clock in the afternoon) for 2 consecutive weeks,
      28-56 tablets in total. Daily measurement PUQE score, Visual analog scale (VAS) and AEs.
      Weekly visits will include global assessment of well-being, adverse events and concomitant
      medications, and a patient diary. The visit after treatment will assess NVP quality of life
      (NVPQoL), SAS and SDS, and primary and secondary outcomes. Participants will be followed up
      by telephone 30 days after treatment.

      Primary outcomes: PUQE scores.

      Secondary outcomes:

      (1)Change in Global assessment of well-being. (2)The day-by-day area under the curve for
      change in PUQE from baseline. (3)Adverse events. (4)Study withdraw. (5)The number of women in
      each group who reported concurrent use of other alternate therapy for NVP. (6)Time loss from
      employment. (7)The amount of Diclectin in each arm where women will continued with
      compassionate use of site package medication (OTC drug) during one-month follow-up if
      symptoms persist. (8)Reliability and validity analysis of PUQE, if it is associated with
      clinical outcomes that are related directly to NVP(such as a pregnant woman's ability to take
      multivitamins, rates of emergency room visits and hospitalization for NVP, health care costs
      for NVP, and a woman's self-reported scores of well-being in NVP). (9)Change in NVPQOL.
      (10)Change in Visual analog scale
