      STUDY OBJECTIVE

      The purpose of this study is to establish the safety and effectiveness of the Edwards SAPIEN
      3 and SAPIEN 3 Ultra valves with Commander delivery system in patients with severe
      symptomatic calcific mitral valve disease with severe mitral annular calcification who are
      not candidates for standard mitral valve surgery.

      STUDY DESIGN

      A prospective multicenter study enrolling high surgical risk patients with severe mitral
      annular calcification (MAC) and symptomatic mitral valve disease. There are 2 arms in this
      study: Transseptal Valve-in-MAC (ViMAC) and a control arm of patients treated with medical
      treatment only which will include patients who can't be treated due to the presence of
      anatomical exclusion criteria or other exclusion criteria.

      Enrollment Enrollment will consist of 100 patients in the treatment arm (transseptal ViMAC)
      and up to 100 in the medically treated arm).

          4. The heart team agrees that valve implantation will likely benefit the patient.
