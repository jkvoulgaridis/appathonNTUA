  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the ControlRad system device when installed
      in Fluoroscopic (x-ray) machine reduces radiation dose to operators (Doctors and nurses) and
      to the patient who is undergoing cardiac Catheterization in the cath-lab.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Prospective, randomized (like a &quot;flip of a coin&quot;) single center study evaluating
      the ControlRad system device when installed - retrofitted on existing C-arms for fluoroscopy
      (x-ray) will reduce radiation exposure without compromising image quality in the region of
      interest and overall workflow during cardiac catheterization procedures. Enrollment will be
      limited to 60 participants scheduled for cardiac catheterization (30 diagnostic
      catheterization procedures and 30 Interventional procedures). All patients presenting to
      Beaumont Hospital Royal Oak who are scheduled for cardiac catheterization with coronary
      angiography in Cath Lab 5 where device is installed will be considered for inclusion in the
      study. Physicians and staff (20 fellows; 30 attending physicians; and 40 Cath-lab staff) will
      be invited to participate in the study. For each procedure, 3 staff members will be study
      subjects: a) the primary operator, b) the secondary operator, c) the nurse/tech who
      circulates in the room. Different operators and staff may participate in each case depending
      on cath-lab scheduling. The Primary operator is the physician who usually stands nearest to
      the C-arm. In most cases in Beaumont this is a Cardiology Fellow. The Secondary operator is
      the physician who typically stands to the right of the primary operator and in most cases is
      the attending cardiologist. The Nurse/tech typically circulates in the room and is
      responsible for monitoring the patient, administering medications and obtaining equipment for
      the procedure.

      The method used to measure radiation dose during the catheterization procedure will be the
      dosimeter badges. These badges are commercially available and are used in the cath-lab and
      will be provided free to the participants. Cardiac Catheterization will be performed
      according to standard guidelines.

      Participants will be randomized 1:1 to either cardiac catheterization without ControlRad or
      cardiac catheterization with the ControlRad system. Participants will be blinded to the
      randomization.

      Once procedure is done,participation also ended and the badges will be removed by the
      Radiation Safety Officer or research coordinator.
