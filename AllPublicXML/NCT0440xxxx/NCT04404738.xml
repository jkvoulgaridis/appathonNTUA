  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopy, now virtually completely, was replaced with robotic surgery in uro-oncological
      surgery in the world. And given the significant increase in the number of robotic surgeries
      for prostate, bladder and kidney cancer, it is now a major domain in oncological surgery.
      Microport MedBot Inc. has independently developed a domestic surgical robot in China.
      Therefore, the purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Chinese
      robot when applied to surgery in oncology.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>perioperative complication rate</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks after operation</time_frame>
    <description>The overall incidence of intraoperative and postoperative complications.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The physiological load of the surgeon during the surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>immediately after the surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The physiological load is assessed by the LED scale immediately after the surgery. LED is the local experienced discomfort scale used to assess the intraoperative physiological load of different parts of the surgeon's body. There are 10 points in the scale, and higher score means worse, with 0 means no discomfort and 10 is the worst discomfort.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The psychological load of the surgeon during the surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>immediately after the surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The psychological load is assessed by the SME scale immediately after the operation. SME scale is the subjective mental effort scale used to assess the intraoperative psychological load of the surgeon. The scale has a total of 150 points, with a scale of 10 points. The higher the score, the worse it is, with 0 means no any difficult and above 110 points means extremely difficult.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>the critical failure rate of the robotic system</measure>
    <time_frame>during the surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Critical failures that are difficult to repair in a short period of time during robot-assisted surgery and can have a serious impact on the process or the operation</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>the recoverable malfunction rate of the robotic system</measure>
    <time_frame>during the surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Recoverable malfunction meant minor errors that could be easily resolved by the technician and has no significant impact on the process or the operation</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Instrument performance</measure>
    <time_frame>immediately after the surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The researcher fills in the instrument performance evaluation form after the operation to review the performance of the instrument during the test.</description>
