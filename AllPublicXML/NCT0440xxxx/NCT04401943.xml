  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to evaluate if an online fatigue intervention program will
      decrease fatigue, pain and increase confidence managing fatigue and being able to do daily
      tasks. This study involves competing a series of questionnaires before and after the
      intervention , and attending and participating in the online videoconference fatigue program
      for 1 1/2 hour meetings each week over a 6-week period of time.

      If eligible and give consent, participants will be asked to complete 2 online questionnaires.
      The first questionnaire asks basic information such as your age, gender, educational level,
      and amount of time diagnosed with systemic sclerosis. The second questionnaire asks about
      your disease symptoms.

      You will also be asked to complete questionnaires about your fatigue, pain, mood, confidence
      in managing your disease and performing daily tasks, and knowledge and use of energy saving
      techniques.

      Once you compete the questionnaires, you will be asked to compete a survey about times and
      days you would be available to attend the online videoconference fatigue program meeting over
      a 6 week period of time.

      Once the time and dates for the fatigue program are scheduled, you will be expected to attend
      and take part (using visual and audio) in each 1 Â½ hour meeting for 6 weeks online.

      The fatigue program includes information on causes of fatigue, ways to protect joint and save
      energy, ways to manage stress, pain, good eating habits, and exercise. Outside of meetings,
      you will also be expected to do any &quot;homework&quot; assignments in between the group meetings such
      as setting goals and doing activities to reach your goals.

      At the end of the 6 weeks, you will be asked to complete the same questionnaires you did at
      the beginning of the study regarding, fatigue, pain, and ability to perform daily tasks. You
      will also be asked to complete an evaluation of the course.

      3 months later, you will be asked to take part in a 45 minute telephone interview to talk
      about your fatigue and how you are using the ideas from the program.
