  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients requiring long-term parenteral home nutrition (NPAD) suffer from chronic bowel
      failure. The causes of this syndrome can be variable either anatomical (extensive resection
      of the small intestine) or functional (occlusion, pseudo-occlusion, malabsorption). Their
      consequences mean that patients are unable to cover their oral energy and / or
      hydroelectrolytic needs. Consequently these patients survive only thanks to a nutritional
      support by venous way (parenteral nutrition).

      NPAD is a complex and risky practice framed by decrees. For nutrition over 3 months,
      treatment must be carried out in a center recognized by the Ministry (historically: approved
      center, in the future: labeled center). The active patient queue in NPAD on the national
      territory is around 1,500 patients (2017 figure).

      At home, and for safety reasons, these infusions are carried out by infusion pumps ensuring a
      constant flow rate and capable of detecting two anomalies: occlusion of the venous route and
      the presence of bubble in the infusion line [1] .

      The purpose of this study is to test the reliability and usefulness of pumps capable of
      communicating information to prescribing physicians.

      The hypothesis of this project is that the information reported by the pumps connected to the
      clinician could represent an aid to medical reasoning, and allow the latter to modify the
      proposed treatment when necessary, in patients followed for complex treatment and at risk,
      such as treatment with NPAD.

      The usability and acceptability of the proposed solution will also be assessed with the
      healthcare team and patients.

      During this study, the management of the patient will not be modified, the clinician not
      having access in real time to the data collected.
