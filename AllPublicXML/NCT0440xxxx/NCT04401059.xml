  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a nationwide, multicenter and prospective cohort study. The purpose of this study is
      to evaluate the synergistic effect and safety of Elemene plus TKIs in EGFR-mutated advanced
      non-small cell lung cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      About 9.2%-45.8% of Chinese patients with Non-small cell lung cancer were positive for EGFR
      gene mutation. Gefitinib, Erlotinib, Icotinib, Afatinib showed efficacy superior to that of
      chemotherapy in the treatment of EGFR mutation positive advanced NSCLC, and lower rates of
      serious adverse events. However, after a median of 8 to 13 months of disease control,
      patients ultimately progress due to acquired resistance of EGFR-TKIs. Elemene, a
      chemotherapeutic isolated from the Chinese medicinal herb Rhizoma Zedoariae, has been shown
      to have a comprehensive anti-tumor effect and the potential effect on reversing drug
      resistance.

      In this study, about 22 research centers will participate in. We planned to enroll 468
      patients with advanced non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma who were positive for EGFR
      mutations. The dynamic random method will be adopted in this study. Patients will be randomly
      divided into the experimental group（Elemene plus First-generation EGFR-TKIs), and control
      group (First-generation EGFR-TKIs, only). The purpose of this study is evaluating the
      synergistic effect and safety of Elemene plus TKIs in EGFR-mutated advanced non-small cell
      lung cancer. We also try to analyze the correlation between molecular biomarkers and patient
      prognosis, including but not limited to drug-resistant genes and circulating tumor cells.
