  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis can develop after an injury like a broken bone. Problems with how the bones
      line up can lead to abnormal loading which will destroy the cartilage that covers and
      protects the bones. Once this happens, patients experience substantial pain and disability.
      Researchers and doctors use planar x-rays to evaluate joints; but these are not always
      precise and are limited to two dimensions. Three-dimensional (3D) computed tomography (CT)
      can be used to look at the joints of the wrist in three dimensions, but is limited to static
      frames. Symptoms arising from joint instability often occur when the wrist is moving and when
      it is performing a functional task (opening a jar). Four dimensional computed tomography
      (4DCT) can detect dynamics changes in the small structures of the wrist with high temporal
      and spatial resolution. This novel imaging techniques provides a movie of bones in the wrist,
      in 3D, while in the scanner. In this proposal, the investigator's will use 4DCT and look at
      how joint alignment of the distal radius effects the joints in the wrist, and investigate how
      it relates to patient's function, description of pain and the presence of Osteoarthritis 10
      years following fracture. This imaging will drive safer clinical research and practice and
      will develop tools that predict the risk of developing arthritis that will help doctors
      determine when surgery is necessary to prevent arthritis of the hand and wrist, and pain and
      disability.

      A series of 60 participants (30 male: 30 female) with current distal radius fractures will be
      recruited. Clinical eligibility will include a unilateral DRF treated with closed reduction
      and casting. These measures will be assessed at baseline (&lt;6 weeks following injury), 3- 6
      months and 12 months following fracture. A second series of 80 participants (40 male: 40
      female) who suffered a DRF ≥10 years previously will be recruited and tested. Exclusion
      criteria for these two cohorts will include presence of neurological disorders, rheumatoid
      arthritis or co-morbid health conditions that preclude completion of study measures. Twenty
      additional healthy participants will be recruited.
