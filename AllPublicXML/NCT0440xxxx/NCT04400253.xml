  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      South Asian immigrant women and girls are at increased risk for insufficient physical
      activity and are not being reached by current approaches to physical activity promotion. This
      randomized control trial study will test the effectiveness and implementation of a multi
      component physical activity intervention directed at the environment, family, interpersonal
      and individual levels to promote physical activity among South Asian immigrant mothers and
      daughters.

    <time_frame>The outcome will be assessed before the intervention (week 0) and after the intervention (week 18)</time_frame>
    <description>The self-efficacy score will be calculated by averaging the responses (scored 1 to 5 point for the responses of strongly disagree to strongly agree) from each question item</description>

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  having known medical condition that restricts ability to participate in moderate
             intensity PA
