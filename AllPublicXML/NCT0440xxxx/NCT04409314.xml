    <textblock>
      This study evaluates whether tumors present in patients with cancer who are planned to get
      CAR T-cells have low amounts of oxygen (hypoxia). PET scans may be used to check the amounts
      of oxygen within areas of cancer with a special radioactive tracer called FAZA that
      specifically looks for areas of low oxygen. This study is being done to help researchers
      determine how the amount of oxygen within areas of cancer affect how well CAR T-cells kill
      cancer cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the incidence of intratumoral hypoxia in patients with relapsed or refractory
      (R/R) malignancies before treatment with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the association between intratumoral hypoxia and clinical responses to CAR
      T-cell therapy.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To correlate intratumoral hypoxia with markers of CAR T-cell activity and toxicity.

      2. To correlate pre-therapy fluorine F 18-fluoroazomycin arabinoside (18F-FAZA) uptake with
      pre-therapy 18Ffluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) uptake.

      OUTLINE:

      Prior to CAR T-cell therapy, patients receive 18F-FAZA intravenously (IV). Beginning 2 hours
      after injection, patients undergo PET scan over 30-45 minutes.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up for up to 6 months after CAR T-cell
      therapy.
