  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a prospective double blind study conducted on 200 polytrauma patients admitted to
      King Abdul-Aziz Specialized Hospital, Taif, KSA between July 2018 and December 2019 in
      surgical ICU. All patients were having severe chest trauma, contused lungs either with or
      without severe head trauma.

      Patients of Group A received meropenem one gram slowly IV infusion every 8 hours for 14 days
      and gentamicin 7 milligram (mg)/ Kilogram body weight per day slowly IV infusion once daily
      only for one week, while patients of Group B received ceftazidime 2 grams and avibactam 500
      mg every 8 hours for 14 days in solution for injection(sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%), sodium
      chloride 4.5 mg/mL, dextrose 25 mg/mL, 0.45% sodium chloride, 2.5% dextrose and/or Lactated
      Ringer's solution). The solution for injection should be administered over 120 minutes. •
      Temperature was measured every 3 hours for 2 weeks. • ABG was done every 8 hours for 2 weeks.
      • CBC including white cell count was done daily and for 2 weeks. • Complete renal functions
      daily (urea and creatinine serum level) for 2 weeks. Any patient showing rise in the
      creatinine level was recorded and excluded from the study. • Chest X-ray for all the patients
      was ordered after intubation and with onset of ventilation and every 24 hours for 2 weeks. •
      All patients received anti-stress (Omeprazole 20 mg IV every 12 hours). • Oro-gastric tubes
      were inserted to all patients and feeding was started within 24 hours.Daily evaluation for
      conscious level and need for sedation and ventilation were done for all patients. •
      Tracheobronchial lavage was obtained by bronchoscopy 2 times a week and sent for qualitative
      culture for 2 weeks. • Blood culture was also taken 2 times per week for 2 weeks. • The
      planned duration of the study is two weeks from diagnosis of VAP and starting the antibiotics
      so any patients who failed to be weaned within this period were considered morbidity and
      recorded.
