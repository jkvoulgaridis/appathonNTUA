  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Growing evidence suggests that Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathological changes begin decades
      before clinical symptoms and tau abnormalities in the locus coeruleus (LC) can be observed
      since midlife. In previous research it has been demonstrated functional vulnerability of the
      LC to aging and stress, as well as an association between higher CSF tau and impaired sleep
      phenomena influenced by the LC. The study objective is to test whether LC dysfunction can be
      measured in preclinical AD stages by LC targeted imaging, and whether it objectively affects
      sleep architecture and attention; by asking 30 cognitively normal older adults to perform a
      full clinical evaluation, one night of polysomnography, a lumbar puncture (LP) to obtain
      cerebrospinal fluid, MRB PET-MR, as well as attention testing.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is three-fold: to test whether lower NET availability in the LC is
      associated with: first, CSF tau levels typical of preclinical stages of AD (Aim 1); second,
      reduced REM and spindle density (Aim 2); and third, impaired performance on attention tasks
      (Aim 3). The goal is to test the overarching hypothesis that LC dysfunction occurs in
      preclinical AD stages, can be measured with MRB-PET, and translates into impairment of sleep
      architecture (LC tonic dysfunction) and attention (LC phasic dysfunction).

    <description>Early abnormal tau phosphorylation in locus coeruleus (LC) neurons may potentially lead to dysfunction of the LC. Studies characterizing the relationship between measures of LC function and Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers are lacking. The levels of LC neuronal integrity by simultaneous PET-MR imaging using the norepinephrine transporter (NET)-selective radiotracer MRB will be assessed in 30 Cognitively Normal older adults.</description>

    <time_frame>Visit 3 (1-4 weeks after Visit 2)</time_frame>
    <description>Decreases in REM and spindle activity have been associated with cognitive impairment and risk for AD. LCs' dysfunction may have a contributive role of in AD progression, through its interference with normal sleep physiology. REM sleep and sleep spindles characteristics derived from in-lab will be measured in relation to LC dysfunction, sleep disturbances and AD progression.</description>

    <measure>Change in levels of norepinephrine transporter (NET) associated with decreased performance in attention test</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 3 (1-4 weeks after Visit 2)</time_frame>
    <description>The psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) and the OddBall test, require the ability to keep task-focused attention, a process influenced by LC phasic activity. Decreased performance on attention tests may be a bystander of LC early dysfunction. Thus, we propose that decreased NET availability is associated with lower measures of task-attention performance (LC phasic dysfunction). This finding will support a link between impaired LC function and performance in attention tests.</description>

    <description>Participants will undergo a fluoroscopy-guided lumbar puncture (LP) to obtain cerebrospinal fluid, the morning after the NPSG. The exposure risk of radiation exposure due to fluoroscopy is significantly outweighed by its benefits. Fluoroscopy uses X-rays for an exposure duration of approximately 5 seconds and it is a common radiological procedure. The estimate of the effective dose from the fluoroscopy study is about 1 mSv. At this radiation dose level there are no known risks, although there is always a slight risk of damage to cells or tissue from being exposed to any radiation, including the low levels of X-rays used for fluoroscopy-guided LP. These risk estimates are referenced by the FDA in association with the European Commission (Radiation Protection Report).</description>
