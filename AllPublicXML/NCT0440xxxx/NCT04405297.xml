    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-location safety and effectiveness study, and data registry of
      autologous adult ADRCs generated by the Transpose® RT System in subjects with OA in the
      shoulder, wrist, knee, hip, or ankle.

    <textblock>
      Subjects who have signed informed consent and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
      Act (HIPPA) authorization, and are determined to meet all inclusion criteria and no exclusion
      criteria will be enrolled in this study and receive the ADRC treatment.

      The subject will have an injection procedure (ADRC treatment) For this study, a licensed
      physician trained in liposuction must perform the syringe liposuction procedure. The licensed
      physician who performs the lipoplasty may be the Investigator or a non-Investigator physician
      (e.g., a plastic surgeon) who is trained on the study protocol.

      All subjects will undergo a minor syringe liposuction procedure to acquire approximately 100
      mL of lipoaspirate for preparation of ADRC using the Transpose® RT System. The removed tissue
      is processed to extract a cell suspension (the cell product). Once the cell product has been
      obtained, tested, and found to conform to release criteria, the subject will be treated with
      the ADRCs.

    <measure>Efficacy outcomes include changes in patient reported outcomes (PRO) measurements for the knee using PROMIS 10 Global health</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS® is a set of participant-centered measures that evaluates and monitors the physical, mental, and social health in adults. Although unknown in osteoarthritis, the PROMIS® 10 Global Heath Survey was developed by the National Institute of Health and validated across a variety of chronic conditions. Each efficacy measure will be analyzed separately while accounting for potential confounding factors in the model such as age, sex, BMI, severity of OA diagnosis, smoking status, and past treatments in targeted joint. The Bonferroni adjustment for multiple testing correction will be used within each cohort. The PROMIS Global-10 is a 10-item patient-reported questionnaire utilizing as 5-point Global Physical Health Score scale ranging from 5=&quot;Excellent/Completely&quot; to 1=&quot;Poor/Not at all&quot; and a 5-point Global Mental Health scale ranging from 5=&quot;Never/None&quot; to 1=&quot;Always/Very Severe&quot;, as well as a single 11-point question scale from 0=&quot;No Pain&quot; to 10=&quot;Worst Pain Imaginable&quot;.</description>

    <description>The SF-12v2 is a generic health outcome measurement widely used in chronic illness and chronic pain conditions. The SF-12v2 is a shorter tool that requires less patient and provider effort. Validity and feasibility have been reviewed with demonstration for significance in non-cancer pain patients.Each efficacy measure will be analyzed separately while accounting for potential confounding factors in the model such as age, sex, BMI, severity of OA diagnosis, smoking status, and past treatments in targeted joint. The Bonferroni adjustment for multiple testing correction will be used within each cohort. SF-12v2 patient-reported questionnaire is utilizes a 5-point scale ranging from &quot;Excellent&quot;/&quot;All of the time&quot; to &quot;None of the time&quot;/&quot;Poor&quot; for both physical and mental questions as well as a 3-point score ranging from &quot;Yes, limited a lot&quot; to &quot;No, not limited at all&quot; for two physical questions.</description>

        The focus of this study is to investigate the therapeutic benefit of autologous ADRCs in
        patients with OA in various joints. The ENDURE study allows subjects at Sanford Health and
        in the United States access to adipose-derived regenerative cells while reviewing safety
        for subjects with knee, shoulder, hip, ankle and wrist OA, using a more pragmatic and
        standard clinical approach.
