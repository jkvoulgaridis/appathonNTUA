  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 first in human, open label, multi-center, dose escalation study to evaluate
      the safety, tolerability, PK, anti-tumor activity and pharmacodynamic effects of SL-172154 in
      subjects with ovarian cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 1 trial will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, anti-tumor and
      pharmacodynamic effects of SL-172154 and identify the dose and schedule i.e., recommended
      Phase 2 dose for future development (RP2D). Subjects eligible for enrollment are required to
      have platinum-ineligible ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers. The study
      design consists of dose escalation cohorts, an optional pharmacodynamic cohort, and an
      optional dose expansion cohort. In the dose escalation phase of the study, subjects will be
      enrolled into sequential dose levels. The study may also enroll a pharmacodynamic cohort to
      obtain additional pharmacodynamic data at one or more dose levels that have completed
      evaluation for safety without exceeding the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Subjects enrolled
      in the pharmacodynamic cohort will not inform dose escalation decisions. A dose expansion
      cohort may be opened to further characterize safety, tolerability, PK, anti-tumor activity,
      and pharmacodynamic data to inform the selection of a RP2D.

             therapy given alone or with bevacizumab.

          4. Subjects should not be primary platinum refractory as defined by progressing during or
             within 1 month of upfront platinum therapy.

          5. Has measurable disease by RECIST v1.1 using radiologic assessment.

          6. Subject age is 18 years and older.

          7. Has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0 or 1.

          9. Has adequate organ function.

         10. Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy

             chemotherapy or any other anti-cancer therapy to baseline or ≤ Grade 1.

         12. Willing to consent to mandatory pre-treatment and on-treatment tumor biopsy(ies),
             unless there is excessive risk as determined by the investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Participants are excluded from the study if any of the following criteria apply:

          1. Prior treatment with an anti-CD47 or anti-SIRPα targeting agent or a CD40 agonist.

          2. Any anti-cancer therapy within the washout period prior to first dose (D1) of
             SL-172154.

          3. Concurrent chemotherapy, immunotherapy, biologic or hormonal/hormonal suppression
             therapy for cancer treatment is prohibited. Concurrent use of hormones for non-cancer
             related conditions is acceptable.

          4. Use of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medication, current or within 14
             days of D1 of SL-172154 treatment.
