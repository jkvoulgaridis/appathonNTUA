  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of instructional technical surgical videos is common in orthopaedic education. Many
      residents have used instructional technical surgical training videos prior to medical school,
      as well as during their residency program, and at instructional courses. The use of
      instructional technical surgical videos and multimedia is considered an adjunctive training
      method for orthopaedic residents to learn operative procedures.

      Immersive virtual reality (iVR) is increasingly used in surgical education. Recently, iVR has
      shown transfer of skill training in orthopaedics. The continued study of the effectiveness of
      iVR training in orthopaedic education could benefit new competency based orthopaedics
      residency programs.

      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of instructional technical surgical
      video training to immersive iVR training for teaching technical skills of reverse total
      shoulder arthroplasty. Our hypothesis was that iVR improved learning effectiveness compared
      to standard technical surgical video. Secondary objectives include validating a virtual
      reality ratings scale through correlation to real-world performance.

      We proposed a randomized, blinded intervention-control trial directly comparing immersive iVR
      versus technical surgical instructional video training in the teaching of reverse shoulder
      arthroplasty in senior residents, learning at the 2020 annual Canadian Shoulder and Elbow
      Society meeting.

      The use of instructional technical surgical videos is common in orthopaedic education. Many
      residents have used instructional technical surgical training videos prior to medical school,
      as well as during their residency program, and at instructional courses. The use of

      method for orthopaedic residents to learn operative procedures.

      Immersive virtual reality (iVR) is increasingly used in surgical education. Recently, iVR has
      shown transfer of skill training in orthopaedics. The continued study of the effectiveness of
      iVR training in orthopaedic education could benefit new competency based orthopaedics
      residency programs.

      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of instructional technical surgical
      video training to immersive iVR training for teaching technical skills of reverse total
      shoulder arthroplasty. Our hypothesis was that iVR improved learning effectiveness compared
      to standard technical surgical video. Secondary objectives include validating a virtual
      reality ratings scale through correlation to real-world performance, and to determine
      efficiency of learning in both groups.

      Currently, technical surgical instructional videos are pervasive in orthopaedic teaching
      education. Immersive VR, another form of teaching, is increasingly being used in surgical
      education. The production of an immersive VR suite with tactile and user metric feedback may
      be an advance over current bench top simulator technology, allowing for greater immersion and
      interaction, leading to better understanding of surgical planning and implementation. The
      development of this technology could provide trainees with immersive levels of training not
      previously seen, with improved learning of technical skills over media such as manufacturer
      technical documents. The effectiveness of training and efficiency of training of the novel
      immersive VR training systems need to be evaluated as they are increasingly incorporated into
      competency based, contemporary residency education.

      We proposed a randomized, blinded intervention-control trial directly comparing immersive iVR
      versus technical surgical instructional video training in the teaching of reverse shoulder
      arthroplasty in senior (fourth and fifth year) residents, learning at the 2020 annual
      Canadian Shoulder and Elbow Society meeting.

    <description>The Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS) outcome measure is a validated assessment tool used for grading overall technical ability during surgery. This checklist contains 27 items, in which an assessor will mark off whether the task was completed successfully or not. For each item done correctly, it is worth 1 point. All points are totalled for a maximum possible score of 27 points. A higher score indicates a better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Global Ratings Scale (GRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>During surgery up until immediately after surgery.</time_frame>
    <description>The Global Ratings Scale (GRS) is a validated assessment tool used for grading operative performance. The GRS contains 7 categories: respect for tissue, time and motion, instrument handling, knowledge of instruments, flow of operation, use of assistants, and knowledge of specific procedure. Each category is graded using a 5-point Likert type scale, a higher number indicates a better outcome. Each categorical score is totalled for a maximum score of 35 points. A higher score indicates a better outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Transfer of Training (ToT)</measure>
    <time_frame>immediately after surgery.</time_frame>
    <description>Transfer of Training (ToT) outcome informs how much skill is gained in the iVR group compared to the control performance. This is measured using an equation. ToT equals the average time to complete surgical procedure (for those in instructional video group) minus the average time to complete the surgical procedure (for those in the iVR training group), divided by the average time to complete surgical procedure (for those in instructional video group). This score is then multiplied by 100% to obtain a percentage value. A higher percentage indicates a better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Transfer Effectiveness Ratio (TER)</measure>
    <time_frame>immediately before surgery up immediately after surgery.</time_frame>
    <description>Transfer Effectiveness Ratio (TER) outcomes informs on the skill comparison relative to the control, on real world training reduction times. TER equals the average time to complete surgical procedure (for those in instructional video group) minus the average time to complete the surgical procedure (for those in the iVR training group), divided by the average time to complete the iVR training. A higher score indicates a better outcome.</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to the iVR simulator utilizes a head-mounted display producing 3D visuals with haptic controllers for an immersive operating room experience. The module produced consists of the key steps in performing a reverse shoulder arthroplasty using virtual versions of the equipment used in the real procedure. Prior to initiation, participants will be provided with a safety and training demonstration on the use of the VR module by study personnel. Participants will be provided as much time as they require to watch the video, including repetition if desired, which they will be timed for completion.</description>
