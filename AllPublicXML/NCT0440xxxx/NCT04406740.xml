  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to formally evaluate the performance of the QTOF, as compared with the
      newest commercially available NMB monitoring equipment, EMG (the TwitchView).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The disposable stimulus/recording electrode array for the TwitchView will be placed on one of
      the patient's wrist/hand and connected to the device. Next, the stimulating electrodes and
      vibration sensor of the QTOF device will be placed over the contralateral ulnar nerve and
      thenar eminence. The devices will be placed prior to the induction of anesthesia - but no
      electrical stimuli will be delivered until AFTER the patient is asleep (as per routine).
      After induction, both devices will be started. The TwitchView automatically selects the
      appropriate stimulus current (takes about 10 seconds) - and when that is complete, the QTOF
      stimulus current will be set to the same value. The stimulus interval for both devices will
      be 20 seconds. Paired measurements of twitch count and TOF ratios will be gathered for the
      entirety of the surgical procedure, and cross checked with Epic regarding the administration
      of neuromuscular blocking drugs (time, dose) and reversal agents (time, dose). RAs will be
      present to verify the correct function of both devices. Note that information from the
      TwitchView monitor will be continuous available to the providers (it is a standard device
      available for use in our ORs). Information from the QTOF will NOT be made available to
      providers.

    <description>The QTOF consists of an electrical stimulator that is just like the stimulator in the traditional TOF devices that are commonly used (both accelerometric and EMG-based), combined with a novel sensor that sticks to the belly of the muscle being measured (most commonly the adductor pollicis, the thumb muscle in the palm of the hand).</description>
