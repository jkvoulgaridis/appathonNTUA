  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, parallel, blinded, clinical trial of treatments. The general
      objective of this study is to analyze and compare the short-term results, during a 4-week
      follow-up, of two different treatments in patients with chronic nonspecific neck pain.

      The treatments to be applied are Global Postural Reeducation (GPR) and specific therapeutic
      exercise, applied during 8 treatment sessions in 4 weeks. These treatments will be applied by
      a physiotherapist with clinical experience in the treatment of cervical pain.

      During the study, 4 evaluations will be carried out to assess the effects of the
      interventions on pain, disability, standing postural control and neuromuscular behavior of
      the cervical muscles ((1) Baseline (pre-intervention); 2) Second pre-intervention (1 week
      later); 3) 1st post-intervention after four sessions (1+2 weeks later); 4) Final, 2nd
      post-intervention (1+4 weeks later))

    <description>The Neck Disability Index (NDI) will be used. It is a modification of the Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Index. It is a scale used to measure disability associated with cervical pain due to acute or chronic conditions.

    <description>Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) will be used. People are asked to indicate the degree to which they have the above thoughts and feelings when they are experiencing pain using the 0 (not at all) to 4 (all the time) scale. A total score is yielded (ranging from 0-52).</description>

    <description>The Tampa Scale for kinesiophobia (TSK-13) will be used. It is a patient-reported outcome measure designed to help identify kinesiophobia. This version is a 13-item questionnaire aimed at the assessment of fear of movement/re-injury. Each item is provided with a 4-points Likert scale with scoring alternatives ranging from &quot;strongly disagree&quot; [0] to &quot;strongly agree&quot; [4] . This gives a possible total raw score range from 0 to 52.</description>

    <description>Global Postural Reeducation with 2 parts in each session:
st: 2 postures in lying position - without gravity load (15 minutes each posture): The aim of these postures is to achieve and maintain postural balance and to stretch the posterior muscle chain. In order to achieve this, specific exercises in the lying position are used. That exercises involve a precise use of contractions, stretch reflexes, light and controlled manual tractions and sustained elongations.
The maintenance of alignment during posture will be achieved by verbal commands and manual contact of the therapist, guaranteeing the active engagement of patient to reach the correct posture.
st: Standing posture - integration under gravity load (10 minutes): With the participant standing the physiotherapist makes final corrections for postural integration.</description>
