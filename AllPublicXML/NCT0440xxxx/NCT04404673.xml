  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Advances in the treatment of rectal cancer over the past two decades have improved survival
      and significantly reduced surgery-related morbidity. As a result, post-treatment quality of
      life (QoL) issues have become increasingly important. Urinary and sexual functions can be
      significantly altered after rectal resection, mainly due to the iatrogenic lesions of the
      pelvic autonomous lexus. Of note, their incidence is reported up to 70% and 30%,
      respectively. Despite the importance of this topic, most of the studies present in the
      literature are difficult to interpret for a variety of reasons. Firstly, both sexual and
      urinary dysfunctions lack a standardized definition. Secondly, the absence of baseline data,
      missing data, small sample sizes, and heterogeneity in the use of validated and nonvalidated
      instruments are the main limitation in drawing conclusive results. As additional factor, no
      clear evidence is present in the literature regarding the best approach to be used in order
      to preserve as much as possible both the sexual and urinary functionalities and to guarantee,
      at the same time, an adequate and oncologically correct rectal resection. Moreover, no data
      are currently present regarding the impact of pre-operative chemo-radiotherapy on the urinary
      and sexual functionalities. The main objective of the investigator's prospective study will
      be to define in a subjective manner which technique (open, laparoscopic, robot-assisted and
      Ta-TME) will guarantee the best urinary and sexual outcomes after rectal resection (with or
      without pre-operative chemo-radiotherapy) for the treatment of rectal carcinomas.

      Thus, the primary endpoint will the post-operative evaluation at 1, 6 months and 1 year of
      the urinary and sexual functions by means of specific questionnaires.

      Secondary endpoints will be:

        -  to investigate which technique (open, robotic, laparoscopic and trans-anal total
           mesorectal excision (TaTME)) more favorably correlate with urinary and sexual functions
           after radiochemotherapy (NAD+);

        -  the comparison of both the urinary and sexual dysfunction incidence on the base of the
           distance of the rectal tumor from the anal verge and the evaluation of the best approach
           to be used (open, laparoscopic, TaTME or robot-assisted) in relation to the tumor
           height;

        -  the short- (postoperative morbidity and histopathological data) and long-term (overall
           and disease-free survival) outcomes comparison among the open, laparoscopic, TaTME and
           robotic rectal resection.
