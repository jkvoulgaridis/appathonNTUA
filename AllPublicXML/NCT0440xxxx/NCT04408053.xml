  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In France, the annual incidence of hip fracture is about 80 000 with more than 75% of these
      fractures occurring in patients aged 80 years old or more. About 10% percent of patients
      presenting with a hip fracture will sustain a contralateral hip fracture, most within 3
      years. The consequences of a hip fracture are dramatic: 20% of patients die in the first year
      and less than half those who survive regain their previous level of function. Hip fractures
      are invariably associated with chronic pain, reduced mobility, disability, and an increasing
      degree of dependence. The efficacy of pharmacological treatments to prevent a contralateral
      hip fracture is marginal and postponed and compliance is known to be poor.

      Osteoporosis is associated with cortical thinning and trabecular bone loss. Therefore, the
      mini-invasive preventive fixation (MIPF) of the contralateral femoral neck is appealing. The
      effect is immediate and compliance is certain. Morbidity is minimal because it is performed
      during the same operation as the fixation of the femoral neck fracture.

      The main objective of this study is to determine whether the mini-invasive preventive
      fixation (MIPF) of the contralateral femoral neck in patients having a femoral neck fracture
      is superior to no fixation regarding the occurrence of a contralateral hip fracture within 3
      years.

    <description>Patient's autonomy will be assessed using the AGGIR scale. The AGGIR scale has 10 physical and mental variables and seven variables relating to domestic and social activities; the former are discriminative and the latter illustrative variables. The rating depends on the person doing the activity on her/his own; however, material and technical aids are allowed (glasses, wheelchair, etc). Each variable can take one of three modalities: A (perform alone), C (cannot perform alone), and B (can perform alone but on conditions).</description>
