  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to examine whether teaching people at risk for type 2 diabetes to use
      self-compassion (orientation to care for oneself during difficult situations) helps them
      self-manage and increase their physical activity. People at risk for type 2 diabetes will
      learn about their type 2 diabetes risk and strategies to increase their physical activity,
      which represents the recommended information that people at risk for type two diabetes should
      receive. In addition to this, some participants, but not all, will be taught to be
      self-compassionate in relation to their type two diabetes risk and their efforts to increase
      their physical activity. The investigators expect that people who receive the additional
      training about how to be self-compassionate will engage in more physical activity than people
      who do not and they will do so because of self-compassion's positive effect on aspects of
      self-management - adaptive reactions and a tendency to use strong self-management skills.
      This study is important for health promotion because it allows the investigators to determine
      whether they can improve how they currently help people prevent type 2 diabetes through
      engaging in physical activity.

      The primary research objective of this pilot and feasibility study is to determine if a
      self-compassion intervention can lead to a clinically significant increase in engagement in
      physical activity as compared to usual care (best behaviour change practice) in individuals
      with prediabetes.

      Primary research question: Will a self-compassion intervention that augments usual care lead
      to greater increases in physical activity over 12 weeks post-intervention follow-up than
      usual care alone among people with prediabetes? Primary hypothesis: Self-compassion will lead
      to greater increases in physical activity than usual care at intervention-end and at 6- and
      12-weeks.

      Secondary research question: Will the effects of a self-compassion intervention on physical
      activity at 6- and 12-weeks post intervention be mediated by (i) negative affect (ii)
      physical activity self-regulatory skills and (iii) personal growth at baseline and
      intervention-end? Secondary hypothesis: The effects of self-compassion on physical activity
      behaviour at 6- and 12-weeks will be mediated by i) affect and ii) self-regulatory skill use
      assessed at baseline and intervention-end.

      Tertiary research question: Will a self-compassion intervention that augments usual care lead
      to greater increases in other health-promoting behaviours (e.g., nutrition, stress
      management, seeking medical attention)? Tertiary hypothesis: Self-compassion will lead to
      greater increases in health-promoting behaviours than usual care at intervention end, 6-weeks
      and 12-weeks post intervention.

      The secondary research objective is to assess feasibility (e.g., recruitment and retention
      rates, receptivity, gender make-up, intervention effect size) for a larger, multi-site
      efficacy trial of self-compassion for physical activity change in people with prediabetes.

      This pilot and feasibility study is a single centre, randomized, active controlled, six week
      intervention with baseline and follow-up assessment at intervention-end, 6- and 12-weeks
      post-intervention. It follows a quantitative-dominant, mixed-methods design. The
      investigators will compare the change in physical activity of community-dwelling people with
      prediabetes randomized to usual care in the form of behaviour change + attention (control
      condition) to that of participants who receive usual care + self-compassion training
      (intervention condition). The investigators will also examine potential mediators of the
      intervention (i.e., negative affect, physical activity self-regulatory skill use).

      They will supplement this trial with interviews after follow-up testing with a subsample of
      self-compassion intervention participants. These interviews will provide feasibility
      information from participants (e.g., receptivity) as well as provide a qualitative assessment
      of the investigators' outcome measures.
