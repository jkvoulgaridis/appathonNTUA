  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators want to determine if delivering formal preoperative education to patients
      helps the patients with post operative pain, function and overall satisfaction. Education
      would cover surgery, post operative activities of daily living, pain and edema management,
      duration of recovery and any expected therapy they might need. All participants will receive
      a pre and post operative questionnaire to determine level of understanding of anticipated
      needs and barriers due to surgery. Group one will receive formal education from an
      occupational therapist or physical therapist while Group two will receive only standard
      education in the MD clinic.

    <description>Bell curve scale for scoring: A score of 50 is the average amount of physical function and/or upper extremity function in the general population. A score below 40 would be poorer function, whereas, a score above 60 would be better function than the general population.</description>

    <description>Bell shape curve scoring: A score of 50 is the average amount for depression in the general public. A score above 60 corresponds to a score of 10 on the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9 scale, which is the cutoff with the highest sensitivity and specificity to detect a diagnosis of moderately severe major depression.</description>
