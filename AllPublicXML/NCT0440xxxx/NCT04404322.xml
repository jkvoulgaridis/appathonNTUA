      To address the critical need in crisis intervention for children and adolescents at suicidal
      risk the investigators developed an ultra-brief acute crisis intervention, based on
      Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT). The current adaptation of IPT-A is comprised of five
      weekly sessions, followed by monthly follow-up caring email contacts to the patients and
      their parents, over a period of three months.

    <textblock>
      In recent years, suicidal behaviors have shown substantial increase worldwide. This trend is
      also prominent in Israel and has led to a dramatic increase in mental health treatment demand
      resulting in long wait times and low treatment acceptance rate. To address the critical need
      in crisis intervention for children and adolescents at suicidal risk, the investigators
      developed an ultra-brief acute crisis intervention, based on Interpersonal Psychotherapy
      (IPT). IPT is an evidence-based intervention for various psychopathologies among different
      age groups. The current adaptation of IPT-A is comprised of five weekly sessions, followed by
      monthly follow-up caring email contacts to the patients and their parents, over a period of
      three months.

    <intervention_model_description>Patients are referred to SCMC depression and suicide clinic through the ER, outpatient providers or are self-referred. They undergo an initial evaluation and risk assessment. Following initial evaluation, each subject is assigned to one of three study groups, based on clinical considerations. In this stratified randomization system, the most serious acute cases are generally referred to our ultra-short crisis intervention (IPT- A SCI) and the rest are randomized to either one of the three groups: IPT- A SCI, Treatment as usual (TAU) and waiting list (WL). All participants and their parents complete the questionnaires via a secure electronic interface, with the aid of a trained research assistant. Treatment drop-out rates, thus far, seem low and stand at about 11% for the IPT-A SCI and at about 16% for patients who receive TAU.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The intervention is comprised of five weekly sessions followed by monthly emails to the patients and their parents over a period of three months. The first session is aimed at introducing the intervention, assessing depression and suicidal risk and building a safety plan. The safety plan consists of a prioritized list of coping strategies that the patient can use when suicidal risk is increased. The second session is focused on reviewing the patient's interpersonal relationships (using the closeness circle and interpersonal inventory) and conceptualizing the interpersonal problem area. Sessions 3-4 focus on developing and practicing interpersonal, emotional and behavioral coping strategies relevant for suicidal risk. Lastly, in session 5, patient and therapist go over the process and main issues which were worked on, emphasizing relapse prevention by going back to the safety plan. First and fifth sessions always involve the parents.</description>
