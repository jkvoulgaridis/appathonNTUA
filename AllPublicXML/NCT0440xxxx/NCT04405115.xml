  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The researchers want to find out if older adults receiving a survivorship care plan followed
      by a geriatric assessment visit improves quality of life and satisfaction with care compared
      to receiving only a survivorship care plan for older adults who have completed chemotherapy
      for cancer treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a pilot randomized trial to examine whether a geriatric assessment-enhanced
      survivorship care plan improves satisfaction, knowledge and health-related quality of life
      compared to standard survivorship care plans among older adults who have completed curative
      chemotherapy for cancer. The investigator's hypothesis is that older adults who receive a
      geriatric assessment-enhanced survivorship care plan will report improved satisfaction with
      care, health-related quality of life, and knowledge and preparedness for survivorship care
      needs.

    <measure>Health related quality of life assessment by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire EORTC QLQ-30</measure>
    <time_frame>4-6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The QLQ-C30 questionnaire is a specific questionnaire for cancer, it is composed of 30 questions or items that assess the quality of life in relation to physical, emotional, social aspects and in general the level of functionality of patients diagnosed with cancer. The QLQ-C30 questionnaire is assigned values between 1 and 4 (1: not at all, 2: a little, 3: a lot, 4: a lot) according to the patient's responses to the item, only in items 29 and 30 are assessed with score from 1 to 7 (1: bad, 7: excellent). The scores obtained are standardized and a score between 0 and 100 is obtained, 0 being the worst possible and 100 the best.</description>
