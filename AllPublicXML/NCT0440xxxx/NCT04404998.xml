  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to gain a better understanding of how energy density and
      cognitive framing of satiation using food information can influence consumption at a meal.
      This study also aims to investigate the influence of energy density and food information on
      sensory specific satiety (the decline in the subjective pleasantness of a food as it is
      eaten).
