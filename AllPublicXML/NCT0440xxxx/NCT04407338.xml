  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Degenerative Lumbar Spinal Stenosis (LSS) is an extremely common condition affecting more
      than 102 million people each year. It is a narrowing of the spinal canal in the lower back.
      It causes pain and even disorders of the lower limbs. When the symptoms get worse and the
      individual feels functional discomfort despite medical treatment, surgical intervention is
      recommended. Two surgical options are available: Rigid Stabilization Devices as conventional
      fusion with or without cage, or dynamic stabilization system as B-DYN device, this system is
      called &quot;dynamic&quot; because it allows the stabilization of the operated part while preserving a
      certain mobility.

      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and tolerance of B-Dyn versus
      conventional bolted fusion (with or without cage) in the treatment of degenerative lumbar
      stenosis (DLS) on the degree of postoperative functional incapacity. So the investigator's
      hypothesis is that the use of the B-DYN device in the treatment of DLS could lead to the
      maintenance of functional disability related to low back pain (maintenance of walking and
      mobility).

      Another important point to be demonstrated in this study is the preservation of the mobility
      of the stage overlying the assembly performed by B-Dyn. Indeed, the continued degeneration of
      segments adjacent to lumbar vertebral fusions is a concern for surgeons For B-Dyn, which is a
      dynamic stabilization, the combination of rigid and flexible parts allows the mobility of the
      overlying stage to be preserved and could also lead to a decrease in adjacent syndrome in the
      long-term compared to the use of conventional fusion.

      The duration of patient follow-up is 60 months. The inclusion period is 24 months to recruit
      the necessary number of subjects for the study (a total of 216 patients is expected).

    <masking_description>The patient will be blinded from the randomizing arm. As the procedure is performed under general anaesthesia, the patient will not be informed whether or not the B-Dyn® device has been implanted as a result of the procedure. The primary endpoint (the ODI being a reported outcome patient) will therefore be assessed blind to the randomizing arm. Other secondary endpoints such as quality of life or pain intensity will also be assessed blindly from the randomizing arm (patient assessment). Blinding of the surgeon is not possible. The device cannot be blinded from the surgeon's view.</masking_description>

    <measure>Evaluation of change from baseline degree of functional disability, related to low back pain, by using the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) at 12th month post-surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Oswestry questionnaire helps assess the symptoms and severity of back pain, as well as the impairment on daily life activities. The questionnaire contains 10 questions, concerning: pain, personal care, loads, walking ability, sitting position, standing position, sleep, sexual life, social life, travels. Each question offers 6 answers, with a score of 0 to 6 that the patient must choose; score 0 corresponds to a normal function, and score 6 to a very diminished function. The score obtained is multiplied by 2 to get a percentage of disability, with 0% for the absence of disability, and 100% for the most important disability. Completion of the test takes about 5 minutes</description>

    <measure>Measuring the mobility of the instrumented level and adjacent levels at inclusion, 2 months, 12 months and 60 months post intervention using dynamic X-rays of the lumbar spine:</measure>
    <time_frame>Inclusion, at 2 months, at 12 months and at 60 months</time_frame>
    <description>Dynamic X-ray is a radiograph to measure the mobility of instrumented level and adjacent one. During this radiograph, the patient will be asked to bend down until he/she reaches the painful threshold in flexion and extension, and in lateral inclination. This image should focus on the instrumented level. The degree of mobility is calculated by subtracting the angle that is formed in flexure by the tangent of the upper layer of the upper vertebra, and the tangent of the lower layer to the angle formed by these extending tangents.</description>

    <description>The surgical technique for placement of the B-Dyn device is performed under general anaesthesia. The procedure begins with the insertion of the first upper polyaxial screw which is screwed in with the polyaxial screwdriver. The use of the phantom (Trial 10) is necessary in order to position the second screw. Once the screws are positioned, the B-Dyn is taken between the jaws of the gripping forceps in order to insert it into the heads of the polyaxial screws. The movable rod of the B-Dyn is then placed in the head of the upper screw. The positioning mark of the fixed rod must be placed facing the operator and in the center of the lower screw head. Finally the cap of the lower polyaxial pedicle screw is tightened. A final tightening of the two plugs on the polyaxial pedicle screw heads is performed to fix the assembly.</description>
