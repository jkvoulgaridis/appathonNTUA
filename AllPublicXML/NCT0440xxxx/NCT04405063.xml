  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Paclitaxel drug-coated
      balloon (Genoss® DCB) by demonstrating non-inferiority to in-segment late lumen loss in the
      segment 6 months after the procedure in patients with in-stent restenosis (ISR) compared with
      a product of the same category (Sequent® Please)

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a controlled clinical trial to compare with the same-category medical device (Sequent®
      Please), 82 patients with in-stent restenosis (ISR) were recruited from a total of 7
      institutions, and the enrolled subjects were 1: 1 through randomization. The ratio was
      assigned to the test group and the control group, and each of the test or control devices was
      assigned to receive the procedure.

      Drug release &quot;stents&quot; for cardiovascular procedures usually follow 9 months or 12 months, but
      the medical device for this clinical trial has a drug coated &quot;balloon catheter&quot; and the
      mechanism of action is different from the stent and the duration of follow up was set to 6
      months.
