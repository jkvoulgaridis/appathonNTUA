      To determine the differences in the placement of the glenoid implant of the inverted
      prostheses when they are implanted using a superior approach and using an anterior approach.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inverted prostheses have proven to be effective in the treatment of all those pathologies
      that involve a deterioration of the rotator cuff (secondary arthropathy, acute fractures,
      sequelae of fractures, tumor surgery and revision surgery). Despite this, numerous
      complications have been described after the use of inverted prostheses, such as glenoid
      erosion, infections, dislocation, or aseptic loosening. The most frequent complication
      related to the use of inverted prostheses is glenoid erosion that can occur in up to 96% of
      cases. This complication appears early in the evolution, usually before 2 years after
      surgery. Its clinical significance is not yet clear, but it seems that it may be a cause of
      long-term prosthetic loosening. To avoid the development of glenoid erosion, the best option
      is to place the glenoid component low, so that if the glenoid component is flush with the
      lower margin of the glena, the chances of developing glenoid erosion are significantly
      reduced. Two types of approaches have been used to implant these prostheses, the
      deltopectoral and the superior anterior approach. Each of them has its advantages and
      disadvantages, so that deltopectoral seems to improve surgical exposure and therefore favors
      the best placement of the glenoid component, but sacrifices the subscapularis tendon,
      increasing the risk of dislocation of the components. On the contrary, the superior anterior
      approach respects the subscapularis tendon, reducing the risk of dislocation of the
      components but gives worse surgical exposure.
