  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study measures the effect of a 3-month patient education and self-management
      intervention in a low-resource setting, on diabetes knowledge and levels of blood glucose
      control.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Vietnam, there is a low level of diabetes knowledge among the general population, and
      significantly lower awareness in rural areas compared with urban areas. This highlights the
      urgent need for communication and education to improve the knowledge of the Vietnamese
      population of patients with type 2 diabetes on risk factors, complications, prevention and
      treatment. The main goal of this study is to evaluate the effects of a patient education and
      self-management intervention as add-on to usual diabetes care in a low-resource setting on
      diabetes knowledge and blood glucose control parameters in Vietnamese patients with type 2
      diabetes.

      This is a single-center, randomized, controlled study among adult out-patients with type 2
      diabetes. Patients meeting the inclusion criteria are randomly assigned to a community
      intervention or to usual diabetes care alone (control group) for a period of 3 months. The
      intervention consists of group education on type 2 diabetes, including, in addition to usual
      diabetes care: information on diet, exercise, drug therapy, and adherence. Each patient
      should attend the group education monthly over 3 consecutive months. Usual diabetes care is
      consistent with the ADA guidelines and comprises standard dietary and exercise advice in
      addition to antidiabetes treatment. Diabetes knowledge is measured with a modified Michigan
      University Diabetes Knowledge Test (MDKT). Other study outcomes includes change in mean
      HbA1c, fasting blood glucose, and systolic blood pressure.

    <description>All patients complete a modified Michigan University Diabetes Knowledge Test (MDKT) (16) at baseline and at the end of the 3-month trial. The MDKT is a quick and low-cost method of assessing general knowledge of diabetes and diabetes self-care. The 23-item original questionnaire was translated into Vietnamese and adapted as required based on a pilot test performed in 10 people with type 2 diabetes, which resulted in one question being removed. The modified questionnaire therefore consist of 22 statements with multiple choice answers with 1 point awarded for each correct answer (Appendix 1). Patients who answer &gt;50% of the questions correctly considered to pass the knowledge test, and patients who answer &lt;50% of the questions correctly considered to fail. The proportion of successful patients (i.e. with MDKT total score â‰¥11) the study primary outcome.</description>
