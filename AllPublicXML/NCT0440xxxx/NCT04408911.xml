    <textblock>
      The aim of this retrospective cohort study is to evaluate the effect of lormetazepam versus
      midazolam on hospital mortality, intensive care unit outcomes and sedation management.

      The hypothesis is that patients receiving midazolam have a 5% higher hospital mortality in
      comparison to patients receiving lormetazepam.

    <textblock>
      Sedation is an integral part of modern intensive care medicine and has seen a tremendous
      development throughout the last years. Current guideline recommendations are targeted at an
      awake critically ill patients (target Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale 0/-1) as early deep
      sedation has been shown to negatively affect the outcome. Nevertheless, is an adequate and
      individualized anxiolysis still an important intervention that can be achieved via process
      optimization, modifications to the infrastructure of the ward and pharmacologic therapy.
      Bolus application of benzodiazepines is a recommended pharmacologic measure to achieve proper
      anxiolysis. Midazolam is currently the most commonly used benzodiazepine in European
      intensive care units. Midazolam accumulates after repetitive application due to its
      pharmacokinetic properties, which increases the likelihood for side effects and makes
      targeted sedation increasingly difficult. Lormetazepam is used with increasing frequency as
      it is eliminated independent of the patients age and has few relevant metabolites. It is
      therefore thought to be better suited for targeted sedation management, which in turn would
      be beneficial for the patients.

      The aim of this retrospective cohort study is to evaluate the effect of lormetazepam versus
      midazolam on hospital mortality, intensive care unit outcomes and sedation management.
