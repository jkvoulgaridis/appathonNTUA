  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of curative intended
      irreversible electroporation (IRE) in the treatment of liver tumors neighboring major vessels
      or bile ducts.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients can be included in the study if they have one or more malignant liver tumors
      unsuitable for resection and thermal ablation (due to proximity of major vessels or bile
      duct) or other established liver directed therapies.

      Prior to inclusion all potential participant will be evaluated by the local multidisciplinary
      team, to insure fulfillment of the above-mentioned criteria. In general, the included patient
      will have tumors with &lt;1 cm of margin to major hepatic vessels or bile ducts, thereby not
      allowing for conventional treatments because of risk of i.e. hemorrhage, biliary tract
      damage, liver failure or ineffective ablation due to heat sink.

      IRE will be done under general anesthesia as an in-patient procedure. Patients will be
      observed for at least 24 hours after IRE.

      Patients will attend CT scans 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months post-IRE according
      to national guidelines (for follow-up after radiofrequency ablation (RFA)). Patients will
      attend the out-patient clinic after 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months. During the follow-up
      period, patients will be asked to fill out electronic forms monitoring pain, quality of life
      and nutritional status. After 24 months the patients will only be followed with CT scans in
      accordance with the mentioned schedule. Data collection for scientific purposes will stop
      when the last included patient has been followed for at least 24 months or when the study
      period concludes.

      In case of multiple liver tumors, where a conventional treatment approach is not possible due
      to a single lesion being too close to major vessels or bile ducts, IRE may be used in
      conjunction to conventional therapy.
