    <description>MPM patients will be first administrated 20 mg/kg of oral photosensitizer, 5-Aminolevulinic Acid (5-ALA) {Gliolan®}, 4 to 6 hours prior undergoing thoracoscopy (VATS). During VATS procedure, after a qualitative control of the fluorescence of tumor lesions and some guided pleural tumor biopsies, the pleural cavity will be illuminated using a flexible probe and laser source at a specific wavelength for 5-ALA (400-500 nm; 25 J/cm2) during 15 minutes (6 fractions of 2.5 minutes separated by 5 pauses of 2 minutes each to improve tissue oxygenation for the PDT reaction). An IPC device (but no talc) will be inserted and used for pleurodesis and may permit to collect further pleural effusion samples. As 5-ALA has a short half-life and thus does not need extensive precautions to avoid patient photosensitivity, the patient would not stay longer than a standard procedure (about 2-3 days in the hospital)</description>
