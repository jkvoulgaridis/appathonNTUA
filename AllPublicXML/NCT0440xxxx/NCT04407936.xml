    <textblock>
      As a single center, retrospective observation study in Guangdong Institute of Cardiovascular
      Diseases, this study included the main study population of patients who underwent coronary
      angiography and / or coronary intervention from 2000 to 2019. The hospitalization information
      was collected in the form of direct derivation of the case, and the follow-up information was
      collected through outpatient service and telephone follow-up.

    <textblock>
      This is a single center, retrospective observation study collecting data on 89000 coronary
      angiography and / or coronary intervention patients from 2000 to 2019.Data regarding
      demographic information, admission diagnoses and history of present illness, biomarkers and
      details on preventive hydration and medications will be collected. The primary endpoint of
      this study is Contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI), defined as a ≥ 0.5 mg/dL or 25%
      increase in serum creatinine (SCr) from baseline during the first 48 to 72 hours after the
      procedure.
