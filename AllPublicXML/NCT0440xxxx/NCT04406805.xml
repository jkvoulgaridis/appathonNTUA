  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) has recently gained increasing scientific interest in the field
      of cardiovascular disease, including its role in cell protection against osmotic and
      hydrostatic stress. Aortic stenosis (AS) is the most common valvular heart disease, affecting
      about 7.6 million people over 75 years of age in North America and Europe alone. We
      hypothesized that TMAO plays a role in protection of the cardiomyocytes against pressure
      overload in patients with AS. The primary aim of this study is to assess the correlation
      between the serum and urine TMAO concentration, and (i) echocardiographic, (ii) biochemical
      and (iii) histopathological parameters of heart failure in patients with severe AS. The
      secondary aim of this study is to evaluate a correlation between the baseline TMAO
      concentrations and the post-treatment clinical status, as well as the post-treatment
      echocardiographic and biochemical parameters.
