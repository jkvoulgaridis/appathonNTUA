  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been hypothesized that exercise may have a beneficial effect on sleep quality and
      insomnia severity in those who have insomnia symptoms as well as those who meet diagnostic
      criteria for insomnia disorder (e.g., Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 5th edition (DSM-5)).
      Yet, the studies that have tested this are extremely limited in number and even fewer explore
      any acute effects of exercise training on subjects who meet diagnostic criteria. Thus, the
      investigators propose to conduct a randomized parallel design to compare the effects of
      short-term moderate-intensity aerobic exercise on insomnia severity and measures of sleep in
      a sample of adults who meet diagnostic criteria for insomnia.

    <textblock>
      Limited experimental research has explored the effects of acute exercise training (&lt; 1 week
      of exercise) on sleep and daytime impairment in samples of adults who meet diagnostic
      criteria for insomnia. In response to the current literature, the investigators aim to better
      understand the short-term clinical benefit of adopting exercise training in insomnia.
      Including multiple bouts of exercise in a short time span while measuring sleep with
      objective and self-reported measures may be more reflective of capturing true acute effects
      of exercise implementation on insomnia. The investigators propose to conduct a randomized
      parallel design to compare the effects of short-term moderate-intensity aerobic exercise on
      insomnia severity and measures of sleep in a sample of adults who meet diagnostic criteria
      for insomnia. This project will address prior limitations in the area of acute exercise
      research by utilizing a sample with diagnosed insomnia, assessing multiple nights of sleep,
      and implementing multiple bouts of exercise stimuli. This project will examine the following
      aims:

      Aim 1: To examine if implementing 1 week of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise improves
      objective and subjective sleep compared to 1 week without exercise in a sample of adults who
      meet diagnostic criteria for insomnia.

      Aim 2: To examine if implementing 1 week of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise reduces
      severity of daytime impairment compared to 1 week without exercise in a sample of adults who
      meet diagnostic criteria for insomnia.

    <description>Participants randomized to the aerobic exercise group will complete 30 minutes of treadmill walking at a moderate intensity, defined as 50% heart rate reserve from the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) exercise prescription recommendations. A 5-minute warm-up and cool-down will occur before and after the 30-minute bout. A Polar H10 heart rate monitor will continuously monitor exercise intensity during the session. Ratings of Perceived Exertion (RPE) will be assessed using the Borg scale (i.e., 6-20 rating system) to indicate perceived exercise effort every 5 minutes during the exercise session. Each session will last approximately 50 minutes.</description>

A Polar H10 heart rate monitor will continuously monitor heart rate during the session to mimic the aerobic exercise condition. Participants will not be permitted to complete homework or work during the allotted time to reduce the chance of unintended stimuli. The quiet rest sessions will be 50 minutes in length.</description>
