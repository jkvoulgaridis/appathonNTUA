  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out whether sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping with ICG
      dye and NIR imaging can be used to identify esophageal or esophagogastric junction cancer
      that has spread to the lymph nodes. If SLN mapping is successful in these types of cancer,
      surgeons in the future could identify the sentinel lymph nodes and only remove these instead
      of removing all the lymph nodes which is currently done.

    <description>Patients will undergo ICG injection and NIR imaging for lymphatic mapping. Any identified SLNs will be dissected during the standard completion lymphadenectomy and esophagectomy. The SLN biopsy procedure will be performed as described below. Although NIR with ICG is used to assess conduit perfusion in all esophagectomies performed at MSK, its use for lymphatic mapping is considered experimental in esophageal cancer.</description>
