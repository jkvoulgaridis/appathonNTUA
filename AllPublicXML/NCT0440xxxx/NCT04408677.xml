      Mainstream oximetry devices use two-wavelength systems to photograph the retina and estimate
      the oxygen saturation levels in the retinal vessels by comparing light absorption in the
      blood of the vessels at the selected wavelengths. This method limits the measurements to
      large retinal vessels, depends heavily on calibration and is non-reproducible across
      machines. The few numbers of wavelengths used (two) also makes it very susceptible to noise
      (such as cataract). These shortcomings have largely limited the use of retinal oximetry in
      clinical practice.

      A new technology for retinal oximetry has recently been developed to address issues of
      dual-wavelength oximeters. Zilia Ocular's oximetry machine uses multi-wavelengths of light to
      take continuous oxygenation measurements of any targeted regions of the retina. It can
      measure any area of the retina, including the blood vessels, retinal tissues and the optic
      nerve head. Its multi-wavelength design also allows it to be less susceptible to noise, more
      precise and reproducible. This technology has the potential to extend our understanding of
      retinal pathologies, serve as a new marker for retinal health and even be used as a
      diagnostic tool to detect retinal injuries before they become visible.

      Zilia's novel technology is one of its kind, allowing continuous and accurate measurements of
      the retina's oxygen saturation. In order to apply this technology to study and investigate
      retinal diseases, we need to first examine its performance in normal eyes and build a
      normative database as a reference. Thus, the purpose of the current study is to build a
      database of baseline oximetry values in healthy Caucasian subjects. The reproducibility of
      the measurements will also be studied in a subset of patients.

      STUDY OBJECTIVES

      Objectives

      Primary:

      1. To measure the oxygen saturation at different locations on the retina (macula, optic nerve
      head, nasal retina) in order to provide the range of these values in normal eyes.

      Secondary:

        1. To assess the repeatability of the device's measurements (on a subset of patients).

        2. To assess the variability of measurements between the two eyes (on a subset of
           patients).

      Outcomes

      Primary Outcome:

      1. Normative values of the retinal oxygen saturation at different locations on the retina.

      Secondary Outcomes:

        1. Intraclass correlation coefficient of the measurements on the same patient at the same
           visit.

        2. Percent difference between the measurements of the two eyes.

      STUDY HYPOTHESES

      Primary:

      1. Oxygen saturation should have a consistent range among healthy subjects.

      Secondary:

        1. Intraclass classification (ICC) between two measurements on the same eye of the same
           participant should be at least 90%.

        2. Measurements between the two eyes should have a percent difference less than 5%.

      STUDY DESIGN Type of study: observational, single-center.

      Expected number of subjects:

      For primary objective: N=120 subjects For secondary objective #1: n= 62 For secondary
      objective #2: n= 12
