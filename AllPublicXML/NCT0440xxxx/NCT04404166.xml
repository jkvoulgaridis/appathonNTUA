  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of Phone-based Intervention under Nurse Guidance after Stroke II
      (PINGS-2) is to deploy a hybrid study design to firstly, demonstrate the efficacy of a
      theoretical-model-based, mHealth technology-centered, nurse-led, multi-level integrated
      approach to substantially improve longer term BP control among 500 recent stroke patients
      encountered at 10 hospitals in Ghana. Secondly, PINGS II seeks to develop an implementation
      strategy for routine integration and policy adoption of mhealth for post-stroke BP control in
      a LMIC setting. The investigators will leverage experience gained from the NIH Global Brain
      Disorders funded R21 pilot study (NS094033) to test efficacy of a refined,
      culturally-tailored, and potentially implementable intervention aimed at addressing the
      premier modifiable risk for stroke &amp; other key variables in an under-resourced system
      burdened by suboptimal care &amp; outcomes.

    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Target goal of &lt;140/90 mmHg measured at baseline, months 3, 6, 9 and 12. Measured by blinded evaluator using an automated BP monitor.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-management</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Compared between the two groups using the validated Hypertension Self-care Profile questionnaire (HBP SCP) with items that compositely assesses behavior, motivation and self-efficacy of hypertension management. Assessed at months 4, 8 and 12 (α.83-.93, r = .64). A total score can range from 20 to 80 with higher score indicating better self-care practice.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Medication adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Measured using Medication possession ratio177 and 14-item Hill-Bone compliance (HBC) to high blood pressure therapy scale with items that assess medication adherence, clinic appointments and salt intake assessed at months 3, 6, 9 and 12 (α.76-.83, r = .64) MPR and HBC will be measured in both PINGS and usual care arms at stated time points. Higher scores (0-14) indicate lower adherence (i.e. higher non adherence).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Cardiovascular ED encounters and Re-hospitalizations</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>To be assessed via once monthly calls to patients and/or carers over 12 months of follow up in both the PINGS and usual care groups.
Patient carers in both arms will also be encouraged to contact study team within 48 hours of hospitalizations for prompt and blinded adjudication of all potential CVD ED encounters to minimize reporting bias between the two groups.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Major Adverse Cardiovascular events (MACE) to be assessed include recurrent stroke: fatal/ severely disabling stroke or non-fatal stroke; Coronary Artery Disease: Acute STEMI/NSTEMI, sudden cardiac deaths. MACE will be confirmed by a blinded adjudicator by reviewing where available clinical notes supported by investigations e.g. CT scan, EKGs, review of death certificates or verbal autopsy if death occurs outside hospital.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health-related quality of Life: The Euro Quality of Life-5D questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D questionnaire,186 will assess state of health of study participants at baseline and Month 12. Scores range from 0 (the worst possible health status) to 100 (the best possible health status).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Health Literacy in HPT/stroke</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Self-Report: HTN/stroke Knowledge questionnaire (r=.70) Health literacy questionnaire (r = .74, .82) Assessed at months 0, 6,12. Higher scores indicate higher health literacy. Scales 1-5 are scored on a 4-point Likert-type response scale (strongly disagree, disagree, agree, strongly agree) and scales 6-9 are scored on a 5-point Likert-type scale with response options focusing on difficulty (cannot do or always difficult, usually difficult, sometimes difficult, usually easy, always easy).</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Disability/Functional status</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Functional status after stroke will be assessed by Research Assistants using the Modified Rankin Scale with a scores ranging from 0 to 6, where 0=no functional limitation and 6 = death. Assessed at months 0, 3, 6, 9 and 12.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Sex, Age, cultural, socio-economic Factors, study site</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed based on self reports at baseline. Cultural factors to assess include language spoken at home, religious observances, acceptance of gender roles; occupation, religious beliefs and dietary practices.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  age ≥ 18 years (stroke is commoner above this age cut-off)

          -  male or females (sex is a biologic variable of interest)

          -  recent stroke (within one month of symptom onset)- stroke may be ischemic or
             hemorrhagic based on brain imaging or diagnosed clinically using the locally validated
             version of the 8-item questionnaire for verifying stroke free status (8-QVSFS) when
             neuroimaging is not feasible

          -  uncontrolled HTN (SBP ≥ 140 mmHg at both the last clinical encounter post-stroke and
             the eligibility screening visit) - SBP is used as the selection variable since most
             African hypertensives &lt;60 years have systolic or combination systolic/ diastolic HTN
             and for most patients, controlling SBP also results in DBP control

          -  patients or family carers should own a basic mobile phone that can receive text/audio
             messages.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        - Any condition that would limit participation in follow up assessments, such as severe
        cognitive impairment/dementia (MMSE ≤24).
