  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is strong evidence that recent intensive interventions based on motor skill learning
      principles are efficient on functional and neuroplastic changes of children with cerebral
      palsy (CP).

      Besides, impaired selective voluntary motor control (SVMC) is one of four interrelated
      neuromuscular deficits in children with CP and is listed in the ICF-CY (International
      Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health for Children and Youth) under body
      functions. Additionally, impaired SVMC has been shown to negatively affect the motor and
      functional abilities of children with CP. However, there have been little scientific
      investigations on the trainability of SVMC according to therapeutic interventions.

      Therefore, the study aims to evaluate the effect of Hand and Arm Bimanual Intensive Therapy
      Including Lower Extremities (HABIT-ILE) on the body function and structures of children with
      bilateral and unilateral cerebral palsy, including SVMC and brain structure.
