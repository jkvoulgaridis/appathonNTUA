  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Barbed suture has been demonstrated to be safe in primary hip and knee surgery and
      retrospective data suggests barbed suture represents no increased complications in the
      revision setting. Barbed suture may represent a faster, more effective way to perform
      revision arthroplasty closures. There are no Level I studies comparing traditional and barbed
      suture closure. The purpose of this study is to assess the surgical complexities of closures
      using closure time without sacrificing cosmesis or wound complications between the
      traditional closure and barbed closure.

    <description>The POSAS consists of two parts: a Patient Scale and an Observer Scale. Both scales contain six items that are scored numerically on a ten-step scale, where 0 = normal skin and 10 = worst scar imaginable. Together they make up the 'Total Score' of the Patient and Observer Scale. This will be assessed at one of the standard of care post-op appointments between 2-6 weeks after surgery.</description>
