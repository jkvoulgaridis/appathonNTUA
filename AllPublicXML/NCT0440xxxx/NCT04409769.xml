  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Staphyloccous aureus and coagulase negative staphylocci are responsible of a large marjority
      of PJI. Regarding the high rate of methicillin resistance, current guidelines recommend the
      use of a glycopeptide, and most frequently vancomycin, as the anti-gram positive agent in
      empirical therapy, while awaiting the microbiological results. Vancomycin is not considered
      as a safe antibiotic, and daptomycin is frequently an alternative option.

      Ceftaroline and ceftobiprole are the only betalactam active on methicillin-resistant
      staphylococci. As some data report a synergistic activity with daptomycin, they could be an
      option in pandrug-resistant staphylococci BJI, but their use if off label in this indication.
