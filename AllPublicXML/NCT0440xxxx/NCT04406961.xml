  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the research has become to create a sphincterotome and a method that takes into
      account the anatomical structure of the sph Oddi. The disadvantages of pull-type
      sphincterotome led to develop a new sphincterotome. The characteristic features of new
      antegrade sphincterotome are: it is inserted ready to use; the direction of cutting is
      strictly determined; fully controlled depth of the cut. Thanks to shaping as it hook the
      sphincterotome has been extracted cutting the circular layer only. The cutting wire is
      located between two teflon catheters preventing the longitudinal muscle layer from being
      damaged. The distance between the catheters determines the depth of the cut. Endoscopic
      transpapillary antegrade sphincterotomy developed by Dr. Dovbenko -(ASD) performance in such
      case allowed: to manage the papillary stenosis; to treat complicated form of gallstone
      disease; In research group this method allowed to avoid cholecystectomy in 71,2 % of cases

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sph of Oddi consists of a circular inner muscle layer and a longitudinal outer muscle layer.
      The circular layer does not depend on the duodenum. The longitudinal layer passes from the
      wall of the duodenum and separates ascending and descending parts superimposing over its
      circular layer. The arrangement of these layers towards each others is constant. Mostly ERCP
      complications are caused by the interventions in major papilla and remain at a high level of
      frequency up to 23 % Cutting all the layers of duodenum leads to bleeding up to 3 %. The
      perforation might happened up to 1 % Destruction of the opening mechanism after
      sphincterotomy leads to develop of reflux cholangitis, acute cholecystitis. It is possible to
      avoid further cholecystectomy only in 10% of patients. Incapability of performing the
      retrograde sphincterotomy in patients with extended papillary stenosis led to the creation of
      a new method - ASD. Retrograde and antegrade sphincterotomies are analysed. 750 patients
      underwent ASD within 7 years 65 % in urgent cases . Relative risk of complication after ASD
      performing 3 times less. Taking into consideration possible post-ASD inner edema, plastic
      biliary/pancreatic stent(s) are required during 5-10 days after. Standard methods for post
      ERCP pancreatitis prevention must be applied in all cases. The new method performed some
      selective. First of all young patient with alone stone in the common bile duct, women after
      after childbirth. secondly, elderly patient were cured by ASD. And as well as a group of
      patients with severe comorbid diseases, such as renal failure, acute myocardial infarction.
      In our research, in two patients with AIDS was performed ASD. They were on special treatment
      after being diagnosed with HIV-infection, within 2 years. It was SSC. Papillary stenosis and
      cholangiolithiasis were cured successfully. The use of ASD with preservation of the closure
      function of the sph. Oddi allowed to avoid cholecystectomy in 71.2%. ASD can be performed new
      design of sphincterotome. It takes into account the anatomical structure of sph. Oddi and is
      recommended as an alternative to standard sphincterotomy, balloon dilatation and drainage
      interventions (RR 0,55 [95%CI 0,18 to 1,67]. ASD must be performed by an endoscopist with
      experience in transpapillary intervention.

Anatomical justification was cutting of only the circular layer of sph Oddi by special sphincterotome. Papillary stenosis and stenosis terminal part of common bile duct due to damage only circular layer sph Oddi. Anterograde direction and hooked form of sphincterotome (endoscopic antegrade sphincterotomy- ASD) allows to capture only need layer and control depth.

    <description>A device is represented by a teflon catheter in the distal part of which a double tube of variable shape is created. The proximal part of the ASD sphincterotome consists of a handle, and a metal wire is located inside the teflon catheter for connection to an electrosurgical unit. On the distal part, the teflon catheter is formed of a double tube length is 10 to 35 mm. The metal wire exits the catheter at a distance 10 to 35 mm from the tip and enters into the tip the second teflon tube. The distal part of the knife is formed shape a hook. A metal cutting wire is located between two tubes. Moving the handle the metal wire is shifted. Pushing the metal wire or approaching in the distal part the second tube sets the depth of cut. The incision is made by moving on guidewire in bile duct. The power settings vary.</description>

    <description>Endoscopic standard sphincterotomy aims at opening bile duct or pancreatic duct by cutting the papilla and sphincter muscles. After deep bile duct cannulation, the standard sphincterotome is retracted until one fourth to one half of the wire length is exposed outside the papilla. The sphincterotome is slightly bowed so that the wire is in contact with the roof. The incision is made lifting the sphincterotome against the papillary roof using the elevator and up-down controls while applying short bursts of current. The power settings vary. The extent of the sphincterotomy is limited by the length of the intraduodenal portion of the common bile duct.</description>
