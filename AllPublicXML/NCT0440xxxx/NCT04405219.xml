  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Smoking, anxiety and pain are clearly related conditions. We aimed to reveal the relationship
      between smoking cessation before surgery and preoperative anxiety, postoperative anxiety and
      pain in chronic smokers.

      METHODS ASA I-II group patients without chronic disease and history of drug use were included
      in the study. Those who did not want to participate in the study, patients with ASA III and
      above were excluded from the study. The patients were randomized into 2 groups: smokers
      (Group S, n = 60) and non-smokers (Group NS, n = 60). Group S was asked to quit smoking 2
      weeks before the operation. Preoperative period and postoperative 0, 2, 4. And 6. hour
      Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) values, postop 0., 2., 4., 6. hour Visual
      Analogue Scale (VAS) values were recorded.

      it has been revealed in the current study that smoking, pain and anxiety are interrelated
      with each other. In the preoperative period, high anxiety scores are related to surgery and
      anesthesia stress. High anxiety scores in the smoker group both in the preoperative period
      and in the postoperative period are associated with smoking cessation. While the pain scores
      were similar in the postoperative period, high anxiety scores strengthened the idea of
      smoking withdrawal and this study gained value. We believe that future studies with a large
      number of patients, with different parameters and multiple centers will strengthen the
      results.
