  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter randomized trial aims to primarily assess and compare the functional
      recovery of patients who undergo open versus robotic pancreaticoduodenectomy for benign and
      malignant lesions of the head of the pancreas.

      The PORTAL trial is a Phase 3 multicenter non-inferiority randomized controlled trial that
      aims to address the question of feasibility and efficacy of the robotic minimally invasive
      approach in pancreaticoduodenectomy.

      In the past 10 years there has been an increasing number of retrospective series from major
      centers for pancreatic surgery worldwide, that demonstrate similar and occasionally improved
      postoperative outcomes in patients who undergo a robotic pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple).
      The benefits of this minimally invasive approach appear to be decreased intraoperative
      estimated blood loss, lower postoperative pain levels and smaller length of hospital stay,
      whereas postoperative complications rates are comparable with the standard open approach.

      This trial is conducted in multiple major centers for pancreatic surgery (open and robotic)
      in China and aims to address these questions in a prospective fashion. All eligible patients
      who present to these centers within the study period will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to
      either of the two arms (open vs. robotic). Patients enrolled in the study will be blinded
      regarding the type of the procedure by application of identical wound dressings at the trocar
      sites and the open incision. Patients will be followed up closely and will be evaluated
      routinely for quality of life parameters for a period of at least 2 years postoperatively.
      Additionally, patients who undergo surgery in either arm for pancreatic adenocarcinoma will
      also be evaluated for time to adjuvant chemotherapy postoperatively, as well as recurrence
      and survival data.
