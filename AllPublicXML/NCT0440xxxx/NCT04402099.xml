    <textblock>
      Twenty years after KBP-2000-CPHG study and ten years after KBP-2010-CPHG study, the CPHG
      proposes to conduct a new epidemiological study on primary PLC in order to evaluate and
      analyze the changes that have occurred over the last decade.

      Primary endpoint:

      Estimate 1-year- and 5-year-mortality rates in patients with PLC.

      Secondary endpoints:

        -  Describe PLC patient population managed by pulmonologists at French General Hospitals in
           2020

        -  Describe PLC diagnostic and therapeutic management by pulmonologists at French General
           Hospitals in 2020 and compare them to KBP-2000-CPHG and KBP-2010-CPHG studies

        -  Estimate prognostic factors

        -  Compare patient and tumor characteristics to those observed for KBP-2010-CPHG and
           KBP-2000-CPHG studies

        -  Compare observed survival rates to those reported for KBP-2000-CPHG and KBP-2010-CPHG
           studies
