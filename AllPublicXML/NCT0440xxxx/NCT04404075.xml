      Design and beta-test a research-oriented mobile health app to assess disease activity,
      quality of life, treatment patterns, adverse medication effects, and lifestyle factors in
      patients with atopic dermatitis.

    <textblock>
      Mobile health technology, including smartphone apps and wearable monitors, has tremendous
      potential to transform clinical research. Recording of patient outcomes on a smartphone
      device and camera in the home setting can greatly reduce the number of in person research
      visits, saving tremendous costs, time, and effort associated with data entry. This also
      allows for easier recruitment of study subjects, who can be enrolled in geographic locations
      beyond academic research centers. After FDA approval of a therapy, mobile health technology
      can help researchers understand how that particular therapy is being used in a real-world
      setting, including frequency of use, adverse events, and impact of use on disease symptoms
      and patient quality of life. In this study, the investigators will create a mobile app to
      help the atopic dermatitis community understand the types of data and quality of data that
      can be gathered from atopic dermatitis patients longitudinally. A review of existing atopic
      dermatitis mobile apps on the market reveals they are consumer-oriented and may not be able
      to fully capture high-quality research data. The investigator proposed app is specifically
      geared for research, and thus fills an important gap. The research team will develop
      SkinTracker, a research-oriented eczema app to longitudinally track atopic dermatitis
      severity, symptoms, quality of life, physical activity, medication usage, and adverse events
      in a real-world setting.
