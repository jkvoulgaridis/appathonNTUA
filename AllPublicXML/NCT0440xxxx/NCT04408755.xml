    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of AVP-786
      (deudextromethorphan hydrobromide [d6-DM]/quinidine sulfate [Q]) compared to placebo for the
      treatment of agitation in participants with dementia of the Alzheimer's type.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible participants for this study must have a diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's disease
      (AD) and must have clinically significant, moderate/severe agitation secondary to AD.

      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, consisting of 12
      weeks of treatment.

      Approximately 750 participants will be enrolled at approximately 110 centers worldwide.

      Study medication will be administered orally twice-daily from Day 1 through Day 85. Screening
      will occur within approximately 4 weeks prior to randomization. Following screening
      procedures for assessment of inclusion and exclusion criteria, eligible participants will be
      randomized into the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants with a diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's disease according to the 2011
             Neuropsychiatric Inventory Agitation/Aggression (NPI-AA) working groups criteria

          -  Participants with clinically significant, moderate-to-severe agitation for at least 2
             weeks prior to Screening that interferes with daily routine per the Investigator's
             judgment

          -  Participants who require pharmacotherapy for the treatment of agitation per the
             Investigator's judgment after an evaluation of reversible factors and a course of
             nonpharmacological interventions

          -  Diagnosis of agitation must meet the International Psychogeriatric Association (IPA)
             provisional definition of agitation.

          -  Participants meeting an additional predetermined blinded eligibility criterion, which
             will remain blinded to the clinical study site Investigators and staff

          -  Participants with a reliable caregiver who is able and willing to comply with all
             study procedures, including adherence to administering study drug and not
             administering any prohibited medications during the course of the study, and who
             spends a minimum of 2 hours per day for 4 days per week with the participant

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants with dementia predominantly of the non-Alzheimer's type (e.g., vascular
             dementia, frontotemporal dementia, Parkinson's disease, substance-induced dementia)

          -  Participants with symptoms of agitation that are not secondary to Alzheimer's dementia
             (e.g., secondary to pain, other psychiatric disorder, or delirium)

          -  Participants with co-existent clinically significant or unstable systemic diseases
             that could confound the interpretation of the safety results of the study (e.g.,
             malignancy [except skin basal-cell carcinoma], poorly controlled diabetes, poorly
             controlled hypertension, unstable pulmonary, renal or hepatic disease, unstable
             ischemic cardiac disease, dilated cardiomyopathy, or unstable valvular heart disease)

          -  Participants with myasthenia gravis
