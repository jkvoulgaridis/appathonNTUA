      Primary Objective:

      To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SAR442257 administered as a single agent in
      patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) and refractory non-Hodgkin
      lymphoma (RR-NHL), and determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D)

      Secondary Objectives:

      To characterize the safety profile of SAR442257 To characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK)
      profile of SAR442257 To evaluate the potential immunogenicity of SAR442257 To assess
      preliminary evidence of antitumor activity

      Study duration per participant is 2 months to estimated 16 months. Cycle lengths in this
      study are 27 days in Cycle 1 and 28 days for subsequent cycles as determined by totality of
      data collected thus far including PK/Pharmacodynamics (PD), safety and preliminary efficacy.

        status ≤2.

        RRMM patients:

        must have received at least 3 prior lines of therapy including proteasome inhibitor (PI),
        immunomodulatory agent (IMiD), and anti-CD38 mAb; and must have received their last dose of
        prior anti-CD38 therapy within 9 months prior to the first dose of SAR442257; and must be
        refractory to anti-CD38 antibody (eg, daratumumab or isatuximab), characterized by
        progression within 60 days of the last dose of anti-CD38, regardless of which line it was
        given; and must be either relapsed or refractory to all established therapies with known
        clinical benefit in RRMM where approved and available, or are intolerant to those
        established therapies; and must not be candidates for regimens known to provide clinical
        benefit.

        Patients with RRMM must have measurable disease as per the following:

          -  Serum M protein ≥0.5 g/dL (≥5 g/L), or

          -  Urine M protein ≥200 mg/24 hours, or

          -  Serum free light chain (FLC) assay: involved FLC assay ≥10 mg/dL and an abnormal serum
             FLC ratio (&lt;0.26 or &gt;1.65).

        clinical benefit where approved and available, or are intolerant to those established
        therapies.

        criteria with the exception of Grade 1 peripheral neuropathy, alopecia or toxicities from
        prior anticancer therapy that are considered irreversible (defined as having been present
        and stable for &gt;4 weeks) which may be allowed if they are not otherwise described in the
        exclusion criteria.

        Participant not suitable for participation, whatever the reason, as judged by the
        Investigator, including medical or clinical conditions, or participants potentially at risk
        of noncompliance to study procedures.

        Sensitivity to any of the study interventions, or components thereof, or drug or other
        allergy that, in the opinion of the Investigator, contraindicates participation in the
