    <textblock>
      Cluster headache attacks do not occur randomly throughout the day, but have a clear circadian
      rhythmicity. The aim of this study is to investigate circadian changes of the brain, the
      autonomic nervous system and pain processing systems.

      Cluster headache attacks do not occur randomly throughout the day, but have a clear circadian
      rhythmicity. The aim of this study is to investigate circadian changes in the functional
      connectivity, spectroscopy, iron deposition and perfusion of the brain. In addition, we plan
      to investigate circadian changes in the pain threshold of the brain using quantitative
      sensory testing (QST). Finally, we will investigate changes in the autonomic nervous system
      measuring the pupillary response.

    <description>Patients suffering from cluster headache will be included in this group. When analysing the data, the investigators will distinguish those in the in-bout period from those in the out-bout period. People in this group may participate twice: once in the in-bout and once in the out-bout period.</description>

    <description>Patient will be scanned in the MRI twice, once at noon (+/- 1 hour), once at 1 a.m. (+/- 1 hour). The investigators will search for any changes in functional connectivity, particular regarding the connection between the hypothalamus and pain-processing networks.</description>
