  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      HIV is a serious disease with no cure or vaccine to prevent it. Using antibodies could be a
      way to prevent HIV infection. Antibodies are made by the human body to fight germs.
      Researches want to test an antibody, CAP256V2LS.

      Objective:

      To test CAP256V2LS to see if it is safe and how the body responds to it.

      Eligibility:

      Healthy people ages 18-60.

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical exam, and blood tests. Some
      will have a pregnancy test.

      Participants will be assigned to one of two groups. Based on their group, they will get 1
      dose of CAP256V2LS in 1 of 2 ways:

        -  Some participants will get CAP256V2LS as an infusion. A thin tube will be placed in an
           arm vein. CAP256V2LS will be given into the vein using a pump.

        -  Some participants will get CAP256V2LS injected under the skin. A small needle will
           inject CAP256V2LS into the fatty tissue of the belly, arm, or thigh. They will get 1 to
           4 injections.

      On the day they get CAP256V2LS, participants will give blood samples at different time
      points. This visit will last about 8 hours.

      Participants will be asked to check their temperature every day for 7 days after receiving
      CAP256V2LS. They will use a tool to measure any redness, swelling, or bruising they may have
      at the injection site.

      Participants will have visits at least 2-3 times during the first week after they get
      CAP256V2LS. Then they will have about 9 more visits over the next 6 months. Visits will
      include blood tests.

      Design:

      This first-in-human, open-label study will evaluate CAP256V2LS (VRC-HIVMAB0102-00-AB) in
      healthy adults. The primary hypothesis is that subcutaneous (SC) and intravenous (IV)
      administrations of CAP256V2LS will be safe and well-tolerated in healthy adults. A secondary
      hypothesis is that CAP256V2LS will be detectable in human sera with a definable half-life.

      Study Product:

      The CAP256V2LS broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibody (bNAb) targets the V1V2 region of the
      HIV-1 envelope, is human in origin, and contains two amino acid modifications within the
      C-terminus of the heavy chain constant region designed to improve antibody half-life in vivo.
      This bNAb was developed by the VRC/NIAID/NIH in collaboration with The Centre for the AIDS
      Programme of Research in South Africa (CAPRISA) and is manufactured under cGMP regulations at
      the VRC Pilot Plant operated under contract by the Vaccine Clinical Materials Program (VCMP),
      Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc., Frederick. MD. The CAP256V2LS drug product is supplied at a
      concentration of 100 mg/mL in a sterile, aqueous, buffered solution of 6.25 mL in single-use
      10 mL glass vials. R-Gene 10 will be added as a stabilizing agent to IV doses of CAP256V2LS.
      R-Gene10 (Arginine Hydrochloride Injection, USP) for intravenous infusion contains L-Arginine
      Hydrochloride, USP in Water for Injection (equivalent to a 10% solution).

      Subjects:

      Healthy subjects, 18-60 years of age

      Study Plan:

      This open-label study will include 2 dosing regimens with CAP256V2LS administered at 5 mg/kg
      IV and 5 mg/kg SC. A single dose of the study product will be administered on Day 0 as shown
      below.

      VRC 611 Study Design

        -  Group 1

             -  Study Product: CAP256V2LS

             -  Subjects per Group: 5

             -  Dose (mg/kg) and Route Administered: 5 mg/kg IV

             -  Day 0: X

        -  Group 2

             -  Study Product: CAP256V2LS

             -  Subjects per Group: 5

             -  Dose (mg/kg) and Route Administered: 5 mg/kg SC

             -  Day 0: X

      Total Subjects: 10 (Enrollment up to 20 subjects is permitted in case additional evaluations
      for safety or pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluations are needed.)

      Duration:

      Study participation will be approximately 24 weeks from the Day 0 product administration
