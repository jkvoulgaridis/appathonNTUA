      The prevalence of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is rising, but existing medications provide only
      modest control of cognitive decline and associated symptoms, and novel therapies are urgently
      needed. This randomized sham-controlled trial will determine if an innovative low-risk
      remotely-supervised transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) applied over the area of
      the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for 30 minutes at the intensity of 2 mA five times per
      week for 6 months at home can improve cognitive performance and symptoms and modulate
      neuroimaging markers of neuroplasticity in 100 patients with mild to moderate AD. If
      effective, this novel intervention can substantially enhance AD symptom management at home,
      improve quality of life of AD patients and their families, and reduce burden associated with
      this debilitating illness.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The hallmark of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is cognitive decline with varied associated symptoms
      and signs. Unfortunately, there is no cure as yet for AD. Available treatments, including 5
      FDA-approved medications, have limited efficacy in terms of slowing pathological progression
      or controlling the symptoms and signs of cognitive decline in AD patients. Given the high
      burdens and costs of AD, and the therapeutic limitations, the development of novel treatment
      approaches for AD is of the highest importance for patients, families, medical providers, and
      society. This randomized controlled trial will determine if innovative, low-risk
      neurostimulation at home for 6 months can improve cognitive performance and symptoms in
      patients with mild to moderate AD.

      The primary objective is to determine the effects produced by 6 months of active tDCS or sham
      delivered over dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in home settings on global cognitive
      performance (assessed by ADAS-Cog test - primary outcome), and secondarily on executive
      control/spatial selective attention (Eriksen Flanker Test), depressed mood (Geriatric
      depression scale), quality of life (Quality of Life Questionnaire-Alzheimer's Disease), and
      patient satisfaction with both the device and procedure (Neurostimulation User's Survey), in
      mild-to-moderate AD patients (n=100). The investigators also aim to determine functional and
      structural brain connectivity/network changes in response to the study intervention using
      functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI; during rest and during executive function
      tasks), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and multivariate covariance-based analytic
      approaches. Lastly, the investigators aim to examine time characteristics (durability) of the
      tDCS behavioral and neuroplasticity effects for up to 3 months following the intervention
      period.

      The intervention will consist of remotely supervised active tDCS stimulation and sham tDCS
      stimulation over the area of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, applied at home for 30
      minutes 5 times per week for 6 months. Participants randomized to the active tDCS will
      receive at each application 30 minutes of direct current stimulation at the intensity of 2
      mA. Participants randomized to the sham group will receive sham tDCS which consists of
      current ramped up to 2mA over 30 seconds, ramped down over 30 seconds and stay at 0 current
      for the remaining time of the 30-minute application.

    <description>Change in The Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog) was developed as an outcome measure for dementia interventions; its primary purpose was to be an index of global cognition in response to therapies. It assesses multiple cognitive domains across 11 items: Word Recall Task, Naming Objects and Fingers, Following Commands, Constructional Praxis, Ideational Praxis, Orientation, Word Recognition Task, Remembering Test Directions, Spoken Language, Comprehension and Word-Finding Difficulty. The score ranges from 0 to 70. A 4-point ADAS-cog change at 6 months is clinically meaningful.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Community-dwelling male or female of age 60 and older.

          2. AD diagnosed by neurologists or geriatricians at our dementia and geriatric clinical
             sites. Clinicians will review the medical records of all potential cases to ensure the
             patients meet established clinical criteria for AD, and also examine individuals as
             needed to further establish the diagnosis. Mild-to moderate stage AD as determined by
             study clinicians using the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR). The CDR is a 5-point
             scale used to characterize six domains of cognitive and functional performance
             applicable to AD: Memory, Orientation, Judgment &amp; Problem Solving, Community Affairs,
             Home &amp; Hobbies, and Personal Care. The necessary information to make each rating is
             obtained through a semi-structured interview of the patient and a reliable informant
             (e.g., family member). A CDR score of 0.5 or 1 is rated as mild severity and a score
             of 2 is rated as moderate severity. The investigators selected mild to moderate AD
             patients as our target population as they are the most prevalent AD severity group
             referred to our clinics, increasing generalizability. This mild to moderate AD group
             is also most likely to be cared for in the community and at home, in contrast to more
             advanced or severe AD stages, which are more prevalent in institutional settings (and
             will be the focus of our future studies).

          3. If on dementia medication regimen, the regimen is stable for at least 4 weeks prior to
             enrollment. The investigators will not restrict clinicians from starting, adjusting or
             stopping dementia medications over the intervention period in keeping with the
             pragmatic nature of our trial, but will account for medications in both groups in our
             analysis.

          4. Able to speak and understand English at a level sufficient undergo the study
             procedures and testing protocols.

          5. Willing to complete an MRI (exclusions relevant to neuroimaging are described below).

          6. Able to provide Informed Consent (or able to provide assent with a legal surrogate
             providing informed consent.)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Unstable medical or major psychiatric illnesses or unstable treatments for medical or
             major psychiatric illnesses. Any medical or psychiatric diagnosis is permitted as long
             as it has been clinically stable for at least 3 months, reflected in part by stability
             of treatments for at least 3 months, and is expected on the basis of clinical judgment
             to be in a stable phase that will likely extend for 6 months.

          2. History of head trauma, seizures, brain surgery, stroke or cancer affecting head,
             metal implants in the head or neck, compromised integrity or sensitivity of the skin
             at or near locations where electrodes will be placed (e.g., eczema, severe rashes,
             blisters, open wounds, burn including sunburns, cuts or irritation).

          3. Currently participating in another intervention study or using neurostimulation
             device.

          4. Exclusions specific to neuroimaging procedure: the presence of any surgically
             implanted metallic devices, such as aneurysm clips or pacemakers that would be a
             safety contraindication for MRI. Subjects with large amounts of dental or surgical
             hardware in the head and neck will be excluded because magnetic susceptibility effects
             will lead to severe image artifacts in these subjects' images. Due to the confined
             space of the MRI magnet, subjects with a known history of claustrophobia will also be
             excluded as will subjects with weight &gt;350lbs or waist circumference &gt;55 inches.
