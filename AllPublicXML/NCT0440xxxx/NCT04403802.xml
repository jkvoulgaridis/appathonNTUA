  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double blind, randomized, crossover pilot study of Voxx Human Performance
      Technology Socks versus placebo socks for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced peripheral
      neuropathy in patients with cancer. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to one of the following
      regimens:

        -  Arm A: Continuous wear of Voxx Human Performance Technology Socks for 2 weeks, followed
           by continuous wear of placebo socks for 2 weeks (separated by a 2-week washout period)

        -  Arm B: Continuous wear of placebo socks for 2 weeks, followed by continuous wear of Voxx
           Human Performance Technology Socks for 2 weeks (separated by a 2-week washout period)

      Patients will be evaluated at three time points using an objective neuropathy assessment as
      well as self-report questionnaires assessing chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy,
      quality of life, and cancer-related symptoms.

    <description>Voxx Human Performance Technology Socks are commercially-available socks that are drug and electrical free. The Voxx Human Performance Technology proprietary pattern is woven into a sock that is made of 70% cotton, 25% polyester, 3% spandex, and 2% nylon.
Prior to the 2-week treatment window, patients will be provided with 6 pairs of Voxx Human Performance Technology socks. Patients will be asked to wear the socks continuously during both waking and sleeping hours, except when showering, bathing, or swimming.</description>

    <description>Placebo socks are identical to the Voxx Human Performance Technology socks but do not include the Voxx Human Performance Technology pattern woven into the sock. Placebo socks are made of the same fabric as Voxx Human Performance Technology socks and are drug and electrical free.
Prior to the 2-week treatment window, patients will be provided with 6 pairs of placebo socks. Patients will be asked to wear the socks continuously during both waking and sleeping hours, except when showering, bathing, or swimming.</description>

             least three months (90 days) ago. Current use of anti-estrogen therapy, Herceptin, or
             PARP inhibitors is okay.

          -  Clinical diagnosis of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy by clinician. This
             will be based on symptom history (paresthesias, dysesthesias, allodynia), loss of deep
             tendon reflexes, decreased vibratory sensation, or the presence of symmetrical
             stocking-glove numbness or paresthesias beginning after neurotoxic chemotherapy.

          -  Self-reported average neuropathic pain score of at least 4 on a 10-point scale over
             the past 1 month.

          -  Age â‰¥ 18 years

          -  Concomitant use of analgesics is permitted if the dose has been stable for at least 2
             weeks prior to study enrollment (no new analgesics have been added, discontinued, or
             changed in the 2 weeks prior to randomization).

          -  Must be able to understand and communicate proficiently in English.

          -  Written informed consent obtained from subject and ability for subject to comply with
             the requirements of the study.

          -  Syphilis, alcoholic neuropathy, diabetic neuropathy, neurological disorders, brain
             injury, or stroke, as assessed by the treating physician.

          -  Medical history of neuropathy from any type of nerve compression (e.g., carpal tunnel
             or tarsal tunnel syndrome, radiculopathy, spinal stenosis, brachial plexopathy,
             leptomeningeal carcinomatosis), as assessed by the treating physician.

          -  Neuropathy related to abnormal thyroid stimulating hormone or cobalamin levels as
             assessed by treating physician.

          -  Current severe depression, suicidal ideation, bipolar disease, alcohol abuse, or major
             eating disorder, as assessed by the treating physician.

          -  Currently participating in another chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy targeted
             program or trial.
