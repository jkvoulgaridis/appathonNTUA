      The primary objective of the study aims to compare the effect of high-dose intravenous
      vitamin C vs. placebo on a composite of death or persistent organ dysfunction - defined as
      continued dependency on mechanical ventilation, new renal replacement therapy, or
      vasopressors - assessed at 28 days on intensive care unit (ICU) patients.

      As secondary objectives, the study aims:

        -  To compare the effect of high-dose intravenous vitamin C vs. placebo on:

             1. 6-month mortality;

             2. 6-month HRQoL;

             3. organ function (days 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 10, 14, and 28 if in ICU);

             4. global tissue dysoxia (at baseline);

             5. oxygenation Index (FiO2 x Mean Airway Pressure/PaO2) (days 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 10, 14,
                and 28 if in ICU, and if still intubated);

             6. occurrence of stage 3 acute kidney injury as defined by KDIGO (Kidney Disease:
                Improving Global Outcomes) criteria20;

             7. acute hemolysis as defined by:

                  -  clinician judgment of hemolysis, as recorded in the chart, or

                  -  hemoglobin drop of at least 25 g/L within 24 hours of a dose of
                     investigational product PLUS 2 of the following:

                       -  reticulocyte count &gt;2 times upper limit of normal at clinical site lab;

                       -  haptoglobin &lt; lower limit of normal at clinical site lab;

                       -  indirect (unconjugated) bilirubin &gt;2 times upper limit of normal at

                - hemoglobin &lt; 75 g/L AND at least 2 of the above criteria AND requires 2 units of
                packed red blood cells;

             8. hypoglycemia as defined as core lab-validated glucose levels of less than &lt; 3.8
                mmol/L.

        -  To assess baseline vitamin C levels in study participants (before the first dose of
           investigational product).

    <textblock>
      Treatment options for sepsis complicated by ARDS are limited to antimicrobials and supportive
      care (intravenous fluids, vasopressors, mechanical ventilation and renal replacement
      therapy). Recent preliminary evidence suggests that intravenous vitamin C may be the first
      therapy to mitigate the dysregulated cascade of events transforming an infection into sepsis.
      However, definitive practice changing evidence requires a large trial powered to detect a
      plausible, modest, and clinically important difference in mortality.

      The study LOVIT will be conducted simultaneously in Canada (country of coordination), France,
      the United States of America, the United Kingdom and Australia/New Zealand.The data from each
      country will be merged with the aim of reaching 4,000 patients globally (roughly 800 patients
      per country). Thus, in the context of increasing off‐label use of vitamin C for sepsis and
      ongoing trials of vitamin C bundled with other pharmacological interventions, this study will
      constitute a rigorous assessment of the effect of vitamin C monotherapy on patient‐important
      outcomes. Moreover, the French LOVIT-ARDS, part of LOVIT, will provide additional information
      on the specific subgroup of patients with sepsis and ARDS.

      This is a prospective multicentric randomized controlled trial. Web-based randomization
      system available 24/7. Eligible patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to vitamin C or
      matching placebo. The study will use permuted blocks of undisclosed and variable size and
      stratify randomization by site.

      The study will enroll a total of at least 770 patients. Sites are expected to enroll at least
      1or 2 patients per month. By enrolling 385 evaluable patients per arm, the study will have
      80% power to detect a 10% absolute risk reduction (from 50% to 40%, which corresponds to a
      20% relative risk reduction).

      Follow-up in the study for each patient: daily during ICU stay and telephone follow-up at 6
      months.

    <description>Quality of life of patients will be assessed by the questionnaire EQ-5D-5L.
The questionnaire EQ-5D-5L essentially consists of 2 pages:
- page1: the EQ-5D-5L descriptive system:
The descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box (1-digit number) next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions.
- page 2: the EQ visual analogue scale (VAS): the EQ VAS records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale.
The 2 parts of the questionnaire can not be assessed seperately.</description>
