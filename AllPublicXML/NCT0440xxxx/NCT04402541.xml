      This is a multicenter, open-label Phase 1 study of orally administered CB-5339 in
      participants with R/R AML or participants with R/R intermediate- to high-risk MDS. The study
      will include two parts:1) a Dose Escalation phase in participants with R/R AML, or R/R
      intermediate- to high-risk MDS and 2) a Dose Expansion phase in participants with R/R AML for
      whom there is no standard of care therapy available that is likely to lead to disease
      remission. Additional cohorts for participants with R/R intermediate- to high-risk MDS
      following hypomethylating agents or other AML cohorts may be added at a later time.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female and ≥ 18 years of age at the time of signing the consent form

          2. One of the following advanced hematologic malignancies including:

               -  Relapsed or refractory AML as defined by 2016 WHO criteria and are not candidates
                  for curative therapies such as allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant or for
                  whom there is no standard of care therapy available that is likely to lead to
                  disease remission according the investigator

               -  MDS high-very high risk by the revised international scoring system for
                  evaluating prognosis in myelodysplastic syndromes that is recurrent or refractory
                  or the participant is intolerant to established therapy known to provide clinical
                  benefit for their condition (e.g., relapsed following treatment with
                  hypomethylating agent or lack of response after &gt; 4 cycles), according to
                  treating physician. Potential participants who meet the criteria for intermediate
                  risk may be considered with approval by the medical monitor if the participant
                  has severe cytopenia(s) and/or elevated bone marrow blast counts.

          3. Adequate organ function defined as:

               -  Serum creatinine ≤1.5 mg/dL or an estimated glomerular filtration rate of ≥60

               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × the upper limit of normal (ULN) unless considered due to
                  Gilbert's disease or leukemic disease

               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤3 × the ULN; alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤3
                  × the ULN. Levels of AST and/or ALT ≤5 × the ULN may be acceptable for
                  participants with known leukemic involvement of the liver after discussion with
                  the study medical monitor

          4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤2.

          5. Contraceptive use by men or women should be consistent with local regulations
             regarding the methods of contraception for those participating in clinical studies. If
             of childbearing potential, agree to use an effective barrier method of birth control
             (i.e., latex condom, diaphragm, cervical cap, etc.) to avoid pregnancy during the
             study and 90 days after the last dose of CB-5339. Female participants of childbearing
             potential need a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 7 days of study
             enrollment. Non-childbearing is defined as ≥ 1 year postmenopausal or surgically
             sterilized

          2. Participants with clinical symptoms suggestive of active central nervous system (CNS)
             leukemia or known CNS leukemia. Evaluation of cerebrospinal fluid is only required if
             there is a clinical suspicion of CNS involvement by leukemia during screening.

          3. Participants with immediately life-threatening, severe complications of leukemia such
             as uncontrolled bleeding, pneumonia with hypoxia or shock, and/or disseminated

             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or CB-5339
             administration, may interfere with the informed consent process and/or with compliance
             with the requirements of the study, may interfere with the interpretation of the study
             results and, in the Investigator's opinion, or would make the participant
             inappropriate for entry into this study
