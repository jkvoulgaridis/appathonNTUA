  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ebola virus is one of the most dangerous human pathogens and is an emerging public health
      problem in sub-Saharan Africa. Ebola virus disease (EVD) first appeared in 1976. The current
      epidemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is one of the largest and most complex
      ever recorded, and is not yet under control: a new death has been reported on April 10th,
      2020. The epidemic was declared a public health emergency of international scope by the World
      Health Organization (WHO) on July 17th, 2019.

      Two studies are the &quot;standard&quot; in the assessment of the consequences of infection in
      survivors, in Liberia (PREVAIL) and Guinea (PostEbogui), especially in:

        -  The observation of comparable mortality rates, even if over time there was an
           improvement in survival, probably linked to the improvement in the quality of care and
           symptomatic treatment;

        -  And the study of the contacts of the survivors, between 4 to 10% of them had done
           seroconversion with regard to EBOV in an asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic way and that
           this rate varied according to the degree of exposure to the risk.

      The DRC's experience in this area and the enormous progress made in the fight against Viral
      hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs), therapeutically and preventively (where much of which patients
      have benefited from antiviral treatment or monoclonal antibodies), the technological
      responses (real-time sequencing of Ebola strains in new cases, vaccination or the use of
      individual isolation units), show the limits of their effectiveness. A large number of
      questions therefore remain unanswered:

        -  The antibody profile of the survivors, in particular the repertoire of IgG specific to
           these individuals and its correlation with survival and its evolution over time;

        -  The impact of treatments initiated during the acute phase on these immune abnormalities;

        -  Finally, genetic factors linked to the host could play an important role in the response
           to the Ebola virus.

      The aim of this study is to provide a better overall understanding of Ebola virus infection
      and its clinical, virological, and immunological consequences, of cured people and their
      contacts; strengthen multidisciplinary monitoring of patients after an acute phase of EVD.
      The results will therefore have a direct impact on the clinical management of this population
      and on the prevention of possible secondary contamination in the Democratic Republic of the
      Congo.
