  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      All diagnostic procedures of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in the diabetic foot (DF) are
      limited due to diabetes mellitus and its late complications. The aim of our study is to
      refine the diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) by a new transcutaneous oximetry
      (TcPO2) stimulation test (a modified Ratschow test) in patients with diabetic foot.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with diabetic foot and mild to moderate PAD (WIfI - Ischemia 1 or 2) with baseline
      TcPO2 values 30-50 mmHg will be included into the study. TcPO2 will be measured on the feet
      in different angiosomes. During this measurement a stimulation test consisting of a modified
      Ratschow test involving 2 minutes of exercise will be conducted. Specific TcPO2 parameters
      will be assessed during the whole procedure (resting TcPO2 before stimulation test, minimal
      TcPO2, delta TcPO2 (minimum TcPo2 minus resting TcPO2) percentage decrease of TcPO2 during
      the stimulation test and TcPO2 recovery time (time to the adjustment of TcPO2 to the resting
      values).

      All TcPO2 parameters detected during TcPO2 stimulation test will be correlated with
      parameters of macrocirculation (systolic blood pressures (SBP) on tibial arteries and their
      Ankle-Brachial Indexes (ABI), toe pressures (TP) and toe-brachial indexesTBI) and DUS
      findings (monophasic/triphasic flow in relevant artery supplying measured angiosome)

    <description>During measurement of TcPO2 in various angiosomes the stimulation test will be performed. We modify the Ratschow test (elevation of the lower limbs, rhythmic flexion and extension in talocrural joints for 2 minutes, then return to horizontal position). TcPO2 is measured continuously. Depending on the type of detected flows by DUS in the evaluated arteries supplying the relevant angiosome, in which TcPO2 values are measured, the patients and their angiosomes will be divided into 2 baseline groups - group M with monophasic flows or arterial obliterations and group T with triphasic flows.
We will compare macrocirculation parameters-systolic pressure on dorsalis pedis artery (DPA), posterior tibial artery (PTA) and their doppler indexes. The resting TcPO2, the minimal TcPO2 found during the stimulation test, their delta (resting TcPO2 - minimal TcPO2) and the percentage decrease in TcPO2 will be compared between the study groups, as well as the duration of TcPO2 recovery.</description>
