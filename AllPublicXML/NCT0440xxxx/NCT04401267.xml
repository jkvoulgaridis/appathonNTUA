  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized unblinded Phase II clinical trial evaluating the impact of intensive
      antihypertensive control (targeted to the 50-75th percentile for age, sex, and height)
      compared to conventional antihypertensive control (targeted to the 90-95th percentile for
      age, sex, and height) on the incidence of radiographically extensive osteonecrosis in
      children and young adults receiving treatment for newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic
      leukemia/lymphoma (ALL).

      Primary Objective

        -  Compare the frequency of radiographically extensive osteonecrosis in patients receiving
           intensive compared to conventional antihypertensive therapy.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  Evaluate the efficacy of intensive antihypertensive control compared to conventional
           antihypertensive control in the prevention of clinically significant (CTCAE Grade 2 or
           higher) and radiologically extensive osteonecrosis, overall and stratified by joints.

        -  Compare the frequency of clinically significant and radiographically extensive
           osteonecrosis in patients receiving antihypertensive therapy and historical controls.

        -  Compare blood pressures achieved in intensive and conventional arms using both pressures
           obtained as part of routine patient care and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring.

        -  Compare levels of vascular dysfunction as measured physiologically, radiographically,
           and in blood samples in patients receiving intensive compared to standard
           antihypertensive therapy.

      Exploratory Objectives

        -  Identify predictive patterns of blood biomarkers which identify patients at high- risk
           of developing clinically significant osteonecrosis.

        -  Identify MRI findings during late induction which correlate with osteonecrosis lesions
           seen during reinduction.

        -  Identify patterns of diurnal blood pressure variation as measured by ambulatory blood
           pressure monitoring associated with the later development of osteonecrosis.

        -  Compare induction blood pressure control and intervention arm to echocardiographic
           changes at reinduction II.

        -  Evaluate patient-reported, health-related quality of life in patients during induction
           and after 1.5 years of therapy when many experience the symptoms of osteonecrosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patient randomization will be stratified based on patient's location (Memphis vs. other), use
      of antihypertensives prior to randomization, and factors known to influence osteonecrosis
      risk, specifically sex and self-declared race (non-Hispanic white vs. other). A target
      systolic blood pressure range will be chosen for each participant based on their
      randomization arm, age, sex, and height.

      Patients will be randomized on day 4 of induction therapy to either conventional or intensive
      blood pressure goals. Patients will be treated with the long- acting antihypertensive
      lisinopril to achieve blood pressure control as indicated by their randomized arm.
      Long-acting therapy will be adjusted every 3-4 days as needed to achieve targeted control
      based on the median of blood pressures obtained in that period. Treatment of hypertension to
      the target will continue until the completion of reinduction II therapy. Patients will be
      evaluated for osteonecrosis as indicated in their primary therapeutic protocol using MRI
      during reinduction II.

      Patients will be asked to complete a symptom survey and a semi-structured interview.
