    <textblock>
      MIRRORS &quot;Minimally Invasive Robotic Surgery, Role in Optimal Debulking Ovarian Cancer,
      Recovery &amp; Survival&quot; is a new United Kingdom based prospective feasibility study the purpose
      of which is to establish the feasibility of launching a British multicentre randomised
      control trial of Robotic interval debulking surgery for ovarian cancer (including cancer of
      the fallopian tube &amp; peritoneum) in the future. This initial feasibility study will focus on
      the ability to recruit patients, acceptability, quality of life, the rate at which it is
      possible to remove all visible tumour and the rate of conversion to open surgery. Ultimately
      the investigators would like to determine whether, in selected patients, robotic surgery
      offers improved quality of life and recovery with equivalent overall and progression free
      survival.

      The study will be offered to all adult women with ovarian cancer (which includes cancer of
      the fallopian tube &amp; peritoneum) who have had chemotherapy prior to surgery. Women will be
      identified through our multi-disciplinary team meeting. A Pelvic Mass &gt;8cm and extensive
      disease requiring liver / upper Gastro-intestinal surgical support will exclude patients if
      an open surgical approach is necessary. Robotic surgery is unlikely to be suitable in all
      cases of ovarian cancer, particularly those with large pelvic masses or extensive disease
      around the upper part of the abdomen, however, it has the potential to provide significant
      recovery and quality of life benefits to a selected group of patients.

      MIRRORS - ICG &quot;Peritoneal angiography / perfusion assessment using Indocyanine green (ICG) in
      patients with advanced ovarian cancers&quot; is a ancillary study within MIRRORS. Using ICG dye,
      the investigators aim to observe whether there are any changes in the blood vessel pattern
      associated with the tumour deposits the investigators remove that makes them distinctive. The
      ICG will not be used to guide where biopsies are taken or tissue is removed. Participation in
      this ancillary research is not required for participation in the trial.

      Hypothesis: in selected cases of ovarian cancer, following neoadjuvant chemotherapy,
      minimally invasive robotic surgery provides maximal debulking surgery and improved patient
      outcomes.

      Null Hypothesis: Robotic surgery is not suitable for the treatment of ovarian cancer
      following neoadjuvant chemotherapy. It is not possible to achieve maximal debulking surgery
      and patient outcomes are not improved.

      To assess the feasibility of obtaining consent from women and acceptability of Robotic
      interval debulking surgery for advanced ovarian cancer. Women deemed suitable for interval
      debulking surgery will be identified through the Gynaecological Oncology multidisciplinary
      team meeting. The aim is to recruit women over a period of 1 year aiming for a total of 20
      women who undergo Minimally Invasive Robotic Interval debulking surgery for advanced ovarian
      cancer. The main outcomes are feasibility of the recruitment process and acceptability of the
      questionnaires and numeric rating pain scale (NRS11) as assessed by completion rate and
      patient interviews.

      In order to be able to offer MIRRORS to as many patients as possible the investigators have
      kept the inclusion criteria wide, not restricting by Body Mass Index (BMI) or patient
      comorbidities. The study will be offered to all adult women with ovarian cancer (including
      fallopian tube and peritoneal cancer) who have been identified through our multi-disciplinary
      team meeting as being suitable for interval debulking surgery after 3 cycles of chemotherapy.
      A Pelvic Mass &gt;8cm and extensive disease which would require liver, upper Gastro-intestinal
      or other surgical support will exclude patients if an open surgical approach is deemed
      necessary.

      MIRRORS ICG will have the same inclusion criteria as MIRRORS with patients only being
      excluded if they have an allergy to Indocyanine green (ICG), Iodine, suffer from
      hyperthyroidism or have poor renal function with an estimated Glomerular filtration rate
      (GFR)&lt; 55ml/min.

    <description>Surgery will commence with an initial assessment with a camera inserted though the belly button. This visual assessment will be used to determine whether it is feasible to proceed with surgery robotically or whether full debulking surgery to zero macroscopic residual disease would be best carried out through an open surgical approach. If an open surgical approach is considered the optimum treatment for the patient and they have consented for this, then this will be done. If there is disease that cannot be removed Robotically after starting by this route, but can be removed via an open incision the surgery will be converted to an open procedure if it is safe to do so. If there are any complications, we may also need to convert to open surgery. The aim of the surgery whether by robotic or open is to remove all visible disease safely.</description>
