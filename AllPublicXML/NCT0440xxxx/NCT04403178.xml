  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with cerebral palsy have an increased risk of hip dislocation, which is a painful
      and severe complication of cerebral palsy. The 20-years evaluation of the Swedish
      surveillance programme shows that hip dislocation in children with cerebral palsy can be
      prevented with regular clinical and radiographic examination and early intervention.

      We would like to determine the individual risk for hip displacement for Danish children with
      CP in The Danish Cerebral Palsy Follow-up Program. This could be a valuable clinical tool in
      deciding on further follow-up and treatment.

      Migration percentage (MP) which is measured from the pelvis radiograph is commonly used to
      assess lateral displacement of the femoral head and is being used in the Swedish and in the
      Danish surveillance programme. Most children with an MP &gt; 40 % need surgery to prevent
      further displacement and prevent dislocation of the hip. In the Swedish surveillance
      programme they have developed the Cerebral Palsy Follow-Up Programme (CPUP) hip score as a
      risk score to determine which children are at high or low risk for hip displacement (MP &gt; 40
      %) within five years after first radiographic examination.

      The aim of this study is to predict the likelihood that a child with cerebral palsy will
      develop hip displacement (MI&gt; 40) within three years. The design is a prediction study.

      Data will be obtained from the national clinical quality database the Danish Cerebral Palsy
      Follow-up Program and the Danish National Patient Register.
