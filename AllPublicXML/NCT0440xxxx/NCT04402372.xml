      The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the novel bidirectional
      cannula (BiflowTM, LivaNova, Italy) with specific design to ensure stable distal perfusion
      compared to conventional cannula with downstream line in patients undergoing femoral arterial
      cannulation for cardiopulmonary bypass during minimally invasive surgery

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The femoral artery is a common site for peripheral cannulation in patients requiring
      cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) for minimally invasive cardiac surgical procedures (MICS), redo
      cardiac surgical procedures, and procedures involving the thoracic aorta Limb ischemia is the
      most common acute and late vascular complication and has been reported in 10% to 70% of
      patients Traditional methods to maintain distal perfusion include the use of a downstream
      cannula or sewing on a side graft, but these techniques are cumbersome, time-consuming, and
      require additional equipment As a result, current practice is relying on the very small
      volume of blood that will flow around the cannula and collateral circulation to keep the leg
      viable, but by the time ischemia is clinically evident, irreversible cell damage may have
      already occurred The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the novel
      bidirectional cannula (BiflowTM, LivaNova, Italy) with specific design to ensure stable
      distal perfusion compared to conventional cannula with downstream line in patients undergoing
      femoral arterial cannulation for CPB during MICS
