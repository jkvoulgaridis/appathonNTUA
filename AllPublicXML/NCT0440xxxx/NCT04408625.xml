    <textblock>
      Study PRV-FTD101 is a Phase 1/2, multi-center, open-label ascending dose, first-in-human
      study that will evaluate the safety and effect of intra-cisternal PR006 administration on
      progranulin protein (PGRN) levels in patients with frontotemporal dementia with progranulin
      mutations (FTD-GRN). Three escalating dose (low dose, medium dose and high dose) cohorts are
      planned. The duration of the study is 5 years. During the first year, patients with be
      evaluated for the effect of PR006 on safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, biomarkers, and
      efficacy. Patients will follow up for an additional 4 years to monitor safety and changes on
      selected biomarkers and clinical outcomes.

             dosing.

          -  Carrier of a pathogenic GRN (progranulin gene) mutation.
