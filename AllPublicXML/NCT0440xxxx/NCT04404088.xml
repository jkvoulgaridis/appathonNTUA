    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well acalabrutinib, lenalidomide, and rituximab work in
      treating patients with CD20 positive stage III-IV, grade 1-3a follicular lymphoma.
      Acalabrutinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for
      cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as lenalidomide, work in different ways to stop
      the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by
      stopping them from spreading. Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody that may interfere with the
      ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Giving acalabrutinib, lenalidomide, and rituximab
      may help to control the disease.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the efficacy of acalabrutinib combined with rituximab and lenalidomide in
      patients with previously untreated follicular lymphoma (FL) (determined by complete remission
      [CR] rate by the end of treatment).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the efficacy of acalabrutinib combined with rituximab and lenalidomide in
      subjects with FL as assessed by objective response rate (ORR) at the end of treatment,
      duration of response (DOR), progression rate within 24 months from treatment initiation
      (progression-free survival [PFS] 24), PFS and overall survival (OS).

      II. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of acalabrutinib combined with rituximab and
      lenalidomide in previously untreated subjects with FL.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the pharmacodynamic effects and investigate biomarkers of response and
      resistance of the 3-drug combination.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive acalabrutinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Beginning cycle 2,
      patients receive lenalidomide PO once daily (QD) on days 1-21 and rituximab intravenously
      (IV) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of cycle 2 and day 1 of subsequent cycles. Treatment repeats
      every 28 days for 13 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year and
      then every 6 months for 2 years.
