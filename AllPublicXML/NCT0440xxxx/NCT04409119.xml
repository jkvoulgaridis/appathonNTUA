  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will investigate the feasibility of using direct HIS pacing or left bundle branch
      pacing (LBB pacing) as an alternative to biventricular pacing in patients with symptomatic
      heart failure and an ECG with a typical left bundle branch block pattern.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Biventricular pacing has for more than a decade been standard of care for patients with
      HFrEF, LVEF &lt; 35%, NYHA II-IV despite optimal medical treatment and an ECG with left bundle
      branch block (LBBB). However, it is not always ideal because of several drawbacks such as
      phrenic nerve capture, inability to reach late activated areas and many more. Direct HIS
      pacing can in many cases capture the left bundle and provide normal electrical activation of
      the left ventricle but sometimes with high pacing thresholds. Recently direct left bundle
      branch pacing has shown promise with synchronous activation of the left ventricle at low
      pacing thresholds.

      In the present study we randomize 50 patients in one center to either conventional CRT or
      HIS/LBB pacing in a 1:1 single-blind design. In the HIS/LBB arm, direct HIS-pacing is
      attempted first but if its not possible or the pacing threshold for capturing the left bundle
      branch is &gt; 2.5 V at 1 ms we switch to placing a LBB-lead.

If it is not possible to find and pace HIS, to correct the LBBB or the threshold for correcting the LBBB is &gt; 2.5 V at 1 ms, implantation of a LBB-pacing lead is attempted instead. If that is not possible either, a left ventricular (LV) lead is implanted.</description>

    <description>In this arm an RV-lead or ICD-lead is placed first and then implantation of a LV-pacing lead is attempted. If this is not possible due to anatomical difficulties (no coronary sinus (CS) access, no available branches other than v cordis anterior or v cordis media) or electrical difficulties (no capture below 4 V at 1.0 msec or phrenic nerve stimulation &lt; 2x pacing threshold), implantation of a HIS-pacing lead is attempted instead. If that is not possible or the threshold for correcting the LBBB is &gt; 2.5 V at 1 ms, implantation of a LBB-pacing lead is attempted instead.</description>
