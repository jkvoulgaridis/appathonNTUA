  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CTG was harvested from 21 patients in each group. Donor site was treated with either GS
      (control) or GS+CY (test). Palatal tissue thickness, graft dimensions, working time (WT) and
      primary bleeding time were recorded intraoperatively. Patients recorded the quantity of
      analgesics (QA) taken, presence of secondary bleeding (SB) and pain perception (PP) daily for
      first postoperative week. Sensation loss (SL), color match (CM), epithelization level (EL)
      were evaluated at days 7, 14, 21 and 28.

    <masking_description>One author (H.G.K.) randomly assigned the patients, with 1:1 allocation ratio, into GS and GS+CY groups by making simple randomization without blocking (computer-generated randomization scheme) (Figure 1). Number-labeled opaque envelopes containing the name of assigned method were used for allocation concealment. The surgical procedures were carried out by (B.T.Y.) whereas another author (E.C.) acquired the intra- and post-operative data. No information regarding to the applied hemostatic was given to the patients to preserve the patient blinding.</masking_description>

    <description>After local anesthesia (2% articaine HCl with epinephrine 1:100,000) administration, palatal thickness was measured by perpendicularly inserting a Michigan-O periodontal probe from the corners of the rectangular donor area and mean value was recorded as 'palatal tissue thickness (PTT)'. Epithelialized gingival graft was harvested with the method described by Zucchelli et al.19 After a rectangular shaped initial incision, graft with 1-1.5 mm thickness was harvested approximately 1.5 to 3 mm away from gingival margins of upper teeth. After harvesting, excess fatty tissues were removed and de-epithelialization was performed to obtain DGG. Donor site was closed either with GS (Spongostan®, Ethicon, Somerville, USA)</description>
