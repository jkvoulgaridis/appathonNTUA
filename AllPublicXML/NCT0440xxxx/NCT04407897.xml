  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The SOFT study will evaluate the feasibility and safety of MR-guided stereotactic ablative
      radiotherapy (SABR) for infra-diaphragmatic soft tissue metastases.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators wish to evaluate the safety and feasibility of MR-guided stereotactic
      radiation to patients with infra-diaphragmatic oligometastatic disease including quality of
      life assessments and patient-reported outcome measures. Further, the investigators assess
      clinical response among patients with oligometastatic disease (OMD), defined as up to five
      metastases in up to three different organs.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histology or cytology proven non-haematological cancer.

          -  At least one metastasis should be localized in the infra-diaphragmatic soft tissue.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale of performance status ≤ 2.

          -  ≥ 18 years old.

          -  Life expectancy &gt; 6 months.

          -  Target diameter (GTV) ≤ 5 cm.

          -  Metastatic lesions must be visible, imaging defined targets and suitable for treatment
             with SABR.

          -  In case of de novo OMD and oligometastatic recurrence a maximum of 5 targets
             (including the primary tumour) in a maximum of 3 organ sites are allowed.

          -  In case of oligoprogressive disease (OPD) * and induced OMD ** only 3 metastases
             (including the primary tumour) are allowed.

          -  All metastatic sites are treated or planned for ablative therapy (including surgery).
             For OPD, only the sites in progression is required to fulfil this criterion.

          -  A baseline scan within 28 days of inclusion (PET-CT or CT and MR scanning).

          -  No curative intended treatment option available.

          -  An ablative strategy should be deemed clinically relevant and it is at the discretion
             of the treating physician to decide.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

          -  If the target is in the liver, a Child-Pugh Score A is required.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient cannot tolerate physical set up required for SABR.

          -  Active bowel obstruction.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness.

          -  Medical contraindication to undergoing MR-imaging.

          -  Pregnancy.

          -  Patients with uncontrolled brain metastases.

          -  Uncontrolled disease in respect to malignant pleural effusion, ascites, lymphangitic
             carcinomatosis, pleural carcinomatosis or peritoneal carcinomatosis.

          -  If the patient has received previous radiotherapy, the combined dose at the radiation
             site must not exceed the dose constraints.
