  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to date, no approved medications are available for the treatment of methamphetamine
      addiction. Recently, N-acetylcysteine is recently being studied for methamphetamine
      withdrawal.

      N-acetylcysteine, is a drug that has been long used as a mucolytic. Recent studies
      investigate the use of N-acetylcysteine in cocaine and withdrawal symptoms by its effect on
      restoring glutamate homeostasis in nucleus accumbens. Up to date, there has been 2 pilot
      study investigating the efficacy of N-acetylcysteine for methamphetamine dependence.

      The present study is aimed to confirm the efficacy and safety of N-acetylcysteine in the
      treatment of methamphetamine withdrawal symptoms.

    <textblock>
      Methamphetamine is a stimulant commonly abused worldwide. Methamphetamine can produce a rapid
      pleasurable rush caused by release of dopamine, nor-ephinephrine and serotonin. It produces
      euphoria, a heightened level of alertness and increased level of alertness and increased
      energy. Long-term regular meth use can lead to severe tooth decay, infection, weight loss,
      malnutrition, kidney damage, liver damage, respiratory issues, paranoia, violent behaviour,
      psychosis, severe anxiety and depression.

      Studies suggested that withdrawal symptoms in methamphetamine dependent patients were due to
      the state of hypodopaminergic activities.

      Up to date, no approved medications are available for the treatment of methamphetamine
      addiction. Recently, N-acetylcysteine is recently being studied for methamphetamine
      withdrawal.
