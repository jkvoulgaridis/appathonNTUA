      This is a prospective, single-arm, multi-center clinical study of pyrotinib in combination
      With letrozole in patients With HER2-Positive, ER-Positive metastatic breast cancer. Our aim
      was to explore the efficacy and safety of pyrotinib combined with letrozole in patients with
      HER2-positive, ER-positive metastatic breast cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ER+/HER2+ metastatic breast cancer is a special subtype of HER2+ breast cancer. General
      guidelines recommend chemotherapy combined with HER2-targeted therapy for this subtype of
      patients. However, for the highly selected patients with ER- positive/HER2-positive ABC, ET +
      anti-HER2 therapy could be chosen as first-line therapy. And Pyrotinib is an oral tyrosine
      kinase inhibitor targeting both HER-1 and HER-2 receptors. Therefore this study is planned to
      enroll 86 patients with HER2-positive, ER-positive metastatic breast cancer receiving
      first-line treatment with pyrotinib and letrozole. The main purpose was to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of pyrotinib combined with letrozole in patients with HER2-positive,
      ER-positive metastatic breast cancer.
