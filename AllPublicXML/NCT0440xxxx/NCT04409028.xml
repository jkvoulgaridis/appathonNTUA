  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to evaluate the impacts of coronal restorations of endodontic treated
      posterior teeth (ETPT) on the satisfaction and quality of patient's life. The patients who
      were chosen for this purpose were asked to fill in 3 questionnaires.Electronic charts and
      files of patients who received endodontic treatment in our faculty between 2018 and 2020 were
      reviewed and chosen. The patients included in the study had been treated by the same
      endodontist and restorative dental specialist. The coronal restoration of the ETPT had to be
      either direct composite restoration (DCR) or indirect ceramic restoration (ICR). When the
      data of patient files and database systems were combined, 76 patients were deemed fit for
      this study. The patients were contacted by phone to request participation in the study. A
      rendezvous was created for the patients who agreed to get involved in the study, and those
      who came to the appointment filled in the questionnaires. Demographics, the semantic
      differential scale, and the OHIP-14 scores provided data that were entered into Minitab 18
      software.

      This cross-sectional clinical study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Istanbul Okan
      University and conducted both at its Endodontics and Restorative Departments of Dentistry
      Faculty. A query of the Nucleus database (a patient management software) was performed to
      identify dental charts of patients who received endodontic treatment between December 2018
      and January 2020. We searched only for primary endodontic treatment of vital tooth codes, and
      then selected the same endodontic specialists' patients. A total of 400 teeth were identified
      for screening. Next, a specified restorative dentistry specialist's patient searched within
      these patients, and 150 patients were obtained. The study was completed with 68 participants
      (n=34 each). Then data and radiographs of patients were checked out for the eligibility
      criteria.
