  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of camrelizumab given
      concomitantly with chemoradiation in participants with unresectable, locally advanced head
      and neck squamous cell carcinoma (LA-HNSCC). All participants will receive camrelizumab in
      addition to chemoradiation, the standard treatment for LA-HNSCC.
