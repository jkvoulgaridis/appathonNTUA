  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this additional part of the study is to test whether the study drug,
      nivolumab, is a safe treatment that will prevent participants' primary central nervous system
      lymphoma (PCNSL) from growing again (recurrence). Participants will be people with PCNSL who
      continue to have cell free tumor DNA (cfDNA) in their CSF despite completion of their first
      treatment (first-line treatment).

    <description>All patients will undergo cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood collection as well as MRI imaging as standard of care prior to (- 21 days) first-line treatment initiation, during first-line therapy (before initiation of the 5th methotrexate dose (+/- 7 days)), at completion of first-line chemotherapy therapy (+/- 7 days) as well as 60, 180, and 360 days after enrollment into maintenance or observation (+/- 7 days). Those patients with persistent cfDNA in the CSF after completion of first-line chemotherapy and either complete or partial response on imaging will be enrolled into the nivolumab maintenance treatment arm. All other patients (no persistent cfDNA in the CSF and either complete or partial response on imaging) are followed with observation. Patients who do not respond to first-line therapy are not eligible for nivolumab maintenance and will no longer be followed in the biospecimen and clinical data collection cohort.</description>
