  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Efforts to examine the utility of alternate modalities for genetic results disclosure has
      widespread implications for how precision medicine research might yield direct health
      benefits for study participants. This study will examine the efficacy of an online
      self-guided program to return genetic results to a racial minority cohort population. Study
      results will provide empirical evidence on the effectiveness of alternate modalities for
      genetic results return, inform ongoing efforts to establish scalable approaches for effective
      return of genetic research results, and increase access to personal health information among
      African American women.

      This study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) within the Black Women's Health Study
      (BWHS) to test alternate communication modalities for results disclosure. The BWHS is an
      ongoing prospective cohort study of 59,000 self-identified black women from across the United
      States who have been followed since 1995. Targeted sequencing of over 4000 women within the
      cohort for BRCA1/2 and other known or suspected high and moderate penetrance genes opens up
      the possibility of returning breast cancer genetic results to BWHS participants and examining
      the clinical utility of genetic results return. The primary aim of the proposed research
      project is to compare the efficacy of two communication modalities for returning breast
      cancer genetic research results to African American women: 1) a conventional modality that
      entails telephone disclosure by a licensed genetic counselor, and 2) an online self-guided
      modality that entails returning results directly to participants, with optional genetic
      counselor follow-up via telephone. Secondary aims of this study will examine 1) moderators of
      the intervention impact and 2) psychosocial, sociodemographic, and clinical predictors of
      result uptake. This study is uniquely situated to provide critical empirical evidence on the
      effectiveness of alternate models for genetic results return and provide further insight into
      the factors influencing uptake of genetic information among African American women.
