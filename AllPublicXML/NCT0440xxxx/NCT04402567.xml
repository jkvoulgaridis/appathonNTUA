      Introduction:

      Currently, Rugby is a sport that is giving priority to the well-being of the player. Players
      are subjected to high training and match loads exposing them to constant stress that can lead
      to overload injuries in addition to frequent contact injuries. Despite knowing what the
      situation is like at the international and national level, the &quot;Unión Argentina de Rugby&quot;
      lacks conclusive epidemiological data.

      Our main purpose was to describe the prevalence, incidence and injury load suffered in male
      amateur rugby players from Argentina during a competitive season in 2019.

      Design:

      Observational, descriptive, retrospective and multicenter study.

      Participants:

      250 male amateur rugby players belonging to three clubs from three rugby unions (Buenos
      Aires, Córdoba and Rosario) of Argentina.

      Methods:

      Registration methods were applied according to the consensus of the World Rugby by a single
      observer per center. Injuries occurred in players from top rosters of 3 amateur rugby clubs
      (data collection centers) as well as the number of matches and hours of training were
      recorded. Medical diagnoses were classified under the rules of the OSIICS classification
      system. The incidence (injuries / 1000 hours-game-player), prevalences (point and period),
      the severity (days of absence) and the injury load will be calculated as well as the
      location, type, nature. This study followed the guidelines of the STROBE-SIIS Initiative
      Declaration.
