  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hand osteoarthritis (OA) is a prevalent joint disorder characterized by pain, stiffness, and
      bony enlargements/swellings of multiple joints, in particular distal interphalangeal (DIP),
      proximal interphalangeal (PIP) and first carpometacarpal (CMC) joints. Symptomatic hand OA is
      estimated to affecting 15.9% of women and 8.2% of men in the general population with a
      variable disease course, occurring more frequently in the elderly. Many factors including
      age, gender, obesity, genetic predisposition, joint deformity, joint hypermobility, and
      trauma are implicated in the development of hand OA. In addition to pain and stiffness,
      patients with hand OA often suffer from the reduced grip and pinch strength, decreased range
      of motion in involved and noninvolved joints, and difficulty performing dexterous tasks,
      resulting in disability in activities of daily living and considerable frustration.

      At present, no therapies can completely cure hand OA and few therapeutic options with proven
      effectiveness for hand OA exist. Diclofenac sodium gel (DSG) is one of the commonly used
      topical NSAIDs, which can provide local pain relief for patients with hand OA with reduced
      systemic exposure, potentially reducing the risk of adverse events (AE). Acupuncture is
      effective in a host of pain-related conditions, ranging from low back pain, neck pain,
      shoulder pain, migraine to pain from knee OA. The research on the effects of acupuncture in
      people with hand OA is very limited.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the clinical effectiveness of 4-week
      electroacupuncture(EA) compared to topical DSG in the treatment of hand OA. Our primary
      hypothesis was that EA would result in a greater pain relief improvement in hand OA compared
      with topical DSG.

    <description>We will apply Ashi points, Ex-UE9, SI3, and TE5. Sterile needles (0.3mm× 40mm) and SDZ-V EA apparatus will be utilized. Acupuncturists will insert needles perpendicularly into Ashi points for approximately 2-3mm until they pierce into the bone surface; acupuncturists will insert needles horizontally into Baxie points towards the wrist with a depth of 5-10mm; and acupuncturists will insert needles perpendicularly into SI3 and TE5 for approximately 5-10mm. All needles except Ashi points will be manually manipulated to achieve De qi. The needles at Baxie 1 and Baxie 4 will be connected using alligator clips from the EA apparatus. The electrical stimulation will last for 30 minutes with a continuous wave of 10 Hz and a fixed current intensity of 0.5 to 2 mA. All the needles will be retained for 30 minutes. Participants will undergo EA treatment three times per week for a total of 12 sessions in four consecutive weeks. If bilateral hands were affected, both sides will be treated.</description>

    <description>The gel will be gently rubbed over the affected joints without excessive joint movement four times per day for 4 weeks and will be asked not to wash hands for one hour after application. Each hand treatment will be used in identical dispensing doses of gel (4 cm strip, approximately 2g, which was judged sufficient for approximately half the surface of each hand (200 cm2)). Dosing times should be distributed evenly over waking hours.If bilateral hands were affected, both sides will be treated.</description>
