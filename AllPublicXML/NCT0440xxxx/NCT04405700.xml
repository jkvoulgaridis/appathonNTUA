  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop a pharmacovigilance (PV) surveillance program to
      monitor adverse pregnancy and infant outcomes, including the presence of congenital
      abnormalities, among HIV-positive and HIV-negative women and their infants at clinical sites
      affiliated with the International Epidemiology Databases to Evaluate consortium (IeDEA).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In part 1 of this study, we will use a mixed prospective and cross-sectional cohort study
      design to implement a PV program at two health facilities affiliated with the Academic Model
      Providing Access to Healthcare (AMPATH) in western Kenya. We will analyze these data to
      examine any associations between ART and (a) pregnancy and (b) infant/birth outcomes. In part
      2, we will create standardized protocols and data exchange standards within IeDEA to enable
      the merging and analysis of multiregional IeDEA PV data. This will include establishing a
      Data Coordinating Center based at Indiana University (IU) to serve as a hub for collecting,
      disseminating and archiving data from the study in Kenya as well as data collected through a
      similar, ongoing study at health facilities in South Africa affiliated with IeDEA. This study
      will establish a multiregional PV infrastructure within IeDEA that can be further scaled
      within the broader IeDEA network.

    <description>Prospective recruitment of pregnant women enrolling in ANC at the site. All HIV+ pregnant women and a 1:1 systematic sample of HIV- pregnant women enrolling in antenatal clinic at the site will be prospectively enrolled in the study. In addition, medical record data for the mother and infant will be collected at the time of delivery for all women who deliver at the site and as such will contribute to a subset of C2 (below). Women enrolled in C1 who do not deliver at the site will be contacted by phone and through field follow-up to ascertain their pregnancy and infant outcomes. Infants born to women enrolled in this component who are suspected of having CAs will be enrolled as outlined in C3 (below) if their mothers deliver at the site. If their mothers do not deliver at the site these infants will be enrolled in the field. Photos/videos of infants with CAs will also be taken for review and classification by a panel of experts (see C3 below).</description>

    <description>Cross-sectional data collection for deliveries at the site. Data will be collected retrospectively from medical records for all women who deliver at the site (including the women enrolled in C1 above), as well from the medical records of all newborn infants and stillbirths delivered at the site. Missing or incomplete information in the woman or her infant's medical record will be clarified by contacting the woman to provide this information.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Cohort 3 (C3)</arm_group_label>
    <description>Photos/videos of infants with CAs. All newborn infants and stillbirths ≥ 24 weeks gestational age delivered at the site, as well as all infants born to women enrolled in C1, will be assessed by surface exam for the presence of CAs. Video and photographs will be taken of CAs identified on surface exam. These images will be reviewed and classified by panel of experts in genetics, dysmorphology and teratology. Mothers of infants with major CAs will be contacted by phone at 1, 6, and 12 months post-delivery to ascertain their infants' vital status and care engagement status.</description>
