  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to measure the extent of inflammation in the brain between
      different groups of participants using a radioactive tracer called [18F]NOS. A radioactive
      tracer is a type of imaging drug that is labeled with a radioactive tag and injected into the
      body. This study will see how the tracer is taken up in the brain using an imaging scan
      called Positron Emission Tomography / Computed Tomography (PET/CT).

      Participants will undergo approximately 60 minutes of dynamic scanning of the brain starting
      at approximately the time of injection of [18F]NOS.

      Participants are required to have a brain MRI performed within 1 year prior to study
      enrollment, or if the subject has not had a brain MRI that is deemed acceptable for use for
      this study they will be asked to undergo a research brain MRI after they have consented for
      this study.
