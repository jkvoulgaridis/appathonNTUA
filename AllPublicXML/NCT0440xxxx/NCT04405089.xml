  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Even when they know it can improve health, many individuals with loss of control eating
      struggle when they are trying to make and sustain new health habits for weight loss and
      maintenance of weight loss. Impulsivity, characterized by lack of foresight and planning and
      excessive risk taking, and compulsivity, characterized by inability to break old habitual
      behaviors, may play a role in refractory obesity. The primary objective of this pilot study
      is to investigate the effect of a novel neuroplasticity based intervention, cognitive
      training coupled with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), on measures of
      impulsivity and compulsivity in individuals with obesity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Impulsivity and compulsivity are two psychological factors which contribute to addictive
      behaviors. Impulsivity is characterized by lack of foresight and planning, and excessive risk
      taking. Impulsivity is a characteristic of poor executive functioning, and reflects deficits
      in goal-oriented behavior and self-regulation. Compulsivity is characterized by inability to
      break old habits. Both of these traits may play a role in refractory obesity. Transcranial
      direct current stimulation (tDCS) coupled with cognitive training may strengthen key
      circuitry involved in impulse control within the prefrontal cortex. tDCS coupled with
      cognitive training has the potential to reduce impulsivity and compulsivity in individuals
      with obesity, with the potential for therapeutic application as a non-pharmacologic approach
      to management of food-related eating behaviors which may impact weight.

      For this double-blind, randomized, placebo (sham) controlled study pilot study the
      investigators aim to recruit and complete studies in approximately 20 individuals, randomly
      assigned to receive either active or sham tDCS, both coupled with computerized cognitive
      training tasks, for five days. Additionally, participants will attend follow up visits at
      approximately 2, and 4 months after the course of intervention visits is completed. Testing
      pre- and post-intervention will include the Binge Eating Scale (BES), PHQ-9 Depression
      Screen, and 4 domains of the NIH Examiner Battery. Weight will be tracked throughout the
      study. MN-BEST blast exposure screening tool is also conducted at baseline.
