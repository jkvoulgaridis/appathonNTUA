    <textblock>
      Pilot study evaluating the feasibility of recruitment, retention, and compliance to a
      modified Heidelberg Model of Neuro-Music Therapy (mHNMT) in patients with Cisplatin-induced
      Tinnitus and relapsed Germ Cell Cancer (rGCC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, interventional pilot study that plans to enroll 15 patients who are
      receiving salvage high dose chemo and bone marrow transplant for relapsed Germ cell Cancer
      (rGCC). Patients will be asked to go through a series of surveys and screening procedures to
      determine eligibility. Once enrolled, patients will receive music therapy while they are
      being treated either inpatient or outpatient for their standard of care treatments.

      Primary Objective To evaluate the feasibility of recruitment, retention, and compliance to a
      mHNMT in patients with CIT and rGCC admitted to BMT service to undergo salvage high-dose
      chemotherapy with tandem bone marrow rescue.

      Secondary Objectives To estimate the effects of mHNMT on severity of CIT, associated
      distress, anxiety, depression, fatigue, benefit findings, sleep, and audiometry measures and
      assess number of times homework completed.

    <measure>Effects of intervention on severity of Cisplatin Induced Tinnitus determined by scores on the Tinnitus Functional Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, day +50, day +100, and day +270</time_frame>
    <description>The Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI) has eight subscales that address the intrusiveness of tinnitus, the sense of control the patient has, cognitive interference, sleep disturbance, auditory issues, relaxation issues, quality of life, and emotional distress. Minimum value is 1 and maximum value is 10. A higher score indicates worse tinnitus.
A mean score of 25 or less than 25 indicates relatively mild tinnitus and little or need for intervention. A mean score ranging from 25-50 indicates significant problems with tinnitus and a possible need for intervention. A mean score of 50 or greater indicates tinnitus severe enough to qualify for more aggressive intervention.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Effects of intervention on associated distress determined by scores on the Tinnitus Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, day +50, day +100, and day +270</time_frame>
    <description>For each item, individuals indicate the level of agreement by answering; not true (score 0), partly true (score 1), or true (score 2). A three point scale limits its utility as an outcome measure. Total scores range from 0-82, with higher scores indicating more distressing tinnitus.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Effects of intervention on anxiety determined by scores on the Impact of Events Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, day +50, day +100, and day +270</time_frame>
    <description>A 22-item self-report measure that assesses subjective distress caused by traumatic events on a scale from 0-4, where 0 is not at all, and 4 is extremely. A higher score indicates increased anxiety.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Effects of intervention on depression determined by scores on Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, day +50, day +100, and day +270</time_frame>
    <description>Each item on the questionnaire is scored from 0-3 and this means that a person can score between 0 and 21 for either anxiety or depression. The HADS uses a scale and therefore the data returned from the HADS is ordinal.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Effects of intervention on benefit findings determined by scores on The Benefit Finding Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, day +50, day +100, and day +270</time_frame>
    <description>Uses a 5-point Likert scoring method from 1 = Not at all to 5 = Extremely.</description>

    <description>Use a 5-point Likert scale and employ 7-day recall. Higher scores indicate higher levels of fatigue. Scores are standardized (M = 50, SD = 10)</description>

    <measure>Number of hours asleep</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Actiwatch Spectrum Pro watch. Sleep parameters will be computed using Actiware® software. The sleep parameters produced include total sleep time, sleep latency (minutes until sleep onset), sleep efficiency, frequency and duration of awakenings after sleep onset (WASO), and number of awakenings. These Sleep variables will be scored for each 24-hour period, and averages over the course of use will be computed for nighttime sleep alone and nighttime sleep plus daytime naps to be combined into epochs for assessment.</description>
