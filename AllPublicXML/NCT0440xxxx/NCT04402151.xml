  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm Phase II clinical trial assessing the clinical efficacy of prostate
      specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET/MR guided MR-LINAC based SBRT-SIB with planned accrual
      of 50 patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Localized prostate cancer can be treated in 5 sessions using a precise, targeted form of
      radiation known as stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), with low toxicity. Despite
      these advances, overall outcomes for aggressive (high risk) prostate cancer remain poor, with
      10-year recurrence-free survival of approximately 65% regardless of treatment modality.
      Recurrences are typically distant and carry poor prognosis, with 5 year survival of 25%. The
      investigators propose to utilize the latest advances in cancer imaging (PSMA Positron
      Emission Tomography (PET)/Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MR)) and radiation delivery (MR-guided
      radiation therapy with real-time adaptive planning), to deliver a personalized radiation
      treatment that targets the areas of greatest risk of recurrence in the prostate with improved
      precision, and as a result improve clinical outcomes for individuals with high risk prostate
      cancer. PSMA PET/MR is a novel imaging modality, not yet widely available, that augments the
      tissue detail provided by MR. The combination of PSMA PET with MR results in improved
      delineation of intraprostatic nodules and higher diagnostic accuracy for detection of
      metastatic disease compared to conventional imaging. PSMA PET/MR imaging data is readily
      transferable to a MR-based linear accelerator (MR-LINAC), a novel, innovative platform that
      allows direct visualization of the tumor during treatment, and permits real-time
      individualized correction for motion with online adaptive radiation planning.
