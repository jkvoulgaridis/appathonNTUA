      This is an open-label, multi-center, rollover study to allow continued treatment access for
      participants enrolled in studies of BXQ-350. This study is intended for subjects who have
      completed the required study observation period or are still on treatment upon the closure of
      their respective BXQ-350 clinical study, and who are judged by the Investigator to benefit
      from continued treatment with BXQ-350. The additional treatment is optional and voluntary.

    <description>Subjects who have completed the required study observation period or are still on treatment upon the closure of their respective BXQ-350 clinical study, and who are judged by the Investigator to benefit from continued treatment with BXQ-350. Treatment will begin after completion of the End of Study visit of the prior BXQ-350 clinical study.
The established safe dose of BXQ-350 from previous adult and pediatric phase 1 studies is 2.4 mg/kg and 3.2 mg/kg respectively once every 28 days (Â± 3 days). BXQ-350 will be administered intravenously at the same dose level and frequency the subject was receiving at the end of the prior BXQ-350 clinical study. Subjects receiving a reduced dose at the end of the prior BXQ-350 clinical study due to toxicity may continue to receive a reduced dose.</description>

    <description>BXQ-350 is a novel anti-neoplastic therapeutic agent configured from two components: Saposin C (SapC), an expressed (human) lysosomal protein, and the phospholipid dioleoylphosphatidyl-serine (DOPS), a phospholipid located on cell membranes (clinical formulation BXQ-350). BXQ-350 is administered by intravenous (IV) infusion in 28-day cycles</description>

                  clinically appropriate for the subject

               5. Provide signed, written informed consent prior to the initiation of any
                  study-specific procedures (Consent from Guardians for minor children and patient

                  (intrauterine device or system, established hormonal contraceptive methods on a
                  stable dose from the time of the last menstrual cycle, or vasectomized partner
                  with confirmed azoospermia) from the time of study entry to 1 month after the

          -  Subjects must not meet any of the following criteria:

               1. Has any ongoing adverse event that could impact tolerability to BXQ-350

               2. Receiving any other non-BXQ-350 study treatment modalities with curative intent,
                  including investigational products other than BXQ-350

               3. Are pregnant or nursing (lactating), where pregnancy is defined as the state of a
                  female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a
                  positive serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) laboratory test
