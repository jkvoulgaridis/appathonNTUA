  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The detection of Klebsiella pneumoniae virulence gene and antibiotics resistance gene takes a
      long time and high cost with equipment requirements. Distinguishing the Klebsiella pneumoniae
      by gene were late for clinical treatment. Therefore, the investigators aim to study the
      clinical characteristics of critically ill patients with Klebsiella pneumoniae infection
      which expressed different drug sensitivity test results.

      Clinical data of adult patients in integrated ICUs of 6 hospitals of Fujian Province China
      from January 2015 to July 2019 were collected, who had been examined for sputum, urine,
      blood, pleural effusion, ascites, cerebrospinal fluid and wound secretions and other body
      fluid samples. And the results showed that Klebsiella pneumoniae was positive, including
      demographic data, underlying disease status, drug sensitivity test, infection-related
      indicators, life support, prognostic indicators.
