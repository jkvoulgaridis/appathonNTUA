    <textblock>
      This study will compare RC48-ADC to physician choice standard treatment. Participants must
      have HER2-low breast cancer ，previous use of anthracyclines, and have been treated with one

      This study is a multi-center, randomized, open, parallel control to evaluate the
      effectiveness and safety of Phase III clinical trials of the efficacy and safety of
      recombinant humanized anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody-Monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) conjugate
      for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer the study.The low
      expression of HER2 is defined as: the immunohistochemistry (IHC) confirmed by the central
      laboratory detects the expression of HER2 protein as IHC 2+ and the fluorescence in situ
      hybridization (FISH) detection has no amplification.
