        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Is at least 42 years of age and has full legal capacity to volunteer;

          2. Has read and signed an information consent letter;

          3. Self reports having a full eye examination in the previous two years;

          4. Anticipates being able to wear the study lenses for at least 8 hours a day, 5 days a
             week;

          5. Is willing and able to follow instructions and maintain the appointment schedule;

          6. Habitually wears soft contact lens for the past 3 months minimum;

          7. Has refractive astigmatism of at least -0.75DC;

          8. Is presbyopic and requires a reading addition of at least +0.75D;

          9. Can be fit and achieve binocular distance vision of at least 20/30 Snellen (or +0.20
             logMAR) which participants also deem to be 'acceptable', with the available study lens
             parameters (sphere +4 to -6; cylinder -0.75 to -1.75DC; near addition +0.75 to +2.50).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Is participating in any concurrent clinical or research study;

          2. Habitually wears one of the study contact lenses;

          3. Has any known active* ocular disease and/or infection;

          4. Has a systemic condition that in the opinion of the investigator may affect a study
             outcome variable;

          5. Is using any systemic or topical medications that in the opinion of the investigator
             may affect contact lens wear or a study outcome variable;

          6. Has known sensitivity to the diagnostic sodium fluorescein and/or the care product
             Opti-Free PureMoist being used in the study;

          7. Self-reports as pregnant, lactating or planning a pregnancy at the time of enrolment;

          8. Has undergone refractive error surgery. * For the purposes of this study, active
             ocular disease is defined as infection or inflammation which requires therapeutic
             treatment. Mild (i.e. not considered clinically relevant) lid abnormalities
             (blepharitis, meibomian gland dysfunction, papillae), corneal and conjunctival
             staining and dry eye are not considered active ocular disease. Neovascularization and
             corneal scars are the result of previous hypoxia, infection or inflammation and are
             therefore not active.
