  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to evaluate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) , occurrence of all adverse
      events (AE) and serious adverse events (SAE) , pharmacokinetic parameters and antitumor
      effect of TQB3558 tablets in Chinese adult patients with advanced solid tumors .The study is
      divided into phase Ia and phase Ib. Phase Ia: dose escalation period, to evaluate the safety
      and tolerability of TQB3558 tablets, determine MTD; Phase Ib: effectiveness exploration
      period, to expand the safe and effective dose group, recommend appropriate dosage and method
      for subsequent clinical research.
