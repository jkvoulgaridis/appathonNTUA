      The study design to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the NuEra Tight for circumferential
      reduction in the abdominal region within three treatment group. each group has a different
      radio-frequency. The study hypothesis is that NuEra Tight is safe and will cause a reduction
      in abdominal circumferential after treatment and at 12 week post last treatment within each
      treatment group.
