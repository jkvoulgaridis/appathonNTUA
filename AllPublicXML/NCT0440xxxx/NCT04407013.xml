    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the standardized care pathway which
      provides enhanced supportive care for patients with advanced cancer.

      A pilot study (single arm pre-post test) will be conducted to evaluate feasibility of
      applying standardized care pathway to provide enhanced supportive care. A Randomized
      Controlled Trial will be conducted by randomly allocating participants in a 1:1 ratio to
      intervention arm (receiving enhanced supportive care according to the standardized care
      pathway) or control arm. Participants in the intervention arm will receive enhanced
      supportive care consisted of symptom management and coping enhancement counseling for 5
      times. Data from advanced cancer patients will be collected at baseline (before start of
      chemotherapy), during chemotherapy (intervention arm), at 3 month, at 6 month, and at 12
      month. Data from caregivers will be collected at baseline, 3 month, and 6 month. Primary
      outcomes will be measured as advanced cancer patients' symptom, coping and quality of life.
