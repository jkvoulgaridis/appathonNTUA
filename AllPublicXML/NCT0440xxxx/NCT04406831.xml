  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aberrant miRNA production has been linked to a wide range of human cancers and shown to play
      important roles in their genesis and growth. These miRNA can be detected in the blood and
      tumors of patients with cancer. We hypothesize that the detection of certain miRNAs present
      in the blood/serum of patients with pancreatic cancer may be important to the early diagnosis
      of the disease. Furthermore, we hypothesize that miRNA detection in PC patients will yield
      prognostic information and help predict the response to treatment.
