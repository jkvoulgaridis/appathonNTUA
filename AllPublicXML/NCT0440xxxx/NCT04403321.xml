  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label, phase II study to compare the efficacy of eltrombopag
      combined with tacrolimus//Cyclosporin A to eltrombopag alone in Chinese subjects with
      refractory or relapsed aplastic anemia. The safety would also be evaluated. Patients would be
      randomized to receive eltrombopag alone or eltrombopag combined with tacrolimus//Cyclosporin
      A. Treatment with eltrombopag will be started at 25 mg/day and increased by 25 mg/day every 2
      weeks according to the platelet count up to 150 mg/day. Tacrolimus will be given at 1mg bid
      with the target concentration to be 5-10 ng/ml throughout the study. Cyclosporin A will be
      give at the target comcentration to be 100-150ng/ml. The hematological response rate and
      safety will be recorded and compared at 3, 6 months and 1 year after starting the study
      treatment (Week 13, 26 and 52).

    <description>Platelet or RBC transfusions will be based on physician's subjective judgement. Platelet transfusion will be done if the platelet count is less than 10×10^9/liter (L) with significant bleeding tendency or the platelet count is less than 20×10^9/L with pyrexia. RBC transfusion will be done to keep the hemoglobin concentration at over 7 g/dL or in the presence of clinical symptoms such as dyspnea.</description>
