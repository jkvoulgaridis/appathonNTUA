    <textblock>
      Chronic kidney disease is a common global public health issue and its prevalence increased
      year by year. Early diagnosis and intervention can prevent further complications and
      comorbidities of long-term dialysis, cardiovascular events and mortality as well as improve
      the patients' life quality. To differentiate acute from chronic kidney disease was crucial
      especially in the setting of crowded and high-risk emergency department. To diagnose acute or
      chronic kidney disease, physicians usually use blood sample test combined with image studies
      such as conventional sonography, CT and MRI. However, there was lots of limited factors. The
      patients may have no previous visit records, poor renal function to receive contrast medium,
      or critical clinical condition to undergo time-wasting exam. Although the conventional renal
      sonography is accessible and inexpensive, the judgement is subjective and provide little
      clinical information. Recent researches of shear wave elastography in evaluating renal
      parenchymal stiffness showed some correlation with nephropathy. In our study, aiming to
      facilitating clinical implication, the investigators will use swear-wave elastography
      combined with conventional renal sonography to benefit patients in diagnosis of acute or
      chronic kidney disease.

      This is a case-control study. The investigators obtained data from participants who were
      older than 20 years old and received renal sonography examination in the emergency department
      of National Taiwan University Hospital. The investigators examined the participants' kidneys
      by recording the kidney size, cortical thickness, possible lesions and elasticity by
      shear-wave elastography. These data combined with the participants' medical history and renal
      function revealed by blood examination will be analyzed. This study was designed to determine
      the correlation between renal cortical elasticity and chronic kidney disease.
