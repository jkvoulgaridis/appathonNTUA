      This prospective double-blind study done on 240 patients admitted to surgical I.C.U after
      laparoscopic appendectomy. Those who had preoperative Koivuranta vomiting score of more than
      3 enrolled in our study. Every group contains 80 patients. Patients of group A received
      ondansetron 4 mg intravenous immediately once reached to I.C.U and another same dose after 6
      hours while patients of group B received isopropyl alcohol 70% inhalation every 15 min for 4
      times then repeated after 6 hours. The last group C received intravenous normal saline at
      rate of 20 ml/kg over 30 minute and repeated by the same dose after 6 hours. The duration of
      the study was 24 hours post-operatively. As PONV is self-limited within 24 hours.

        240 patients admitted to surgical I.C.U of King Abdul-Aziz specialist hospital for
        post-operative care after laparoscopic appendectomy surgery between March 2019 till
        February 2020. A Koivuranta Score to Predict Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting done
        preoperatively for all the patients and only those who had score of more than 3 on
        Koivuranta vomiting score (had more than 60% chance to develop PONV) enrolled in our study.
        And randomly allocated in one of three groups group A, B or C.
