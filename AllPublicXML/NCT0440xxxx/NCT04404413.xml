    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare the body composition and physical performance
      effects of HIIT, with or without intermittent fasting intervention in active women. Fourteen
      active normal weight women aged 18-35 participated in the study. The effects of 2x8 weeks
      without (HIIT) or with (HIIT+IF) intermittent fasting caloric restriction (20% reduction in
      weekly energy intake) on body composition and performance (Hand-grip strength, Counter
      movement jump, Wingate Anaerobic 30 s Cycling Test), were compared. There were two weeks in
      between both phases when they did not perform the scheduled activity, so as not to alter the
      experimental phase.

    <description>A single-group crossover design was used to compare the effects of 2x8 weeks of high-intensity interval training without (HIIT) or with (HIIT+IF) intermittent fasting caloric restriction (20% reduction in weekly energy intake) on body composition and performance. There were two weeks in the middle of both phases in which they did not carry out programmed activity, in order not to alter the experimental phase.</description>
