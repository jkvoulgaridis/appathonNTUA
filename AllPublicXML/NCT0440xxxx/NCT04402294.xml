  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is investigating working memory brain states by using transcranial magnetic
      stimulation (TMS) in combination with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The study
      uses a novel, individualized targeting approach for TMS based on each subject's individual
      multi-modal fMRI data. Next, the individualized target will be stimulated in a TMS/ fMRI
      imaging session to investigate working memory states and optimal stimulation frequencies.

    <intervention_model_description>Task and resting fMRI will be used to determine an individualized brain target for each participant. In a subsequent session, participants will complete a task fMRI with repetitive TMS neuromodulation; during this session, various stimulation protocols will be interleaved with working memory task blocks to result in online brain readouts of the degree in which modulation affected the brain state in regards to working memory performance.
Based on this testing, an optimal and sub-optimal TMS stimulation frequency will be determined for each individual participant. Each frequency will be administered separately across three stimulation days using a crossover design, with the order of frequencies being randomized and counterbalanced. Therefore, each subject will receive six days of TMS stimulation: three using the optimal frequency, and three using the sub-optimal frequency. The initial TMS/ task fMRI testing session will be completed at the midpoint and end of the study.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The investigators will create individualized TMS targets using deep learning methods on task and resting fMRI data to target working memory augmentation. The individualized target will be stimulated in a subsequent fMRI scan involving working memory task performance interleaved with repetitive TMS (rTMS) delivered at a variety of stimulation frequencies. Based on activation readouts in response to rTMS, an optimal and sub-optimal brain state frequency to impact working memory performance will be selected for each participant. Participants will receive rTMS at each frequency separately for three days (six days total), with the order of frequency randomly assigned and counterbalanced. Following each three day protocol, another fMRI working memory readout will be conducted to support the targeting and frequency selection algorithms.</description>
