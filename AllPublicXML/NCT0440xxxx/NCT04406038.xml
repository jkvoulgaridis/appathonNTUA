  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Seroprevalence study of COVID-19 in Saint Petersburg, Russia is a regional longitudinal
      cohort study aiming to evaluate the spread dynamics of the COVID-19 disease in the population
      of Saint Petersburg. Clinically asymptomatic adults are sampled from the population using
      random digit dialing and tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in the
      blood serum. Data collection and serial sampling of the same individuals is planned every two
      weeks in order to understand both the spread of the virus in the population and the dynamics
      of the antibody titers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At least 1 550 individuals, 18 years old and older, are randomly sampled using random digit
      dialing from the population of Saint Petersburg, Russia. Random sampling is performed by a
      survey company on the list of mobile phone numbers with designated geography prefixes of St.
      Petersburg. The baseline questionnaire for computer-assisted telephone interview includes
      travel history, medical history, and socio-economic status of the respondents. Sampled
      individuals are then invited to the clinic for blood sampling, their refusal to participate
      is recorded. Collected blood samples are used for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies testing.
      Data and sample collection is conducted every two weeks for 18 weeks (10 times in total).
      Participants complete additional questionnaires in the clinic providing information on
      medical history, history of allergies, chronic disease, smoking and medication taken
      regularly. Contact tracing data and environmental conditions of the household are re—Åorded.
