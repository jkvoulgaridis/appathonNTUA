  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Buqitongluo Granule
      in treating qi deficiency and blood stasis syndrome, and explore the effect of the
      improvement of qi deficiency and blood stasis syndrome on the prognosis of diseases.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The BOSS study is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial.
      The primary hypothesis of this trial is that Buqitongluo Granule will improve the syndrome
      score of Qi Deficiency and Blood Stasis in convalescence of ischemic stroke, stable angina
      pectoris of coronary artery disease and diabetic peripheral neuropathy with qi deficiency and
      blood stasis syndrome. Buqitongluo Granule will be compared to placebo, combined with
      guidelines-based standard care in patients. During the trial, it is forbidden to use
      acupuncture, Traditional Chinese Medicine decoction (compound granule), Traditional Chinese
      Medicine injection, Chinese patent medicine (including external use), external washing of
      Traditional Chinese Medicine and health product (composition or efficacy similar to the study
      drug).
