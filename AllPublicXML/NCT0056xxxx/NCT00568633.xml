  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a cancer of the bone marrow that mostly affects older adults.
      Even with the best chemotherapy, two-year disease-free survival is achieved in a minority of
      patients. Bone marrow transplantation from a sibling donor may improve cure rates; however,
      patients over 50 years of age have a high risk of complications and therefore generally are
      excluded from this treatment option. Recently our group developed a transplantation strategy
      for older cancer patients that protects against transplant-associated complications, yet does
      not interfere with the ability of the transplanted donor cells to destroy cancer cells. With
      this new method, we can now safely evaluate transplantation as a curative therapy for AML
      patients over the age of 50. We have assembled clinical and scientific researchers throughout
      the state of California to study and compare bone marrow transplantation using our new
      approach with the best standard of care chemotherapy in AML patients over the age of 50. The
      results of this study have the potential to establish a new treatment standard that will
      improve survival of older AML patients.

Total lymphoid radiation (TLI) Days -11 to -7, and Days -4 to -1 (2 fractions on day -1)
Anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) Days -11 to -7
Methylprednisolone Days -11 to -7

Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), Day 0 to Day +28
Allogeneic HSCT: Allogeneic, 5+ of 6 HLA-matched PBSC transplant from sibling, mobilized to target of 5 x 10e6 CD34+ cells/kg and &lt; 7 x 10e8 CD3+ cells/kg.
Anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG): 1.5 mg/kg for 5 days by IV
Cyclosporine (CSP): 6.25 mg/kg twice daily oral

Non-Myeloablative unrelated-donor transplant, +/- TLI and ATG conditioning
Umbilical cord blood transplantation
Haploidentical transplantation
