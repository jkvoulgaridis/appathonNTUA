  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute rejection is a common problem after a kidney transplant. Rejection can occur when the
      kidney recipient's immune system tries to attack (or reject) the new kidney. Rejection
      typically most often develops in the first few months after a transplant.

      This single center study will seek to determine if a new combination of anti-rejection
      medications, including the recently FDA approved drug called Belatacept, is better than the
      current standard anti-rejection drug regimen at preventing rejection. Also to be determined
      will be whether the new combination of drugs will allow participants to wean off their oral
      anti-rejection medications over time.

      This study will test the safety and effectiveness of a new investigational drug combination
      using alemtuzumab, belatacept, and sirolimus when given with or without donor bone marrow.

      This combination of medicines has not been tested before in humans. Alemtuzumab (Campath) is
      approved for use in some types of white blood cell cancers, but is considered investigational
      in transplant patients. Belatacept is now FDA approved and is being studied in transplant
      patients. Sirolimus (Rapamune) is approved for use in transplant patients, but its use with
      belatacept and alemtuzumab is investigational.

      In the initial 20 subjects enrolled in the study, half tested whether an infusion of bone
      marrow from the kidney donor would improve the effect of these drugs. This bone marrow
      infusion was also considered investigational.

      Enrollment of 20 additional subjects began in January, 2013. The donor bone marrow infusion
      has been eliminated. Enrollment was open to primary living and deceased donor kidney
      recipients. Enrollment was closed as of 8/12/2014.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a single-center, open-label,proof of concept study in non-human leukocyte
      antigen (HLA)-identical living and deceased donor renal transplants. The initial 20 subjects
      were randomized to either receive/not to receive a single donor bone marrow infusion in
      addition to the investigational combination of alemtuzumab, belatacept, and sirolimus. Since
      the bone marrow infusion has been eliminated in the second group of 20 subjects, no
      randomization was required. All recipients in the second group of 20 subjects will receive
      the same investigational combination of alemtuzumab, belatacept, and sirolimus.

      At the time of transplant, participants will receive a 3-hour IV infusion of 30 mg. of
      alemtuzumab. Participants will receive a combination of sirolimus and belatacept for at least
      one year. At that time, eligible participants will consent to and begin oral
      immunosuppressive withdrawal or continue therapy through study close. Sirolimus will first be
      weaned by halving the dose and/or increasing the dosing interval over at least a 2-6 month
      period. After sirolimus is discontinued, participants will remain on monthly IV belatacept
      monotherapy indefinitely.

      Follow-up will continue for at least five years. If subjects are successfully weaned from
      oral immunosuppression during their participation in this trial, no other alternative therapy
      will be warranted. Since belatacept is now FDA approved, subjects will be eligible to
      continue this therapy after their study participation has ended.

    <time_frame>Year 2</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint is the number of patients successfully withdrawn from oral immunosuppression (sirolimus) for one year after their last dose of sirolimus. After taking sirolimus for one year, participants meeting certain pre-specified criteria were offered the opportunity to wean from sirolimus and continue with belatacept monotherapy. To be eligible for weaning of sirolimus, participants were required to have a kidney biopsy negative for all signs of rejection, including borderline findings.</description>

    <description>Renal transplant recipients will be given an experimental combination of immunosuppressive drugs. Participants will receive a single dose of alemtuzumab on the day of transplantation and will receive belatacept and sirolimus for 1 year.

    <description>Belatacept will be given within 24 hours of transplantation via a peripheral intravenous catheter at a dose of 10mg/kg (actual body weight) infused over 30 mins. The dose will be repeated on study days 4 (post op day 3) and 8 (post op day 7), then every 2 weeks for 5 additional doses. Thereafter, belatacept will be given once every 4 weeks (+/- 3 days) at 10mg/kg through 6 months then at 5mg/kg indefinitely.</description>

    <description>Sirolimus will be started on postoperative day 1 at a dose of 2 mg per day orally. Doses will be adjusted to maintain 24-hour trough levels of 8-10ng/ml until the drug is weaned. Toxicity attributable to sirolimus (e.g., mouth ulcers, arthralgias) will prompt dose reduction to address clinical concerns in this regard. If sirolimus trough levels need to be reduced below 4ng/ml to control drug side effects, the patient will be considered intolerant to the drug and will be changed to other medications.</description>

After taking sirolimus for one year, participants meeting certain pre-specified criteria were offered the opportunity to wean from sirolimus and continue with belatacept monotherapy. To be eligible for weaning of sirolimus, participants were required to have a kidney biopsy negative for all signs of rejection, including borderline findings.</description>
