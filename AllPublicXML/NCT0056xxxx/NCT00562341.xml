  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed prospective study aims to determine whether interpretation of PSA levels in
      morbidly obese men require correction due to the obesity itself. If PSA levels are found to
      rise after weight loss, interpretation of PSA levels in morbidly obese men may be improved by
      upward correction of the PSA level. A 'correction factor' may be proposed for the
      interpretation of PSA levels in obese men, toward the clinical decision regarding indication
      for prostate biopsy.

      The main objective of this study is to determine whether interpretation of PSA levels in
      morbidly obese men require correction due to the obesity itself. Secondary outcome measures
      that will be followed include the affect of obesity and weight loss on testosterone,
      estradiol and leptin. In as much as these might also affect PSA, we will be measuring these
      values as well. Also, we do not know the effects of lap-band induced weight loss on clinical
      outcome measures of sexual, bowel and urinary function. Thus we will aim to investigate these
      parameters as well.
