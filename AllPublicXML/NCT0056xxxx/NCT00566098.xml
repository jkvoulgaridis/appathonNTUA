      RATIONALE: Activating white blood cells in the laboratory may help them kill more cancer
      cells when they are put back in the body. This may be an effective treatment for patients
      undergoing a stem cell transplant for multiple myeloma.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects of activated white blood cells
      and to see how well they work in treating patients who are undergoing a stem cell transplant
      for newly diagnosed stage II or stage III multiple myeloma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Evaluate the safety and response rate of activated marrow infiltrating lymphocytes
           (aMILs) in patients undergoing autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation for
           newly diagnosed, stage II-III multiple myeloma.

        -  Determine the overall in vitro fold-expansion and assess pre- and post-expansion for
           myeloma T-cell specificity in assessing the feasibility of generating aMILs from myeloma
           patients.

        -  Assess the toxicity of aMILs.

        -  Evaluate the effect of aMILs on hematopoietic engraftment, including neutrophil
           engraftment, platelet engraftment, and primary graft failure (if failure occurs).

        -  Evaluate response rates utilizing the Blade criteria, including the complete response
           (CR) rate, near complete response (nCR) rate, very good partial response (VGPR) rate,
           partial response (PR) rate, minimal response (MR) rate, and overall response rate (CR,
           VGPR, PR, MR).

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate T-cell reconstitution, including absolute lymphocyte counts, CD3+, CD4+, and
           CD8+ T-cell counts.

        -  Evaluate progression-free survival and overall survival.

        -  Evaluate anti-tumor immune response.

        -  Determine pneumococcal-specific vaccine responses.

        -  Determine delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo collection of marrow infiltrating lymphocytes (MILs)* either at
      diagnosis prior to the initiation of induction therapy or upon completion of induction
      therapy. The MILs bone marrow product undergo ex vivo activation and expansion of T cells for
      7-8 days to produce activated marrow infiltrating lymphocytes (aMILs). Patients then undergo
      stem cell mobilization and leukapheresis to collect the peripheral blood stem cells 12 days
      after mobilization. Patients receive melphalan IV over 20-30 minutes on days -2 and -1 and
      undergo a peripheral blood stem cell transplantation on day 0 as planned. Patients receive
      aMILs infusion on day 3. Patients receive pneumococcal polyvalent vaccine on day 21.

      NOTE: *Patients who have completed induction therapy receive pneumococcal polyvalent vaccine
      approximately 2 weeks prior to MILs collection; patients undergoing MILs collection prior to
      starting induction therapy do not receive a pre-transplantation vaccine.

      Blood and bone marrow samples are collected periodically for laboratory correlative studies.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 1 year.

        <description>Survival in months for participants who are alive (Overall Survival) and alive without disease progression (Progression-free survival). Disease progression is defined as a change from negative to positive on immunofixation or electrophoresis for participants previously in complete remission or a 25% increase in serum electrophoresis for participants not previously in complete remission. Partial response is defined as a &gt;= 50% decrease in serum paraprotein or 90% decrease in urinary light chains (for participants without measurable serum paraprotein). Complete response is defined as negative serum and urine immunofixation and a bone marrow aspirate with &lt; 5% plasma cells.</description>
