    <textblock>
      This study will examine the effectiveness of an investigational drug called ZD6474 (also
      known as vandetanib or ZACTIMA). Vandetanib is an experimental drug that is designed to
      prevent the growth and development of new blood vessels on tumors and to prevent the direct
      growth of cancer cells. It has been tested in a number of clinical trials on adults with
      cancer, but the United States (U.S.) Food and Drug Administration has not specifically
      approved it as a cancer treatment. The purpose of this investigational study is to better
      understand how vandetanib affects humans who have kidney cancer related to von Hippel-Lindau
      (VHL) disease, and to develop tests that may improve researchers understanding of kidney
      cancer and its effects.

      Volunteers must be at least 18 years old and must have been diagnosed with kidney cancer
      related to VHL. Candidates must have a life expectancy greater than three months and must
      have at least one measurable renal tumor for study purposes. Candidates may not be receiving
      any other investigational agents or have been treated with an investigational drug within the
      past four weeks. Candidates who have had surgery, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy within the
      past four weeks will be excluded from the study. Candidates will be screened with a physical
      examination and medical history.

      During the study, participants will receive an oral dose of vandetanib once a day for 28 days
      (a treatment period known as a cycle). Participants will need to return to the National
      Institutes of Health every two weeks on the same day of the week as the first dose of
      vandetanib for a series of tests and procedures, including blood and urine tests and an
      electrocardiogram. Every 12 weeks, computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI) scans will be done to assess the size of participants tumors. Participants whose tumors
      do not grow and who do not have unacceptable side effects may continue to receive vandetanib
      to maintain the current condition, until researchers conclude the study....

      Background:

      Von Hippel Lindau disease is a hereditary cancer syndrome in which affected individuals are
      at risk for developing tumors in a number of organs, including the kidneys, brain, spine,
      adrenal glands, eyes and pancreas.

      The molecular hallmark of VHL is inactivation of the VHL gene which leads to accumulation of
      proteins targeted for degradation through the ubiquitin pathway, which includes a group of
      transcriptionally active proteins called the hypoxia inducible factors (HIF), whose alpha
      subunits undergo degradation in a VHL-dependent fashion. Accumulation of HIFs results in
      overexpression of several genes including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), glucose
      transporter 1 (GLUT-1), transforming growth factor (TGF)-alpha, platelet- derived growth
      factor (PDGF), and erythropoietin, which are believed to play a role in tumorigenesis, tumor
      progression and metastasis.

      ZD6474 is an orally administered receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor with activity against the
      Kinase insert domain-containing receptor/vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2
      (KDR/VEGFR2) and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Kinase insert domain receptor
      (KDR)/vascular growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) is an endothelial cell receptor for vascular
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and plays a crucial role in mediating tumor angiogenesis,
      while epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (a receptor for TGF-alpha and epidermal growth
      factor (EGF) is believed to mediate tumor growth and proliferation.

      Objective:

      Primary Objective

      To assess the overall response rate in VHL patients with renal tumors treated with single
      agent ZD6474

      Secondary Objectives:

      To study the safety and tolerability of ZD6474

      To evaluate time to progression and progression-free survival in VHL patients receiving
      ZD6474

      To study the effect of ZD6474 treatment on non-renal tumors associated with von Hippel Lindau
      disease ( pancreatic tumors, pheochromocytoma, central nervous system (CNS)
      hemangioblastomas)

      To investigate the effect of ZD6474 on circulating endothelial cells and endothelial
      progenitor cells and to explore the utility of these markers as surrogates of angiogenesis
      inhibition

      To investigate the effect of ZD6474 on biomarkers of angiogenesis such as plasma VEGF and
      soluble VEGFR2

      Eligibility:

      Adults with clinical diagnosis of von Hippel Lindau disease

      Presence of one or more measurable renal tumors

      Age greater than or equal to 18 years

      Adequate organ function, performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 0-2)
      and life expectancy (greater than 3 months)

      Design:

      Single agent ZD6474 administered daily at a starting dose of 300mg per day

      Patients will be evaluated for response every 12 weeks using Response Evaluation Criteria in
      Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria

      The study is based on an open label two-stage optimal phase II design

      Accrual of a maximum of 37 patients.

    <description>Overall response rate is defined as the percentage of participants with either a partial or complete response occurring at any time after initiation of therapy. Response is determined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Partial response (PR) is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD. Complete response (CR) is a disappearance of all target lesions. Progressive disease (PD) is at least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions. Stable disease (SD) is neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD (progressive disease), taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started.</description>

        or St. Johns Wort.

        Clinically significant cardiac event (including symptomatic heart failure, myocardial
        infarction or angina) within 3 months of entry or presence of any cardiac disease that in
        the opinion of the Principal Investigator increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmia.

        History of clinically significant arrhythmia [including multifocal premature ventricular
        contraction (PVC), bigeminy, trigeminy, ventricular tachycardia] that is symptomatic or
        requires treatment (CTCAE grade 3) or asymptomatic sustained ventricular tachycardia

        Uncontrolled atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation controlled on medication is not
        excluded.

        Presence of Left bundle branch block.

        Previous history of QTc prolongation while taking other medications that required
        discontinuation of that medication.

        Congenital long QT syndrome or first degree relative with unexplained sudden death under
        the age of 40 years QTc with Bazetts correction that is unmeasurable, or greater than or
        equal to 480 msec on screening electrocardiogram (ECG). If a patient has QTc greater than
        or equal to 480 msec on screening ECG, the screen ECG may be repeated twice (at least 24
        hours apart). The average QTc from the three screening ECGs must be less than 480 msec in
        order for the patient to be eligible for the study). Patients who are receiving a drug that
        has a risk of QTc prolongation are excluded if QTc is greater than or equal to 460 msec.

        Potassium concentration less than 4.0 mEq/L, calcium (ionized calcium or adjusted for
        albumin), or magnesium concentrations outside normal limits despite optimal
        supplementation/correction

        Left ventricular ejection fraction less than 45 percent measured by multiple gated
        acquisition scan (MUGA) or echocardiogram (ECHO)

        Hypertension not controlled by medical therapy (systolic blood pressure greater than 150
        mmHg or diastolic blood pressure greater than 100 mmHg).

        Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
        infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
        arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
        requirements.

        Patient known to be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive and requiring
        antiretroviral therapy.

        Currently active diarrhea that may affect the ability of the patient to absorb ZD6474 or
        tolerate further diarrhea.

        Patients on therapeutic anticoagulation

        Patients with known bleeding disorders

        Pregnant women are excluded from this study because ZD6474 is an anti-angiogenic agent with
        the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but
        potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother
        with ZD6474, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with ZD6474.

        Any known hypersensitivity to ZD6474 or other excipients of ZD6474.

        <title>Overall Response Rate.</title>
        <description>Overall response rate is defined as the percentage of participants with either a partial or complete response occurring at any time after initiation of therapy. Response is determined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Partial response (PR) is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD. Complete response (CR) is a disappearance of all target lesions. Progressive disease (PD) is at least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions. Stable disease (SD) is neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD (progressive disease), taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started.</description>

        <title>Time To Progression (TTP)</title>
        <description>Time to progression is defined as the time from the start of treatment to progression as defined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria, with death being treated as a censored event. Partial response (PR) is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD. Complete response (CR) is a disappearance of all target lesions. Progressive disease (PD) is at least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started, the appearance of one or more new lesions, developing a surgical size tumor that should be resected. Stable disease (SD) is neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD (progressive disease), taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started.</description>

        <description>Tumor measurements for non-renal tumors were assessed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) before and after treatment. Complete response (CR) is disappearance of all target lesions. Partial response (PR) is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD. Progressive disease (PD) is at least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest um LD recorded since treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions. Stable disease (SD) is neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started.</description>
