  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective clinical data-collection is to document the performance,
      clinical outcomes, and wear rates of ArCom® and ArComXL® Polyethylene. The data gathered will
      be collated and used as a part of Biomet's post-market surveillance system and to provide
      feedback to designing engineers, support marketing efforts, and answer potential questions
      from reimbursement agencies.

      Inclusion/exclusion criteria are identical to those indications and contraindications stated
      in the FDA approved labeling for the device in 510(k) K926107 and 510(k) K043051. Surgical
      techniques and patient care are to be standard for the surgeons participating in the
      protocol.

      The study follow-up intervals are 6 weeks, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 5 years, and 10 years.
      Demographic data is collected pre-operatively along with the Harris Hip Score and UCLA
      Activity Score. Operative information includes the surgical technique and other standard
      operative information. Follow-up information includes the Harris Hip Score, UCLA Activity
      Score, and Radiographic data. Anterior/posterior and frog leg lateral X-ray data is recorded
      to show radiolucencies, component position and angles. Sites are also required to send in an
      Anterior/Posterior Pelvis x-ray for wear analysis. Implant durability is documented by asking
      the surgeon to record revisions, complications, and device related adverse events. All
      information collected is de-identified in compliance with HIPAA regulations.

    <description>Independent wear analysis of radiographs. The six-week radiographic evaluation will be assessed in comparison to the one-year evaluation in order to determine the early changes of the polyethylene. The difference between the one and two-year evaluations will yield the first true wear rate. We have included a three-year evaluation to reduce the scatter of the linear regression used to calculate the wear rate. The five-year and ten-year evaluations will produce mid and long-term wear rates.</description>
