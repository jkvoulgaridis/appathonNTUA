      The objectives of this study are:

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of Phentolamine Mesylate to lower intra-ocular pressure (IOP)
           in the treatment of Open-Angle Glaucoma (OAG) and Ocular Hypertension (OHT).

        -  To evaluate the ocular and systemic safety of Phentolamine Mesylate compared to its
           vehicle.

        -  To evaluate additional efficacy of Phentolamine Mesylate to improve visual performance.

      Placebo-controlled double-masked, multiple dose Phase 2 study in 40 patients with IOP ≥ 22
      and ≤30 mmHg, evaluating ocular and systemic safety and efficacy following administration of
      Phentolamine mesylate 1.0% QD at 8PM to 10PM in both eyes for 14 days.

         16. Participation in any investigational study within 30 days prior to Screening

         17. Use of any topical or systemic adrenergic or cholinergic drugs up to 30 days prior to
             Screening, or during the study

         18. Changes in systemic medication that could have an effect on IOP within 30 days prior
             to Screening

         19. Women of childbearing potential who are pregnant, nursing, planning a pregnancy, or
             not using a medically acceptable form of birth control

         20. Resting heart rate outside the normal range (50-110 beats per minute) at Screening or
             Qualification Visit

         21. Hypertension with resting diastolic blood pressure (BP) &gt; 105 mmHg or systolic BP &gt;
