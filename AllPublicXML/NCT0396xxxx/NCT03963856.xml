  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spaceflight induces detrimental changes in most organ systems with both acute changes and
      chronic adaptations. For example, acute fluid shifts associated with weightlessness (also
      called - improperly - microgravity) cause initial rapid cardiovascular alterations, whereas
      the chronic changes are more reflective of cardiovascular deconditioning and
      cerebrovascular/ocular adaptations (Pavy-Le Traon et al., 2007).

      Long-duration stays in weightlessness have resulted in ocular structural and functional
      adaptations in some astronauts, which has been termed the Spaceflight Associated Neuro-ocular
      Syndrome (SANS ; see review in Lee et al., 2018). The leading hypothesis is that ocular
      changes are the consequence of chronic exposure to the weightlessness-induced headward
      (cephalad) fluid shift experienced by all astronauts. Countermeasures targeted to reverse
      this fluid shift, including lower body negative pressure and veno-occlusive thigh cuffs, have
      been proposed and tested in ground-based studies using a head-down tilt model of the cephalad
      fluid shift. However, the amount of fluid shift reversal required to prevent the development
      of SANS has not been investigated or determined. Similarly, artificial gravity through
      centrifugation has been proposed as a SANS countermeasure, given its ability to reverse
      headward fluid shifts and its efficacy as a countermeasure to long-duration bed rest-induced
      cardiovascular adaptations (long-duration bed rest is widely employed to simulate the effects
      of microgravity on various physiological systems). However, the minimum level of artificial
      gravity required also has not been investigated.

      The primary objective of this study is to characterize cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and
      ocular changes across a range of gravity levels to identify a threshold of gravitational load
      that can serve as a countermeasure to SANS during future spaceflight missions.
