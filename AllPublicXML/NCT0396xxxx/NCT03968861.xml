  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to document the outcome at 2-3 years of age of participants of
      the TOBY Xe trial, to provide preliminary information about the later clinical effects of
      treatment with Xenon gas combined with moderate hypothermia following perinatal asphyxia. The
      TOBY Xe trial was a randomised controlled trial of inhaled xenon gas combined with
      hypothermia for the treatment of perinatal asphyxia. The trial primary outcome was changes on
      magnetic resonance parameters examined prior to discharge from hospital.

      Continuing clinical follow-up of trial participants is important following any therapeutic
      trial and is essential in early phase trials where information on the clinical effects of the
      intervention are lacking. Therefore, we have set up this study to determine the major
      clinical and neurological outcomes of participants of the TOBY Xe trial and to determine
      whether the magnetic resonance parameters in that trial are qualified to predict outcome
      following neural rescue therapy. This information is necessary for planning further studies
      of this intervention.

        The study population were the surviving participants in the TOBY Xenon study. There were 69
        survivors from 92 participants at 2 years after birth and 62 of the 69 participants entered
