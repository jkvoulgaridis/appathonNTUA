  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Red meat is an integral component of the habitual diet among the UK and Irish population,
      with adults consuming an average of 71grams/day. Although typically high in saturated fatty
      acids (SFA), red meat is also an important dietary source of protein and essential nutrients
      including iron, zinc, B vitamins and long chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) which
      provide numerous benefits to human health, particularly related to cardiovascular disease
      (CVD) risk. N-3 and n-6 PUFA are a family of fatty acids with important roles in
      cardiovascular health, and it is often recommended in dietary guidelines to replace SFA with
      unsaturated fats, such as PUFA. Owing to the social and economic burden of CVD, increasing
      the proportions of these unsaturated fatty acids, in combination with a reduction in SFA
      within meat, could have a large impact on CVD risk at the population level, whilst retaining
      the beneficial nutrients and n-3 PUFA which meat provides.

      In this research, a total of 90 eligible and consenting participants will be randomly
      allocated to consume three portions per week of n-3 enriched beef (from either dietary
      supplemented or grass-fed cattle) or control beef (from standard supply). This beef will be
      offered within a lunchtime meal and served from the Human Intervention Studies Unit at Ulster
      University, Coleraine for a period of 5 weeks. A fasting blood sample will be taken before
      and after intervention to determine the effect the n-3 enriched beef on cholesterol
      concentrations, lipid profile, PUFA status and inflammation. Blood pressure, stiffness of the
      arteries and body shape, size and composition will also be assessed, and some health and
      lifestyle habits will be captured using questionnaires.
