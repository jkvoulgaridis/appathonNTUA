  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in COPD Assessment Test (CAT) score</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>CAT consists of 8 items scored on a scale of 1 to 5, with a total score range of 0-40. A higher score denotes a more severe impact of COPD on the patient's life.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in COPD Assessment Test (CAT) score</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>CAT consists of 8 items scored on a scale of 1 to 5, with a total score range of 0-40. A higher score denotes a more severe impact of COPD on the patient's life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in 12-item Test of Adherence to Inhalers (TAI-12) score</measure>
    <time_frame>6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>TAI comprises a patient domain (including 10 items) and a healthcare professional domain (including 2 items). Each item ranges from 1 (lowest adherence) to 5 (highest adherence) points. The patient domain score ranges from 10 to 50. Adherence is rated as good (score =50), intermediate (score = 46-49), or poor (score ≤45). The questions for healthcare professionals are scored with 1 or 2 points (poor or good knowledge of the regimen and/or inhalation technique).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in COPD and Asthma Sleep Impact Scale (CASIS) score</measure>
    <time_frame>6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>It is a self-administered 7-item scale scored on a five-point scale ranging from 0 if the item never applies, to 4 if the item applies very often. A total raw score is produced from the sum of the seven individual scores which is then linearly transformed to a 0-100 total scale score. Higher scores representing greater sleep deterioration in the previous week.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in EuroQoL score</measure>
    <time_frame>6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Il consists of 2 pages, a descriptive system and a visual Analogue scale. The descriptive system comprises 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression), each dimension having 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems. This decision results in a 1-digit number expressing the level selected for that dimension. The digits for 5 dimensions can be combined in a 5-digit number describing the respondent's health state.The VAS records the respondent's self-rated health on a 10 cm vertical VAS with endpoints labelled 'the best health you can imagine' and 'the worst health you can imagine'.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of an 8-item questionnaire on satisfaction and usability of the device score from baseline (Visit 1)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>it contains 8 questions, each scored on a 0-5 Likert scale, which range from 0 (fully disagree) to 5 (fully agree), for a total maximum score of 40. Higher scores indicate a higher ease of use and satisfaction with the inhaler</description>
