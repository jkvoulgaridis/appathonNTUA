  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study was to compare dental caries treatment and follow-up based on an
      elaborate and individualized assessment of caries risk in children, to a simpler risk
      assessment strategy by means of a double-blind randomized clinical trial of two years
      monitoring. Participants will be children from 7 to 11 years old, who pass through the
      screening of the Children's Clinic of the Faculty of Dentistry of the Federal University of
      Pelotas and fulfill the inclusion criteria. A randomized, stratified sample of approximately
      250 children will be included in the study, one group will be composed of children undergoing
      dental caries-related treatment and maintenance, guided by an individualized and multivariate
      risk assessment, and another group of children treated based on dental caries experience
      alone in the deciduous and / or permanent dentition. Recruitment will begin at the beginning
      of 2019, and participants will be followed up for 24 months. Parents will respond to an
      anamnesis, 24-hour dietary recall, food frequency questionnaire, and oral and general
      health-related quality of life questionnaire, children will undergo a clinical examination to
      assess caries, according to the International Caries Detection and Assessment System (ICDAS)
      in its simplified form and evaluation of caries activity. Dental treatments and return
      intervals will be designated according to the individual risk of the patient detected in the
      initial approach according to the group. The study evaluations consist of baseline, 12 months
      and 24 months, data will be transferred to spreadsheets after the different phases of the
      study. Primary outcomes (number of dental surfaces requiring operative intervention) and
      secondary outcomes will be analyzed by Student's t test, quality of life and quality of life
      related to oral health, will be assessed at the beginning of the study and at the end of
      treatment, and compared between the groups.
