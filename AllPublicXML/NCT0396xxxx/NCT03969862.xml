  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background : The NOVEOS® method is a chemiluminescent immunoassay used to provide
      quantitative detection of total IgE and allergen-specific IgE antibodies in human serum.

      The IgE antibody assay has an essential place in the diagnosis of mediated IgE allergies.

      This system could become an alternative to the techniques used today. NOVEOS® uses a quick
      and convenient method to give results concerning the patient's sensitization profile towards
      allergens. The volume required for the assays is 4 μl (against more than 100 μl for current
      techniques), which is particularly important in pediatric and geriatric populations where it
      may be more difficult to take larger samples.

      NOVEOS® also brings true autonomy. In fact, the incorporated reagents provide sufficient
      capacity for 8 hours of continuous testing.

      Objective: Validate the NOVEOS® system as an allergy diagnostic tool, by estimating the
      sensitivity and specificity of the NOVEOS® assays compared to the gold standard diagnostic
      represented by the clinical history and PT positive, for a panel of 20 allergens

      Methods: This is a validation study of a new immunoassay method (Système NOVEOS®).

      The study includes :

        -  A preliminary phase to familiarize the team with the use of the NOVEOS® system. It is
           planned to analyze its technical characteristics: the precision, the sensitivity. Eight
           allergens will be tested, on a cohort of 136 patients

        -  A validation study of the technique as a diagnostic tool for allergy (sensitivity and
           specificity compared to the gold standard represented by clinical history and positive
           PT) and comparison between the new technique and the ImmunoCap® system. Twenty allergens
           will be tested prospectively, each on 50 cases and 10 controls. A single patient may be
           both a case for an allergen and a witness for another. For rare allergies, the blood
           database of the Allergy Service will be used, and affected patients will be contacted to
           request their non-opposition.

    <description>The serum-specific IgE assay is an in vitro assay of IgE antibodies that are able to bind specifically to their allergen.
Today, there are techniques that allow the assay of both the IgE reactivity against sources of allergens, but also against the different allergenic components.
The results of the NOVEOS® method will be considered acceptable according to the following criteria:
Total agreement ratio of sample recovery ≥ 0.8
Linear Regression / Correlation between the 2 techniques, R ≥ 0.8</description>
