  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, open-label, phase II trial of cabozantinib in subjects
      with untreated, high risk prostate cancer undergoing radical prostatectomy. This multicenter
      study will enroll 30 subjects. Duke is the lead site for this trial. There will be a second
      site selected TBD.

      Patients will be assigned (first 9 subjects only) or randomized 2:1 to either: (1)
      cabozantinib 40 mg by mouth daily for 4 weeks, followed by a 2 week drug washout period
      before prostatectomy (n = 20), or (2) immediate prostatectomy within 12 weeks of registration
      (n = 10). The first 9 subjects (6 subjects assigned to cabozantinib treatment, 3 subjects
      assigned to immediate prostatectomy) will constitute the Safety Lead-In Cohort, which will be
      only accrued at Duke. After six subjects have received cabozantinib and completed the 57-85
      day safety visit without triggering a stopping rule, subjects may be accrued at the ex-Duke
      site.

      The primary goal is to compare pathologic apoptotic indices (cleaved caspase-3) in
      prostatectomy specimens from patients who undergo immediate prostatectomy (controls) versus
      those who receive with cabozantinib followed by prostatectomy. The secondary objective is to
      conduct immune phenotypic profiling on the peripheral blood and tumor microenvironment in
      prostatectomy specimens from both groups. A statistical analysis will be used to compare the
      apoptotic indices between the two groups.

         13. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study
             drug administration, or may interfere with the interpretation of study results, and in
             the judgment of the investigator would make the subject inappropriate for entry into
             this study.

         14. Inability to swallow tablets.

         15. Diagnosis of another malignancy within 2 years before first dose of study treatment,
