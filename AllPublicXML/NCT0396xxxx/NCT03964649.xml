          -  At least one claim for methotrexate during the variable-length pre-index period.

          -  At least one claim for tofacitinib or bDMARDs between 01 February 2016 and 31 July
             2019 (the identification period).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with claims for other conditions for which bDMARDs are used during the
             one-year pre-index period or on the index date: ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn's
             disease, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, or ulcerative colitis will be excluded from
             the study.

          -  Patients with evidence of the index medication during the one-year pre-index period
             will be removed from the analysis. Patients will be allowed to have been treated with
             (other) bDMARDs during the one-year pre-index period.

          -  Patients with more than 1 bDMARD or bDMARD with tofacitinib filled on the index date
             will be removed from the study.
