  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the effectiveness of a traditional, continuous walking rehabilitation
      program for people with MS to the novel intervention of an intermittent or interval walking
      rehabilitation program. Half of the participants will receive the continuous walking program
      while the other half will receive the novel intermittent walking program.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The typical rehabilitation of walking difficulties for people with MS has included practice
      walking. In general, this includes training to build walking endurance by having the person
      with MS walk until he/she becomes tired and needs to stop. Although this model has been used
      successfully to treat people with other diagnoses, it has limited effectiveness in improving
      walking ability and endurance in people with MS because of fatigue. Recently, a different
      model has been considered: intermittent or interval walking training. Interval walking
      training is organized such that seated rest breaks are intentionally interspersed between
      walking training bouts that end before the person with MS becomes too tired to continue.
      Exploratory research has shown that people with MS can walk faster and farther when using
      interval walking training, and may have more improvements in walking ability and endurance
      after using interval walking training. This study will compare the effectiveness of the
      traditional model of continuous walking training to the promising new model of interval
      walking training. This will help to determine whether interval or continuous walking training
      is superior in improving walking ability and endurance in people with MS.

    <description>A survey that measures a participant's perception of how his/her walking ability is affected by multiple sclerosis. The scale ranges from 0-100 with lower scores representing a lesser impact of multiple sclerosis on the participant's walking ability. There are no subscales.</description>
