  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are more than 300,000 new cases of Lyme disease every year in the US. Lyme disease is a
      dangerous bacterial infection transmitted by tick bites and it becomes increasingly severe as
      the infection progresses. Definitive diagnosis is based on serum-based tests that have
      fundamental limitations: 1) current tests cannot detect early infections so patients do not
      receive antibiotic therapy until the infection has progressed, and 2) there is no way to
      measure if antibiotic therapy has been successful. MicroB-plex will address these two unmet
      clinical needs by introducing a novel, blood-based diagnostic method that will enable
      clinicians to diagnose infections earlier and to monitor the success of their interventions.

    <textblock>
      Lyme disease is the most commonly reported arthropod-borne infection in the US with recent
      CDC estimates eclipsing 300,000 new cases in 2013. In addition to growing in frequency, the
      infections have a complex and increasingly severe course. Beginning with mild flu-like
      symptoms and frequently a signature bull's-eye rash, erythema migrans, Lyme disease can
      progress to severe articular, neurological and cardiac symptoms, most of which are
      preventable with early antibiotic therapy. Leading investigators have identified two major
      shortcomings to the current serology-based methods for the definitive diagnosis of Early
      Localized Lyme disease. First, the clinical sensitivity in the first four weeks is poor,
      under 50% at the time of symptom onset, so many patients remain undiagnosed or unconfirmed
      until the disease has had time to progress. Second, serum antibody levels remain elevated
      long after the infection has been resolved making the monitoring of therapeutic success or
      diagnosis of re-infection virtually impossible. MicroB-plex will address these shortcomings
      by using a novel sample matrix from circulating antibody secreting cells (ASC) for diagnosis
      of Lyme disease. This novel matrix is MENSA (medium enriched for newly synthesized antibody).
      In this study, MicroB-plex and its clinical collaborators will test whether MENSA is
      effective in early Lyme diagnostic (within the first 2 weeks) and if this new approach will
      track therapeutic success.
