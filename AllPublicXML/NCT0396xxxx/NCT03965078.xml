    <textblock>
      This study examines whether the presence of an epiretinal membrane affects the time to
      resolution, requirement for non-topical treatment, and outcome of pseudophakic cystoid
      macular oedema.

      Cataract surgery is the most frequently performed surgery in the NHS. Cystoid macular oedema
      (CMO, inflammation and fluid accumulation in the central retina) is the most common visually
      significant complication following cataract surgery occurring in 1-2% of cases. Many cases
      resolve with topical anti-inflammatory eye drops. However some cases do not respond and
      require more invasive treatment modalities eg injections into the eye. If CMO remains
      persistent this can lead to permanent visual loss. There is little current knowledge on what
      factors lead to persistence in some cases compared to others. Epiretinal membrane (ERM, a
      fibrocellular membrane that can form on the inner retina) can be associated with a similar
      cystoid macular oedema that often does not resolve until the ERM is removed surgically. This
      study aims to look at whether the presence of an ERM affects how long it takes for cystoid
      macular oedema to resolve following cataract surgery and the requirement for non-topical
      treatment modalities.

      A prospective, non-interventional, observational study design is proposed. Eligible
      participants would be identified at one of several participating NHS hospitals in the Wessex
      Deanery. Subjects with evidence of CMO post-cataract surgery and commenced on treatment would
      be included. Treatment choice is at the discretion of the reviewing clinician and independent
      of the study protocol. Investigations performed would be only those conducted as part of
      standard care. Presence of epiretinal membrane would be determined from review of the medical
      records. Case- records of eligible participants would be reviewed over a 12-month period to
      assess response to treatment and type of treatment(s) used. Based on current surgical data
      recruitment would be estimated to take 18 months to achieve the 165 eligible participants to
      achieve statistical power.

    <description>The time to resolution of the CMO will be calculated from the time of commencement of treatment until the documented time of resolution (based on clinical entry and confirmation on OCT scan). The clinical notes will be accessed at 3 months, 6 months and 12 month time-points to extract this data from the intervening clinical visits. The patient will complete the study either once the CMO is determined to have resolved or at 12 months post-commencing treatment, whichever is sooner.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or Female, aged 18 years or above.

          2. Clinical diagnosis of visually significant pseudophakic CMO in ipsilateral eye within
             12 weeks of cataract surgery.

               -  The clinical diagnosis needs to be made by an ophthalmologist of Grade ST3 or
                  higher.

               -  Visually significant is defined as best recorded visual acuity 6/9 Snellen or

             Grover et al [12] and Wolf-Schnurrbusch at al [13] (For clarity the OCT examination
             does not need to be undertaken on the same day as the clinical diagnosis of
             pseudophakic CMO. Any OCT examination undertaken after cataract surgery to the
             ipsilateral eye within the treatment period showing these characteristics will be
             acceptable to substantiate the clinical diagnosis of pseudophakic CMO.
