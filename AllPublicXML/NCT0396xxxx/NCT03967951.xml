  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to quantify inter-observer variability in delineating pancreatic
      neuroendocrine neoplasm (PanNEN) on Computerized Tomography (CT) images and its impact on
      radiomic features (RF), subsequently to this determination, to use CT texture analysis to
      predict, histological characteristics of PanNEN on CT scans.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CT imaging is the most widely used modality for studying radiomic features due to its ability
      to assess tissue density, shape, texture and size before, during and after therapy. To the
      best of the investigator's knowledge, the impact of inter-observer delineation variability on
      the reliability of CT RF for PanNEN patients, including Hounsfield unit (HU) values-, shape-,
      and texture-based features, has not yet been assessed. One this has been determined, an
      additional evaluation will be conducted to correlate the morphologically observed images with
      their histopathological characteristics.

      The ultimate potential objective of this research is to identify and predict characteristics
      of aggressiveness of PanNEN in CT scans.

    <description>Radiomic features will be calculated and extracted from all contrast and non-contrast CT-scans. First order features will be evaluated and high order features will be grouped in parent matrices. Parent matrices of second and third order will be chosen and evaluated.
In the second part, based on the results of inter-correlation of the operator analysis, the most significant radiomic features will be chosen. Morphological and histopathological features will be evaluated will be.
Histopathology will be performed on a biopsy specimen; percentage of Ki67 and grading will be evaluated.</description>

        Monocentric, retrospective, observational study. Subjects who fulfill the inclusion
        criteria will be randomly chosen from our Institutional data-base. Thirty patients will be
        used to evaluate inter-observer variability and forty patients will be used to evaluate
        histological characteristics on CT-scans with and without contrast agent).

        Imaged based and clinical variables will be used to construct an overall status of the
        patient.
