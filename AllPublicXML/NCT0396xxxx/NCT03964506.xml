      Subjects with Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who are
      considered eligible for allogeneic stem cell transplant by the transplant team at WCI (Wilmot
      Cancer Institute)will be enrolled in the study. Patients will receive Melphalan on day -2 and
      HBO (Hyperbaric Oxygen) therapy on day 0 of the transplant. After neutrophil recovery is
      documented, the patients will be seen in clinic at least weekly through day +100.

      Subjects with Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), who are
      considered eligible for allogeneic stem cell transplant by the transplant team at WCI(Wilmot
      Cancer Institute) will be enrolled in the study. Melphalan 140mg/M2 will be given IV over
      4-hours once on day -2 of the preparative regimen. Patients will receive HBO therapy on day 0
      of the transplant. The treatment consists of exposure to hyperbaric oxygen at 2.5 atmospheric
      absolutes (ATA) for a total of 90 minutes after compression to 2.5 atmosphere absolutes (ATA)
      in a monoplace hyperbaric chamber (Model 3200/3200R, Sechrist Industries, Inc., USA),
      breathing 100% oxygen. The subjects will be in the chamber for a total of 120 minutes as
      approximately 10-15 minutes were spent during the compression and decompression phases and
      subjects had 10 minute room air breaks every 30 minutes of hyperbaric oxygen treatment.
      Patients will be seen daily until neutrophil count engraftment is documented. After
      neutrophil recovery is documented, the patients will be seen in clinic at least weekly
      through day +100. A final visit will be scheduled day +100. As part of routine care, subjects
      will be followed daily or as directed by the treating physician until neutrophil recovery,
      defined as three consecutive days of achieving a neutrophil count of &gt;500/mm3. Laboratory
      testing will occur per institutional guidelines. Follow-up will continue until Day +100.
      Donor chimerism and disease status will be determined by bone marrow biopsy on Day +30 and
      day +100 post-transplant.
