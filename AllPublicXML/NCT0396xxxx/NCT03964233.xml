      Phase Ia - Dose Escalation

      The main objective of the dose-escalation part is to determine the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) of BI 907828 in combination with BI 754091 and BI 754111, based on the frequency of
      patients experiencing dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), and/or the recommended dose for
      further development of BI 907828 in combination with BI 754091 and BI 754111, and to evaluate
      safety and tolerability of BI 907828 in combination with BI 754091 and BI 754111 by
      monitoring the occurrence and severity of adverse events (AEs).

      The secondary objectives are the determination of the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of BI
      907828, BI 754091 and BI 754111 based on Cmax and AUC0-tz, and the preliminary assessment of
      anti-tumor activity.

      Phase Ib - Dose Expansion

      The main objective of the dose-expansion part is to assess the preliminary efficacy of the
      combination of BI 907828, BI 754091, and BI 754111.

      The secondary and further objectives are to further assess the safety, the PK profiles at the
      recommended dose for expansion (RDE), and to determine the Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D).

             female patients who do not agree to the interruption of breast feeding from the start
             of study treatment to within 30 days after the last study treatment.

          -  History (including current) of interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis within the
             last 5 years.

          -  History of severe hypersensitivity reactions to other monoclonal antibodies

          -  Immunosuppressive corticosteroid doses (&gt;10 mg prednisone daily or equivalent) within
             4 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment.

          -  Active autoimmune disease or a documented history of autoimmune disease, except
             vitiligo or resolved childhood asthma/atopy

          -  Active infection requiring systemic treatment (antibacterial, antiviral, or antifungal
             therapy) at start of treatment in this trial.

          -  Any of the following cardiac criteria:

               -  Mean resting corrected QT interval (QTc) &gt;470 msec

               -  Any clinically important abnormalities (as assessed by the Investigator) in
                  rhythm, conduction, or morphology of resting ECGs, e.g., complete left bundle
                  branch block, third degree heart block

               -  Any factor that increases the risk of QTc prolongation or risk of arrhythmic
                  events such as heart failure, hypokalaemia, congenital long QT syndrome, family
                  history of long QT syndrome or unexplained sudden death under 40 years-of-age, or
                  any concomitant medication known to prolong the QT interval

               -  Patients with an ejection fraction (EF) &lt;50% or the lower limit of normal of the
                  institutional standard will be excluded. Only in cases where the Investigator (or
                  the treating physician or both) suspects cardiac disease with negative effect on
                  the EF, will the EF be measured during screening using an appropriate method
                  according to local standards to confirm eligibility (e.g., echocardiogram,
                  multi-gated acquisition scan). A historic measurement of EF no older than 6
                  months prior to first administration of study drug can be accepted provided that
                  there is clinical evidence that the EF value has not worsened since this
                  measurement in the opinion of the Investigator or of the treating physician or
                  both.
