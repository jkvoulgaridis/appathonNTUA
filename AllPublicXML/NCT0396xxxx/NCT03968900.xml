  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The number one preventable cause of death in the world is tobacco use. Cigarette smoking in
      particular, costs an estimated $300 billion due to expenses related to medical care and lost
      productivity. Despite similar smoking prevalence rates, blacks suffer disproportionately from
      smoking-related harms compared to whites.Sleep disparities such as shortened sleep duration,
      shorter circadian periodicity, earlier chronotype, and increased variability of sleep timing
      have been reported more frequently in blacks compared to whites. Given that poor sleep
      quality predicts relapse from smoking cessation programs, particularly among
      socioeconomically disadvantaged adults, sleep deficiencies and irregular timing of sleep may
      impact smoking craving and withdrawal symptoms over the course of the 24-hour day.
      Surprisingly, few studies have examined these temporal patterns of smoking and craving, and
      none with regard to sleep disruption, chronotype or racial disparities. A better
      understanding of these factors may explain heterogeneity within the smoking population,
      especially in minorities. Thus, the purpose of this proposal is to test the central
      hypothesis that the impact of chronotype and impaired sleep on cigarette usage as well as
      smoking dependence, urge/craving, and withdrawal depends on race.

      Three specific aims will determine: contributions of sleep timing and sleep quality and
      quantity to racial disparities in smoking status (Aim 1), objective sleep characteristics and
      smoking behavior among blacks and whites who smoke cigarettes (Aim 2), and whether sleep
      restriction modifies craving and withdrawal in racially diverse smokers (Aim 3).
      Specifically, we will utilize self-report questionnaires, objective measures of sleep quality
      and timing (actigraphy) and circadian phase (dim light melatonin onset), as well as
      ecological momentary assessment of cigarette use, smoking urges, cravings, and withdrawal
      symptoms to identify circadian and sleep characteristics that are most strongly associated
      with smoking status, heaviness of smoking and dependence among blacks and whites. Finally, we
      will test whether acute sleep restriction (4 hours of time-in-bed) versus sleep extension (10
      hours of time-in-bed) modifies craving and withdrawal symptoms following cessation in black
      and white smokers. If successful, the results of this study will result in identification of
      circadian dysfunction and insufficient sleep as mechanisms that underlie the association
      between sleep and cigarette smoking behaviors and dependence in diverse populations.
      Moreover, these findings are likely to inform clinicians of the importance of sleep and sleep
      timing on cigarette smoking behaviors and dependence that will help in the development of
      novel interventions to reduce morbidity and mortality caused by tobacco use.

    <measure>Munich Chronotype Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire that determines chronotype from midsleep time calculated from sleep onset and offset on both free days and work days. Chronotype will be determined from the mid-sleep time on days off . Specifically, Mid-sleep time is equal to Sleep onset + Sleep duration/2. For those who sleep longer on days off than on workdays, we will correct for weekend recovery sleep by subtracting 'sleep debt' accumulated, which is estimated by the following equation: Sleep duration on free days - Sleep duration (average) for the week/2. Chronotype will be categorized by either the median (two categories) or quartiles (to examine more extreme chronotypes).</description>
