      The investigators aim to study the population pharmacokinetics of children receiving the
      anti-infective drugs for treatment of infectious disease in central nervous system.In this
      study, the investigators will detect drug concentration in plasma by using residual blood
      samples of blood gas analysis and other clinical tests and employ computers for constructing
      population pharmacokinetic models.
