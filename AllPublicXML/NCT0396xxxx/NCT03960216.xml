  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A 6-month, parallel-arm, investigator-masked, randomized clinical trial was conducted in
      patients with MetS and severe periodontitis. Participants were randomly assigned to an
      Intensive Periodontal Treatment group (IPT; scaling and root planing and azithromycin
      capsules 500mg/24h/3days) or to a Minimal Periodontal Treatment group (MPT; professional
      plaque removal and placebo capsules). Blood and subgingival microbiological samples were
      collected at baseline, 3 and 6 months after therapy. The primary outcome was between-group
      difference in C-reactive protein (CRP). Secondary outcomes included HbA1c, lipids, α-1
      antitrypsin, fibrinogen levels and subgingival microbiota assessment.
