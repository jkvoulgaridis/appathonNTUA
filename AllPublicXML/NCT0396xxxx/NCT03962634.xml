  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of the study is to compare the success rates of pulpal anesthesia (defined
      as ability to complete the intended dental procedure without the need for rescue anesthesia)
      between Kovanaze nasal mist and Articaine needle anesthesia.

      In June 2016, an intranasal delivery system of local anesthesia called Kovanaze, gained FDA
      approval. [9] Kovanaze is available as a 0.2 ml metered spray and is intended to achieve
      pulpal anesthesia of 5 maxillary teeth on either side of the face. Even though success rates
      between 83 and 90 % have been reported for adults and children &gt;40kg, [10] FDA label (Section
      14.2) provides data for children (&gt;10 kg) indicating that the drug is safe for use in
      children as long as the dose is adjusted to bodyweight of the child. [9]

        -  One 0.1 mL spray for patients weighing 10 kg to less than 20 kg;

        -  Two 0.1 mL sprays for 20 kg to less than 40 kg; or

        -  Two 0.2 mL sprays for patients weighing 40 kg or more.

      With the ability to avoid the traditional painful injection Kovanaze offers promise in the
      field of maxillary anesthesia and this study intends to:

        1. Compare Kovanaze to conventional needle anesthetic children (at least 6 years of age and
           weighing &gt; 20 kg)

        2. Evaluate patient anxiety, tolerance and acceptability of Kovanaze in patients undergoing
           dental procedures
