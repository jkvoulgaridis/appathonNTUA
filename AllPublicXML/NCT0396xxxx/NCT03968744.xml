  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients suffering of Parkinson's Disease will be treated with 50 mg/day of Safinamide per os
      for 2 weeks (escalation phase). Then, safinamide will be increased up to 100 mg/day and, if
      tolerated, the treatment will be taken for 10 more weeks (maintenance phase). Total treatment
      12 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adult patients affected by PD and suffering from motor fluctuations will be screened for
      participation.

      If the inclusion and exclusion criteria are met, the participant will enter in the baseline
      assessment phase and undergo 1 night baseline PSG and 1 week baseline actigraphy. The patient
      will then start the treatment with 50 mg/day of Safinamide per os for 2 weeks (escalation
      phase). Then, safinamide will be increased up to 100 mg/day and, if tolerated, the treatment
      will last for 10 weeks (maintenance phase). At week 12 (end of treatment), the
      questionnaires, actigraphy and PSG will be repeated. A safety follow-up visit is scheduled 4
      weeks after study treatment completion.

      The treatment will be continued thereafter in all patients if medically indicated.

    <measure>Effect of safinamide on overall sleep quality</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To measure the change in PDSS-2 (Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale Version 2) score and the changes in sleep maintenance (=total sleep time/partial sleep time) and sleep efficiency (=total sleep time/ time in bed) scores measured by polysomnography (PSG). PDSS-2 total score ranges from 0 (no disturbance) to 60 (maximum nocturnal disturbance). Scores &gt; 18 are considered as relevant sleep disturbances.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Effect of safinamide on subjective sleep quality and sleepiness</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To measure the change in subjective sleep quality as measured by PDSS-2 subscores and by the electronic diary &quot;Sleep Fit app&quot;, and in daytime sleepiness as measured by ESS (Epworth sleepiness scale) score. PDSS-2 total score ranges from 0 (no disturbance) to 60 (maximum nocturnal disturbance). Scores &gt; 18 are considered as relevant sleep disturbances. ESS score ranges from 0 to 24. Scores &gt; 10 suggest relevant daytime sleepiness.</description>

    <measure>Effect of safinamide on objective motor activity</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Effect of safinamide on subjective motor activity</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To measure the change in motor activity as measured by UPDRS (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale). Higher UPDRS score indicates more severe impairment of non-motor and motor activities.</description>

    <measure>Effect of safinamide on objective sleep parameters and motor symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Effect of safinamide on non-motor symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To measure the change in depressive symptoms as measured by (BDI-II) Beck Depression Inventory and SAS (Starkstein Apathy Scale). Total BDI-II score ranges from 0 to 63 with higher total score indicating more severe depressive symptoms. Total SAS score ranges from 0 to 42 with higher scores indicating more severe apathy.</description>

    <description>To measure the change in quality of life as measured by PDQ-39 (Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39). PDQ-39 is scored on a scale of 0 to 100, with lower scores indicating better health and high scores more severe symptoms.</description>
