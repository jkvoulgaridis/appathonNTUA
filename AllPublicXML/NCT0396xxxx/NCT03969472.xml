  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to investigate the effects of probiotics in combination with pelvic floor
      muscle electrophysiologic therapy on the uterine endometrial repair and reproductive
      prognosis in patients after surgery for intrauterine adhesion

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Post-traumatic repair disorder of endometrium can cause intrauterine adhesions, amenorrhea
      and infertility, which seriously endanger women's reproductive health. In our previous study,
      high throughput sequencing of intrauterine microorganisms showed that the content of lactic
      acid bacteria in the uterine cavity of patients with intrauterine adhesions was significantly
      lower than that of normal people. Concurrently, our previous studies found that chronic
      endometritis can aggravate endometrial fibrosis, then affect the repair of endometrial
      trauma, and increase the recurrence of intrauterine adhesion. Our previous study also suggest
      that stem cells are beneficial to the repair of endometrium. Studies have shown that lactic
      acid can inhibit inflammatory response and regulate the proliferation of intestinal stem
      cells. So can lactic acid also change the microbial environment in uterine cavity to inhibit
      endometrial inflammation and regulate the proliferation of endometrial stem cells to help
      repair endometrial wounds? In addition, electrical stimulation can relieve depression and
      anxiety and play a sedative effect. In recent years, some studies have shown that pelvic
      floor electrophysiological therapy can improve the intimal blood flow resistance index of
      thin endometrium. Therefore, whether or not the pelvic floor electrophysiological therapy can
      repair the endometrium after the intrauterine adhesion. We expect probiotics and
      electrophysiologic therapy can promote endometrial repair after electrosurgical resection of
      intrauterine adhesions.

    <description>The severity and extent of intrauterine adhesions were scored according to a classification system recommended by the American Fertility Society (AFS) (1988 version). A score of 1-4 was considered to represent mild adhesions, a score of 5-8 was considered to represent moderate adhesions and a score of 9-12 represented severe adhesions.</description>
