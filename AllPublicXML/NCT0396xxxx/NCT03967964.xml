             stimulating hormone (FSH) levels; or amenorrhea of 6 to 12 months, in which the
             postmenopausal state will be confirmed with a FSH level of 0.040 international units
             per milliliter or higher.

          -  Body Mass Index between 19 and 30.

          -  Intact uterus.

          -  Not having received hormone therapy in the month prior to selection.

          -  Adequate veins to conduct serial blood samplings.

          -  Recent Pap smear (not more than 12 months), with a result negative for malignant
             neoplastic cells, and that contains sufficient endocervical cells for analysis. If the
             Pap smear was performed more than 12 months ago or cannot be verified through clinical
             documentation, it must be repeated during the selection process.

          -  Normal mammogram, BI.RADS I or II (American College of Radiology), within the last
             year. If the mammogram was performed more than 12 months ago or cannot be verified
             through clinical documentation, it must be repeated during the selection process.

          -  That provide written informed consent.

          -  Use at randomization of phenytoin, barbiturates, primidone, carbamazepine, rifampin,
             griseofulvin, ketoconazole, lipid-lowering agents.

          -  History of diseases such as coronary heart disease, breast cancer, uterine cancer,
             and/or chronic hepatic disease.

          -  Unconscious volunteers, severely ill, or with mental disability.

          -  Allergy and hypersensitivity to DHEA and/or testosterone.

          -  Untreated or uncontrolled hypertension, with systolic pressure above 140 mm Hg or
             diastolic pressure above 90 mm Hg.

          -  Current participation in other research at the moment of the screening visit, or
             having concluded their participation in a previous research in less than 30 days since
             their last visit.

          -  Pregnant or lactating women; pregnancy must be confirmed with a urine positive human
             chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) test during screening.

          -  History of vein thrombosis (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism).

          -  History of arterial thrombosis (myocardial infarction) or prodromic conditions (e.g.
             transient ischemic attack, angina pectoris).

          -  History of stroke.

          -  History of migraine with focal neurological manifestations.

          -  History of hepatic tumor (benign or malignant).

          -  Diabetes mellitus that will be ruled out at screening if fasting glucose is less than
             100 mg/dL or between 100 and 125 mg/dL, with Oral Glucose Tolerance Test that rules
             out diabetes. Diabetes will be confirmed with blood glucose equal to or above 200
             mg/dL or 2 fasting glucose tests equal to or above 126 mg/dL.

          -  High density lipopolysaccharide (HDL)-cholesterol below 35 mg/dL.
