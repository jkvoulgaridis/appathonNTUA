      Aim: The aim of this retrospective study was to assess the frenum attachment recurrence and
      evaluate clinical parameters after conventional and diode laser-assisted frenectomy in
      patients with different abnormal frenum insertions.

      Methods: Data records of 429 patients treated with maxillary labial frenectomy between
      January 1, 2016 and January 1, 2018 were screened. Records of 70 patients meeting the
      inclusion criteria were evaluated. Data were analyzed in terms of gender, age, category of
      frenum, presence of diastema, operation technique, type of periodontal disease. The distance
      between frenum attachment and mucogingival junction (FMGJ), plaque index (PI), gingival index
      (GI) and probing depth were assessed.

    <description>In the laser-assisted frenectomy, a diode laser device (GIGA Cheese II®, China) (λ= 810 nm) with a 400 µm diameter, plain-ended optical ﬁber tip was used for the procedure maintaining contact with oral mucosa at 2,5 W, 70 Hz frequency with a short pulse (140 microseconds) duration.</description>
