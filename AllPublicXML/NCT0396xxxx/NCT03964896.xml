    <textblock>
      This clinical trial studies how well a nurse-driven telephone intervention improves side
      effects in patients with cancer who are undergoing chemotherapy. Receiving calls from a nurse
      at home while receiving chemotherapy may improve the management of side effects and overall
      care in cancer patients.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore the feasibility of a proactive nurse-driven telephone triage intervention for
      patients with cancer receiving first-line chemotherapy in the ambulatory setting.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore the symptom experience of patients receiving a nurse-driven telephone triage
      intervention while receiving chemotherapy in the ambulatory setting.

      II. To explore the satisfaction of patients receiving a nurse-driven telephone triage
      intervention while receiving chemotherapy in the ambulatory setting.

      III. To explore the frequency of emergency room visits and hospital admissions for symptom
      management by patients receiving a nurse-driven telephone triage intervention while receiving
      chemotherapy in the ambulatory setting.

      OUTLINE:

      During standard of care chemotherapy, patients receive up to 18 telephone calls from a nurse
      using a standardized triage call script over 20 minutes.

    <description>Completion is defined as the patient answering the call and completing the assessment; the target completion rate is set as 70%. Completion of nurse-driven calls will be assessed separately by center (breast, sarcoma, head and neck) and globally across all centers. The study will declare the intervention to be feasible within a center if the 90% confidence interval for completion rate is completely above 70% or contains 70%. To calculate the confidence interval, the study will construct a generalized linear mixed model with only a term for intercept.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Symptom experience</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 25 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Will be measured using the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI). This information will be summarized using graphical methods including box-plots and histograms, as well as summary statistics and 90% confidence intervals. The MDASI will be assessed by center and time point, as well as by time point across all centers.</description>

    <description>This information will be summarized using graphical methods including box-plots and histograms, as well as summary statistics and 90% confidence intervals. Satisfaction will be assessed by treatment group and by time point, as appropriate. They will also be assessed by center and again across all centers.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  English speaking

          -  Newly diagnosed patients with a breast, sarcoma, or head and neck cancer diagnosis
             preparing to undergo first-line, standard of care chemotherapy (patients with head and
