  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study was a parallel-group, randomized controlled trial with concealed allocation,
      blinding of investigators and assessors and intention-to-treat analysis. It examined the
      effect of custom-made foot orthoses and heel lifts in children with calcaneal apophysitis.

      It was hypothesized that the primary outcome, pain relief, would be significantly improved
      with the custom-made orthosis compared to the heel lift.
