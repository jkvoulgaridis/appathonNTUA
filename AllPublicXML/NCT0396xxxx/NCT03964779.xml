      The study population will be divided into three groups:

        -  Group (A) consisting of 40 infertile women with either unexplained or anovulatory
           infertility with/without associated male factor of infertility,

        -  Group (B) consisting of 40 infertile women with tubal (mechanical) factor of infertility
           with/without associated male factor of infertility, and

        -  Group (C) consisting of 40 women with exclusive male factor of infertility and will be
           used as a control group.

           . All women will be subjected to:

        -  Informed consent

        -  Full history taking, including age, duration of infertility and whether primary or
           secondary

        -  General and pelvix examination

        -  Trans-vaginal ultrasonography

        -  Determination of hormonal profile (FSH, LH, Estradiol, Prolactin)

        -  Determination of ovulatory status

        -  Determination of of tubal patency

        -  Determination of presence of male factor

        -  Determination of TSH and antithyroid antibodies (antithyroglobulin and antithyroid
           peroxidase) blood levels
