    <textblock>
      prospective multicenter observational study. Parents whose children meet the inclusion
      criteria complete a questionnaire assessing the child's follow-up, the management of the
      current asthma attack, and the treatment provided at home.

      The main objective is to calculate the prevalence of placement of short-acting
      bronchodilators. The secondary objectives are to describe the factors associated with their
      implementation.
