  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Induction of anesthesia and the knee-chest position are associated with hemodynamic changes
      that may impact patient outcomes.

      Changes from baseline in cardiac output and other hemodynamic variables following induction
      of anesthesia and knee-chest positioning were compared. Propofol plasma concentrations were
      also measured after induction of anesthesia and after the knee-chest position.

      The aim of this study was to assess whether planned reductions in target-controlled infusion
      propofol concentrations attenuate the hemodynamic changes associated with anesthesia
      induction and knee-chest position.

      The secondary aim was to quantify the variation in propofol measured plasma concentrations
      (Cm), both after induction and after KC positioning, and correlate them with predicted
      concentrations (Cp) by the Schnider Pk model.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 20 patients scheduled for elective lumbar spinal surgery in the knee-chest
      position were included. In addition to standard anesthesia monitoring, bispectral index and
      noninvasive cardiac output monitoring were undertaken. The study was carried out in 2 parts.
      In phase 1, target-controlled infusion propofol anesthesia was adjusted to maintain BIS 40 to
      60. In phase 2, there were 2 planned reductions in propofol target concentration: (1)
      immediately after loss of consciousness: reduction calculated using a predefined formula, and
      (2) before positioning: reduction equal to the average percentage decrease in CO after
      knee-chest position in phase 1.
