  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diamond Blackfan anemia (DBA) is a rare inherited pure red cell aplasia. The two main
      non-stem cell transplant therapeutic options are corticosteroids and red blood cell (RBC)
      transfusions. About 80% of DBA patients initially respond to corticosteroids, however, half
      of the patients cannot continue due to side effects or loss of response. These patients are
      then typically dependent on RBC transfusions throughout life. Each of these treatments is
      fraught with many side effects and significant morbidity and mortality are potential
      consequences of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT). The majority of individuals
      with DBA have mutations in genes encoding structural proteins of the small or large ribosomal
      subunit leading to deficiency of the particular ribosomal protein (RP). Using the RP
      deficient zebrafish embryo model, high throughput drug screens have demonstrated a strong
      hematologic response to several calmodulin inhibitors. One of these chemicals is
      trifluoperazine (TFP). TFP treatment of a mouse model of DBA also increased the red blood
      cell count and the hemoglobin (Hb) levels in the mice. TFP is a FDA-approved typical
      antipsychotic agent that has been available since 1958 with a well-known safety profile. In
      the United States, TFP is approved for the short-term treatment of generalized non-psychotic
      anxiety; treatment or prevention of nausea and vomiting of various causes; and, management of
      psychotic disorders.

      This study aims to determine the safety/tolerability of TFP in adult subjects with DBA. TFP's
      expected dose-limiting toxicity is primarily neurologic (extrapyramidal) when used long-term
      at typical anti-psychotic doses (range 10-50 mg daily). Non-neurologic adverse effects in
      subjects with DBA have not been investigated. We will perform a dose escalation study to
      define the safety and tolerability of lower doses of this agent in subjects with DBA. To
      mitigate the potential risks of administering TFP to this new population, we will (1) start
      dosing at dose levels well below those prescribed for psychosis, (2) dose escalate to a
      maximum of 10 mg daily (the lowest dose typically prescribed for psychosis), and (3) perform
      weekly safety monitoring. Given the positive signal in DBA animal models and the 60-year
      clinical experience with higher doses of TFP, this drug warrants a trial in humans to assess
      tolerability in DBA.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a dose escalation safety/tolerability study to evaluate the presence of TFP-related
      adverse events in DBA subjects, and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of TFP in
      DBA.

      If tolerated, this trial will support either a proof of concept trial of low-dose TFP in DBA,
      or the advancement of a chemically modified TFP-like drug (to alleviate the neurologic
      toxicity) for the treatment of DBA.

    <description>Each subject will undergo weekly safety assessment using the Simpson-Angus Extrapyramidal Side Effects Scale to determine the safety of TFP in this new population of patients. The subjects will also undergo weekly bloodwork to evaluate for any liver or kidney abnormalities as well as a complete blood count and reticulocyte count. All dosed subjects will be followed for an additional 1 week after discontinuing study drug (post-study safety follow-up). There will be no more than 6 subjects enrolled at any particular time.
Treatment will be discontinued for any subject if their Hb is &gt; 12 gm/dL , and not associated with RBC transfusions.</description>
