    <textblock>
      Background: Chronic non-specific low back pain is defined as unknown mechanical
      musculoskeletal pain lasting more than 3 months. Electrotherapy is a non-pharmacologic,
      non-invasive and simple method back pain treatment that is mainly applied using
      interferential (IF) therapy. The current study was designed to investigate the effect of IF
      on pain, range of motion, and quality of life in patients with chronic non-specific low back
      pain. Materials and methods: 61 patients suffered from chronic non-specific low back pain
      (CNLBP) were randomly assigned to IF group (n=30) and placebo IF (n=31). The entire patient
      received suggested exercise 3 times per week for 4 weeks. The outcome measures were visual
      analogue scale (VAS), lumbar range of motion (ROM) in terms of flexion&amp; extension and the
      Short Form-36 (SF-36) health questionnaire to evaluate the quality of life (QOL).

      Participants The study was conducted in outpatient clinics in Cairo University Hospitals. 60
      patients (29 males and 31 females) were invited to participate in the current study. Subjects
      were included in the study if they had LBP of at least three months duration and aged between
      25 and 60 years. Patients with spinal pathology (tumor, nerve root, fracture, and
      compromise), cardiopulmonary conditions, pregnancy, and received physiotherapy in the last
      eight weeks or any contraindications to the use of electrotherapy were excluded.

    <measure>Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The severity of pain was evaluated using a visual analogue scale (VAS). The participants were requested to put a line on the scale perpendicularly that matched to their pain intensity. VAS scores represent the pain intensity as none, mild, moderate, or severe. The accompanying cutoff was used for the pain scale: 0- 4 , no pain; 5- 44, mild pain; 45- 74, moderate pain; and 75-100, severe pain</description>
