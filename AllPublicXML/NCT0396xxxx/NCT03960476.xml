  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to better understand how older adult aging-in-place/long term care decision
      making and implementation is impacted by age-related changes (e.g. cognition, health
      literacy, chronic conditions), social influences (e.g. caregivers/supporters), and
      environmental factors.

      Subjects who are part of the NIA-funded LitCog study will be given access to
      PlanYourLifespan.org, a web-based decision-making and planning tool. Participants will be
      followed for up to 42 months to examine the mediating/moderating factors involved in
      decision-making, timing of decision implementation, and goal concordance. Findings have the
      potential to inform healthcare providers, caregivers, health/long term care insurers, area
      agencies on aging, and older adults nationally in supporting aging-in-place decisions and
      services use.
