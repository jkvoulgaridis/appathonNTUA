  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic sun exposure enhances the incidence of cutaneous neoplasms (NMSC - non melanoma skin
      cancer), wrinkles, roughness, telangiectasia and irregular pigmentation of the skin.
      Nowadays, actinic keratosis (AK) are considered in situ squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and
      should be managed that way. Conventional topical Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has proven its
      efficacy on treatment of AK and cancerization field. PDT's action in global improvement of
      photodamaged skin, texture, pigmentation and reduction of wrinkles has been well documented
      in literature. Immunohistochemical and histopathological essays describe the hypothesis of
      conventional PDT's mechanisms of action in photoaging by dermal remodeling, with enhancement
      of collagen, statiscally significant. Daylight-Photodynamic Therapy (DL-PDT) is a new
      modality that keeps the efficacy of topical PDT in treatment of AK and cancerization field,
      but painless and more practically. Until this moment, there is no report of DL-PDT efficacy
      on photorejuvenation and actinic keratosis evaluated by clinical, histopathological and
      immunohistochemical studies. The investigator's aim is to evaluate the alterations induced by
      isolated DLPDT or DLPDT associated with other techniques of transepidermal drug delivery (CO2
      laser, micro needling and microdermabrasion) in the treatment of field cancerization in
      photodamaged skin with actinic keratosis, through clinical evaluation, histopathological and
      immunohistochemical studies. It is an interventional prospective randomized study performed
      in forty patients attended at the Dermatology Service of Hospital Universitário Antonio
      Pedro- Universidade Federal Fluminense.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, prospective intervention study on the clinical, histological and
      immunohistochemical changes induced by PDT with daylight in 40 patients presenting
      face-photodamaged skin with actinic keratosis, attended at the Dermatology outpatient clinic
      of Hospital Antônio Pedro (HUAP) of Universidade Federal Fluminense - UFF, who meet the
      inclusion criteria and agree to sign the informed consent form (TCLE) for participation in
      clinical research. There will be four treatment groups with different protocols. These
      protocols were chosen by hand draw using two boxes containing folded papers. One with the 4
      numbers of the groups (1, 2, 3, 4), and another with 4 papers with the names of the
      protocols. At each draw, one paper from each box was withdrawn, and the combined results from
      the two boxes defined the treatments of each group. Group I was randomly assigned to perform
      PDT daylight alone (standard procedure); Group II was randomly selected to be carried out of
      PDT daylight with TED (previous application of microdermabrasion with crystal peeling); Group
      III was randomized to be TFD light-day associated with TED (microneedle), and Group IV was
      drawn to be TFD daylight completion with TED (CO2 laser fractionated as preparation). Two
      treatment sessions will be performed with a 4-week interval, regardless of the protocol
      chosen per group. Patients will be numbered according to the registration for participation
      in the study. These numbers will be distributed in 4 groups randomly through the computer,
      using an Apple application called Random (random number generator: seller Mireia Lluch
      Ortoloa, category utilities, version 1). Each daylight PDT session will consist of:
      application of pure chemical sunscreen for 15 minutes; (Metvix®, GALDERMA), approved by
      ANVISA under Registration No. 1291600650016, for 30 minutes, before exposure to daylight for
      2 hours. Regarding the association of techniques, these will be varied according to the
      group. In the case of skin preparation with microdermabrasion and laser, these will be
      performed immediately after simple curettage, followed by application of the MAL for 30
      minutes. The sunscreen will be applied after microdermabrasion, but applied before the laser.
      In the group that will be submitted to microagglutination, the MAL will be applied after
      simple curettage and before microagglutination. For clinical evaluation, patient data will be
      recorded on the evaluation form, and photographs with the same position and lighting patterns
      will be performed before and after predetermined periods. For histological and
      immunohistochemical evaluations, skin biopsies will be performed before and after 3 months of
      the last treatment session.
