  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Liver abscess is purulent collections in the liver parenchyma that result from microbial
      infection spread to the liver through the biliary tree, hepatic or portal vein and by
      extension of adjacent infection or as a result of trauma. Liver abscesses are most commonly
      pyogenic followed by amoebic and rarely tuberculous or fungal in immunocompromised patients.
      In the developing country amoebic liver abscess is more frequent than the developed country
      but secondary bacterial infection of amoebic liver abscess and polymicrobial pyogenic liver
      abscess are also common.

      Pyogenic liver abscess is commonly a polymicrobial infection caused by mixed enteric
      facultative and anaerobic pathogens. The most commonly isolated organisms are Escherichia
      coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus constellatus, Streptococcus anginosus,
      Streptococcus intermedius, Enterococcus and anaerobes, including Bacteroidesfragilis and
      Fusobacteriumnecrophorum. Amoebic liver abscess most frequently occur following infection
      with the parasite Entamoeba histolytica.

      Liver abscess is a common medical emergency. Prompt empirical antimicrobial with or without
      percutaneous aspiration or drainage of the abscess is therapeutic.

      An empiric antimicrobial regimen for liver abscess should cover enteric gram-negative
      bacilli, streptococci, anaerobes and antamoebahistolytica. Presently a Fluoroquinolone
      (Ciprofloxacin, Levofloxacin) or a Third or Fourth generation Cefalosporine (Cefixime,
      Ceftriaxone, cefepime) or a Beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combination
      (piperacillin-tazobactam or ticarcillin-clavulanate) or a Carbapenem (Imipenem-cilastatin,
      Meropenem, Doripenem, Ertapenem) are being used in combination with or without Metronidazole
      as the empirical antimicrobial regime for the treatment live abscess. There is no randomized
      controlled clinical trial to evaluated and compare efficacy of the antimicrobial regimens for
      the treatment of liver abscess as well as there is no specific treatment guideline for the
      use of empirical antibiotics. There is also no definite proven rational for using
      Cefalosporine, Beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combination or Carbapenem upfront, not
      using Fluoroquinolone in empirical antibiotic regimen for the treatment of liver abscess.
      Injudicious use of broader spectrum antibiotics may also lead to rise in antibiotic
      resistance in future.

      Both ciprofloxacin and Cefixime are effective oral antibiotics as they are well-absorbed
      orally with good oral bioavailability and achieve plasma concentration well above the minimal
      inhibitory concentrations require for the killing of the microorganism. Using intravenous
      (IV) antibiotics upfront, for the treatment of liver abscess in patients who can take orally
      may unnecessary increase the duration of hospital stay, healthcare burden and the cost of
      therapy, as well as the risk of hospital acquired infection.

      So the investigators have planned this randomized controlled double blind study to evaluate
      the efficacy of empirical Ciprofloxacin plus Metronidazole and Cefixime plus Metronidazole
      therapy for the treatment of liver abscess and to compare the outcomes of two different
      empirical antibiotics regimen.
