  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effect of periodontal disease on the general condition of patients remains today
      underestimated in Parkinson's disease. The BUCCO-PARK project aims to carry out an
      exploratory study of oral therapeutic education on the clinical evolution and fate of the
      microbiota of patients undergoing brain stimulation surgery. During the study, patients will
      follow the standard care pathway alone or combined with an oral therapeutic education.
      Biological samples will assess how the microbiota of these patients will be impacted.
      BUCCO-PARK aims to optimize the care of Parkinson's patients by integrating oral care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients included will be randomized in one of both defined groups : experimental group, in
      which patients will receive an oral education or control group, in which patient only follow
      the traditional care pathway.

      Patients will be included in the trial before surgery after medical examination and life
      quality and oral environment evaluations.

      Oral therapeutic education for patients randomized in experimental group will be performed at
      inclusion, and 6, 12 and 24 months after surgery.

      For all patients, an oral examination, an assessment of the quality of life and oral, fecal
      and blood samples will be carried out at inclusion, and 6, 12 and 24 months after surgery.
