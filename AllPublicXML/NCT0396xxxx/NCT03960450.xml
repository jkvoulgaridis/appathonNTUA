  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to evaluate the safety and tolerability of BOS-475 following
      single and repeat topical administration to healthy participants (Part A), and to evaluate
      the safety and tolerability of 42-day repeat topical administration of BOS-475 to
      participants with plaque psoriasis (Part B).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Part A, healthy participants will be randomized to receive a single dose application of
      BOS-475 or vehicle cream. Following a washout period, participants will receive 7 days of
      repeated dosing with BOS-475 or vehicle cream on the back, followed by 7 days of repeated
      dosing of BOS-475 or vehicle cream over the facial area (excluding eye lids and areas around
      the mouth).

      In Part B, participants with mild to moderate stable plaque psoriasis affecting up to 15% of
      their body surface area will be randomized to receive 6 weeks of topical treatment of BOS-475
      or vehicle cream.
