  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      French population grows older year after year: 24.3% people were over 60 years old in 2006
      against 20.6% in 2000 and the expected number might be over 33% in 2050.

      The elderly suffer from lots of illnesses, so they usually take lots of drugs. Therefore,
      this drug use is most likely to have adverse drug reactions.

      Finally, according to Health Ministry, the number of emergency department consultations
      doubled from 1996 to 2016.

      Consequently, it is interesting to study the impact of drug iatrogenic effects on emergency
      consultations.

      It would help to prevent these adverse drug reactions as we prescribe those drugs : First, do
      not harm.

      This will be a retrospective study.

      The number of patients will be defined by the number of visits during a random draw of 10
      emergency department consultation days between 21st June 2018 and 22nd September 2018 in
      Toulon - La Seyne sur Mer public hospital.

      There are between 100 and 300 emergency department consultations per day in this hospital so
      the estimated number of patients will be between 1000 and 3000.

      Every patient who came to hospital for a consultation in emergency department during this
      period of time will be included in the study except those who expressed their opposition to
      their data collection and treatment.

      Each patient will be anonymized with a code defined as follows : N(ame) L(ast name) 001
      (chronological inclusion number)

      Information of the patients involved in adverse drug reactions will be extracted and a
      description of this patient sample will be made.
