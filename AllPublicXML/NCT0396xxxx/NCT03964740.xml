      Single-center open-label randomized pilot study to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of
      a mobile technology based intervention for asthma and obesity control. The interventional
      group subjects received a mobile device with an ad-hoc designed application (called ASMATIC)
      which permitted them to record asthma control variables (peak-flow and presence of core
      symptoms), have daily reminders on their medication for asthma control and advice for healthy
      lifestyle habits, including personalized diet recommendations and exercise monitoring. The
      device also permits a bidirectional communication between the patient and the study staff for
      reporting any emerging issues related to the asthmatic condition of the patient, as the need
      of additional in-personconsultations. The control group is followed-up based on the study
      site usual clinical practice, without any specific intervention.

      The primary study objective is to evaluate whether the use of the ASMATIC mobile application
      use improves parameters of asthma control, obesity control, asthma obese patient's quality of
      life and if it's associated with savings in health-related costs (efficiency assessment),
      compared to the usual clinical practice.

The device also permits the study subject to communicate with the hospital and for the study team to review potential issues of interest on the patient's asthma control parameters which might need an intervention such us additional in-person consultations</description>

             requirements.

          -  Active smokers or ex-smokers in the 6 months previous to study entry.

          -  Subjects currently in immunotherapy treatment or potential candidates for it,

          -  Subjects with asthma non controlled risk factors.

          -  Subjects with any severe or non controlled pathology that compromise their safety
             during their participation study.
