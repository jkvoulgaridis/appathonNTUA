      This study will compare stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) to trans-arterial
      chemoembolization (TACE) as a bridging strategy for patients with HCC undergoing liver
      transplantation. We propose that SBRT will be associated with longer time intervals between
      initial treatment and the need for retreatment, compared to TACE, as a &quot;bridge&quot; to liver
      transplantation in subjects with HCC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who are waiting for a liver transplant,
      local treatment of their disease has become the standard of care in an effort to decrease
      dropout rates and as a means of reducing tumor recurrence after transplantation. For patients
      undergoing local regional therapy as a bridge to transplantation, trans-arterial
      chemoembolization (TACE) is the most commonly utilized treatment. However, the best modality
      for patients undergoing treatment as a bridge to transplantation is unclear. A newer strategy
      for the treatment of HCC is stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). This study will
      compare SBRT to TACE as a bridging strategy for patients with HCC undergoing liver
      transplantation.

    <description>A 45-item self-report instrument to measure health-related quality of life (HRQL) in patients with hepatobiliary cancers and is one of the most widely-used instruments in this clinical area. The FACT-Hep consists of the 27-item FACT-G, assesses HRQL, and the 18-item Hepatobiliary Subscale (HS), assesses disease-specific issues such as pain, appetite, and cramping. The FACT-G evaluates physical well-being, social/family well-being, emotional well-being, and functional well-being. Sections have a 7-day reference period and are scored from 0-4 (&quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;very much&quot;), with higher scores indicating better HRQL. Score ranges are 0-28 for physical well-being, 0-28 for social/family well-being, 0-24 for emotional well-being, 0-28 for functional well-being, and 0-72 for the HS. All subscale scores from the FACT-G and HS can be summed together to create a total FACT-Hep score, with a possible range of 0-180. The FACT-Hep takes approximately 10 minutes to complete.</description>
