      The patients treated in our clinic for epididymoorchitis will be given scrotal shear wave
      elastography by the Department of Radiology and affected testis will be compared to non
      affected testis radiologically. Shear wave elastography is a method of ultrasonography, which
      allows the focused ultrasonographic wave to be directed to the selected tissue to produce
      deformation of the tissue and to obtain the numerical data on the tissue elasticity by
      measuring the speed of the wave when the tissue is recovered. The higher the wave velocity,
      the lower the elasticity of the tissue.

      The data to be obtained by this method will be compared statistically.

    <textblock>
      Epididymo-orchitis is an inflammatory disease of the epididymis and / or testis. The clinical
      picture is manifested by sudden onset testicular pain and swelling. The differential
      diagnosis of testicular torsion should be made in the pediatric age group. While urgent
      surgery is required in testicular torsion, treatment with epididymo-orchitis consists of
      antiinflammatory and cold application. Scrotal ultrasonography is used in the differential
      diagnosis and epididymo-orchitis is diagnosed in epididymis.

      The scrotal ultrasound for the control after the patient's symptoms have regressed gives an
      idea about the course of the inflammatory process. In recent years, the introduction of
      elastography, which is an advanced ultrasound technique, has begun to suggest the evaluation
      of the elasticity of testis and epididymis in various scrotal diseases.

      In epididymo-orchitis, a disease that is known with inflammation of the testicular
      parenchyma, a study evaluating whether there is a permanent change in the testicular
      parenchyma after inflammation has regressed is not yet available in the English literature.
      In this study, it is planned to evaluate the pediatric patients from this perspective and
      contribute to the literature with the results to be obtained.
