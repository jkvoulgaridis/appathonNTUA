  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is still the only treatment
      available to cure acute myeloid leukemia and high risk myelodysplasia. Allo-HSCT has an
      anti-tumor effect (called the graft versus leukemia effect= GVL) mediated by donor
      lymphocytes. This GVL effect is often associated with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).
      Several studies have shown that the relapse incidence is lower in patients developing chronic
      GVHD. These studies confirm the impact of donor immune system on leukemic residual cells. In
      fact, the relapse incidence increased in patients with no sign of GVHD. The investigators
      assume that leukemic cells probably use mechanisms to inhibit the allogeneic response. These
      escape mechanisms to immunosurveillance have been described in other malignancies. Out of
      context of the allo-HSCT, in acute myeloid leukemias and myelodysplasia, correlations between
      the severity of the disease and the presence of regulatory T cells (Tregs) or exhausted T
      cells (PD1 positive) in the bone marrow and in the blood of patients were described at the
      time of diagnosis or relapse. Myeloid Derived Suppressive Cells (MDSCs) have been described
      as capable of inducing Tregs and exhausted T cells in the tumor microenvironment.The
      investigators want to evaluate the role of myeloid suppressive cells in bone marrow after
      allo HSCT. They hypothesize that their presence in bone marrow and / or blood recipient is
      correlated to the relapse incidence.
