    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the frequency and presentations of chronic persistent pain
      in patients after breast cancer surgery at our tertiary care hospital. Results of this study
      will help us to understand the magnitude of problem in our population and making
      institutional guidelines for appropriate management of such patients.

      After approval from the Departmental Research Committee and Institutional Ethical Review
      Committee all adult female patients with known carcinoma of breast who are scheduled for
      elective definitive breast cancer surgery (Mastectomy) from 1st July 2016 to 30th December
      2016 will be enrolled in this audit. Inclusion of patients will be done once operative
      procedure is finalized and consent taken in breast clinic. Those patients who did not give
      consent and those patients who need reoperation on same side for recurrence of cancer or any
      reason will be excluded from this study.

      Data will be obtained from patient's medical record, interview of patient on follow up visit
      at breast clinic and telephonic communication with patient. Variables have been defined and a
      special form has been designed for data collection. All patients will be followed for next
      three months and those who have persistent pain will be followed for six months after
      operation.

      Follow up information will be obtained from patient visiting breast clinic. For any missing
      data patient's medical records will be reviewed and patient will be contacted to know if they
      have chronic post-surgical pain or not. Audit forms will be filled by authors according to
      their availability. The primary investigator or author at breast clinic will keep all forms
      for safe record keeping which shall later be used for data analysis.
