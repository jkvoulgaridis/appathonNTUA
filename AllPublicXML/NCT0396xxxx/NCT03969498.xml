  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A number of case reports describe the association of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL Abs)
      with hematological and solid organ malignancies. Especially in elderly patients, thrombotic
      events associated with aPL Abs can be the first manifestation of malignancy.
      Cancer-associated monoclonal gammopathy of the IgM type can be accompanied by positive lupus
      anticoagulant (LA) or an anticardiolipin (aCL) IgM. Cancer and antiphospholipid antibody
      syndrome (APS) can coexist in sporadic cases, while some cancer patients with or without
      thrombosis may show some transitory aPL Ab positivity, the most striking symptomatic clinical
      feature, catastrophic APS, being even described in cancer patients.

      Some reports suggest a significant incidence of malignancies in APS patients. Cancer was the
      2nd cause of death (13.9%), after bacterial infection, during the 10-year follow-up of the
      1,000 APS patients studied by the Euro-Phospholipid Project Group, but no control group was
      simultaneously evaluated. The risk of cancer in patients with APS is thus still uncertain.

      The Nîmes Obstetricians and Haematologists APS (NOH-APS) study was based on the recruitment
      of a cohort of women with no history of thrombosis, who had experienced pregnancy loss
      fulfilling the clinical criteria of obstetrical APS (oAPS), who were either positive for aPL
      Abs (APS group), or positive for the F5 rs6025 or F2 rs1799963 polymorphism (Thrombophilia
      group), or negative for thrombophilia screening (Control group). We now want to assess the
      comparative incidence of cancer in women for whom an oAPS diagnosis had been made. This
      evaluation will be carried out during the 2017 medical follow-up step, corresponding to a
      median follow-up of 17 years. An external, local population-derived control group, the
      registry of tumors in Montpellier area (Registre des Tumeurs de l'Hérault) will be used to
      compute standardized incidence ratios (SIRs).
