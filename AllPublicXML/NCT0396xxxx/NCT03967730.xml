  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of sonodynamic therapy (SDT)
      in reducing the inflammation of perivascular adipose tissue and increasing peak walking time
      (PWT) among peripheral artery disease (PAD) patients with symptom of intermittent
      claudication.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atherosclerotic lower extremity PAD affects the living quality of more than 20 million people
      in the world. PAD is associated with a major decline in functional status and claudication is
      the most evident symptom. Current claudication therapies reveal significant limitations.
      Pharmacotherapy and exercise are recommended in 2016 AHA/ACC Guideline on the management of
      lower extremity PAD patients with claudication. However, they may not achieve an ideal
      clinical therapeutic effect. Furthermore, endovascular procedure may not be feasible, durable
      or cost-effective, especially in femoropopliteal arteries.

      The aim of this trial is to verify the hypothesis that SDT can reduce the inflammation of
      PVAT and improve PWT among PAD patients with symptom of intermittent claudication.

    <description>Sonodynamic Therapy (SDT) Sinoporphyrin Sodium (DVDMS) as sonosensitizer, is dissolved in 0.9% sodium solution for following skin test and intravenous injection. 0.01mg/ml DVDMS solution (0.1ml) is prepared for skin test followed by 0.04 mg/ml DVDMS solution intravenous injection(0.2mg/kg).The target atherosclerotic lesions are marked on the corresponding skin with ultrasound guidance and underwent ultrasound exposure after 4 hours incubation. The therapeutic ultrasonic transducer is fixed to the marked skin site for 15 min of each lesion. Ultrasound parameters included intensity of 2.1W/cm2 for each lesion, resonance frequency: 1.0 MHz and duty factor: 30%.</description>
