  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall evaluation plan for the Growing Responsible Fathers program (Fatherhood PRIDE)
      will utilize both a process evaluation and an outcomes evaluation, and will include both
      quantitative and qualitative approaches. Pre- and post-test surveys will be used to measure
      short-term outcomes outlined in the logic model including whether or not there has been an
      increase in self-efficacy and knowledge related to personal finance, parent engagement,
      healthy relationships, and education. Pre-test surveys will be administered at intake and/or
      prior to program activity and post-test surveys will be conducted at the conclusion of the
      program activity.

      will utilize both a process evaluation and an outcomes evaluation, and will include both
      quantitative and qualitative approaches. Pre- and post-test surveys will be used to measure
      short-term outcomes outlined in the logic model including whether or not there has been an

      prior to program activity and post-test surveys will be conducted at the conclusion of the
      program activity.

      Intermediate outcomes will be measured using a follow-up survey at six (6) months after
      completing the primary components of the program. The follow-up surveys will be administered
      via a variety of methods in order to increase response rates and will measure outcomes
      identified in the logic model such as knowledge and self-efficacy.

      Additional attempts will be made online through an email invitation as well as with phone
      calls. Center for Community Initiatives staff will be responsible for conducting the
      follow-up surveys with the program participants. Focus groups will be conducted with a
      volunteer sample of participants at the end of their program workshops to assess satisfaction
      with the program, what worked, and what could be improved.

        The program will serve 1350 fathers in Baker, Clay, Duval, Nassau and St. Johns' counties
        in the five year project period. Fathers are referred by the local family courts, re-entry
        centers and the federal and state Healthy Start programs; the child welfare system; and
        other community partners. The program serves two sub-populations: incarcerated fathers and
        community fathers.
