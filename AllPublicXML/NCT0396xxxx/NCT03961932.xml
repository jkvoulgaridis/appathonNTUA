  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of linzagolix in
      subjects with varying degrees of impaired renal function compared to matched control subjects
      with normal renal function
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, non-randomized, open label, single-dose study to evaluate the effect of
      varying degrees of impaired renal function (i.e., mild, moderate, severe Renal Impairment
      (RI), and End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis) on the PK, safety, and tolerability
      of linzagolix and its major metabolite, KP017.

      Up to 40 adult female participants will be enrolled.

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

        Renal Impaired Subjects

          1. Adult female, ≥ 18 years of age at screening

          2. Has a BMI ≥ 18.0 and ≤ 42.0 kg/m^2 and weight ≥ 40 kg, at screening

          3. Aside from RI, be sufficiently healthy for study participation based upon medical
             history, physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and screening
             clinical laboratory profiles, as deemed by the Principal Investigator (PI) or designee

             Subjects with mild, moderate, or severe RI:

          4. Has estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) based on Modification of Diet in Renal
             Disease (MDRD) equation at screening as follows:

               -  Severe RI only: ≤ 29 mL/min/1.73m^2 not on hemodialysis

               -  Moderate RI only: 30 - 59 mL/min/1.73m^2

               -  Mild RI only: 60 - 89 mL/min/1.73m^2

          5. Has a stable renal function with no clinically significant change in renal status at
             least 1 month prior to study drug administration and is not currently or has not been
             previously on hemodialysis for at least 1 year

             Subjects with ESRD:

          6. Subject is maintained on a stable hemodialysis regimen at least 3 times a week for at

          3. Has a surgical (e.g., hepatectomy, nephrectomy, digestive organ resection) or medical
             condition other than RI which might significantly alter the absorption, distribution,
             metabolism, or excretion of linzagolix and its metabolites, or which may jeopardize
             the subject's safety in case of participation in the study, in the opinion of the PI
             or designee
