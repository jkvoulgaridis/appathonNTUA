    <textblock>
      The Odisha State Malaria Control Program (India) has introduced 'malaria camps' where teams
      of health workers visit villages to educate the population, enhance vector control with
      long-lasting insecticide nets (LLINs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS), and perform
      village-wide screening with rapid diagnostic tests and treatment for malaria. The long-term
      goal of this project is to evaluate the effectiveness of malaria camps (MCs) by determining
      if they reduce malaria, and to characterize malaria transmission in MCs.

    <textblock>
      The persistently high malaria burden in the remote forested areas of Odisha, India has led to
      the introduction of 'malaria camps' by the Odisha State Malaria Control Program where teams
      of health workers visit villages to educate the population, enhance vector control with
      long-lasting insecticide nets (LLINs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS), and perform
      village-wide screening with rapid diagnostic tests and treatment for malaria. The camps
      appear to be very effective but this is hard to assess in the context of ongoing changes such
      as LLIN introduction. The long-term goal of this project is to evaluate the effectiveness of
      malaria camps (MCs) by determining if they reduce malaria, and to characterize malaria
      transmission in MCs. The major objective to achieve this is through a quasi-experimental
      study (i.e., pretest-post-test control group design) of the effectiveness of the
      intervention, to determine if MCs reduce the prevalence of clinical and asymptomatic malaria
      as detected by PCR. In the first year, villages will be assigned across three study arms: arm
      1 to receive new MCs; arm 2 is a control with no MCs but with standard malaria control; and
      arm 3 consists of villages already in receipt of MCs to study longer term effects. In the
      second year, both arm 1 and arm 2 villages will receive the intervention (i.e., a
      non-randomized stepped-wedge design). MC effectiveness will be evaluated from epidemiologic
      surveys and PCR detection of malaria prevalence with and without MCs.

    <measure>Parasite presence</measure>
    <time_frame>24 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The standard molecular method of (conventional) PCR + gel electrophoresis will be used to measure parasite presence. All reactions are run with Plasmodium positive controls and negative controls. 10% of samples are QC-ed at second independent site.
The results can be continuous and categorical. Continuous variables will be transformed into categorical variables, so that infections can be sub-divided into symptomatic or asymptomatic.</description>

    <time_frame>24 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by quantifying the number of gametocyte infected erythrocytes and dividing by the number of leukocytes or by quantitative reverse transcriptase real time PCR. Both results can be measured continuously and categorically (data will be transformed). To account for a mixed-infection (either by species or by multiple strains) we will take the gametocyte to trophozoite ratio to reduce any apparent bias.</description>

    <measure>BMI</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Height in cm will be measured with a height measuring tape. Weight in kg will be measured with a scale. Participants will be asked to remove shoes and shawls or cardigans, or other clothing that can be removed without ethical concerns.
BMI will be calculated as (kilograms/meters squared). Measures will be adjusted by age using the WHO Multicentre Growth Reference Study Group's 2006 WHO Child Growth Standards: Length/height-for-age, weight-for-age, weight-for-length, weight-for-height and body mass index-for-age: Methods and development.
Categorical BMI measurements will be based on standards for Asian Indians: Misra A, Chowbey P, Makkar BM, et al. Consensus Statement for Diagnosis of Obesity, Abdominal Obesity and the Metabolic Syndrome for Asian Indians and Recommendations for Physical Activity, Medical and Surgical Management.</description>

    <description>Mid-Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC) Mid-Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC) is the circumference of the left upper arm, measured at the mid-point between the tip of the shoulder and the tip of the elbow (olecranon process and the acromium). Participants will be asked to remove any clothes that may hinder the measurement (preferable directly on skin, but tight clothes can be accepted if they are difficult to remove).
MUAC will be measured in cm to one decimal using a Myotape/tape measure.</description>

    <description>The Govt. of India Malaria Control Programme (MCP) of Odisha provides ITNs and IRS, and trains community health workers (ASHAs) on the diagnosis and treatment of malaria, providing them with antimalarial drugs so that malaria treatment is available even in remote villages. Faced with a persistent burden of malaria in forest villages, the MCP recently introduced malaria camps (MCs) combining focused screening and treatment in villages with intensified vector control. The program includes one round of testing and treatment for the whole village population before the monsoon season, followed by one round of screening and treating of fever cases only during the monsoon season.</description>
