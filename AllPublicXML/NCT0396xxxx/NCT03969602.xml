  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Catastrophizing has emerged as the strongest independent predictor for persistent
      postsurgical pain. Although behavioral interventions, including Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
      (CBT), have been shown to reduce the impact of persistent pain, postsurgical patients have
      not historically been offered these interventions. The aim of our study is to examine whether
      an intervention targeting pain catastrophizing can reduce the risk of persistent pain and
      disability after spinal fusion.

      Our primary hypothesis is that a perioperative cognitive behavioral intervention with the
      goal to decrease anxiety and pain catastrophizing will decrease the risk of persistent pain
      and disability after spinal fusion surgery in high catastrophizing patients.

      To study this hypothesis the investigators will perform a prospective, randomized, controlled
      multicenter trial with 1:1 allocation, comparing 2 cohorts.

      Patients aged &gt; 18 years/old, with a primary diagnosis of spinal stenosis, degenerative or
      isthmic spondylolisthesis or degenerative disc disease (DDD) determined by expert spine
      surgeons and selected for lumbar spinal fusion surgery with decompression will be screened
      for high levels of pain catastrophizing using the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS). Patients
      with a score of ≥ 24 on the PCS who will consent to the study will be randomized to CBT (2
      sessions preoperatively and 4 sessions postoperatively) plus usual care (experimental group)
      or usual care (control group). To limit expectation bias, an educational intervention will be
      added in the control group.

      Primary outcome is the Core Outcome Measure Index (COMI) at 12 months. Secondary outcomes are
      scores on 11-point Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) for back and leg pain, Oswestry Disability
      Index (ODI), Patient-reported outcomes measurement - depression (PROMIS-D), Patient Global
      Impression of Change (PGIC), Pain Catastrophizing (PCS), reliance on analgesics and
      employment status. NRS will be measured on the 4th postoperative day, at 8 weeks, 6 months
      and 1 year, while all other outcomes will be measured at 8 weeks, 6 months and 1 year.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of moderate to severe chronic postsurgical pain (CPSP) at 12 months after
      surgery is circa 12% in Europe, depending in part upon the surgical procedure. Worldwide,
      more than 230 million people undergo major surgery every year; the global annual cost of new
      cases of CPSP is in the hundreds of billions of dollars. The response to this costly tragedy
      has been unacceptably slow.

      Perioperative protocols have historically not incorporated routine screening for patients
      at-risk for post-surgery persistent pain or compromised function. However, early detection
      and management of patients at high risk for CPSP may modify the postsurgical pain trajectory
      and reduce the incidence of CPSP.

      In particular, persistent pain and disability after spinal surgery poses a large problem.
      Around 20% of the patients have persistent or recurrent pain in the back or limbs after
      surgical interventions for spinal disease. Several risk factors for such unfavorable outcomes
      have been identified, among which psychological factors. The most robust psychological
      predictors of high levels of acute postsurgical pain and of persistent pain in the back or
      limbs after spinal surgery are high levels of preoperative anxiety and pain catastrophizing.

      Psychological variables are modifiable and could be target for intervention. Cognitive
      Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is the leading psychological treatment for chronic pain. CBT aims to
      reduce maladaptive cognitions and behaviors and replace these with more adaptive ones. CBT
      has been shown to reduce anxiety and catastrophizing and to increase self-efficacy and
      feelings of control beliefs and through this lowers pain-related disability and pain
      interference (including sleep problems and depression).

      This study is a prospective, randomized, controlled multicenter trial with 1:1 allocation,
      comparing lumbar spinal fusion surgery outcome between 2 groups with high pain
      catastrophizing, 1 that receives perioperative CBT plus usual care (experimental group) and 1
      that receives usual care (control group). To minimize expectation bias in patients, an
      educational intervention is added in the control group.

      Patients will be enrolled in the Department of Neurosurgery at the Neurocenter of Southern
      Switzerland, Lugano Regional Hospital and the department of Neurosurgery of Zuyderland
      Medical Center, Heerlen, The Netherlands.

      Patients with as score of ≥ 24 on the PCS will be eligible to be randomized to perioperative
      CBT plus usual care or education plus usual care.

      Data collection sessions will occur for each patient randomized, at baseline, at 8 weeks, and
      at 6 and 12 months following surgery. A third, non-randomized group is also included,
      consisting of low catastrophizing patients. These patients will not undergo any additional
      intervention besides usual care, but will undergo the same data-collection as the high
      catastrophizing randomized groups. This offers the possibility to examine whether CBT can
      reduce the negative effects of catastrophizing on outcome to the level of improvement one
      would expect in non-catastrophizing patients. Staff blinded to group assignment will contact
      patients by phone at circa one week before data collection time points to remind them to fill
      in the questionnaires.

      Our primary hypothesis is that patients randomized to the CBT group show a greater
      improvement on the Core Outcome Measures Index (COMI) at 12 months post-surgery compared to
      patients randomized to the control group.

      Secondary hypotheses are that patients randomized to the CBT group show a larger reduction in
      disability (ODI), leg/back pain (NRS), depression and pain catastrophizing (PCS) at 12 months
      post-surgery compared to patients randomized to the control group. Moreover, patients in the
      CBT group report higher global impression of chance, less reliance on analgesics and better
      employment status compared to patients in the control group. Finally, the investigators
      hypothesize that the high catastrophizing group receiving the control intervention will have
      worse outcomes on all measures compared to the low catastrophizing group receiving standard
      care, whereas the high catastrophizing group receiving the CBT intervention will have
      comparable outcomes as the low catastrophizing group.

      All included patients will be assessed before surgery for the outcomes of interest. Patients
      assigned to the CBT intervention condition will attend six individual 60-min CBT sessions (2
      before and 4 after surgery). Patients randomized to the education condition will receive six
      session of biomedical education and an exercise program. Non-randomized low catastrophizing
      patients do not receive an additional intervention. All patients will receive care that they
      would have routinely received had they not been entered in the study (i.e. standard
      postoperative physical therapy). The three groups of patients will undergo the same data
      collection procedures.

      The primary outcome is the difference between the CBT and education group in the COMI change
      score (pre surgery - 12 months post-surgery). The investigators consider a 2-point difference
      (SD=2.5) between the groups at 12 months as clinically meaningful [40]. The effect size of
      this difference is d=0.80. With a 2-sided alpha of .05 and power of .95 a sample size of at
      least 84 patients is needed (42 per intervention group). With a conservative estimate of 1/3
      of patients screening in on the basis of their PCS score (&gt; 24), and 50% declining
      participation, the investigators will need to screen around 500 patients. The two centers
      together perform around 200 elective lumbar fusions every year. Thus, 2,5 years will be
      needed to include a sufficient number of patients. Another 42 patients with a PCS score &lt; 24
      will be included for assessment only (total sample size: 126).

      To test for a difference between groups in the average COMI at 12 months, the investigators
      will use linear regression corrected for baseline COMI. In addition, the difference in
      trajectory of COMI over time will be assessed by means of linear mixed-effects regression,
      taking all follow-up measurements into account. The investigators will assume an unstructured
      covariance matrix for the repeated measures of the outcome variable. Adjustment for type of
      surgery, age and sex will be made and, if necessary, for other control variables
      significantly associated with the outcome.

      Secondary outcome variables will be analyzed similar to the primary outcome, except for
      categorical outcomes. For these, the investigators will use Pearson's chi-square test to test
      for differences in proportions at 12 months post intervention. All analyses will be performed
      according to the intention to treat principle. An alpha of 0.05 will be used to establish
      statistical signiﬁcance.

      Randomization will be stratified for type of surgery (open vs. minimally invasive) and
      surgical indication (degenerative disc disease/lumbar stenosis vs. spondylolisthesis). The
      Project Manager of the Clinical Trial Unit of the Regional Hospital (CTU-EOC) will be in
      charge for computer generated randomization lists. The Project Manager will act as an
      independent external person, not involved in any other aspect of the trial except
      administrative/financial issues.

      The investigators and research assistants assessing outcomes will be blinded to group
      assignment. The psychologist/s delivering the CBT and the clinicians delivering the
      educational intervention in the control group cannot be blinded. Nevertheless, patients will
      be blinded to study hypotheses and will be informed that the study is examining the
      comparative benefits of two treatments that are given in addition to usual care and that may
      potentially improve outcomes. The patients will not be aware of the study hypotheses and will
      not be informed about the likely association between a high PCS score and lower outcomes
      after lumbar spinal surgery, neither about the fact that the control intervention (i.e. an
      educational &amp; exercise intervention that is expected to minimize/cancel any expectation bias)
      will not address catastrophizing.

      The questionnaires are validated tools for patient-reported outcomes and will be completed by
      the patients without the presence of the investigators or other study personnel.

    <measure>COMI (Core Outcome Measure Index)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months post surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The COMI comprises a short set of questions used to assess the impact of spinal disorders on multiple patient-orientated outcome domains. It is based on a set of individual items selected from established questionnaires and recommended for standardized use by an international group of experts in the field. It consists of seven items to assess the extent of the patient's back pain and leg pain, difficulties with functioning in everyday life, symptom-specific well-being, general quality of life, and social and work disability. A summary index score from 0 (best health status) to 10 (worst health status) can be computed by averaging the values of the five subscales.</description>

    <time_frame>8 weeks, 6 and 12 months post surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L questionnaire uses a health state classification defining health in terms of five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: 1= no problems, 2= slight problems, 3= moderate problems, 4= severe problems and 5= extreme problems. The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. This decision results in a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state, ranging from 11111 (no problems in any of the 5 dimensions) to 55555 (extreme problems in all dimensions). The health states are then converted into a single index value from 0 (worse) to 1 (best).</description>

    <description>Participants randomized will receive six individual 1-hour sessions of CBT: two sessions before the operation and four after, delivered by a psychologist trained in CBT for chronic pain. The CBT intervention is tailored to reduce pain catastrophizing. Main techniques are: pain education and the influence of cognitions, emotions and behavior on pain and pain disability; identification of catastrophizing cognitions and replacing them with more adaptive cognitions; stress/anxiety reduction by diaphragmatic breathing and progressive muscle relaxation; emotion regulation skills training; cognitive restructuring; coping skills training to combat helplessness and foster a sense of control and self-efficacy for dealing with acute post-operative pain. The four postoperative sessions build on and further extend the skills learned preoperatively. Each session ends with specific homework assignments. All patients receive a homework book and an individually tailored instruction manual.</description>

    <description>Participants will have six meetings with members of the research team (in person or through telephone). In a first preoperative meeting a member of the team provides verbal information on the preparation for surgery, surgery itself and recovery from surgery, stressing the importance of postoperative exercise. Any questions raised by the patient are discussed. A booklet is provided with information about: structure of the spinal column and spinal diseases; examinations before surgery; the operative environment; surgical procedures; anesthetic procedures; postoperative care and postoperative pain reduction. A second preoperative (telephone) meeting is scheduled to answer any remaining questions. During the postoperative phase, instructions and an exercise manual are provided, Patients keep a diary to record their training activity. Three, six and eight months after discharge patients are contacted by telephone and their training progress is discussed.</description>

    <description>The biopsychosocial approach of CBT focuses on the complex interaction between psychological, social and biological factors. The biopsychosocial model assumes that health problems are hardly ever limited to just one domain of human experience but by multiple domains of human experience. CBT helps patients understand thoughts and feelings that influence behaviors. It consists of a cognitive aspect and a behavioral aspect. The cognitive aspect is based on Becks cognitive model: the way that individuals perceive a situation is more closely connected to their reaction than the situation itself. A person's cognition has impact on their mood and emotions, their bodily reactions and their behavior. The second part of cognitive behavior therapy focuses on the actual behaviors that are contributing to the problem. The goal of CBT is to identify maladaptive thoughts and change them into more realistic and constructive thoughts to modify feelings and behavior and thereby the experience of pain.</description>
