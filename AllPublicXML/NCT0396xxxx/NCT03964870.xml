      Study design: The Spanish registry of RYR1 and CACNA1S polymorphisms (RYCA) is an anonymous
      descriptive observational multicentre study that aims to identify and catalogue the variants
      or polymorphisms in the RYR1 and CACNA1S genes in the Spanish population. Secondarily, its
      correlation with the binding mutations described in both genes at European level by the EMHG
      will be evaluated to assess the incidence of malignant hyperthermia in Spain. The RYCA
      registry complies with the highest standards of European and international homologation, both
      with regard to computer security and the protection of personal data (Data Protection Law
      15/1999).

      Hypothesis: Performing a Spanish registry of RYR1 and CACNA1S polymorphisms will contribute
      to describe the variants present in our environment and determine their relationship with MH
      susceptibility.

      Objectives:

        -  Describe the national polymorphisms of the RYR1 and CACNA1S genes

        -  To evaluate the incidence of genetic MH susceptibility according to the recommendations
           of the EMHG.

      The presence of polymorphisms in a population that has not been studied before may have a
      difficult correlation with the mutations described in the EMHG webpage.

      Eligibility Criteria: The sample contained in the registry will originate from the genetic
      data of patients unrelated to HM who have been sequenced the RYR1 and CACNA1S gene by another
      pathology. The data related to the genetic analysis will be provided without identifying data
      of the patient or the clinical history. There will be no possibility of identification of the
      patient by the team responsible for the RYCA registry, so the request for informed consent is
      not viable. There will be no selection of participants or patient follow-up.

      Methodology: A preliminary pilot study will be conducted in an unselected anonymous cohort of
      the sequenced exome database of the RYR1 and CACNA1S gene at the La Fe Health Research
      Institute (IISlaFe). The population contained in this database is random and unrelated to HM
      and the patients are anonymous, so we do not have access to personal data or medical history.
      If the analysis is feasible, a request for collaboration will be transferred to the Genetics
      Services / Research Units with experience in the exome sequencing of the RYR1 and CACNA1S
      genes. Anonymous readings will be requested to carry out the registration and description of
      the variants existing in the Spanish population and their relationship with the variants
      described by the EMHG.

      Variables: The registry will include the chromosomal coordinates, number of total patients
      included, number of patients whose variant is in heterozygosis, number of patients whose
      variant is in homozygosis and allelic frequency. Thus, for each of the genes of interest, and
      making use of their respective chromosomal coordinates, information regarding the variants
      that these might include will be extracted.

      Sample size. Sample size calculation is not considered since it is a descriptive record.

    <description>The peripheral blood must be extracted by venous puncture. For this, it is necessary to carry out the extraction of the blood by qualified health personnel respecting the corresponding hygienic-sanitary norms. The blood must be in a tube with EDTA anticoagulant (preferably). The method of extraction of peripheral blood DNA: is carried out mainly by automatic procedure using the QIASYMPHONY SP DNA extractor-purifying equipment and the QYASIM DNA MIDI KIT Kit (Qiagen), Cat. No: 931255, following the manufacturer's protocols.
The DNA extraction stage is collected in the GESTLAB system as SAMPLE PROCESSING (it comprises extraction and quantification via Nanodrop, as indicated below).</description>
