      Patients with adenocarcinoma of the gastro-esophageal junction or the stomach who have
      documented progression after being treated with a 1st line chemotherapy which contained at
      least a platinum and 5-FU (5-Flourouracil)can be included. All patients will receive a
      standard second line therapy with paclitaxel and ramucirumab plus the investigational drug
      avelumab, a checkpoint inhibitor. Clinical and radiographic assessment will be performed
      regularly. Patients will be treated until disease progression, untolerable toxicity or
      withdrawal of consent.
