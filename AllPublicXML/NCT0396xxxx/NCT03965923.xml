      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the maternal and infant safety of the dapivirine
      (DPV) vaginal ring (VR) and daily oral Truvada in HIV-uninfected pregnant women and their
      infants.

      Participants will be assigned to one of four cohorts based on gestational age:

        -  Cohort 1: 36 0/7 weeks - 37 6/7 weeks

        -  Cohort 2: 30 0/7 weeks - 35 6/7 weeks

        -  Cohort 3: 20 0/7 weeks - 29 6/7 weeks

        -  Cohort 4: 12 0/7 weeks - 19 6/7 weeks

      Within each cohort, participants will be randomized to receive either DPV VR or oral Truvada.
      Participants randomized to the DPV VR will use the VR continuously for approximately one
      month, replacing the VR each month. Participants taking the Truvada tablet will take one
      tablet orally per day. Participants will use their assigned study product until their
      pregnancy outcome, but no later than 41 6/7 weeks of gestation.

      Participants will attend several study visits throughout the study and study staff will also
      contact participants by phone at different timepoints throughout the study.

      The total duration of study participation will vary depending on gestational age at time of
      enrollment and length of pregnancy prior to pregnancy outcome, and will range from
      approximately 12 weeks or less for Cohort 1 to approximately 36 weeks or less for Cohort 4.
      Infants born to study participants will be followed for approximately 52 weeks.

                  for all Cohorts. The ultrasound should be performed no later than the 36th week

               -  Note: Plans to deliver at a health center or hospital where adequate records may
                  be obtained is inclusionary due to logistical challenges related to collection of
                  vaginal rings (VRs), specimens and delivery outcome data outside of those
                  settings.

          -  At Screening and Enrollment, willing to be randomized at time of enrollment to either
             of the two study arms, and to continue study product use until delivery.

             involving drugs, medical devices, vaginal products, or vaccines for the duration of
             study participation, unless approved by the Protocol Safety Review Team (PSRT).

          -  Per participant report at Screening and/or Enrollment, intends to do any of the
             following during the study participation period:

                  participation.

               -  Relocate away from the study site.

               -  Note: Detection of bacterial vaginosis (BV) or candida in the absence of symptoms
                  is not exclusionary. Otherwise eligible participants diagnosed during screening
                  with a UTI, cervicitis, or STI/RTI requiring treatment per WHO guidelines are
                  offered treatment consistent with WHO recommendations. If treatment is completed
                  and symptoms have resolved within 35 days of obtaining informed consent for
                  screening, the participant may be enrolled.

                  equal to Grade 1.**

               -  Hemoglobin greater than or equal to Grade 2.**

                  improvement to a non-exclusionary grade or resolution is documented within 35
