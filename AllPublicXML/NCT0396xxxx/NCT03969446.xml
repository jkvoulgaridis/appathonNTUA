      This phase Ib trial studies the side effects and best dose of pembrolizumab and how well it
      works in combination with decitabine in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia or
      myelodysplastic syndrome that is newly-diagnosed, has come back, or does not respond to
      treatment. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the
      body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to
      grow and spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as decitabine, work in different ways to
      stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing,
      or by stopping them from spreading. This trial may help doctors find the best dose of
      pembrolizumab that can be safely given in combination with decitabine, and to determine what
      side effects are seen with this treatment.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab in combination with decitabine, by
      evaluation of toxicities including: type, frequency, severity, attribution, time course and
      duration.

      II. Determine the maximum tolerated dose(s)/schedule (MTD) and phase 2 recommended dose(s)/
      schedule (RP2D) of the combination for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and high-risk
      myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).

      III. Obtain preliminary estimate of complete remission (CR/CR with incomplete hematologic
      recovery [CRi]) rate.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Obtain estimates of remission duration and survival probabilities (overall and
      progression-free) at 2 years.

      II. Explore the possible association between pre-treatment PD-1, PD-L1, and PD-L2 and
      clinical response.

      III. Evaluate change in PD-1, PD-L1, PD-L2 levels as a result of the combination therapy.

      IV. Explore the possible association between specific T cell subsets (e.g. CD4 T regulatory
      cells, T naive, effector and memory cells), other immunological correlatives (e.g. T-cell
      receptor [TCR] repertoire analysis) including post-treatment changes, and clinical response
      to combination therapy.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts.

      COHORT I: Patients with AML receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days
      1 and 22 and decitabine IV over 1 hour on days 1-10. Patients who achieve a CR receive
      decitabine on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 42 days for up to 8 cycles or 1 year from
      start of therapy, whichever comes first, in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      COHORT II: Patients with MDS receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 22 and
      decitabine over 1 hour on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 42 days for up to 8 cycles or 1
      year from start of therapy, whichever comes first, in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days, then every 3 and 6
      months for up to 2 years.
