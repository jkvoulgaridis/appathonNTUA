  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgery (under general anaesthesia or under loco-regional anaesthesia) is an event that
      causes stress, anxiety, pain and even minor complications such as nausea or vomiting.
      Peri-operative management and the psychological support allocated to each patient will have
      an impact on the hospitalization experience. Many studies have focused on reducing
      peri-operative mortality (decrease in pain intensity as measured by analog visual scale,
      decrease in nausea/vomiting frequency, decrease in remobilization time, etc.) but few
      assessed the overall recovery of patients. there is a desire to improve physical and
      psychological recovery, with particular attention to the patient's own feelings. It is
      essential to evaluate our peri-operative management practices based on patient-centred
      criteria. In this context, the development of a scale for measuring the quality of
      post-operative recovery appears to be necessary. In 2013, a questionnaire was quickly run
      (about 2-3 min): the QoR-15 was validated. This questionnaire is reliable, sensitive, easily
      achievable in clinical practice, not onerous for the patient and provides information on the
      post-operative recovery perceived by the patient himself.

      The QoR-15 was validated in English, then in Danish, Chinese, Portuguese and more recently in
      Swedish. It has not yet been validated in French and therefore cannot be used in studies on
      francophone patients.

      Investigator goal is to validate a French version of the QoR-15, the FQoR-15.
