      This study is a Phase I trial using an advanced lentiviral vector to deliver a functional
      gene for human clotting factor IX into patients with hemophilia B, to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of infusion of lentiviral gene modified autologous stem cells in patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hemophilia B is a genetic bleeding disorder caused by the lack of ability to produce
      blood-clotting factor IX (FIX). Individuals with hemophilia B suffer repeated bleeding
      episodes, which can cause chronic joint disease and sometimes even death due to the inability
      for blood to clot efficiently. The current treatment is intravenous infusion of clotting
      factor concentrates, either prophylactically or in response to bleeding. The procedure is
      life time long and expensive while still cannot achieve a cure.Gene therapy is a novel
      technology that has been successfully demonstrated in a number of clinical studies for
      diseases such as cancer and genetic diseases. In this study, an advanced lentiviral vector
      system NHP/TYF will be used to deliver a functional FIX gene to overcome human clotting FIX
      gene defect in patients with hemophilia B. This study is a Phase I trial evaluating the
      safety and efficacy for infusion of gene modified autologous stem cells in patients with
      hemophilia B.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Able to provide informed consent and comply with requirements of the study. 2.
             Males ≥2 years with confirmed diagnosis of hemophilia B (endogenous factor IX ≤2 IU/dL
             or ≤2% of normal).

             3. A minimum average of 4 bleeding events per year requiring episodic treatment of
             factor IX infusions or prophylactic factor IX infusions.

             4. No measurable factor IX inhibitor as assessed by the central laboratory and have no
             prior history of inhibitors to factor IX protein.

             5. Agree to use reliable barrier contraception until 3 consecutive samples are
             negative for vector sequences.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Significant liver dysfunction as defined by abnormal alanine transaminase,
             bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase.

             2. History of inhibitor against factor IX. 3. Evidence of active hepatitis B or C and
             currently on antiviral therapy. 4. Have serological evidence of HIV-1 or HIV-2 with
             CD4 counts ≤200/mm3 (subjects who are HIV+ and stable with CD4 count &gt;200/mm3 and
             undetectable viral load are eligible to enroll).

             5. Any evidence of active infection or any immunosuppressive disorder. 6. Participated
             in a gene transfer trial within the last 6 months or in a clinical trial with an
             investigational drug within the last 12 weeks.

             7. Unable or unwilling to comply with study assessments.
