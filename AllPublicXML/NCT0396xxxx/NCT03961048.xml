  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study would like to identify the best starting dose and infusion rate for nerve blocks
      and nerve catheters related to the erector spinae plane block that can improve functional
      status and pain control on cardiac surgery patients and minimize the necessity for opioid
      pain control using a continuous reassessment model.

      The study will continue taking steps in helping to identify the role erector spinae plane
      nerve blocks have in thoracic surgery. This is a relatively new nerve block (first identified
      and described in 2016) and the studies that have been done and the case series that have been
      reported have been very promising in supporting its role in thoracic surgery. As it is a
      plane block (not around a specific nerve but in a general area), larger volumes and doses
      often have to be used in these sorts of blocks (such as a transverses abdominalis plane
      block) to get good spread of the local anesthetic in the plane to reach the desired nerves
      that pass through this plane with one injection. Our hospital has been doing these blocks for
      patients as a standard of care for them, but this study will take a closer look to see if
      there is an optimal dose and volume of medicine to improve patients' functional status and
      pain control to minimize the need for opioids. The study will use a continuous reassessment
      model to determine the optimal dose.
