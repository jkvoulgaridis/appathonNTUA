  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will assess the feasibility and acceptability of a pilot intervention to
      keep people living with HIV (PLHIV) in southern India in care and virologically suppressed.
      The lack of understanding of the causes of loss from the HIV care continuum in India stifles
      the armamentarium of effective interventions to keep Indian PLHIV in care. The results of
      this research will demonstrate the feasibility and acceptability of a pilot intervention
      targeting the multiple mechanisms by which PLHIV become lost to care. By targeting these
      mechanisms, this intervention will be designed to be scalable in a setting where access to
      mental health specialists is limited.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This pilot intervention represents the final Aim of the NIMH-sponsored study &quot;Syndemics and
      Loss from the HIV Care Continuum in India.&quot; This trial will be conducted at the Y.R. Gaitonde
      Centre for AIDS Research and Education (YRG CARE), located in Chennai, the capital of Tamil
      Nadu state and one of the epicenters of the Indian HIV epidemic.

      The investigators will recruit 50 adult (age &gt;=18) PLHIV presenting to care at YRG CARE and
      ART-naïve. Participants will be recruited at their first visit to YRG CARE, at which the
      participant's HIV diagnosis is established or confirmed and the participant receives initial
      counseling and clinical care. At this recruitment stage, research assistants will conduct a
      pre-intervention questionnaire including measures of depressive symptoms, internalized
      stigma, self-efficacy, mental health, and physical health. The investigators will then
      randomize the patient to usual care vs. enhanced-care intervention (25 in each arm).

      The enhanced-care intervention will be multi-faceted, reflecting the likelihood of multiple
      syndemic conditions as well as evidence from LMICs suggesting that programs combining
      multiple approaches are the most effective in improving retention in care.

      The enhanced-care intervention will consist of the following components:

        1. Active outreach, including bidirectional weekly SMS messaging / automated voice
           messaging (depending on literacy)

        2. Appointments (specific appointment times/dates).

        3. Financial support, including free clinic visits, labs, medications, and transportation
           incentives on a sliding scale based on distance to clinic

        4. Microenterprise, including bag-making or food-making ventures for women

        5. Enhanced counseling. Participants in the enhanced-care intervention will participate in
           an individual enhanced counseling program called Steps to Success, based upon a Life
           Steps and Problem Solving curriculum.

    <description>YRG CARE is affiliated with two microenterprise programs in bag-making and food-vending which can be leveraged as part of an intervention, particularly for women. There is an established training and mentoring program for individuals who wish to join the bag-making or food-making ventures. Participants who opt for this will be linked to the bag-making and food-vending programs, with all up-front costs (e.g. vending kiosk, training, serving materials, etc.) covered.</description>

    <description>Participants in the enhanced-care intervention will participant in an individual enhanced counseling program called Steps to Success, based upon a Life Steps and Problem Solving curriculum. Steps to Success will consist of five one-on-one sessions of approximately 1 to 1.5 hours each. The first session will take place at the time of the participant's second clinical visit to YRG CARE, which will be between 1-3 weeks after the participant is recruited.</description>
