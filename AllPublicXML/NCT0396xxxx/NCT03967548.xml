      The subjects of this study were healthy subjects, who were given medicine in a single dose
      group: 0.004%.

      Tear collection was conducted on the single dose D1 (that is, the day of administration).
      Collection points: 10 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 6 h, 8 h, and 12 h after
      administration.Each time 5-50 mg (generally 20 mg), a total of 160-1600 mg of tears will be
      collected (during the screening period, all subjects will retain the tear samples collected
      by the Schirmer filter paper, among which, qualified tear samples will be used for blank
      samples or methodological investigation.After administration, only 1 tear collection site
      will be collected for each subject.
