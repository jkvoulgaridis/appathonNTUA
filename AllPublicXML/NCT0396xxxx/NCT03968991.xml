      The aim of this study is to validate the VISIODOL® scale for screening of pain in people with
      visual impairment.

      The VISIODOL® monocentric study conducted at Clermont-Ferrand University Hospital is a
      cross-disciplinary diagnostic tool validation performed in patients with acquired or
      congenital visual impairment and healthy sighted volunteers. Different evaluations by thermal
      (Pathway Médoc®) and mechanical (electronic Von Frey®) tests will allow to compare the new
      VISIODOL® scale with the numerical scale, which is a commonly used tool. The ergonomic
      quality, the satisfaction of use and the quality of life, stress, anxiety and catastrophism
      of the patients will also be studied.
