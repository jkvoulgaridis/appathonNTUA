    <textblock>
      Phase 0, Open Label study of Brodalumab in patients with moderate to severe Hidradenitis
      Suppurativa. Consisting of n=10 patients receiving 210mg subcutaneously every 2 weeks for 24
      weeks. Patients will be followed for a period of 36 weeks (12 weeks after last dose of
      Brodalumab) to assess for safety.
