  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-institutional pilot trial for patients with advanced breast cancer. The trial
      is designed to assess the safety and tolerability of induction talazoparib followed by
      combination of talazoparib and avelumab. As an exploratory endpoint, the study team will
      evaluate the immunomodulatory effects of induction talazoparib followed by the combination of
      talazoparib and avelumab in patients with advanced breast cancer.
