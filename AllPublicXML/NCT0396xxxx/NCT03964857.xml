    <textblock>
      To investigate the effects of two types of oil blends on blood lipid profile, glucose
      homeostasis, body composition, gut microflora and other markers of cardiometabolic disease
      risk in Chinese men and women with borderline hyperlipidemia

      The primary aims of this study is to evaluate the effects of consumption of two separate
      blends of cooking oil, containing rice bran, flaxseed and sesame oils, for a period of 8
      weeks, on blood total cholesterol, total triglycerides, low-density and high-density
      lipoprotein cholesterol and metabolism in borderline hyperlipidaemic, 50 to 70 years old,
      Chinese, male and postmenopausal female, as compared to refined olive oil. The secondary aims
      of the study is to evaluate the effect of the two separate blends of cooking oil on markers
      of cardiometabolic diseases risk (including body composition, glucose homeostasis, markers of
      oxidative stress and chronic inflammation) and changes in gut microbiota composition and
      function.
