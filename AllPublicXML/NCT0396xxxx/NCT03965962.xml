      Primary Objective:

      To demonstrate that Purified Vero Rabies Vaccine - Serum Free Vaccine generation 2 (VRVg-2)
      is non-inferior to Verorab and Imovax Rabies vaccines when co-administered with human rabies
      immunoglobulin (HRIG), in terms of proportion of subjects achieving a rabies virus
      neutralizing antibody (RVNA) titer ≥ 0.5 IU/mL at D28, ie, 14 days after the fourth vaccine
      injection.

      Secondary Objective:

        -  To describe the safety profile of VRVg-2 versus Verorab and Imovax Rabies vaccines when
           co-administered with HRIG, as well as that of VRVg-2, after each vaccine injection.

        -  To demonstrate that the proportion of subjects in the VRVg-2 + HRIG group achieving an
           RVNA titer ≥ 0.5 IU/mL at D28 is at least 95%.

        -  To describe the immune response induced by VRVg-2 versus Verorab and Imovax Rabies
           vaccines when co-administered with HRIG, as well as that induced by VRVg-2, at D14 (7
           days after the third injection), at D28 (14 days after the fourth injection) and at D42
           (14 days after the last injection).

      Study duration per participant will be approximately 7 months including: 1 day of screening
      and vaccination, a 28-day vaccination period, 1 safety-follow up visit at Day 42, 1 safety
      follow-up/end of study visit at Day 56 and a 6-month safety follow-up call after last vaccine
      administration.

             interfere with trial conduct or completion.

          -  Moderate or severe acute illness/infection (according to investigator judgment) on the
             day of vaccination or febrile illness (temperature ≥ 38.0 C). A prospective

             the febrile event has subsided.

          -  Personal history of Guillain-Barré syndrome.

          -  Identified as an Investigator or employee of the Investigator or study center with
             direct involvement in the proposed study, or identified as an immediate family member
