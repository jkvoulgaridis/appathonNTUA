    <textblock>
      This study evaluates whether Remote Ischaemic Preconditioning (RIPC) can improve activity,
      gait and fatigue in people with Multiple Sclerosis. Half the participants will receive RIPC,
      the other half will receive a sham treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Regular physical activity has been shown to improve physical fitness, fatigue, quality of
      life, and reduce the progression of disability in people with multiple sclerosis (MS).
      However, people with MS are less physically active than others. This is partly due to poor
      exercise tolerance and fatigue.

      Remote Ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) is the exposure of a limb to brief periods of
      circulatory occlusion and reperfusion by inflating pressure cuffs around arms or legs to
      above systolic pressures (mmHg), to protect organs against ischaemic injury. RIPC has been
      shown to improve exercise performance and delay fatigue in athletes. However, there is little
      to no research examining the effect of RIPC on walking or exercise performance in MS
      patients. The aim of this trial is to assess whether RIPC can improve activity, gait and
      reduce fatigue in people with MS.

    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A 21 item self reported fatigue scale which assess the effects of fatigue across three domains, cognitive, physical and psycho-social. Each item is scored from 0-4 (0=no effect of fatigue, 4=large effect of fatigue) yielding a total between 0 - 84.</description>

    <description>A 12 item self reported scale which assesses the impact of MS on a patient's walking ability. Each item is scored from 1-5 (1=no impact, 5=high impact), yielding a total between 1-60 which is transformed to a percentage out of 100.</description>
