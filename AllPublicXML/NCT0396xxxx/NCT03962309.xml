  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early identification of individuals at high risk remains the cornerstone of primary
      cardiovascular prevention (CV). However, cardiovascular screening including people at low CV
      diseases (CVD) risk are too costly, time consuming and poorly effective in reducing incident
      CV events to be proposed at population level. Thus, innovative tools that allow to exclude
      low risk subjects in order to concentrate the relatively poor resources of NHS for primary
      prevention in high risk groups are needed. In this study, we will assess whether a new low
      cost strategy for CV risk stratification, based on non-laboratory measures, will allow to
      recognize low risk subjects who do not need further and expensive measures. To this end, we
      will take advantage of a General Practitioners (GPs) national network that will allow to work
      in the natural contest of primary prevention. If successful, the project will provide the
      basis for future, cost-effective prevention programs to be performed at national level.

      National, multicenter cross-sectional study.

      The current study will be performed as part of Italian Cardiology Network implemented by the
      Italian Ministry of Health.

      This study will be carried out with the collaboration with Study Center for Primary Care.

      A random sample of subjects identified by the list of patients in charge of the participating
      GPs aged 40-70 years will be invited to a screening for the evaluation of their CV risk.

      All patients who agree to participate in the study and sign the consent will complete a
      health self-assessment questionnaire which includes questions covering anthropometric,
      sociodemographics, personal and family health history, life style habits and aspects of the
      behavioral domain.

      This will be followed by biometric measurements including height, weight and waist
      circumference conducted at the consulting room of the GP by certified staff. Informative
      predictors, selected among all variables selected, will be identified by a stepwise
      multivariable logistic regression. The low risk CV score will be calculated as the sum of the
      coefficients of the retained variables.
