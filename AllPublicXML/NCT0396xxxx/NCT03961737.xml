  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Of the 50,000 prostate cancers that occur each year in France, more than half will benefit
      from curative radiotherapy, alone or in combination with hormone therapy from 6 months to 3
      years depending on the stage of the disease. At present, there are few ways to predict the
      response to this irradiation.

      Evaluating the early response of tumor tissue to irradiation could predict the final response
      to treatment. It is difficult to offer biopsies during treatment for reasons of patient
      comfort. This is why this study consists in analysing transcriptomic and protein responses
      (immunohistochemistry) to irradiation on ex vivo prostate explants. These explants will be
      irradiated after culture and the transcriptional and immunohistochemical changes analysed
      before and after irradiation to determine an early tumor tissue response profile to
      irradiation.

    <description>A first series of biopsies will be performed during the procedure to place the gold grains prior to radiotherapy. Explants will be performed from these biopsies. Half of these explants will be irradiated with a research irradiator at a dose of 2 Gy then placed for 24 hours in an appropriate culture medium. The other half will be directly cultured for 24 hours. After 24 hours of incubation, half of the irradiated explants and half of the explants will be used to study the transcriptome. The tissues will be stored in RNAlater solution and then frozen at -80°C. The remaining half explants will be used for immunohistochemical analysis. Two years after the end of radiotherapy, a new series of biopsies will be performed for research, in order to verify histologically the effectiveness of radiotherapy.</description>

    <description>Before radiotherapy treatment, prostate biopsies will be performed in each patient. From these biopsies, explants will be performed. Half of these explants will be irradiated ex vivo and the other half will not receive any prior treatment.
Then the patient will receive radiotherapy. It will be reviewed 2 years after the end of radiotherapy. New prostate biopsies will be performed to evaluate the tumor response to radiotherapy and to characterize the immunohistochemical and transcriptomic profiles of non-responder patients.</description>
