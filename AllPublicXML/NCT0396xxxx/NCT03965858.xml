    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of inhaled
      Esketamine in participants with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) in the course of Major
      Depressive Disorder (MDD). The study is to determine the efficacy and dose response of three
      Esketamine doses, compared with placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, multiple dose, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicentre study of
      Esketamine DPI, inhalation powder delivered via dry powder inhaler (DPI) in participants with
      TRD in the course of MDD. There are 3 study phases: Screening phase, a two weeks double-blind
      treatment phase and a 6-week follow-up phase. Participants are to be randomized in 1:1:1:1
      ratio to receive placebo or one of the three doses of Esketamine DPI. Participants from each
      group will receive different dosing sequences, consider as a single dose, corresponding to
      low, medium, high Esketamine dose or placebo. Participants will undergo one cycle of
      treatment consisting of four doses of Esketamine DPI or placebo over 14-day period.
      Participants safety will be monitored throughout the study.
