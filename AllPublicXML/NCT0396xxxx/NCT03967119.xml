  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic surgery can induce hemodynamic pertubations. Pneumoperitoneum, inevitable in
      laparoscopic surgery, induces increase in intra-abdominal pressure, which can decrease
      cardiac output. Simultaneously, pneumoperitoneum can stimulate sympathetic system and
      increase vascular resistance/arterial blood pressure. Patients undergoing laparoscopic
      surgery may show a normal range of blood pressure during pneumoperitoneum even when the
      patients are in hypovolemia, and desufflation at the end of main surgical procedure can cause
      an abrupt hypotension revealing hypovolemia. Therefore, appropriate fluid management is
      essential for preventing desufflation-induced hypotension in laparoscopic surgery. Recently,
      dynamic variables are used to predict and guide fluid therapy during controlled ventilation.
      these variables arise from heart-lung interactions during positive ventilation, which
      influence left ventricular stroke volume. Several dynamic variables are derived from
      variations in left ventricular stroke volume (stroke volume variation, SVV), for example
      pulse pressure variation (PPV), and variations in pulse oximetry plethysmography waveform
      amplitude (PWV), which have all been shown to predict fluid responsiveness in different
      clinical and experimental settings. However, there are few evidences regarding which type of
      dynamic variables can predict desufflation-induced hypotension in laparoscopic surgery.
      Therefore, this study was designed to assess the predictive abilities of three different type
      of dynamic variables including PPV, SVV, and PWV for desufflation-induced hypotension in
      patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery.

      The study is a prospective, single-arm, and observational one. Eighty Patients who age more
      than 19 years and are undergoing laparoscopic surgery for urologic procedures are being
      enrolled in this study. All anesthetic and surgical managements are being performed according
      to the institutional standards. An attending anesthesiologist who is independent from this
      study performs anesthetic managements for the participants including fluid administration.

      Investigators assess and record the following parameters at the following time points.

      The parameters assessed: mean arterial pressure, heart rate, pulse oxygen saturation, SVV,
      PPV, PWV, peak inspiratory pressure, plateau pressure, positive end-expiratory pressure,
      respiratory rate (all dynamic variables are assessed at two levels of tidal volume- 6 ml/kg
      and 12 ml/kg).

      The time points: T0, before anesthetic induction; T1, immediately after anesthetic induction;
      T2, immediately after pneumoperitoneum; T3, 10 min before desufflation; T4, immediately after
      desufflation.

      The desufflation-induced hypotension is defined as more than 20 % decrease in MAP at T4 from
      MAP at T3.

    <description>Arterial blood pressure, pulse oxygen saturation, and cardiac output/stroke volume are monitored with invasive arterial catheter, pulse oxymetry, and esophageal doppler in all participants. Some dynamic variables including SVV and PPV are automatically calculated in each monitor. PWV is manually calculated in a printed plethysmographic waveform. Plethysmographic waveform amplitude (PW) is measured on a beat-to-beat basis as the vertical distance between peaks and preceding valley troughs in the waveform. The maximum PW (PWmax) and minimum PW (PWmin) are determined manually over the same respiratory cycle, and PWV is calculated. PWV=(PWmax-PWmin)/[(PWmax+PWmin)/2].</description>
