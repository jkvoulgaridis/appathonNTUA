      INITIATION is a postmarket clinical follow-up study in China. The purpose of the study is to
      continue to evaluate the safety and effectiveness/performance of Incraft in subjects with
      abdominal aortic aneurysms requiring endovascular repair in routine clinical practice.
      Approximately 120 subjects will be enrolled and followed through 1-years postprocedure. Up to
      20 sites in China may participate.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Technical success</measure>
    <time_frame>At the conclusion of the index procedure</time_frame>
    <description>The technical success at the end of the first surgery, which was defined as the successful insertion of the delivery system and the successful placement of the device at the desired location.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Absence of stent graft migration(&gt;10mm)</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Stent graft migration is defined as evidence of proximal or distal movement of the stent graft &gt; 10mm relative to fixed anatomical landmarks compared with the 1 month size measurement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Absence of Type I or Type III endoleak and no aneurysm enlargement (growth &gt;5mm)</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at 1 year compared to size measurement at 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Endoleak is defined as a persistent blood flow outside the lumen of the endoluminal graft but within an aneurysm sac or adjacent vascular segment being treated by the device. They are the result of incomplete sealing, or exclusion of the aneurysm sac, and thus cause reflux of blood flow into the sac.
Aneurysm enlargement is defined as an increase in maximum aneurysm cross sectional diameter greater than 5mm compared to a baseline measurement, or any subsequent measurement following baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Absence of stent graft fracture</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed within 30-days and 1-year post-procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Stent-graft fracture is defined as stent skeleton fracture and barb separation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Absence of stent occlusion (including unilateral or bilateral limb occlusion) and aneurysm sac rupture</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 1-year post-procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Stent occlusion is defined as a complete absence of flow, within the AAA stent graft (aortic bifurcate or one or both iliac limbs).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Absence of all-cause mortality and aneurysms-related death</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 1-year post-procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Aneurysms-related death is defined as a death from AAA rupture, or death within 30 days of open aortic surgical or endovascular repair or death from any subsequent procedure required to treat the same aneurysm.</description>
