             14 days; (2) Completely spinal cord injury at neurological level C4- T12/L1; (3) No
             serious complications

          3. Participants With Chronic Complete SCI: (1) Classification ASIA A, greater than 6
             months post injury and no significant further improvement within past 3 months; (2)
             Completely spinal cord injury at neurological level C4- T12/L1; (3) Peripheral nervous
             system in good condition; (4) No serious complications

          2. Decline in peripheral nerve function

          3. A current diagnosis of diseases affecting spinal cord injury recovery or
             rehabilitation training (e.g., brain injury, cerebral hemorrhage, cognitive
             impairment, other central nervous system diseases)

          4. Having serious health problems, (e.g., cardiovascular disease, diabetes, autoimmune
             diseases, tumors or severe hypertension) or serious complications (e.g. severe
             bedsores, pulmonary infection, respiratory disorders)

          5. Pregnancy or lactation

          6. History of mental illness or suicide risk, with a history of epilepsy or other central
             nervous system disorders
