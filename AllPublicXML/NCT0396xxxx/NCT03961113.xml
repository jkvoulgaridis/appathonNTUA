  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Giant cell arteritis is the leading cause of vasculitis in the elderly. No work evaluates its
      impact on autonomy. At the diagnosis a gerontological evaluation will be carried out
      including the scores ADL, iADL, MNA, SF 36, SPPB, FRIED and GDS. A monthly telephone
      reassessment will collect ADL and iADL. The end-of-study consultation at M12, conducted by a
      geriatrician, will have the same scores as at M0. This will make it possible to evaluate the
      difference in the functional autonomy score between M0 and M12 in the elderly with ACG.

    <description>At diagnosis a gerontological evaluation will be carried out including the following tests: ADL, iADL, MNA, SF 36, SPPB, FRIED criteria and GDS. The set of scales and scores of the procedure is commonly used in geriatrics to assess the fragility of the patient.
A monthly telephone reassessment conducted by an ARC will collect ADL and iADL from the first month to the eleventh month. The end-of-study consultation will be conducted by a geriatrician at the 12th month and will include the following tests: ADL, iADL, MNA, SF 36, the SPPB, the criteria of FRIED and the GDS</description>
