  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel-group study designed to assess
      healthcare provider and subject/caregiver reported functionality and performance of a
      single-use accessorized pre-filled syringe (APFS) or autoinjector (AI) with a fixed 210 mg
      dose of tezepelumab administered subcutaneously in the clinic and in an at-home setting.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of a screening/run-in period of up to 2 weeks and a treatment period
      of 24 weeks, followed by a post-treatment follow-up period of 12 weeks. During the treatment
      period, one dose of 210 mg tezepelumab will be administered via a single-use APFS or AI
      subcutaneously (SC) every 4 weeks (Q4W) starting at Visit 2 (Week 0) until Visit 7 (Week 20).
      Subjects will be administered tezepelumab at the site during Visits 2 (Week 0), 3 (Week 4), 4
      (Week 8) and 7 (Week 20). At-home administration of tezepelumab will occur during Visit 5
      (Week 12) and Visit 6 (Week 16). Each device will be assessed separately using descriptive
      presentations.
