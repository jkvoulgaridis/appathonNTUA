    <textblock>
      This study will compare the clinical efficacy and safety between rPMS device and pelvic floor
      exercises for the treatment of urinary incontinence. The subjects will be enrolled and
      assigned into two study groups - active and control group. Subjects will be required to
      complete six (6) treatment visits and five follow-up visits - 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after
      the final treatment.
