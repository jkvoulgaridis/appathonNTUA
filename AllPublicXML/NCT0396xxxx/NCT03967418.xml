  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Improving knowledge about behavioural addictions is a real public health issue. The
      etiopathogenic model of behavioural addictions is multifactorial, with various risk and
      vulnerability factors, involved in the initiation and maintenance of the disorders. Among
      these factors, neurocognitive alterations associated with behavioural addictions has recently
      aroused interest among researchers.

      To our knowledge, there is no work wich compared several behavioural addictions with each
      other on a neurocognitive level. Moreover, neurocognitive data concerning certain behavioural
      addictions (such as sexual addiction) is almost non-existent. However, understanding the
      neurocognitive profiles of these patients would allow the investigators, on the one hand, to
      reinforce the existing literature and improve our understanding of the global process of
      addiction, and on the other hand, to propose alternative approaches to its management, taking
      into account the neurocognitive difficulties of the patients.

      The investigators therefore propose to explore the neurocognitive alterations of patients
      suffering from several behavioural addiction (sexual addiction, excessive use of video games
      and eating disorders with bulimia episodes), by comparing them with each other, to matched
      healthy control groups and to a recognized behavioural addiction (gambling disorder; data
      from the BANCO study - NCT03202290).
