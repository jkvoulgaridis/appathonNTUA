  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Less is known about pain and opiate use at home directly after total knee replacement (TKR).
      Regarding side effects, low opiate use is desired. An e-health application, PainCoach app,
      was developed to guide patients in pain control and opiate use.

      The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the PainCoach app on pain and opiate
      use in TKR patients in the first two weeks at home after surgery. The hypothesis was that the
      use of this app would decrease pain and opiate use.

    <intervention_model_description>Patients were randomised to the PainCoach-app group or control group. Both groups received usual care. In the PainCoach-app group, in addition to receiving the aforementioned usual care, patients could use the PainCoach app whenever they wanted. In response to the patient's input of the pain experienced, the app gave advice on pain medication use, exercises/rest and when to call the clinic. This advice was the same as patients also received during usual care.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>In the PainCoach-app group, in addition to receiving the aforementioned usual care, the PainCoach app was downloaded on each patient's smartphone or tablet. Patients could use this app whenever they wanted until day 14 after surgery. They were not subjected to any different treatment compared to the control group, i.e. advice on pain management was delivered in an extra and different way, but the pain medication itself was exactly the same for both groups.</description>
