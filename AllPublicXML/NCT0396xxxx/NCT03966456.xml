  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>ORR was defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population who had a Complete Response (CR; disappearance of all target lesions) or Partial Response (PR; at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters). The percentage of strongly PD-L1 positive participants who experienced a CR or PR is presented.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Experiencing Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events are defined as any adverse medical events that occur in the participants taking the drugs and do not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>PFS</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>PFS was defined as the time from the first day of study treatment to the first documented disease progression per irRC or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first.</description>
