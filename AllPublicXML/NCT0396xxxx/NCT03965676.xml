  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective is to evaluate the decrease in crystalline volume of the target tophus
      using Dual-Energy Computed Tomography (DECT), after 6 months +/- 1 month of urate-lowering
      therapy with target uricemia.

      Study hypothesis

        -  The dynamics of tophus resolution with urate-lowering therapy is poorly understood.

        -  It is variable according to the location of the tophus, peri articular / intratendinous,
           but also probably at the feet / hands, the initial overall volume of the tophus, the
           initial crystal charge of the tophus. Knowledge of prognostic factors for tophus
           resolution will help determine the best target for treatment follow-up for each patient.

        -  Erosions are the consequence of tophus. Tophus resolution could be associated with
           repair of erosions and stabilization of joint destruction.

      Study design The research is a non-randomized prospective bi-centric study in adult patients
      with tophaceous gout. It aims at studying tophus resolution (main objective), and prognostic
      factors for tophus resolution (secondary objective), and bone erosions, with Dual-Energy
      Computed Tomography (DECT) (secondary objective).

      Study population

        -  Adult patients with a tophaceous gout but no urate-lowering treatment or treatment but
           target not reached (target = uricemia &lt; 360µmol/L).

        -  Recruitment of patients during a visit or hospitalization in rheumatology at
           Lariboisière Hospital.

      Calculated size of study population: 50 patients

      No control group

      Inclusion criteria

        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years

        -  Patient with a tophaceous gout

        -  Without urate-lowering treatment or with treatment but uricemia not at target

        -  Having given its free and informed consent to participate in this study

        -  Affiliated with a social security system

      Non-Inclusion criteria

        -  Pregnant or breastfeeding woman

        -  Participation in another intervention research or period of exclusion due to a previous
           research.

        -  Impossibility to position oneself in ventral position (position for hands/wrists DECT
           acquisition).

      Acts or product added for the research study Dual-Energy Computed Tomography examination at 6
      and 12 months +/- 1 month of medical treatment with uricemia &lt; 360µmol/L (baseline DECT is in
      the domain of usual care).

      For each patient, 3 visits (usual care):

        -  M0: Inclusion visit

        -  M6 + /- 1 month: visit, usual care, + DECT for research purpose

        -  M12 + /- 1 month: visit, usual care, + DECT for research purpose

      Research duration:

        -  Inclusion period: 24 months

        -  Duration of participation (treatment + follow-up): 12 months + /- 1 month

        -  Total duration: 37 months
