  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many older Veterans in VA primary care clinics experience anxiety and depressive symptoms,
      but only a minority of these Veterans seek care through VA mental health services. Research
      suggests that some older Veterans with psychological distress under-utilize mental health
      services due to perceived stigma of treatments focused on mental health symptoms. However,
      prior research with civilians, including one study of Veterans with PTSD, suggests a
      strengths-focused intervention that provides group training in compassion meditation may be
      effective in reducing negative emotions and increasing positive emotions and well-being. The
      proposed project is designed to examine the feasibility of this approach with Veterans ages &gt;
      55 years with anxiety or depression. The information from the study will guide and support
      development of a larger-size, more definitive study, planned as the follow-up after this
      project. If successful, this line of research could open the door to a novel and effective
      treatment that widens acceptance by older Veterans with psychological distress.

    <intervention_model_description>The proposed non-randomized feasibility study will collect pilot data to establish feasibility for a future randomized controlled trial (RCT) of manualized compassion meditation (CM) group intervention to restore functioning in older Veterans identified through VA Primary Care clinics as having clinically significant psychological distress. Twenty to 30 participants will be enrolled in a 10-week CM training group (with 8-10 participants in each group). As part of establishing feasibility for a subsequent large-scale RCT, 10 additional participants will be enrolled in a 10-session manualized psychoeducational group focused on topics in healthy aging. The latter group will be conducted to examine the feasibility and appropriateness of employing this as a control condition in a follow-up RCT.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The investigators will evaluate the improvement in depression and anxiety (Brief Symptom Inventory-18; BSI), social connection (Social Connectedness Scale; SCS-R), satisfaction with life (Satisfaction with Life Scale; SWLS) and positive emotions (modified Differential Emotions Scale; mDES) from baseline to post-intervention using a linear random effect model and time will be included as a main effect in the model. The random effects model is suitable for examining changes in outcomes in longitudinal studies.

    <description>The investigators will develop and test a 10-week psychoeducational group focused on topics in healthy aging to examine its feasibility as a control condition for a subsequent VA Merit-supported randomized controlled trial. This will include multiple resources for community education regarding healthy aging, including a library of videotaped community-focused talks, such as increasing happiness, mental resilience and health, nutrition, and physical activity. These resources will be incorporated into 90-minute sessions wherein the key information from talks is shown to participants, with a follow-up discussion and review period led by the group facilitator. In the context of the present feasibility study, the investigators anticipate modifying and refining the content and format of the group in response to participant feedback.</description>
