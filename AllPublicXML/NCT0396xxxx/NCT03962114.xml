      This clinical trial investigates the effects of nicotinamide riboside (vitamin B3) on the
      disease course of patients with ataxia telangiectasia.

      Patients will be treated during four consecutive months with nicotinamide riboside
      (25mg/kg/day), followed by a washout period of two months.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: Ataxia, dysarthria, quality of life, laboratory parameters.

      Rationale: Ataxia Telangiectasia (A-T) is an autosomal recessively inherited
      neurodegenerative disorder, with a high cancer risk, that also affects the immune and
      respiratory system. Therapy for A-T is restricted to symptomatic treatment including
      rehabilitation care, combined with infection prevention and treatment, and screening for
      pulmonary dysfunction and malignancies. A-T is caused by mutations in the ATM gene. The ATM
      protein plays a pivotal role in more than 100 different biochemical processes, among which
      cellular energy metabolism, cell signaling, and DNA repair. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
      (NAD+) is an essential molecule in many of these processes and studies have shown that NAD+
      deficiency plays a role in disease mechanisms underlying DNA repair disorders such as A-T.
      NAD+ is available in food, but can also be synthesized in the body from its precursors
      nicotinamide, nicotinic acid, and nicotinamide riboside (NR), as a group called &quot;vitamin B3&quot;.
      Treatment of experimental A-T animal models with NR showed beneficial effects. The aim of
      this study is to investigate whether treatment with NR during a period of six months may have
      positive effects on the disease course of patients with A-T.

      Objective: To investigate the effects of NR on the disease course of patients with ataxia
      telangiectasia.

      Study design: Single center, interventional, explorative, open-label proof of concept study.

      Study population: Patients with A-T (age &gt;2 years).

      Intervention (if applicable): Patients will be treated with nicotinamide riboside
      (25mg/kg/day), during four consecutive months, followed by a washout period of two months.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: Ataxia, dysarthria, quality of life, laboratory parameters.
