  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anaphylaxis elicited by accidental intake of the offending food constitutes a major health
      risk to the food allergic patient. Current advice for the food allergic patient is to avoid
      the offending food allergen and to carry an epinephrine autoinjector. However, novel
      treatments altering the clinical reactivity to the offending food thereby diminishing the
      risk of anaphylaxis are much needed. A correlation between the level of specific IgE in serum
      towards the offending food and the clinical sensitivity of the patient has been suggested.
      The clinical threshold for a food allergic reaction to occur is therefore hypothesized to
      increase by reducing the level of specific IgE to the relevant food allergen.

      Therapy with Omalizumab has proven efficacious in lowering the level of IgE in serum but a
      high pre-treatment level of total IgE in serum potentially hampers the efficacy in a number
      of patients, as seen especially in patients with concomitant atopic dermatitis. The aim of
      this study is to investigate if the combination of initial IgE specific immunoadsorption
      combined with subsequent treatment with Omalizumab will increase the clinical threshold to
      the culprit food and thus prevent medical emergencies (anaphylaxis) in patients with severe
      food allergy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      10 patients with a proven food allergy will be submitted to the combined effort of IgE
      specific (selective) immunoadsorption and subsequent treatment with Omalizumab.

      An Oral Food Challenge (OFC) will be performed before, during and after the above mentioned
      treatments according to international guidelines with administration of increasing doses (3,
      10, 30, 100, 300, 1000 and 3000 mg of protein) of the incriminated food at one hour
      intervals, until objective signs of an allergic reaction in the patient occur. The cumulated
      dose eaten before this reaction is defined as the threshold (Tr).

      The patient's threshold value (mg protein) before therapy (Tr0) will be determined by OFC
      immediately before three cycles of immunoadsorption on three consecutive days are performed.
      This repeated procedure will expectedly reduce the serum level of IgE (total as well as
      specific) by a factor of at least 10. Immediately after the last day of immunoadsorption, a
      second OFC for determination of threshold (TrP) will be performed and compared to Tr0, in
      order to determine the efficacy of the immunoadsorption.

      Immediately after finalization of the second OFC, treatment with Omalizumab 300 mg s.c.
      injection will be initiated and repeated every 2 weeks until 12 weeks of treatment has been
      reached. The administration, the dose and dose interval is the recommended dosage as to the
      SPC (Summary of Product Characteristics). Treatment with Omalizumab will expectedly reduce
      the level of serum IgE (total as well as specific) by a factor of 2-4. The day following the
      final administration of Omalizumab, a third OFC for determination of threshold (TrX) will be
      performed and followed by a fourth OFC for determination of threshold (TrW) four weeks later.
      These thresholds will be compared to Tr0 and TrP to determine the combined efficacy of
      immunoadsorption and therapy with Omalizumab during therapy and after cessation of therapy.

      Skin Prick Tests (SPTs), serum levels of total (t-IgE) and specific IgE (s-IgE) as well as
      relevant component resolved diagnostics (all in kIU/L) and Basophil Histamine Release (BaHR)
      (ng/mL) for relevant food allergens will be determined immediately before and after
      immunoadsorption, before challenges and before administration of Omalizumab.

      Provided that 80 % of the patients will respond to immunoadsorption and therapy with
      Omalizumab (i.e. a comparison between Tr0 and TrX) with at least a two-step increase in
      threshold, a number of 10 included patients will result in a statistical significance for
      difference between the two parameters of 0.0047, if the remaining two patients do not change
      their threshold values. If, additionally one patient decreases threshold (i.e. 7 positive, 2
      unchanged and 1 negative), the value will still be statistically significant (p=0.0142) using
      the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The specified number of patients have to complete the study to
      ensure the results.

      GCP-monitoring is performed by the local GCP-unit at Odense University Hospital.

    <description>As described open food challenges will be performed according to international guidelines (1) at specified time points and thresholds for a clinical objective reaction as measured in milligrams food protein before (Tr0) and after (TrP) the initial immunoadsorption and then during (TrX) and after cessation (TrW) of treatment with Omalizumab. Challenge thresholds at Tr0, TrP, TrX and TrW will be reported for each patient and compared. Since the study is non-randomized and uncontrolled the individual patient will serve as his/her own control. A 2-step change in threshold will be considered significant.</description>
