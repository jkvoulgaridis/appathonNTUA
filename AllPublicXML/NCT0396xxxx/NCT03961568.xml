      52 Week Open-Label Safety Study of cenobamate adjunctive therapy for subjects who complete
      double-blind study YKP3089C025. Subjects will have a 12 week double-blind conversion phase
      where subjects who received placebo in the double-blind study will be converted to
      cenobamate. Subjects who received cenobamate in the double-blind study will continue to
      receive their daily dose of cenobamate. Subjects switching from placebo to cenobamate will be
      titrated starting at 12.5 mg and increase their dose over the course of 12 weeks as followes
      12.5 mg for 2 weeks, 25 mg for two weeks, 50 mg for two weeks, 100 mg for two weeks, 150 mg
      for two weeks, and 200 mg for two weeks. All subjects will receive 200 mg for the last two
      weeks of the conversion phase to preserve the blind. After completing the doubl-blind
      conversion phase, subjects will have 40 weeks of open-label, flexibly dosed cenobamate. The
      dose range is 50 mg - 200 mg. Primary endpoints are all safety measures.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject must have successfully completed the Double-blind Treatment Period in the
             Core study.

          -  Written informed consent signed by the subject or legal guardian, prior to entering
             the study, in accordance with the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) Good
             Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines. If the written informed consent is provided by the
             legal guardian because the subject is unable to do so, a written or verbal assent from
             the subject must also be obtained. As required by country-specific regulations, only
             the subject may sign the ICF in accordance with ICH guidelines.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject tests positive, via urine drug screen at Visit 14 of the Core study, for
             illicit drugs except for tetrahydrocannabinol and Cannabinoids.

          -  Any significant changes to the subject's medical history that, in the opinion of the
             Principal Investigator, could affect the subject's safety or conduct of the study.
