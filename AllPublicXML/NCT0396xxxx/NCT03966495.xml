  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sustainability can be defined by several dimensions: the pursuit of program elements, the
      maintenance of its effectiveness, its integration into work processes, the adaptation of the
      program to the local context, its integration into the organizational culture, the
      dissemination of the program to other centres. Studies show that the continuation of the
      entire intervention is rare once the research stops.

      The PRisM study (Pluriprofessionality and Risk Management through a Multifaceted Program in
      Primary Care) was a primary care risk management (RM) research project. Its purpose was to
      develop a safety culture within the participating multi-professional primary care structures.
      From 2015 to 2017, multi-professional primary care offices participated in the study, half of
      which implemented a RM program consisting of: 1) Training on RM in the context of primary
      care; 2) The appointment of a RM referent; 3) The conduct of six meetings of systematic
      analysis of incidents.

      The PRisM study represents a favorable ground for the development of a methodology for
      evaluating the sustainability of a RM program in primary care.

    <description>Pluriprofessional primary care offices with the PRiSM RM program:
Nine of the pluriprofessional primary care offices which implemented the RM program tested in the PRiSM study (2015-2017). The program consisted in: 1) Training on RM in the context of primary care; 2) The appointment of a RM referent in the office; 3) The conduct of six incident review meetings.
All participating offices had to declare adverse events that occurred during the time frame of the PRiSM study.
All participating offices had to fill in the safety climate survey MOSPS at the beginning and at the end of the PRiSM study.</description>
