    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the association of the Self-Administered questionnaire (CESAM) score and
      its stratification of frailty in four levels with incident adverse health events in older
      community dwellers and to compare this association with three validated frailty indexes which
      are the Cardiovascular Health Study frailty index, Study of Osteoporotic Fracture index and
      Rockwood frailty index.

      Older adults' health and functional status is heterogeneous because of the various cumulative
      effects of chronic diseases and physiologic decline, contributing to a vicious cycle of
      increased frailty. Thanks to advances in medicine and hygiene, a growing number of older
      adults spend more years with a greater range of disorders causing disability but not
      mortality. Health systems thus need to face this new challenge. Quantification of frailty and
      its association with the occurrence of adverse health events is crucial to understand how
      efficiently health systems may respond to this situation.

      This study aims to examine of association of the Self-Administered questionnaire (CESAM)
      score and its stratification of frailty in four levels with incident adverse health events in
      older community dwellers and to compare this association with three validated frailty indexes
      which are the Cardiovascular Health Study frailty index, Study of Osteoporotic Fracture index
      and Rockwood frailty index.
