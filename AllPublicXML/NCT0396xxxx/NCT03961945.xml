  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate if the sponge capsule device can accurately detect the presence of
      Barrett's Esophagus and prevalent dysplasia/adenocarcinoma detection, in a screening
      population, with and without chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The SOS device will be safely administered by a non-physician such as a nurse. Novel
      discriminant methylated DNA markers will be assayed on esophageal cytology specimens obtained
      from a sponge on a string (SOS) device to enable detection in Barrett's Esophagus and
      prevalent dysplasia/adenocarcinoma detection.
