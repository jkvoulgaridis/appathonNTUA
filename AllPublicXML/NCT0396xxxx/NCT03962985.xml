  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effects of MMFA visits on psychological, health, social conditions
      and personal interactions in older community dwellers with a precarious state and to
      determine whether these effects may change precarity.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Precarity is a vulnerable state exposing individuals to adverse health, psychological social
      events. Older adults are exposed to precarity, especially those who were the old generation
      of immigrants in Canada. Art-based activities have also been proposed to community dwellers
      and have shown positive effects on health outcomes and are determinants for well-being with
      aging. The effects of participatory art-based activities on precarity in older adults have
      never been examined. Recently, the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts (MMFA) developed a new
      participatory art-based activity which is a 3 month-period of weekly museum visits for
      precarious populations.

    <description>It will be used a questionnaire called: Evaluation of Health Precariousness and Inequalities in Health Examination Centers(EPICE). This questionnaire has 11 questions that summarize 90% a precarious state. The answer to each question is assigned a coefficient, the sum of the 11 answers gives the EPICES score. The score is continuous and ranges from 0 (no precarious social conditions) to 100 (maximum level of precarious conditions).The threshold of 30 defined a precarious state.</description>
