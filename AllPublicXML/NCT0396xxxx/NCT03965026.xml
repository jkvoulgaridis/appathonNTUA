  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At this time, two methods exist to calculate a pregnant woman's presumed delivery date (DPA)
      : one adds 280 days to last menstruation date (Naegele rule), other estimates early
      pregnancy's date by imagery and adds 270 days. Unless pathology requires a trigger, this DPA
      estimated a early pregnancy is not re-estimated. These methods are simple and arbitrary :
      Mongelli and al. in 1996 found that out of nearly 40 000 unique pregnancies, only 4% give
      birth at determined DPA by echography and 70% at more or less 5 days. Jukic and al. in 2013
      they estimate a natural variation of 37 days between pregnancy durations. Face of these poor
      performances, the calculating DPA method seems to be open to improvement.

      Thus, the DPA calculation formula does not take into account the individual patients
      characteristics (age, occupation, antecedents ...), nor the follow-up data collected during
      pregnancy. Jukic and al. in 2013 propose a first model with some individual characteristics
      and medical measures (period between ovulation and early pregnancy, hormone peak) to refine
      the estimation. Their study gives promising results but their small patients number (a
      hundred) does not allow them to detect all interactions. Moreover, their method calculation
      is not dynamic, i.e it does not refine the DPA as pregnancy progresses. To our knowledge, no
      studies developing an evolutionary model over time for the DPA exist. However, objectives of
      a more accurate estimate of expected date are multiple and important. The investigators will
      mention here the two main ones :

        -  A better understanding of mecanisms leading to early labour or abnormally long gestation
           in order to anticipate patients at risk

        -  A better material and human needs anticipation, allowing a more efficient organization
           more adapted to activity and a care of each parturient in optimal conditions.

      Our study will focus on predictive model elaboration of pregnancy duration that will evolve
      as the pregnancy progresses and new data collected. The investigators are considering a
      machine learning methodology by patient's medical record computerization at the Groupe
      Hospitalier Paris Saint-Joseph (GHPSJ) since early 2016. Thus, for patients who gave birth
      from end of 2016, the investigators have a large amount of information on their pregnancy and
      follow-up on hospital servers, which motivates an automatic approach based on massive data
      analysis.

      This study thus intends to implement advanced techniques in Machine Learning (Online
      Learning, Support Vector Machine ...) to advance a powerful calculation model.
