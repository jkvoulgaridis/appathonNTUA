  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many studies have shown that inflammation has an important effect on the development,
      progression, and also response to treatment of tumors. Dexmedetomidine is a potent and
      selective alpha 2 receptor agonist, known to have a sedative, analgesic and
      immune-controlling effect. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of
      dexmedetomidine during surgery on postoperative inflammatory response and surgical recovery
      in gastric cancer patients undergoing robot or laparoscopic gastrectomy.
