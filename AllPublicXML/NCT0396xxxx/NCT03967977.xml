    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 study designed
      to compare the efficacy and safety of tislelizumab + either cisplatin or carboplatin +
      gemcitabine versus placebo+ either cisplatin or carboplatin + gemcitabine in approximately
      420 participants with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who have not
      received prior systemic therapy.
