    <textblock>
      The purpose of this observational registry is to evaluate the safety and performance of the
      easyEndoTM Universal Linear Cutting Stapler and reloads from Ezisurg Medical used in
      laparoscopic RYGB surgery to create anastomoses. The goal of the study will be achieved by
      assessing the device performance and reporting of peri- and postoperative complications in a
      prospectively maintained database.
