  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this pilot RCT, a total of 40 adults with hypertension will be randomized to either an
      artificial intelligence (AI) physical activity intervention group or an active control group
      with a 1 to 1 ratio after completing a 2-week run-in period and 4-week training. The AI
      intervention group will receive an automated and personalized daily step goal intervention
      involving a sophisticated activity analytics algorithm using advanced statistics and machine
      learning, while the active control group will receive a standardized and fixed 10,000 daily
      steps goal. Both groups will receive an identical smartphone app (app content differs between
      the two groups) and ActiGraph GT9X Link to assess objectively measured physical activity
      (primary outcome) during the study period.
