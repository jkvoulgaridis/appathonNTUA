  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are currently very few proven pharmacologic options available for these patients. The
      recent discovery of transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV) channels, particularly
      TRPV2 channels, in the cardiovascular system is promising as a potential pathway for
      pharmacologic intervention for Fontan patients. Probenecid, a drug best known as a treatment
      for gout or as a penicillin adjunct, acts as a TRPV2 agonist and has recently become the
      subject of study as a model therapy for the treatment of cardiomyopathy due to its positive
      inotropic and lusitropic effects. The purpose of this pilot study is to determine if
      probenecid will improve magnetic resonance (MRI) parameters of systolic and/or diastolic
      dysfunction as well as associated symptoms in patients with a Fontan circulation. The
      investigators will quantitatively assess functional improvement with pre- and post-treatment
      cardiopulmonary exercise testing.

    <description>Determine if Fontan patients treated with probenecid for four weeks will experience increased systolic and diastolic function (as measured via standard and advanced MRI parameters) compared with four weeks of placebo. Participants will be assigned to either the placebo arm or study medication arm for the first four weeks. They will then undergo a four week wash out period. Finally, participants will be placed into the study arm that they were not assigned to in the first four weeks when they return for the last four weeks of study participation. There will be four MRI scans over the course of the 12 week study period.</description>
