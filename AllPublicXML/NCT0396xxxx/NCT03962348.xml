  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are studying a jail-based intervention to reduce the duration of untreated
      psychosis (DUP) among young adults with previously undetected first-episode psychosis who are
      detained in jail. Longer DUP (or treatment delay) is linked to poorer outcomes in
      first-episode psychosis and there is evidence that justice-involved young adults with
      first-episode psychosis have an alarmingly long DUP. Thus, despite the expansion of
      Coordinated Specialty Care (CSC) programs that improve outcomes through early,
      multi-component care, there is a need to establish early detection services in the criminal
      justice system and create pathways from justice involvement to CSC. This intervention offers
      a novel and potentially high impact approach for reducing DUP in jail settings: (1) a
      targeted education campaign for correction officers in three New York City jails; and (2) a
      jail-based Specialized Early Engagement Team that receives referrals, engages detainees, and
      serves as a bridge to community-based CSC. The study team will design and implement the
      intervention, thoroughly study its feasibility and acceptability, and prepare an intervention
      manual for broader use in diverse jails and future formal research.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Persons with serious mental illnesses are overrepresented in jails. Criminal justice (CJ)
      involvement, including jail detention, is common among those with first-episode psychosis
      (FEP) and frequently precedes psychiatric treatment engagement. Yet, no documented
      interventions currently exist specifically to identify/engage such individuals while in jail
      and connect them to Coordinated Specialty Care (CSC) in the community upon release. Expansion
      of CSC programs across the U.S. provides an opportunity for partnership with the CJ
      systemâ€”one that has the potential to reduce the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) and
      thus improve outcomes.

      To detect FEP and reduce DUP among detainees in a large, urban jail, the investigators
      propose to implement: (1) a &quot;Targeted Educational Campaign&quot; (TEC), and (2) a Specialized
      Early Engagement Team (SEET) in 3 jails on Rikers Island in New York City (NYC): Anna M.
      Kross Center (AMKC), Rose M. Singer Center (RMSC) and Robert N. Davoren Complex (RNDC).

      The investigators expect the multimedia TEC to generate referrals to the Correctional Health
      Services (CHS), and to reduce our DUP-1 (psychosis onset to antipsychotic initiation). Then,
      the jail-based SEET (a Social Worker and Peer Specialist) will link those identified to
      community-based CSC (primarily OnTrackNY sites in NYC), thus reducing DUP-2 (psychosis onset
      to CSC enrollment).

      The investigators will examine a set of hypothesized targets/mediators (the &quot;how's&quot;). These
      are key ingredients that underpin the intervention's ability to reduce DUP.

      The multi-media TEC will generate referrals to the CHS, by improving the behavioral
      capabilities, expectations, and self-efficacy (constructs from Social Cognitive Theory) of
      the Correction Officers trained. The SEET will then link detainees with FEP, using tenets of
      person-centered treatment and shared decision-making, and the Critical Time Intervention
      model, to community-based CSC. This will occur through engagement of detainees while in jail,
      and telephonically (when possible) after release. The investigators will assess feasibility
      and acceptability to lay the groundwork for a multi-site, definitive effectiveness trial.

    <description>Correction Officers will be exposed to the Targeted Educational Campaign (TEC) with the aim to increase their knowledge about the early symptoms of psychosis, and how to make a referral to the CHS staff, their self-efficacy to detect symptoms of psychosis and make referrals, and their expectations about their ability to be successful in making that referral (and for referrals to result in beneficial outcomes).
Correction Officers will be approached and recruited during roll call and in the staff canteen where they take their meal breaks, or at a time/location agreed upon by the Department of Correction, to complete brief surveys at three different times: pre-exposure, after 6 months, and after 12 months from the beginning of the TEC.</description>
