  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study tests using a wheelchair back that supports the spine in a neutral position and
      one that allows the spine and pelvis to fall into a posterior pelvic tilt.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals will randomly start with the supportive back vs the unsupportive back.
      Measurements of the spine and pelvis will be taken. Forward upward reach, one stroke push,
      times forward push and ramp skills will be assessed.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Seated Body Measurements performed.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 hour session (one visit)</time_frame>
    <description>Angle measurements will be taken when sitting. These include the pelvic angle (femur to pelvis) and Spinal Angle of Kyphosis (femur to acromion).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Vertical Forward Reach Test (VFRT):</measure>
    <time_frame>2 hour session (one visit)</time_frame>
    <description>Assesses stability by measuring the maximum distance an individual can reach forward vertically (upward) while sitting in a fixed position.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Breathing status:</measure>
    <time_frame>2 hour session (one visit)</time_frame>
    <description>An instrument called a spirometer is placed into the mouth with the nose clipped and the individual is instructed to take a deep breath and blow out. Peak effort flow, peak cough flow, and functional capacity will be recorded.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>One stroke push:</measure>
    <time_frame>2 hour session (one visit)</time_frame>
    <description>This measures how far the wheelchair moves forward with one stroke over carpet.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Timed forward Wheeling/Wheelchair Propulsion Test (WPT):</measure>
    <time_frame>2 hour session (one visit)</time_frame>
    <description>The WPT is a brief test measuring the number of wheelchair pushes and time needed to cross a distance of 23 meters</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Ramp Ascent (forward wheeling</measure>
    <time_frame>2 hour session (one visit)</time_frame>
    <description>This is a timed test on a 10.3 meter ramp with a 1:13 grade slope</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Scale:</measure>
    <time_frame>2 hour session (one visit)</time_frame>
    <description>The participant will rate any pain felt while sitting in the test wheelchairs after all activities using a numerical scale of 0-10, with 0 being no pain.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>2 hour session (one visit)</time_frame>
    <description>The study team developed a survey for patients to fill out asking questions such as comfort of back support and opinions of practicality of back support.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Breathing status:</measure>
    <time_frame>2 hour session (one visit)</time_frame>
