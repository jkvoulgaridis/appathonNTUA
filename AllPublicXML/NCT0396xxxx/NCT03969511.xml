    <textblock>
      Rationale: Acute large-vessel strokes, requiring endovascular treatment, are currently being
      managed through radiology department before being transferred to the angiography room.
      However, patients with severe neurological deficit have demonstrated even greater benefits
      from recanalization as the symptom onset-to-reperfusion time is shortened to less than 1
      hour. Recent pilot study have shown a benefit in reducing management delays with direct
      admission to the angiography room and subsequently in increasing functional independence at 3
      months. Therefore, the aim is to demonstrate the superiority of the direct angio-suite
      transfer versus the standard management, in terms of 3-month functional independence, in
      patients strongly suspected of having a severe ischemic stroke related to acute large-vessel
      occlusion of the anterior circulation, and treated by mechanical thrombectomy ± intravenous
      thrombolysis.

      Methods and Design: The DIRECT ANGIO trial is a (PROBE) randomized, multicenter, controlled,
      open-label, blinded endpoint clinical trial.

      Study Outcomes: The primary outcome is the rate of patients with 3-month functional
      independence defined as modified Rankin Scale score ≤2 at 3 months.

      Methods:

      Design: The DIRECT ANGIO trial is a French academic, investigator-initiated, multicenter,
      controlled, open-label, blinded endpoint, two-arm randomized, clinical trial to compare the
      effectiveness and safety of direct angio-suite admission versus the standard radiological or
      emergency departement-based management in ≤75 year-old patients with suspected proximal
      arterial occlusion lesion. As of March 2020, 9 comprehensive stroke centres (Besançon,
      Bordeaux, Colmar, Limoges, Montpellier, Nancy, Reims, Foch Hospital, Rothschild foundation)
      have agreed to participate.

      Patient population: As of the phone call from the emergency rescue service, the
      neurologist/the emergency medical doctor will check inclusion and exclusion criteria and then
      randomize the patient during the travel to the hospital.

      Inclusion criteria: All consecutive patients with the following features are enrolled, under
      the condition of immediate availability of the angio-suite and the medical team:

        -  aged 18 to ≤75 years,

        -  strongly suspected of having an acute and severe neurological deficit related to acute
           large-vessel occlusion of the anterior circulation (hemiparesis or hemiplegia with at
           least one sign of cortical damage : aphasia, hemianopsia, hemi-neglect, deviation of the
           head and eyes),

        -  who can be admitted to hospital within an anticipated 5 hours after symptom onset,

      According to the French laws, oral informed consent will be sought via telephone
      conversations from patient if their level of consciousness is sufficient or from their
      relatives. Written informed consent will be then given at hospital. In case of inability to
      consent and absence of the relatives, informed consent to follow will be obtained.

      Exclusion criteria are detailed below.

      Randomization: After inclusion and before hospital arrival, i.e. during the transfer to the
      hospital, patients are randomized in the two treatment arms using a web-based centralized
      system with a 1:1 ratio to either direct angio-suite management or standard management. To
      deal with open-label, 3-month functional outcome is gathered with blinding to randomization
      arm.

      Treatment and Intervention

      Intervention Arm: Upon arrival in angio-suite and after neurological examination with scoring
      National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and modified Rankin Scale (mRS), and
      performing blood sampling, electrocardiogram and weight estimation, patient undergoes
      rotational Cone Beam CT (CBCT) in order to confirm ischemic stroke and CBCT-angiography in
      order to confirm proximal arterial occlusion lesion. Mechanical thrombectomy is then
      performed as well as intravenous thrombolysis when contraindications are excluded.

      It should be noted that in the absence of proximal or distal intracranial arterial occlusion,
      the patient will be redirected to standard management as in the control arm. They will thus
      benefit from cerebral MRI/CT-scan and the treatment strategy will then be determined.

      Control Arm: Arrival is in the MRI/CT-scan room or in the emergency department. Directly
      after neurological examination and blood sample, patient undergoes imaging. If required,
      patient undergoes intravenous thrombolysis directly in the MRI/CT-scan room or after transfer
      in the stroke unit or in the emergency service, according to the practices of the centres
      involved.

      In a second step, the patient is admitted in the angio-suite if mechanical thrombectomy
      indicated. The transfer to angio-suite will be carried out as soon as possible.

      All patients data will be recorded in an electronic case report form (e-CRF) and imagings
      will be recorded in a centralized database, located in the Clinical Investigation
      Centre-Technological Innovation of Nancy, in order to a centralized radiological reading by
      the Imaging Core Lab.

      Clinical assessment

      Clinical evaluation is conducted early, as soon as the first telephone contact with the
      emergency rescue service or the fire brigade, by the neurologist at the participating centre
      who confirms that the patients meet the inclusion criteria.

      Clinical assessment includes then demographics and collection of routine clinical information
      (comorbidities, symptoms, vital constants), allergy contraindications. Neurological deficit
      will be assessed using the NIHSS score and pre-stroke disability with mRS by a neurologist at
      hospital admission.

      At 3 months (±15 days) and 12 months (±1 month), the mRS score will be centralized gathered
      by a trained clinical research nurse blinded to randomization group via a telephone
      conversation. The 12-month outcome assessment comprises medical ongoing treatment, vital
      status, serious adverse effect and EQ-5D questionnaire.

      Care workflow time will record all the delays between each strategy time (onset-to-admission
      in angio-suite/radiology department time; onset-to-intravenous thrombolysis, onset-to-groin
      puncture, onset-to-reperfusion times).

      Imaging protocol Baseline imaging characteristics in the standard management group is either
      magnetic resonance imaging with 3D-Time of Flight (TOF) sequence or CT-scan with intracranial
      angiography and CT-perfusion sequence. In the angio-suite group, rotational CBCT and
      CBCT-angiography will be performed.

      The imaging protocol in angio-suite will be harmonized between the centres and the quality of
      the images evaluated before the study is implemented.

      Furthermore, if mechanical thrombectomy is indicated, angiographic perfusion will be assessed
      with the modified Treatment In Cerebral Ischemia (mTICI) score on initial and final
      angiograms and collateral status with the Grading Collateral System (GCS) score on initial
      angiogram, in the two groups.

      Primary Outcomes The primary outcome is the rate of patients with 3-month functional
      independence defined as modified Rankin Scale score ≤2 at 3 months (±15 days), irrespective
      of the pathology that actually led to the hospitalisation and of the treatment actually
      received. It will be centralized gathered via telephone conversations with patients and their
      relatives by a certified clinical research nurse with blinding to the randomized group.

      Secondary Outcomes

      Secondary feasibility outcomes will include

        -  the rate of confirmed large-vessel stroke in the intervention and the control groups,

        -  the rate of proximal intracranial occlusion of the anterior circulation in the
           intervention group,

        -  the hospital admission-to-imaging time / the admission-to-thrombolysis time / the
           admission-to-puncture time / the admission-to-reperfusion time,

        -  the imaging-to-puncture time / the imaging-to-reperfusion time,

        -  the puncture-to-reperfusion time.

      Secondary Effectiveness outcomes will include :

        -  the quality of final perfusion according to the mTICI score: percentage of patients with
           reperfusion defined by mTICI 0, 1, 2a, 2b, 2c, and 3 (modified Treatment In Cerebral
           Infarction) at the end of thrombectomy,

        -  the rate of complications per procedure: embolus in new territory, arterial perforation,
           arterial dissection

        -  the 24-hour (±6 hours) clinical improvement staged with the NIHSS score, the NIHSS at
           5-7 days (or at hospital discharge if within 5 days),

        -  the blinded 12-month (±1 month) functional outcome valued by the mRS score,

        -  the rate of cerebral hemorrhage at admission,

        -  the rate of patients without proximal intracranial arterial occlusion,

        -  the rate of conversion to the standard management

      Secondary safety outcomes will comprise:

        -  the rate of 24-hour asymptomatic and symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhagic
           transformation as defined by the Safe Implementation of Thrombolysis in
           Stroke-Monitoring Study (SITS-MOST),

        -  the rate of overall mortality (mRS score 6) at 3-month (±15 days) and at 12 months (±1
           month),

        -  the inhospital rate of neurosurgical procedure (malignant stroke or large intracerebral
           hemorrhage with mass effect).

        -  the rate of stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic), of stroke unrelated to large-vessel
           occlusion,

        -  the rate of patients treated by intravenous thrombolysis alone and who required
           additional imaging (MRI or CT-scan),

        -  the rate of stroke mimics (tumour, epilepsy).

      Medico-economic analyses will assess the avoided health care costs in an health insurance
      perspective and provide a cost-utility evaluation using the Health-Related Quality of Life
      Questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) at 12-month (±1 month) from inclusion. Health costs will be
      collected from a national database (the National Institute of Health Data) using a matching
      method.

      Data Monitoring Body: To ensure that appropriate ethical consideration is given to the
      welfare of the patients enrolled in the study, a DSMB was formed. The members of the DSMB are
      not participants of the DIRECT ANGIO consortium and not involved in the clinical trial. The
      DSMB is composed by one neuroradiologist, one pharmacovigilance specialist and one
      methodologist, who are not participating in the study and are not affiliated with the
      sponsor.

      In addition, one interim analysis is planned once 50% of patients have been included, for the
      study to be stopped early owing either to compelling evidence of efficacy (using a
      pre-specified Haybittle-Peto efficacy boundary with an alpha level of 0.001) or of futility.

      Sample Size Estimates:

      The type I error is specified at 0.05 with a power of 80%. Assuming 30% of patients
      randomized in the control arm achieve 3-month mRS score ≤2 and an absolute difference of 20%
      between the two arms, we will need a sample size of 93 patients per group for a two-sided
      test. To deal with 10% drop-out, we will include a total of 208 patients.

      Statistical Analyses:

      Demographic and baseline clinical-radiological characteristics will be provided in the entire
      inclusion cohort. Descriptive statistics will include drop-out rate for each covariates and
      use chi-squared, Fisher's exact, Student or Mann-Whitney test when appropriate.

      Comparisons between two randomized arms for the primary outcome will be made in the
      intention-to-treat and in the per-protocol sets with a logistic regression adjusted on the
      center. Odds ratio (OR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) for dichotomous primary outcome
      will be reported.

      The secondary efficacy and safety outcomes will be assessed with chi-square tests for
      categorical variables (eg, overall mortality and serious adverse events) and Student's t test
      for continuous variables (eg, mean 24-hour NIHSS).

      In addition, one interim analysis is planned once 50% of patients have been included, for the
      study to be stopped early owing either to compelling evidence of efficacy (using a
      pre-specified Haybittle-Peto efficacy boundary with an alpha level of 0.001) or of futility.

      Furthermore, the medico-economic analysis will take into account disability costs and health
      costs avoided with the interventional strategy. A cost-utility analysis will be also
      performed with health-related quality of life estimated with EQ-5D-5L questionnaire.

      The study protocol was approved by the National Commission for Informatics and Liberties
      (CNIL), the Comité de Protection des Personnes (CPP).
