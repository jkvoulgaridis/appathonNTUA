    <description>Patients in the DEB-TACE group received a maximum dose of 4 ml of DC bead (diameter 75-500 um) loaded with a maximum dose of 150 mg of anthracyclines drugs, such as doxorubicin. The anticancer agents and the diameter of DC Bead for individual patient will be selected according to the common clinical practice of each center. Treatment endpoint consisted of stasis of flow within feeding vessel(s) or completed delivery of maximum single-session dose of 150 mg doxorubicin. TACE will be repeated &quot;on demand&quot; according to the radiological response.</description>

    <description>Patients in the cTACE group were treated with anthracyclines, such as doxorubicin, in a mixture of lipiodol. Administration of the anticancer in oil emulsion was followed by injection of embolic materials such as gelfoam or PVA particles until complete stasis in segmental or subsegmental arterial branches. the tumor-feeding vessels should be superselected whenever possible. The anticancer agents for individual patient will be selected according to the common clinical practice of each center. TACE will be repeated &quot;on demand&quot; according to the radiological response.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior informed consent

          2. Confirmed Diagnosis of HCC: a. Cirrhotic subjects: Clinical diagnosis by American
             Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) criteria. HCC can be defined in
             cirrhotic subjects by one imaging technique (CT scan, MRI, or second generation
             contrast ultrasound) showing a nodule larger than 2 cm with contrast uptake in the
             arterial phase and washout in venous or late phases or two imaging techniques showing
             this radiological behavior for nodules of 1-2 cm in diameter. Cytohistological
             confirmation is required for subjects who do not fulfill these eligibility criteria.
             b. Non-cirrhotic subjects: For subjects without cirrhosis, histological or cytological
             confirmation is mandatory. Documentation of original biopsy for diagnosis is
             acceptable

          3. Patients with unresectable Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage A and BCLC B,
             and all patients have a intermediate or high tumor burden (the diameter of largest
             tumor plus tumor number is more than 6)
