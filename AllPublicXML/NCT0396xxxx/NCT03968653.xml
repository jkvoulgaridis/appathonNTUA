    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of
      Debio 0123 in combination with carboplatin in participants with advanced solid tumors that
      recurred or progressed following prior platinum based therapy and for which no standard
      therapy of proven benefit is available.
