  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The FES-ABLE project results from an Iberian partnership and aims to evaluate the impact of
      an intervention based on a functional electrical stimulation (FES) prototype on the upper
      limb movement quality during functional tasks. The results of this project will contribute to
      the definition of the therapeutic window of FES to improve upper limb function in stroke
      rehabilitation.

    <measure>Kinematic metrics change</measure>
    <time_frame>Kinematic metrics will be assessed during 2 months and they will be reported through study completion, an average of 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>End-point kinematics and joint kinematics will be analyzed. Regarding end-point kinematics, to evaluate speed, the absolute and relative movement times will be calculated separately for each phase and for the entire tasks, as well as the peak velocity for reach, forward and backward transport and return phases. To assess efficiency, smoothness and control strategy of movement, the índex of curvature, the number of velocity peaks (or number of motor units) and the time to peak velocity will be respectively calculated for reach, forward and backward transport and return phases.
Regarding joint kinematics, joint angles5 of shoulder, elbow and wrist at onset of each phase will be calculated, as well as maximum aperture and time to maximum aperture in reach and return phases, and trunk displacement (to measure compensation) for each phase.</description>

    <measure>User satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>User satisfaction will be assessed during 2 months and it will be reported through study completion, an average of 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants' satisfaction will be assessed through an adaptation of the Reduced Upper Extremity Motor Activity Log Questionnaire. In this adapted questionnaire, the participant will be asked to classify the use of the arm in function of the quantity (0 - not used;1 - very rarely; 2 - rarely; 3 -half pre-stroke; 4- 3/4 pre-stroke; 5 - same as pre-stroke.) and quality (0 - not used.1 - very poor.2 - poor.3 - fair.4 - almost normal.5 - normal.) in the evaluated tasks.</description>
