  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is the characterization of parameters from medical history, physical
      examination and diagnostics, which correlate with and could be used to predict diuretic
      efficacy.

    <textblock>
      This prospective observational study is conducted to identify and further isolate possible
      predictors for the efficacy of diuretics and to identify potential new predictors.

      The study also observes if specific diuretic regimes (e.g. combination of loop diuretics and
      distal effective diuretics for sequential nephron blockade) have a greater diuretic effect.
      This is not yet proved.

      The data of the study shall to help to determine criteria, allowing to choose an effective
      diuretic regime in different patient cohorts already at the beginning of therapy and to
      identify patients at high risk.
