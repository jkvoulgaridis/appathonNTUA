    <textblock>
      In this study evaluated the prevalence of sacroiliac joint dysfunction in patients with
      lumbar disc hernia and examined the variations in clinical parameters cause by this
      combination.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two hundred thirty-four patients already diagnosed with lumbar disc hernia were included in
      the study. During the evaluation, sacroiliac joint dysfunction was investigated using
      specific tests, pain levels with a Visual Analog Scale, and the presence of neuropathic pain
      using the Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs Pain Scale. Other clinical
      assessments were performed using the Beck Depression Inventory, Health Assessment
      Questionnaire, and Tampa Kinesiophobia Scale. Positivity in three out of six provocation
      tests was adopted as a criterion for sacroiliac joint dysfunction.

      Sample Size A power analysis using the formula n= t2pq / d2 was performed to determine the
      sample size. Based on those data the investigators concluded that a minimum of 174 and a
      maximum of 322 patients would be required to achieve significant results, and 234 patients
      were enrolled.

      Statistical Analysis The study data were expressed as mean plus standard deviation (SD) for
      constant variables values and as number and percentage for categoric variables. The
      chi-square test was used to analyze categoric variables. Results were evaluated at a 95%
      confidence interval at a significance level of p˂0.05. The analysis was performed on
      Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) for Windows 16.0 software.

      The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guideline
      has been implemented in this manuscript.

    <measure>Examination of the level of pain caused by this combination which with sacroiliac joint dysfunction in lumbar disc hernia</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>All patients were evaluated in terms of pain threshold measurements using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). The patient is asked to mark the severity of the pain on a horizontal or vertical 10 cm line. It is defined as 0 no pain, 5 moderate pain, 10 is the most severe pain encountered in life.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Examination the presence of depression caused by this combination which with sacroiliac joint dysfunction in lumbar disc hernia</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The presence of depression was evaluated using the Beck Depression Inventory. The Beck Depression Inventory created by Aaron T. Beck, is a 21-question multiple-choice self-report inventory, one of the most widely used psychometric tests for measuring the severity of depression.
Each answer is scored on a scale value of 0 to 3. Higher total scores indicate more severe depressive symptoms.
In this study evaluated that there is no depression between 0 and 13 points, a moderate depression of 14-24 points, and a severe depression of more than 25 points.</description>

    <measure>Effect on the quality of life this combination which with sacroiliac joint dysfunction in lumbar disc hernia: Health Assessment Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life was performed using the Health Assessment Questionnaire.The Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) was originally developed in 1978 by James F. Fries, MD, and colleagues at Stanford University. The domain of disability is assessed by the eight categories of dressing, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and common activities. Discomfort is determined by the presence of pain and its severity. Each answer is rated 0-3. The Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) is a questionnaire that reflects the functional status, and its score is correlated with disease activity indicators.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Examination the presence of kinesiophobia caused by this combination which with sacroiliac joint dysfunction in lumbar disc hernia</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The presence of kinesiophobia was evaluated using the Tampa Kinesiophobia Scale.The Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK)that was developed in 1990 is a 17 item questionnaire used to assess the subjective rating of Kinesiophobia or fear of movement. The original questionnaire was developed to &quot;discriminate between non-excessive fear and phobia among patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain''. The TSK is a self-completed questionnaire and the range of scores are from 17 to 68 where the higher scores indicate an increasing degree of Kinesiophobia.</description>
