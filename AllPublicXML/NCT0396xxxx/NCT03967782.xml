    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to compare the effect of realizing an exercise right before
      or right after a meal of on energy intake, appetite feelings and food reward in adolescents
      with obesity.

    <textblock>
      The present study will compare the nutritional response to the realisation of an acute
      exercise right before or right after lunch in adolescents with obesity. 18 adolescents with
      obesity will be asked to randomly complete three experimental sessions: i) one control
      session (rest); ii) one session with an acute exercise realized right before lunch; iii) one
      session with an acute exercise realized right after lunch. Their ad libitum energy intake
      will be assessed during lunch as well as at dinner time. Appetite feelings will be assessed
      at regular intervals and their food reward in response to the lunch will also be assessed.

    <description>food intake will be measured ad libitum during a lunch buffet. The adolescents will be offered an ad libitum buffet-type meal composed based on their food intake preferences. Their intake will be weighted using an electronic food scale by a member of the investigation team and then analysed using Bilnuts software.</description>
