  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is the longitudinal prospective clinical evaluation in patients
      with motor predominant PD; it will assess the individual disease progression (change) of the
      clinical and imaging parameters measured at 6-month interval over a minimum of 12 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The absence of clear PD subtypes defining a common path and rate of disease progression,
      combined with the absence of validated biomarkers indicative of disease progression and a
      strong placebo effect, constitute a challenge for clinical trials assessing new potential
      disease-modifying therapies in PD.

      The present cohort would constitute a well-defined population of patients, with individual
      progression assessment, suitable to evaluate new disease-modifying therapies in a subsequent
      Phase1/2 clinical trial.

          8. L-Dopa treatment stable for at least 4 weeks

          9. Covered by healthcare insurance

         10. Written informed consent form signed

        Exclusion Criteria:

             by a psychiatrist or a neurologist at the selection period

          5. Any medical or psychological problems which may interfere with a smooth conduction of
             the study protocol (e.g. cancer with a limited life expectancy)

          6. History of significant brain or vascular disease (tumor, epilepsy, stroke …)

          7. Any contraindication for undergoing MRI of the head

          8. Prior brain surgical procedures with or without implementation of an intra-cerebral
             device

          9. Drug or alcohol addiction

         10. Pregnancy or breastfeeding

         14. Simultaneous participation in another clinical trial with the administration of
             investigational drug(s)
