  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In prior research the investigators have shown that the Mobility and Vitality Lifestyle
      Program for healthy aging and weight management (MOVE UP) was effective in producing a mean
      loss of &gt;= 5% body weight, with increased physical activity and reduced fatigue. The current
      study will pilot a modified and streamlined program to see if it will be similarly effective.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to test feasibility of Community Health Worker delivery of a modified
      and streamlined lifestyle program in volunteer community settings and to provide pilot data
      to inform the design of future randomized controlled trials that may improve physical and
      mental health in older adults. The current objective is to:

        1. Adapt and pilot the previously studied 32-session, 13-month MOVE UP intervention to a
           streamlined 12-session (4-month) community-based translational behavioral weight
           management program. The pilot program will be delivered by trained Community Health
           Workers (CHWs).

        2. Implement and evaluate the program's impact on weight and healthy lifestyle changes,
           including physical performance outcomes, at 2 sites, each with at least 6 eligible obese
           adults ages 60-75 years old.

    <description>Each of the 12-group-sessions will focus on incremental behavioral strategies for maintaining recommended healthy eating, activity, and weight loss behaviors. Participants will monitor body weight and weight loss behaviors. Body weight will be measured at each in-person session and participants will also be encouraged to measure their body weight on their own. Beginning in Session 3, participants are given a home physical activity goal of 10 minutes/day, 50 minutes/week. The goal is raised by 5 minutes/day, 25 minutes/week every other session, the final goal being 30 minutes/day, 150 minutes/week. All subjects will be recommended to engage in an energy restricted dietary intervention that evidence demonstrates has effectively reduced body weight by 5-7% within the initial 4 months of the intervention. This will include reducing energy intake to 1200 to 1800 kcal/d based on initial body weight (&lt;200 pounds = 1200 kcal/d; 200 to 250 pounds = 1500 kcal/d; &gt;250 pounds = 1800 kcal/d).</description>
