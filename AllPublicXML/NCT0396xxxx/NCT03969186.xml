  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled trial comparing a simple telehealth intervention
      implemented after hospital discharge to standard of care, specifically looking at the number
      of hospital readmissions throughout the course of the study. All cirrhotic patients admitted
      to the Hepatology service at The Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania will be
      approached and consenting patients will be randomized to one of the two arms as outlined
      below. Patients will be followed for 90 days with daily texts and weekly phone calls. The
      rates of 30 and 90 day readmission as well as the days to readmission will be compared
      between the two study groups.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with cirrhosis and ascites comprise a large percentage of hospital admissions. As a
      large transplant center, the University of Pennsylvania sees an average of 54-65 cirrhotic
      patients admitted to the hepatology service every month. Many of these admissions are
      preventable and can be attributed to poor medication adherence and late detection of clinical
      deterioration. By introducing a telehealth intervention following hospital discharge,
      investigators seek to decrease the number of readmissions for these patients by encouraging
      and assisting with improved adherence and by regularly tracking the progression of symptoms.

      This interventional study will serve a dual purpose of helping both the patient and their
      provider. Patients will obtain an extra line of communication to their providers that eases
      their ability to access resources and alert their providers to new symptoms. Similarly, by
      instituting a triaged system of communication with the patient, their health team is able to
      offer more individualized treatment while also providing more immediate attention at the
      first signs of clinical deterioration. This study will determine rates of 30 and 90-day
      readmissions in both cohorts as a way to examine the impact of a simple telehealth
      intervention compared to standard of care.

    <description>The intervention arm will receive a simple telehealth intervention utilizing the Way to Health Platform engineered at the University of Pennsylvania. This platform will be used to send daily SMS messages to patients for 90 days following discharge and alert the research team to changes in patients' status. In addition, the patients in the intervention arm will receive a weekly phone call administered by members of the research team to assess their overall progress and well-being.</description>
