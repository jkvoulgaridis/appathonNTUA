      This study intends to determine the effects of trigger point dry needling in patients with
      Patellofemoral pain Syndrome.

      This is a single blinded randomized controlled trial, will be conducted at District Head
      Quarter (DHQ) hospital Taunsa Sharif.

      Dry needling is a technique used to release myofascial trigger points. this study is planned
      to determine the effects of dry needling on quadriceps muscle in patients with Patellofemoral
      pain syndrome. The sample size was calculated to be n=92 through Open Epi tool version 3,
      with 95 % confidence interval (CI), and power 80%,

      After the completion of therapeutic protocols, the participants will be assessed with the
      help of Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS), Algometer and Anterior Knee Pain scale along with
      knee Range of Motion(ROM)

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) is used to assess pain. It scores ranges from 0-10, 0 means No pain and 10 means Severe pain. Patient will be asked to verbally report the pain score.</description>

    <measure>Algometer</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Pressure threshold is the minimal pressure (force) which induces pain. The digital algometer is a force gauge with a rubber disc of 1 cm2 surface. It will be placed over trigger point in muscle and pressure pain sensitivity would be measured.</description>

    <measure>Anterior Knee Pain Scale (AKPS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Anterior Knee Pain Scale (AKPS) - sometimes called the Kujala Scale is a 13-item knee-specific self-report questionnaire. It documents response to six activities (walking, running, jumping, climbing stairs, squatting, and sitting for prolonged periods with knees bent), as well as symptoms such as limp.
The maximum score is 100 that indicate good results, if score is 70 then it is moderate, lower scores like 50 or below 50 indicates severity of the disease.</description>

    <description>Hot Pack will be applied on Quadriceps muscles before session for general relaxation for 7-10 minutes. Stretching of quadriceps femoris muscle with 4 repetitions and 15 second hold per session will be performed. Strengthening exercises of 3 sets of 10 RM with progressive loading per session will be performed.
Then after wearing gloves and appropriate personal protective measures, a thin filiform needle will be inserted which will penetrate into the skin and stimulate underlying myofascial trigger points.</description>
