  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC), a tumoral tumor of the peritoneum, is a frequent metastatic
      localization of colorectal cancer (CRC, 13%). Long regarded as a palliative situation, its
      management has progressed significantly with a curative treatment based on a complete
      cytoreduction surgery coupled with intraperitoneal hyperthermic chemotherapy. However current
      screening tools, tumor markers (ACE, CA19-9, CA125) and abdominopelvic CT scan are
      insufficient, to diagnose CP early. A non-invasive biomarker, more sensitive and more
      specific than currently available tumor markers, would be a major advance in oncology.
      Microparticles (MPs), vesicles from extracellular membrane budding in response to cell
      activation or apoptosis of different cell types, have been described as implicated in tumor
      progression, procoagulant activity associated with cancer, and initiation of metastatic
      niches. A specific microparticulate (microparticulosome) signature has been reported in
      patients with CRC, particularly in the presence of a thromboembolic event. However, there is
      currently no data on PMs and their involvement in CP. In addition, CP and surgery coupled
      with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy are major risk factors for thromboembolic
      complications. The characterization of prothrombotic PMs is therefore essential to predict
      such event.

      The main objective of this project is to characterize the microparticulate signature of CP of
      colorectal origin and to compare it with that of CP without CP. The secondary objectives are
      to compare the microparticulate signature obtained on peripheral venous samples and
      intraoperative tumor samples, evaluate the evolution of the microparticulate signature
      between the beginning and the end of the intervention, then correlate the peripheral
      signature to the oncological follow-up of the patients with CP and the occurrence of a
      thromboembolic event.
