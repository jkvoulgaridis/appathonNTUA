  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The concept of &quot;enhanced recovery&quot; was introduced by European anesthesiologists and surgeons
      who challenged traditional clinical practices involved in peri-operative care in 1990s. The
      goal of enhanced recovery programs (ERP) is to maintain normal physiology thereby decreasing
      complications. It focuses on peri-operative optimization of patient care. It was originally
      created for open colorectal surgeries but now has shown benefit in various surgical
      specialities including thoracic surgery, vascular surgery, hepatobiliary as well as
      gynecological surgery.

      The successful implementation of structured ERAS program requires an ERAS protocol, audit
      system and a multidisciplinary team. The investigators will evaluate the effect of compliance
      with the protocol and outcomes such as length of stay, readmissions, morbidity and mortality.

      After approval by the Institutional Review Board, the investigators plan to retrospectively
      study gynecological patients who underwent ERAS protocol at Augusta University Medical Center
      between January 2017 and February 2019.

      This is a retrospective observational study to evaluate the outcomes of patients who had ERAS
      protocol during their surgery.

      Demographic and outcome variables will be obtained from the institutional health
      documentation system. The investigators will collect demographic variables (age, ASA status),
      morphometric measurements (body mass index), time from enrollment to ERAS protocol,
      hospitalization length of stay, and readmission rate. The investigators will also record the
      documentation of the ERAS protocol interventions against the ERAS protocol approved by the
      institution. The investigators will assess the effect of the degree of compliance on outcome
      variables.
