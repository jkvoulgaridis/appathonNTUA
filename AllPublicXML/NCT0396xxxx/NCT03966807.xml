  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to examine, in an innovative setting, the potential for a
      lung cancer diagnosis in a loved one to represent a teachable moment for smoking cessation in
      family members or caregivers who are current smokers. The researchers will identify the
      willingness and preferred modality for smoking cessation among family members/caregivers in
      this setting. The researchers will estimate abstinence rates at 4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks..

        Patients with newly diagnosed lung cancers will be identified from the daily patient lists
        at the thoracic oncology clinics at IUSCC, Roudebush VAMC, and Eskenazi. The study
        coordinator will screen for newly diagnosed lung cancer patients to identify potential
        family member/caregiver study participants.

        Patients will be approached and asked whether they have any family members/caregivers who
        smoke, and if they would be willing to allow the study team to contact those people (or
        person) with information about the study. For patients who agree and have family
        members/caregivers present at the clinic visit that day, the study coordinator (or other
        designated member of the study team) will discuss the purpose of the study and utilize the
        5A strategy (Ask, Advice, Assess willingness to quit, Assist, Arrange follow-up) to
        ascertain interest in participation.
