  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To verify the role of nab-paclitaxel in neoadjuvant therapy for esophageal squamous cell
      carcinoma, the investigators designed a prospective, randomized, controlled , multicente
      phase II trial, to investigate the efficacy and safety of nab-paclitaxel combined with
      cisplatin as neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgery versus surgery alone for esophageal
      squamous cell carcinoma.
