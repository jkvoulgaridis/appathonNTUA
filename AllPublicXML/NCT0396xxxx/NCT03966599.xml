      This study was designed to evaluate whether patient position (lateral vs. prone) has affect
      on the need for analgesia and onset of pain after surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy is the preferred surgical treatment in many cases of kidney
      stones which is performed in different positions such as prone, lateral, and supine. However,
      we do not have enough evidence comparing prone and lateral positioning regarding the need for
      analgesia and onset of pain after surgery. This study was designed to evaluate whether
      patient position (lateral vs. prone) has affect on the need for analgesia and onset of pain
      after surgery.

    <description>determining pain with visual analogue scale (VAS) and need for analgesics (milligram) in lateral versus prone position. The visual analogue scale (VAS) is usually presented as a 100-mm horizontal line on which the patient's pain intensity is represented by a point between the extremes of &quot;no pain at all&quot; and &quot;worst pain imaginable.&quot; Its simplicity, reliability, and validity, as well as its ratio scale properties, make the VAS the optimal tool for describing pain severity or intensity.</description>
