  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Goal of this study is to develop and evaluate a physiotherapy concept that is focused on
      bilateral leg spasticity and aims to reduce spastic gait disturbance and to improve mobility
      in patients suffering from HSP.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized single-center parallel study with a control group design. A blinded
      block randomization in groups of four was performed in equal parts toward the treatment (TPC)
      or the control (regular standard-of-care) group using randomization.com. Group assignment was
      kept in a closed envelope which was opened by the participant at the end of the baseline
      visit. Therefore both, the movement disorder specialist as well as the physiotherapist, were
      blinded to the randomization result for the baseline assessment up to the beginning of the
      first physiotherapy training session.

      Therapeutic effects were evaluated at follow-up visits after 12 weeks (first visit,
      short-term effect) and after 26 weeks (second visit, long-term effect) comparing standard-of
      care with the TPC. Clinical evaluation is stated in detail below. Primary outcome assessment
      of this study was the change between baseline and follow-up assessment in treatment to
      control group in the spastic paraplegia rating scale (SPRS) score as a validated measure of
      disease severity (see Reference). Secondary outcome assessment was the change in walking
      distance in the Three-Minute-Walking test (3MW). Further exploratory outcome assessments were
      evaluated as effect sizes as specified below.
