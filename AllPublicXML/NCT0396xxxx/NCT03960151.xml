          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 2.5 × ULN

          -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 2.5 × ULN

          -  No concurrent use of thioridazine or pimozide. No use of agents expected to induce the
             metabolism of rolapitant which include: Rifampin, Rifabutin, Phenytoin, Carbamazepine,
             and Barbiturates.

          -  As determined by the enrolling physician or protocol designee, ability of the subject
             to understand and comply with study procedures for the entire length of the study

          -  Patients and their partners must agree to use a highly effective method of birth
             control from the signing of the informed consent form until 90 days following the last
             dose of rolapitant.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any untreated central nervous system (CNS) metastases.

          -  Treatment with any investigational drug within 30 days prior to registration.

          -  Concurrent participation in a clinical trial which involves another investigational
             agent.
