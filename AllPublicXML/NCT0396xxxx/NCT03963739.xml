    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to examine how adenocarcinoma of the prostate treatment
      differentially affects African American men's ability to work and to describe and compare
      changes in work ability (as measured through self-reported global work ability item) reported
      by African American and white adenocarcinoma of the prostate survivors before treatment and 6
      months after treatment completion.

      This observational, longitudinal study will recruit approximately 220 patients through the
      Wake Forest National Cancer Institute Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) Research
      Base (WF NCORP RB). The recruitment goal will be to have 160 participants who complete the
      interviewer-administered Structured Questionnaire at all three time points. All participants
      will be administered the first Structured Questionnaire prior to a prostatectomy or
      initiation of radiation therapy to treat adenocarcinoma of the prostate. Participants will
      also be administered Structured Questionnaires at three and six months after the
      prostatectomy or completion of radiation therapy. For most patients, the time between study
      enrollment and completion of participation will be approximately 6 - 10 months.
      Interviewer-administered Structured Questionnaires will address work ability, job
      characteristics, presence of symptoms associated with adenocarcinoma of the prostate
      treatment, and general background information.

    <measure>Change in work ability measured by Global Work Ability</measure>

    <description>Calculate 95% confidence intervals around the work ability score and the change in the work ability score. A two group t-test will be used to compare changes in the work ability score by race (white, African American), followed by a general linear model to compare changes in work ability with adjustment for demographic, work environment, and other baseline characteristics.</description>

    <description>Examine whether demographics, treatment, psychosocial and physical effects of treatment, and work environment factors impact (a) desired and (b) actual length of leave following treatment for adenocarcinoma of the prostate. Factors that are significant at an alpha level of 0.25 or less or have significant interactions will be entered into a general linear model.</description>

    <measure>Effect of race and income on treatment-related function, work environment, and type of treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months after treatment completion</time_frame>
    <description>Will use interactions to test moderation effects of race and income on the relationship between adenocarcinoma of the prostate treatment-related function (bladder, bowel, and hormonal function), work environment (e.g., work demands, workplace control, and social support), and type of treatment (surgery or radiation therapy, hormonal treatment) regarding outcomes of work limitations (as measured by the Work Limitations Questionnaire), Global Work Ability item, employment status, and preferred and actual length. Work ability, as measured through the WLQ and the Global Work Ability measures, and preferred versus actual length of time off work will be modeled as continuous variables in general linear models; employment status will be modeled as dichotomous (logistic regression) or in a multinomial model depending on the distribution of responses.</description>

    <ipd_description>Wake Forest NCORP Research Base is committed to following the NIH Statement on Sharing Research Data (http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-03-032.html). As of July 2018, the WF NCORP RB signed an agreement with NCI to contribute de-identified data and data dictionaries from clinical trials conducted through our RB to the NCI NCTN/NCORP data archive within 6 months of primary and non-primary publications of phase II/III and phase III trials to https://nctn-data-archive.nci.nih.gov/. This will become the primary means for sharing raw data, and we will adhere to the guidelines spelled out in the NCTN/NCORP Data Archive Usage Guide. De-identified data from studies not covered by the agreement (e.g., phase II and observational studies) will be made available upon request. All data files will be de-identified. De-identification procedures will meet the HIPAA criteria as detailed in the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 45, Section 164.514.</ipd_description>
