  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators will determine whether using high flow oxygen in
      moderate-to-severe Obstructive Sleep Apnea patients following a major non cardiac surgery is
      more efficacious than usual care in preventing decrease in oxygen level in blood.

      The POSA-II trial is a culmination of the investigator's program of research to prevent
      postoperative adverse outcomes in surgical patients with untreated Obstructive Sleep Apnea
      (OSA). It is a multi center open label, randomized clinical trial of nasal high-flow vs.
      usual care in patients with untreated moderate-to-severe OSA undergoing major non cardiac
      surgery. It is a proof of concept trial to show that nasal high-flow reduces severe
      desaturation, the causal mechanism for OSA-related adverse events, and to collect key
      feasibility data for a large international multi center trial with enough power to detect
      effects on the clinical outcomes. Eligible patients undergoing major non cardiac surgery with
      high-risk OSA will have a home sleep study. One hundred and ninety patients with
      moderate-to-severe Sleep Apnea will be randomized into either nasal high-flow or usual care
      group. Sleep studies, oximetry, electrocardiogram (ECG), and Troponin will be done
      preoperatively. Postoperatively, ECG and Troponin will be determined daily for the 1st three
      days, and nocturnal oximetry for the 1st 3 nights. Patients will be followed during their
      hospitalization and for 30 days postoperatively to ascertain any adverse outcomes. A blinded
      clinical events committee will adjudicate all components of the composite outcome.

    <description>The investigators will measure Oxygen Desaturation Index(the number of desaturation events per hour) by using Pulsox 300i for maximum of three nights post-operatively at the hospital preventing the severe desaturation in surgical patients with untreated moderate-to-severe OSA undergoing major non cardiac surgery. Higher values of ODI are considered worst. If successful, it will provide feasibility data for the performance of a large randomized clinical trial focusing on clinical outcomes and the cost effectiveness of the therapy to the health care system.</description>

    <measure>Time (minutes) spent below 90% and 80% SpO2 (T90, T80)</measure>
    <time_frame>72 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will measure the time spent in minutes with SpO2 between 0% to %79 (T80) and the time spent in minutes with SpO2 between 0% to 89% (T90). ODI, T90 and T80 will serve as surrogate outcomes of adverse events in the pilot study. In POSA study, an increase in time spent with SpO2 &lt;80% after surgery was associated with a higher risk of postoperative vascular events under usual care.</description>

    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>The rate of postoperative cardiovascular events will be collected during hospitalization and following discharge from hospital, emergency department (if visited) and physician records, and patient by phone at day 30. Adjudicators who are blinded to the results of the ECG, Troponin, sleep study and oximetry will evaluate outcome events.</description>

    <description>Nasal High-Flow oxygen delivery will be applied starting at airflow of minimum 20 Litre/minute. It will be titrated in 15Litre/minute increments to 35 Litre/minute and a maximum 50 Litre/minute as determined by patient comfort. O2 supplementation will be managed by the anesthesia and surgical health care team to maintain the oxygen saturation level in the blood between 92-95%. In the Nasal High-Flow group, when SPO2 is in the range of 92-95%, air will be given instead of oxygen for the 1st 3 nights and during the day, if required, till discharge, whichever is earlier.</description>
