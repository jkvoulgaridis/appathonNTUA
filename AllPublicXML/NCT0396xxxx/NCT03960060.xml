      This is a single arm, open label, dose escalation clinical study to evaluate the safety and
      preliminary therapeutic efficacy of CCT301-59 T cells in adult subjects with relapsed and
      refractory stage IV metastatic solid tumors (soft tissue sarcoma, gastric cancer, pancreatic
      cancer, bladder cancer etc.).

      The subjects with ROR2 (receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 2) positive biopsy will
      receive CCT301-59.

      According to the 3+3 rules during the dose escalation stage to receive CCT301-59 treatment.
