  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common tumor (the 8th leading cause of cancer in France)
      and has a poor prognosis. It is the 3rd leading cause of cancer deaths in the world. In the
      early stages (low tumor mass), HCC can be treated for curative purposes by surgical
      resection, percutaneous ablation or liver transplantation. When the tumor mass is larger (&gt; 3
      nodules) but remains confined to the liver, the standard treatment is hepatic intra-arterial
      chemoembolization (TACE). In the event of failure of the latter or if the tumor dissemination
      progresses in the portal venous system or in the form of metastases, the systemic treatments
      are then indicated.

      In 1st line, the reference treatment is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (ITK) Sorafenib.

      Cabozantinib obtained the European and French authorization (AMM) in November 2018 for its
      use in case of failure of Sorafenib in patients with HCC.

      The main objective is the evaluation of the safety of Cabozantinib administered to patients
      with intermediate HCC ineligible for chemoembolization or advanced HCC after failure of
      Sorafenib and possibly another systemic anticancer line.
