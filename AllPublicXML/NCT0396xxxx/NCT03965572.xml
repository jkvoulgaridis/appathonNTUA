  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cabergoline is frequently being requested by many postpartum women with a live newborn to
      suppress lactation. The aim of the study is to investigate which women desire such an
      intervention, and what side effects they are experiencing.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cabergoline is a dopamine receptor agonist. Outside of the United States, it is occasionally
      used to suppress lactation, most commonly after a pregnancy loss or stillbirth. However, the
      investigators noted that the patient population in Israel has been requesting cabergoline for
      administration after healthy births, for immediate lactation suppression.

      Use of cabergoline after delivery comes with many concerns. One primary concern is that this
      medication can increase the risk of venous thrombotic events, particularly during postpartum
      when thrombosis risk is already elevated. Secondly, it may have effects that alter mood,
      which are similarly concerning during a vulnerable period when postpartum depression and
      other mental health disorders are common.

      Finally, of course, is the issue that so many women are requesting lactation suppression
      immediately after birth, and therefore will not accrue the neonatal and maternal benefits of
      lactation.

      The investigators want to understand the characteristics, demographics and other factors that
      lead these women to make this choice, as well as assess their risk of medical and
      psychological adverse effects from cabergoline used in the postpartum period.

      During this study, the investigators will not be prescribing cabergoline or in any way
      affecting its use. The study will be recruiting as subjects women who requested and received
      cabergoline prescriptions independently, as is common practice throughout the country.

      The study will involve three questionnaires with these subjects: one in the hospital, after
      birth; one a week after birth; and one 6 weeks after birth. The questionnaires will involve
      medical history, a validated lactation questionnaire, as well as demographic data. All data
      will be held in a private, password-locked database.
