  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some fibromyalgia patients may use inappropriate emotional regulation strategies to respond
      to pain. Rumination could be one of this inefficient regulation strategies. The investigators
      believe that the use of rumination strategies to respond to the discomfort of daily physical
      activity would maintain and aggravate a negative emotional state after the effort.
      Distraction would be a more effective strategy to cope with pain. From this data, the
      investigators want to explore the causal link between rumination and negative affectivity
      after physical activity in fibromyalgia using an experimental design.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia is a disorder characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain accompanied by
      fatigue, sleep, memory and mood issues. As with any condition of chronic pain, psychological
      mechanisms can help maintain discomfort and pain. These mechanisms may hinder the recovery of
      physical activity. Some patients may use cognitive strategies of emotional regulation that
      are ineffective to cope with pain and discomfort of everyday activities, such as rumination.
      The literature suggests that this process is linked to the physical and psychological
      difficulties of fibromyalgia. However, no study has revealed a causal link between rumination
      and negative affectivity in a context of physical activity in this population. The
      investigators want to test this hypothesis by directly manipulating the style of information
      processing following a relevant activity for these patients: climbing steps. In one group the
      investigators will induce rumination right after climbing the steps. In the other group the
      investigators will induce distraction. Patient with Fibromyalgia will be recruited at the
      Pain Center of CHU-Amiens. Patients will complete different scales before to climb steps and
      after experimental induction. The investigators hypothesize that Patients using a rumination
      strategy after an uncomfortable physical activity will experience a greater subjective
      discomfort than patients using a distraction strategy.

    <description>The PANAS Scale or Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) is a self-report questionnaire. The list is split up into two segments, or mood scales. One scale measures a person's positive emotion and the other scale measures the negative. Each segment has ten terms, which can be rated on a scale of 1 to 5 to indicate the extent to which the respondent agrees that this applies to him.Characteristic of this test is the fact that it can be completed in 10 minutes. High score is associated with stress and anxiety. small score is associated with calm.</description>

    <measure>Change in VAS score before and after induction phase</measure>
    <time_frame>One hour and twenty minutes after inclusion of the patients</time_frame>
    <description>The pain VAS is a unidimensional measure of pain intensity, which has been widely used in diverse adult populations, including those with rheumatic diseases. Visual analogue scales (VAS) are 10-cm lines anchored at the ends by words that define the bounds of various pain dimensions. The patient is asked to place a vertical mark on the scale to indicate the level of intensity of his or her pain, anxiety, depression, etc. 0 would mean &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 would mean &quot;worst possible pain.&quot;</description>

For example, they will be led, in the rumination condition, to reflect on the causes, meanings and consequences of the amount of tension they feel in their muscles.</description>
