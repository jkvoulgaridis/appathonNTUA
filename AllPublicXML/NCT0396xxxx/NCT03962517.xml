  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of training with the Gait Enhancing
      and Motivating System-Hip (GEMS-H) vs. training without the GEMS-H on locomotor function in
      adults. The investigator hypothesizes that long-term GEMS-H use would improve locomotor
      function. Specifically, individuals in the GEMS-H group will show faster gait speed compared
      to those in the control group.

      The GEMS-H is a hip-type assist device developed by Samsung Electronics. The GEMS-H is worn
      around the waist and fastened at the waist and thighs by a set of belts with velcro to assist
      motion at the hip joints. The device weighs 2.1kg, and has 2 brushless direct current motors
      running on a rechargeable lithium ion battery. The normal operation time for the device is 2
      hours. It is controlled through a custom built application on a hand held tablet.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of training with the Gait Enhancing
      and Motivating System-Hip (GEMS-H) vs. training without the GEMS-H on locomotor function in

      function. Specifically, individuals in the GEMS-H group will show faster gait speed compared
      to those in the control group.

      Participants will be scheduled for 18 sessions of training (randomly placed either in GEMS-H
      training group or traditional training group without the GEM-H) plus 5 sessions of testing
      (pre-training, mid-test after the 9 sessions of training, post-training, 1 month follow-up
      and 3 month follow-up after the 18 sessions training completed).

In the description part, health status is measured in terms of five dimensions (5D); mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Mobility dimension asks about the participant's walking ability. Self-care dimension asks about the ability to wash or dress by oneself, and usual activities dimension measures performance in &quot;work, study, housework, family or leisure activities&quot;. In pain/discomfort dimension, it asks how much pain or discomfort they have, and in anxiety/depression dimension, it asks how anxious or depressed they are.</description>
