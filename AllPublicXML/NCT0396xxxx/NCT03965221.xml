  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized three arm control trial to examine the efficacy of two distinct apps (LYNX and
      MyChoices) developed for young men who have sex with men (YMSM) compared to standard of care
      (SOC) information about HIV testing and PrEP (Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      COMPARE is part of the iTech NIH U19, which has an overall goal to develop innovative
      technology-focused interventions addressing the HIV prevention and care continuum for youth.
      In years 1-2 of the iTech grant, the investigators optimized and pilot tested using a similar
      study design and identical study outcomes, two distinct mobile apps called LYNX and
      MyChoices. Each app is designed to increase HIV testing and PrEP uptake among YMSM. In this
      study, the individual apps are being tested in this follow-on research study to evaluate for
      efficacy. YMSM will be randomized to receive either MyChoices, LYNX, or SOC. LYNX uses the
      Information-Motivation-Behavior Skills (IMB) model and is a highly interactive mobile app to
      promote accurate risk perception, increase HIV/STI testing, and linkage to PrEP. MyChoices is
      guided by the Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) model, is adapted from HealthMindr and developed
      using iterative feedback from youth refined to maximize acceptability among YMSM. It includes
      three major functions that are designed to promote self-efficacy, self-regulation,
      goal-setting and environmental influences to impact behavior change. The SOC includes
      information on HIV testing and PrEP with the provision of referrals to local HIV/STI testing
      and PrEP resources.

    <description>LYNX is developed using IMB model and engages youth through entering sexual diary data, earning badges, and calculating a personalized sexual protection (Sex Pro) score, which informs and motivates youth around HIV/STI testing and PrEP uptake. Behavioral skills are built through HIV/STI testing reminders, presenting options for home HIV testing and/or linkage to nearby testing services, and access to an online chat with support for HIV/STI testing and PrEP referral.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>MyChoices is adapted from an app for adult MSM, HealthMindr, developed using SCT. The app aims to increase HIV testing and PrEP uptake by increasing self- regulation, self-reflection, and self-efficacy around HIV testing and PrEP uptake. Brief surveys about sexual risk and protective health behaviors within the app are used to assist users in tracking and self-monitoring their behaviors and creating a personalized HIV testing plan. Quizzes, videos and infographics as well as &quot;Help me Choose,&quot; &quot;Ordering,&quot; and geofencing functions are used to maximize self-efficacy around HIV prevention and uptake of PrEP.</description>

    <ipd_description>Raw data will be available to outside individuals through contacting the multiple principal investigators (MPIs) at two different times. The first will be after all of the baseline data is collected. The investigators will institute a concept plan process where internal study staff first have the availability to write primary papers or give presentations on particular topics. After this, if outside individuals wish to analyze data, the investigators will welcome this collaboration. A similar process will happen for outcome data; however this will not be possible until the publication and release of the outcome paper(s). Information regarding the availability of data for analysis will be listed on the MPIs' web pages. Contact information for the MPIs will be listed in all manuscripts and publications as another means to access data.</ipd_description>
