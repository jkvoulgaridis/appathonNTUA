  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At present, the number of end-stage kidney disease patients is increasing. Kidney transplant
      surgery is one of the treatments that give patients a better survival rate than hemodialysis
      or abdominal dialysis. In Thailand, there were 5,729 kidney transplant patients or 88.9 cases
      per million population in 2012. Among this number, 465 were new surgical patients or 7.2
      cases per million population.

      From the year 2007-2012, the survival rate of the kidney donor from living donor kidney
      transplant (LDKT) was 98.5 percent and 93.3 percent at 1 and 5 years, respectively.

      The most common cause of graft loss was chronic rejection by 33% of all graft loss. However,
      16.1 percent were unknown reasons for graft loss.

      The research question is &quot;In patients with kidney transplantation who suspected graft
      rejection&quot; Is it true that doing plasmapheresis or DFPP is no different.

      The researcher therefore conducted a comparative study. Is plasmapheresis or DFPP effective
      or different side effects?

      Rejection condition can be divided into 2 groups, namely cellular rejection and
      antibody-mediated rejection (AbMR) by acute AbMR treatment according to the guidelines for
      care for kidney transplant patients in Thailand, 2014. The introduction of a single filter
      plasma (plasmapheresis) or 2 filters (DFPP) in combination with IVIG (intravenous
      immunoglobulin), which may or may not be given methylprednisolone. If the patients did not
      response to the treatment, Rituximab or Bortezomib was considered.

      Only one previous study showed that among 29 graft rejected patients treated with
      plasmapheresis, 37.9% had subsequently graft loss and the rest of them had significantly
      decreasing creatinine level at 1 month follow-up. Another group of 10 graft rejected patients
      treated with DFPP, 40% had subsequently graft loss. Six patients had decreasing creatinine
      level at 1 month follow-up.

      Both groups do not have complications or side effects from plasmapheresis or DFPP.

      The researcher therefore conducted a comparative study.

      Is plasmapheresis or DFPP effective or different side effects in treating post-kidney
      transplant patients who suspected of graft rejection?

    <description>Plasmapheresis is the removal, treatment, and return or exchange of blood plasma or components thereof from and to the blood circulation. It is thus an extracorporeal therapy (a medical procedure performed outside the body).[Wikipedia]
DFPP is a selectively removal of the immunoglobulin fraction from the serum and, as a result, to minimize the volume of substitution fluid required. [Tanabe K. Double-filtration plasmapheresis. Transplantation. 2007 Dec 27;84(12 Suppl):S30-2.]</description>
