    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase I, open-label study is to evaluate the absorption, distribution,
      metabolism, excretion, absolute bioavailability, and to characterize the metabolites of
      AG-881 in healthy male participants following administration of a single oral dose of [14C]
      AG-881 and a concomitant intravenous microdose of [13C315N3] AG-881.
