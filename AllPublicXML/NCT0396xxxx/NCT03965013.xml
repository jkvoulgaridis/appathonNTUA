  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is investigating the safety and tolerability of the new medicine NNC0268-0965
      (referred to as insulin 965), its concentrations in the blood and its effect on blood sugar
      for the treatment of diabetes. This first part of the study is conducted in healthy people,
      while there is a second part involving people with type 1 diabetes. The study will test how
      insulin 965 is tolerated by the participants' body, how it is taken up in the participants'
      blood, how long it stays there and how blood sugar is lowered. Participants will either get
      the new insulin 965 or placebo (an injection that does not contain active medicine) - which
      treatment you get is decided by chance. It is the first time that insulin 965 is tested in
      humans. Participants will get one injection of either insulin 965 or placebo under the skin
      of the left thigh. The study will last for about 5 weeks. Participants will have 6 clinic
      visits with the study doctor. People cannot be in the study if the study doctor thinks that
      there are risks for their health.
