  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent work in emergency medicine has shown errors were more likely to occur at the end of
      shifts, as pressure exists to make a number of decisions simultaneously, and after what may
      be an already long series of cognitive challenges. Decision fatigue may also contribute to
      disparities by surfacing subconscious bias. The objective of the R21 pilot phase of Improving
      Quality &amp; Equity of Emergency Care Decisions (IQED) is to identify addressable gaps in
      quality and equity and use performance feedback as an intervention to improve performance on
      chest pain, CT imaging, and antibiotic prescribing. Performance feedback intervention will
      include feedback offline via email or text.

      The objective of the R21 pilot phase of Improving Quality &amp; Equity of Emergency Care
      Decisions (IQED) is to identify addressable gaps in quality and equity and use performance
      feedback as an intervention to improve performance on chest pain, CT imaging, and antibiotic
      prescribing. Performance feedback intervention will include feedback offline via email or
      text.

      Each clinician will be randomized at the provider or clinic level to either the intervention
      or control group. Once clinicians are randomized, the aforementioned intervention will be
      turned on for a 3-6 month time period.

      For providers in the intervention group, the goal is to evaluate the effect of social norms
      on overuse and underuse behavior related to prescriptions or testing. Near real-time social
      norms will be delivered to providers which benchmark their own performance on various metrics
      to that of their peers. The investigators performance feedback reports for each provider
      randomized to receive the audit and feedback intervention will have three key
      characteristics: (1) each target provider will receive his or her individual performance, (2)
      benchmarks will prominently feature the performance of providers who would be considered
      credible peers of the target provider, and (3) benchmarks will reflect only performance that
      is desirable (e.g., showing only the performance of the best-performing credible peers).

      Providers randomized to the control group will follow standard practice.
