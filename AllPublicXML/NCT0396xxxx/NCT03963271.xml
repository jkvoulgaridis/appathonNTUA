  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the electrophysiological properties of the heart conduction
      system in patients with unexplained polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) and/or
      ventricular fibrillation (VF), in patients with specific genetic mutations regarding sudden
      cardiac death or sudden cardiac arrest, in their family members and in a control cohort. The
      electrophysiological properties will be measured with the relatively new technique
      ECG-Imaging (ECGI).

      Also a National Dutch registry for patients with unexplained polymorphic VT and/or VF and
      their family members will be created.

      By combining the data from the registry and the results of ECGI, The investigators hope to
      identity risk markers for patients at higher risk for apparently idiopathic ventricular
      fibrillation, and use these for an adapted flow chart for the 'general'population of patients
      at risk for unexplained polymorphic VT and/or VF. The investigators aim to be able to
      identify patients before the first arrhythmic event, and aim for better treatment strategies
      in the future.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ECGI combines electrical body-surface mapping with 256 electrodes placed on the thorax with a
      CT-scan obtaining the anatomy of the heart and torso, hereby able to reconstruct local
      electrograms, activation and recovery times. In recent research, ECGI provided numerous extra
      insights into normal cardiac electrophysiology, but also electrophysiological disorders and
      disease. The results strongly suggest that ECGI can play a pivotal role in further
      characterizing arrhythmia mechanisms, therefore could do so for polymorphic VT or idiopathic
      VF leading to diagnosis and treatment improvement. Moreover, ECGI seems to have the potential
      to detect arrhythmogenic substrate in individuals before their first event, offering the
      possibility to diagnose and treat patients before sudden cardiac arrest occurs.

      In the VIGILANCE study:

        1. ECGI will be used to noninvasively characterize the epicardial electrophysiological
           substrate and triggers of:

             -  Patients with unexplained polymorphic VT and VF,

             -  Index patients of family cohorts with a specific genetic mutation related to
                arrhythmogenesis, at high risk for unexplained polymorphic VT and/or VF.

             -  Family members,

             -  A control cohort. Results will be evaluated for risk stratification.

        2. All unexplained polymorphic VT and/or VF patients and their family members will be asked
           to participate in a National Dutch registry, and these date will be analysed to
           determine their prognostic value in terms of arrhythmia risk

        A potential subject who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from
        participation in this study:

          -  A known strong reaction against electrode attachment or contrast agent.

          -  Any serious medical condition, which in the opinion of the investigator, may adversely
