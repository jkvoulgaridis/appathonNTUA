  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to compare a new, continuous illumination and short Incubation time
      regimen of aminolevulinic acid photodynamic therapy#ALA- PDT) to a conventional regimen for
      treatment of Moderate or Severe Acne. The hypothesis is that the continuous illumination
      approach will be less or even no painful, but equally efficacious, as the old regimen.
