  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Delirium is associated with prolonged hospitalization, an increased risk of
      dementia, institutionalization and mortality, as well as increased costs. Early detection of
      delirium would allow for early treatment and improved patient outcomes, but delirium is often
      not recognized and treatment is therefore delayed or not applied at all. Additionally,
      current screening tools are subjective, so an alternative, more objective diagnostic tool for
      early delirium detection is desired.

      Objective: To investigate the diagnostic performance of the DeltaScan, a CE-certified device
      to detect delirium using a brief electroencephalography (EEG) recording. A single EEG
      recording will be obtained from patients admitted to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU), and
      elderly patient admitted to the ward.

      Study design: Cross-sectional, multicenter study.

      Study population: Adult patients admitted to an ICU, and elderly at the ward.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: (1) Delirium as assessed by an adjudication committee of
      three delirium experts, based on cognitive information that is collected by one experienced
      investigator in line with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th
      edition, (DSM-5) criteria (2) Delirium Probability as determined by DeltaScan, (3) the
      proportion of successful DeltaScan measurements, and (4) the repeatability of the DeltaScan
      measurements.

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group
      relatedness: The burden to participants of this study is minimal. EEG recording using the
      CE-certified DeltaScan will be made using a strip with EEG electrodes that will be mounted to
      the head using self-adhesive gel. The patient will be visited by an experienced investigator,
      who collects information in accordance with DSM-5 criteria for delirium. This assessment will
      be performed once and takes about 10 minutes. Afterwards, the EEG recording will be performed
      once and takes a maximum of 4 minutes, and all procedures combined will take a maximum of 6-7
      minutes. Both the EEG recording and the assessment are an add-on to routine care and will be
      performed within 30 minutes of each other.

    <measure>The positive and negative predictive value of DeltaScan</measure>
    <time_frame>The predictive value of DeltaScan is assessed through study completion. Each patient is assessed only once, at a random time between admission and discharge to the ICU/nursing ward, for a maximum of 1 day.</time_frame>
    <description>Using positive and negative predictive values, the diagnostic performance of the DeltaScan will be assessed separately in patients admitted to an ICU, and elderly patients admitted to the ward.
A specific focus will be on a high negative predictive value (NPV) because it is important not to miss delirium. A lower positive predictive value (PPV) is acceptable, as the subsequent step in the management of patients with a positive Delta scan will be further diagnostic testing, which is clinically considered to have a lower risk compared to missed delirium.</description>
