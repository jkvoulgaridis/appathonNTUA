  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study examine whether an evidence-based individual user-preferred exercise program will
      increase the physical activity level in boys with Duchenne muscular Dystrophy (DMD).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Regular physical activity is recommended in DMD. However, due to progression of muscle
      weakness and loss of function, a sedentary lifestyle is normal, and disuse of still
      functioning muscles leads to a secondary deterioration. Use of steroids have proven to
      decrease the rate of progression, and also leads to adverse advents like obesity and
      osteoporosis.

      Use of muscle strength training and aerobe exercise in DMD, may optimize muscle function,
      cardio-respiratory fitness and overall physical activity level, in addition to decrease
      possible adverse advents.

      In this study, children with DMD attending Haukeland University Hospital will be invited to
      participate (Nâ‰ˆ14). The participant`s physical activity level is registered during a four
      week baseline period and follow up. At start, 6 months and 12 months, a five day hospital
      stay will be conducted, both for testing and to prescribe an individual user preferred
      physical exercise program. The exercise program will be performed at home between the
      hospital visits. Benefits, safety and feasibility of regular physical exercise will be
      examined during follow-up and end of study. For comparison of the physical activity level and
      motor function, DMD children attending standards of care follow-up at others Norwegian
      regional pediatric rehabilitation clinics will be invited to participate in a control group.

    <description>The PAQ-C is a self-administrated, 7 day recall instrument, developed to assess general levels of physical activity throughout the elementary school year. The PAQ-C provides a summary physical activity score derived from nine items, each scored on a 5-point scale. The nine items and scores are:
&quot;Spare time activities&quot;. Score &quot;no activity&quot; being a 1, &quot;7 times or more&quot; being a 5.
&quot;Physical education&quot;. 3. &quot;Recess&quot;.4. &quot;Lunch&quot;. 5 &quot;Right after school&quot;. 6 &quot;Evening&quot;. 7 &quot;Weekend&quot;. 8. &quot;Describe you best&quot;. Each of these 7 item start from lowest activity response (score 1) to the highest activity response (score 5).
9. How often did you do physical activities for each weekday? None=score 1 Little bit = score 2, Medium = score 3, Often = score 4, Very often = Score 5. Item 9 mean score is reported. Total score 45 represents the participant's general level of physical activity. The participants perform the PAQ-C at baseline and at every hospital visit (start, 6 and 12 months).</description>

In addition the participants is asked to give a summary of the week regarding to name the most enjoyable activity this week and the reason why, and to describe if there occurred something unusual that increased or decreased their physical activity level more than regular.</description>

    <description>The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory TM (PedsQL TM) is a questionnaire measuring measures quality of life in children, adolescents and young adults. The questionnaire have four subscales with a total of 23 items. Each items with score 0 to 4. The subscales are Physical functioning (eight items), Emotional functioning (five items), Social functioning (five items) and School functioning (five items). A score can be calculated for each subscale. Total score 100 points indicate optimal quality of life. A Psychosocial score can also be calculated (based on the subscales Emotional, Social and School functioning). Participants will report from PedQoL at start and end of study.</description>

        Boys with DMD from Hordaland county, attending the pediatric rehabilitation centre at
        Haukeland university hospital, will be recruited for intervention.

        For comparison, boys with DMD, attending other Norwegian pediatric rehabilitation centres
        will be invited as control group. Assessment of their physical activity level and
        self-reported physical activity level will be examined at start and after 12 months. In
        addition, functional abilities by use of North Star ambulatory assessment or EK2 scale will
        be assessed.
