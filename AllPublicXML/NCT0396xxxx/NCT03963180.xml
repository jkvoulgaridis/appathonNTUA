  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has revolutionized women's healthcare. Laparoscopy is an
      excellent route of MIS. Today, laparoscopic surgery is one of the major procedure in the
      management of a gynecologic disease. It has revealed benefits of decreased morbidity, earlier
      discharged, and quicker return to normal daily activities, and shorter hospital when compared
      to abdominal approach.

      Postoperative ileus (POI) defined as an uncomplicated ileus occurring following surgery,
      resolving spontaneously within 2 to 3 days. Clinically, it is characterized by abdominal
      distension, a lack of bowel sounds, nausea, vomiting, stomach cramps, and lack of flatus. It
      leads to morbidity and delays in patient discharge from the hospital, leading to an increased
      economic burden on the healthcare system. That's why many researchers have focused on the
      prevent of postoperative ileus; many studies have investigated preventive approaches such as
      early mobilization of the patient, adequate pain control, epidural anaesthesia, hot pack
      therapy, motility agents such as metoclopramide, and alvimopan. Although POI incidence has
      lower after the laparoscopic surgery it remains a major problem during the postoperative
      period.

      Recent studies demonstrated that coffee consumption is associated with improved
      gastrointestinal function without worsening of postoperative morbidity for both open and
      laparoscopic surgery. However, until now, no studies investigating the effect of
      postoperative coffee consumption at laparoscopic gynecologic surgery. Therefore, the
      investigators performed a randomized controlled trial to assess whether coffee consumption
      accelerates the recovery of bowel function after laparoscopic gynecologic surgery.
