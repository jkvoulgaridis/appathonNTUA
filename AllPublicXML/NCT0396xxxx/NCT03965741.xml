  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with cancer are at a significantly increased risk of experiencing a venous
      thromboembolism (VTE). VTE is defined by a blood clot in the leg or lower extremity (deep
      vein thrombosis) or a blood clot in the lung (pulmonary embolism) and is a leading cause of
      condition of being diseased and death among cancer patients. The goal of the study is to
      gather information how often venous thromboembolism (VTE) occurs in prostate cancer patients
      in Sweden and how this condition is treated with blood thinners.
