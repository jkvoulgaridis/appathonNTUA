  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malignant anterior mediastinal tumors essentially include lymphomas and thymomas. The
      location of mediastinum is anatomically close to several critical organs such as heart, lung,
      and breasts, which might be affected meaningfully when the mediastinal region is irradiated.
      There have been quite a few studies investigating long-term toxicities concerning the above
      critical organs and risks of secondary malignancies related to treatment regimens combining
      chemotherapy and mediastinal radiotherapy. With the advancement of modern radiotherapy,
      highly conformal and intensity modulated radiotherapy have become a radiotherapeutic standard
      in recent years. However, most previous studies analyzed patients treated in the era of 2D
      techniques rather than conformal 3D plans. Almost inevitably, a large volume of the heart and
      lung was irradiated via the 2D technique with which substantial dose levels might be given to
      these organs unavoidably. Certainly long-term radiotherapy related toxicities are
      significantly associated with the dose and volume irradiating the normal organs at risk.
      Relying on the techniques of modern conformal radiotherapy and the contemporary strategy of
      multimodality therapy, the dose and volume irradiating the heart and lung were considerably
      reduced. Therefore, objective tools including heart echocardiography and lung function test
      will be utilized in this prospective study to evaluate and monitor mainly the patients
      diagnosed as malignant lymphoma who are recommended to receive mediastinal radiotherapy in
      the era of modern treatment strategy and techniques.

      The participants potentially included in the current study are mainly lymphoma patients with
      mediastinal malignant lymphoma or patients whose radiation therapy field essentially
      encompasses anterior mediastinum. Patients are prospectively enrolled in this study after
      physicians' clinical judgement. After signing the consent form, the recruited patient will
      receive comprehensive pre-radiotherapy evaluations, including cardiac echocardiography,
      laboratory tests (BNP, and NT-pro BNP), and lung function tests. Participants who are
      particularly female patients under the age of 45 will receive pre-radiotherapy breast
      echocardiography. Radiotherapy treatment planning of both photon and proton respectively will
      be simulated on EclipseÂ® treatment planning system. Subsequently participants will receive
      mediastinal RT within one month after being enrolled in the study. Eligible patients should
      receive standard multidisciplinary treatment as the tumor board at our institute has
      suggested. Modern radiotherapy techniques comprise all available modalities in our hospital,
      including photon or proton beams, intensity-modulated radiotherapy, volumetric modulated arc
      therapy, image-guidance, and breathing control system. The prescription of treatment field
      designing and dose scheme will comply with our institutional protocols and updated cancer
      treatment guidelines. Participants will receive longitudinal follow-up examinations at 3, 6,
      9, 12, 18, 24, 36 months after the start of RT course. Standardized examinations include the
      above mentioned cardiac echocardiography and relevant tests.

      It is anticipated that long-term mediastinal RT-related late effects are prospectively and
      longitudinally surveyed through consistent heart examinations and lung function tests.
      Long-term effects are expected to be lower with using maturely and widely adopted modern RT
      techniques. Therapeutic and survival outcomes are expected to be satisfactory, achieving the
      international level in this prospective observational study focusing on mainly lymphoma
      patients with mediastinal involvement who are suggested and scheduled to receive mediastinal
      RT as part of the combined modality treatment.

      This study aims to standardize the application of clinical examinations including cardiac
      echocardiography, lung function tests, and relevant laboratory tests as part of objective
      tools for monitoring patients' cardiac and pulmonary functions after receiving mediastinal
      RT. Therefore, it is expected that the risk factors of predisposing patients to develop
      cardiac toxicities after chemoradiation particularly including mediastinal RT will be
      explored and identified. In addition objectivity of BNP (or NT-pro BNP) will also be verified
      in combination with the objective measurement and findings obtained from cardiac
      echocardiography. It is anticipated that our study would be an important and leading one that
      integrates radiation oncology, hematology, cardiology, and pulmonology into prospective and
      longitudinal cardiopulmonary surveillance carried out for mainly malignant lymphoma patients
      undergoing mediastinal RT in this era of modern chemoradiation.
