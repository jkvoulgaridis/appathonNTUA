      The primary objectives are to determine the correlation between rate of temperature decline
      and nadir cryoballoon temperatures rate of temperature decline and nadir esophageal
      temperatures during pulmonary vein isolation. To accurately measure the distance between the
      esophagus and the ostium of each pulmonary vein intra-operatively. To attempt to create
      recommendations for esophageal temperature-guided ablation in order to increase the safety
      profile of cryoballoon pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) by providing one center's experience.
      By trending cryoballoon ablation temperatures and subsequent esophageal temperatures, data
      trends may emerge and be predictive for esophageal ulceration formation. These trends may
      include:

        -  Distance between esophagus and pulmonary vein in patients who developed post-ablation
           esophageal ulcerations

        -  Intra-procedure esophageal temperatures in patients who developed post-ablation
           esophageal ulcerations

        -  Intra-procedure cryoballoon temperatures in patients who developed post-ablation
           esophageal ulcerations As well as to associate the development of symptoms (including
           dysphagia, chest pain, fever, &quot;heartburn,&quot; or odynophagia) with the presence of
           ulcerations.

      When treating atrial fibrillation and targeting various areas in the left atrium,
      electrophysiologists have the choice to perform ablation with RF energy or cryoenergy.
      Esophageal ulceration and in more rare cases, esophageal fistulae, are known complications of
      this ablation procedure. Though rare (0.1-0.25% fistula rate and 15-20% esophageal ulceration
      rate according to the most recent Heart Rhythm Society EHRA ECA consensus statement)1, the
      investigators would very much like to understand how to completely prevent these occurrences.
      Cryoenergy has more recently been introduced as an energy source used in the PVI procedure;
      therefore, for this energy source, rates of esophageal ulceration are not yet well-defined.
      Nine esophageal fistulae have occurred in the first approximately 130,000 cryoballoon
      procedures.
