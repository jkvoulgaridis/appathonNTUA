  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a frequent complication that occurs in 15 to 25% of patients
      after vascular surgery, and up to 40% of patients after cardiac surgery. AKI compromises
      seriously short and long-term prognosis of critically ill patients. Several AKI risk factors
      have been identified including a chronic pathology of the patient such as kidney failure or
      diabetes, acute kidney injury related to hemodynamic disorders during surgery, including
      cardiopulmonary bypass, or sepsis, and the use of nephrotoxic agents such as some
      antibiotics, colloids or iodine contrast agents. Avoiding nephrotoxic agents is therefore
      strongly recommended in ICU patients, to reduce the incidence of AKI, or to reduce its
      severity.

      The aim of this cohort study was to assess whether the use of daptomycin, was associated to a
      lower incidence of AKI than vancomycin in cardiovascular ICU patients, with similar efficacy.

      This is a retrospective observational study with a propensity score adjustment to reduce the
      bias of selection for a comparative analysis between two antibacterial treatments used in
      routine care.

      Since treatments were not randomized, the investigators used the propensity score method for
      primary endpoint analysis. For this, the investigators included the covariates potentially
      related to treatment and outcome in a multivariate logistic model explaining the choice of
      treatment. This propensity score was used in the second model as an adjustment covariate
      included in the multivariate analysis to determine factors independently associated with the
      primary endpoint (AKI within 7 days).

      The main hypothesis is the first line antibiotic treatment with daptomycin leads to less
      nephrotoxicity than vancomycin in a population known at high risk for AKI and with at least a
      similar efficacy on clinical success rate.
