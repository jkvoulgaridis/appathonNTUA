  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to compare the protein composition of simultaneously
      collected undiluted pulmonary edema fluid and AnaConDa-S ® fluid from patients with ARDS.

      In a previous pilot randomized controlled trial, in patients with moderate-severe acute
      respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the use of inhaled sevoflurane improved oxygenation and
      decreased levels of a marker of lung epithelial injury (soluble receptor for advanced
      glycation end-products, sRAGE) and of some inflammatory markers (interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6,
      IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α), compared to intravenous midazolam. These results
      reinforce those from previously published preclinical studies as they suggest a protective
      effect of sevoflurane from alveolar/systemic inflammation and from reduced epithelial injury
      and/or improved alveolar fluid clearance, as assessed by plasma soluble receptor for advanced
      glycation end-products (sRAGE). The results from available studies support the safe use of
      sevoflurane inhalation through dedicated device is well tolerated, with no major adverse
      effect, e.g. on renal function or respiratory mechanics, in critically ill patients admitted
      to the intensive care unit (ICU), including those with ARDS.

      Because the investigators group frequently uses sevoflurane in patients with ARDS and are
      interested in developing further research on the effects of inhaled sedation in ARDS, the
      current study has been designed to verify whether the same concept could be applied to the
      filter the investigators use to vaporize sevoflurane in their ICUs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS (within 24 hours of onset) and already receiving
      inhaled sevoflurane for sedation as a current practice in participating centers will be
      enrolled in this observational study.

      After an exposure duration of at least 12 hours, a sample of directly-aspirated, undiluted
      pulmonary edema fluid will be collected concurrently with AnaConDa-S®filter collection. This
      sample will be the only specific intervention of this study.

      Patient data prospectively collected from the medical record will include demographics, ARDS
      risk factor, chest x-ray, ventilator settings at the time of AnaConDa-S ® filter collection,
      hospital and ICU length of stay and hospital mortality. Murray's lung injury score and the
      Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score will be calculated from data
      already available in the medical record.

      AnaConDa-S ® filters will transported to the laboratory on ice and centrifuged at 2,000 x g
      for 10 minutes to collect condensed fluid that will be subsequently aliquoted and stored at
      -80°C for further analysis. Undiluted pulmonary edema fluid will be centrifuged at 2,000 x g
      for 10 minutes. Supernatants will be aliquoted and stored at - 80°C. Levels of IL-1β, IL-6,
      IL-8, TNF-α, soluble TNF-receptor 1, angiopoietin-2, and sRAGE will be measured in duplicate
      in both types of fluid with Multiplex.

    <measure>Comparaison between levels of protein markers, measured IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, soluble TNF-receptor 1, angiopoietin-2, and sRAGE, measured in undiluted pulmonary edema fluid and in AnaConDa-S ® fluid</measure>
    <time_frame>Between 12 hours and 24 hours after the begining of Sevoflurane sedation</time_frame>
    <description>After an exposure duration of at least 12 hours, and when clinically available, a sample of directly-aspirated, undiluted pulmonary edema fluid will be collected (in general, only few ml are collected) concurrently with AnaConDa-S® filter collection. The concordance between levels of markers measured from undiluted alveolar fluid and those measured from AnaConDa-S® fluid will be explored using Lin's concordance coefficient, correlation coefficient (Pearson or Spearman according to the statistical distribution) and Bland-Altman plot. Confidence intervals at 95% will be presented. To complete these analyses, the satisfactory agreement will be confirmed by Passing and Bablok regression in order to highlight non-systematic and non-proportional differences between the two methods (undiluted pulmonary edema fluid and AnaConDa-S® fluid).</description>
