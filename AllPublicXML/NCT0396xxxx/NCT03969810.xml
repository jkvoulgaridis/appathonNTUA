  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many patients in intensive care units (ICUs) rely on family members or surrogates to make
      medical decisions on their behalf. One of the recommended ways to improve a surrogate's
      experience is to invite him or her to participate in daily, multidisciplinary ICU rounds. In
      practice, this is often a challenging way for clinicians to engage with the patient's
      surrogates.

      Surrogates of non-decisional ICU patients will be randomized to receive a written rounding
      summary every day or every other day that the patient is in the ICU. The summary will be
      organized as follows for each of the most important ICU problems: 1) Description of the
      problem, 2) Ways the ICU team is addressing the problem i.e. consultations, diagnostic tests,
      and treatments. 3) An assessment of whether the problem is improving or worsening.

      The investigators hypothesize that surrogates who receive written rounding summaries will be
      more satisfied with ICU care than surrogates who receive usual care. Satisfaction will be
      measured by the Critical Care Family Needs Inventory (CCFNI) questionnaire.

For patients assigned to the intervention group, the investigators will forward the previous day's summary to the ICU nurse at the beginning of each day shift. After participating in morning rounds, ICU nurses will be asked to modify the summary based on the plan for the day. Nurses will be asked to use the written summary to guide communication with surrogates that day.</description>

        Patients in the adult Medical and Cardiac ICUs at Rush University Medical Center will be
        prospectively screened.

        Inclusion criteria (Patient characteristics required for surrogate inclusion) At least one
        of the following

          -  The patient has required invasive or non-invasive mechanical ventilation for at least
             three consecutive days.

          -  The patient has an expected in-hospital mortality rate of at least 25% according to
             the primary ICU physician.

        Exclusion criteria (Patient characteristics that will exclude surrogates from study
        enrollment):

          -  The patient possesses decisional capacity at the time of enrollment.

          -  The patient has required invasive or non-invasive mechanical ventilation for more than
             the previous 14 days

          -  The patient is expected to die or transition to comfort care within the next 48 hours
             based on ICU physician estimate.

          -  The patient is expected to be liberated from mechanical ventilation (if applicable) or
             discharged from the ICU within the next 24 hours.

          -  There is no identifiable surrogate.

          -  The patient is member of a vulnerable population i.e. pregnant, prisoner.

          -  The ICU physician refuses permission to approach surrogates for consent

        The investigators will hand out fliers that describe the study to surrogates of patients
        who are expected to meet the above criteria. Surrogates can ask the nurse to contact the
        lead investigator if they are interested in learning more about the study. If no surrogate
        is present prior to the patient meeting the inclusion criteria, the investigators will
        attempt to contact the surrogate by phone to provide information on the study.

        One surrogate will be approached for informed consent and enrolled based on the following
        criteria.

        Inclusion criteria for surrogate decision maker:

          -  Age ≥ 18 years old

          -  Self-identified as participating directly in health care decision making for the
             incapable patient

        Exclusion criteria for surrogate decision makers:

          -  The surrogate does not agree to participate in study procedures (surveys, interviews)

          -  The surrogate needs translation assistance because of poor English fluency

          -  The surrogate has history of a clinically important neurological disorder (e.g.,
             dementia)
