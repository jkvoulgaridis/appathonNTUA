  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is one of the leading health problems in the community and it is the most common
      life-threatening neurological disease impairing the quality of life. Early rehabilitation of
      stroke is very important. The purpose of our study was to evaluate, through clinical
      examination, whether there was any difference between patients who underwent early
      rehabilitation and those who underwent late rehabilitation in terms of improvements in motor
      and functional impairment after rehabilitation, and also to evaluate this difference
      objectively by analyzing white-matter pathways (corticospinal tracts) using DTI.

      Methods: Twenty-eight (28) adults (12 women, 16 men, average age 58 years) with first-time
      stroke who met the study criteria were divided into two groups depending on the duration of
      their stroke at the time of their presentation to our facility. Group 1 consisted of patients
      who underwent rehabilitation program within the first 1-4 weeks after stroke, whereas Group 2
      consisted of patients who underwent rehabilitation program within 5-8 weeks after stroke.
      Both groups were evaluated using the BRS, FMA scale, FAC and BI scales. For cranial imaging,
      DTI was obtained 1 day before and 1 day after treatment. FA and ADC values of corticospinal
      tracts were performed using DTI.

      Intervention: Patients were enrolled in a rehabilitation program, which was designed for a
      total of 4 weeks, with daily sessions lasting a total of 1 h on 5 days of a week.

    <description>Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is based on determining tissue structure by measuring diffusion rate and direction of movement of water molecules in vivo. DTI is the only in vivo method of mapping white-matter pathways in the human brain. Tractography is the technique for mapping white-matter structure with DTI data</description>

    <description>Twenty-eight stroke patients aged 36-72 years admitted to the our Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Outpatient Clinics were included in this prospective study. After the approval of the ethics committee, written informed consent was obtained from the patients after they were informed about the content and purpose of the study, the schedule of rehabilitation to be administered, and the features of cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to be performed. Patients with confirmed diagnosis of stroke by computed tomography and/or MRI techniques were randomized into two groups according to the onset of post-stroke rehabilitation. The patients were randomized according to the duration of their admission to our clinic for rehabilitation. Group 1 consisted of patients admitted to our clinic within 1-4 weeks after stroke; Group 2 consisted of patients admitted within 5-8 weeks after stroke.
Late initiation of rehabilitation in Group 2 patients is not a condition related to our clinic.</description>
