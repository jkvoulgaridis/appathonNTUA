  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study explores the brain basis of imaginal exposure, a widely used psychological
      treatment technique. Specifically, this study uses functional magnetic resonance imaging to
      examine brain areas activated during imaginal exposure, in individuals fearful of spiders.
      Physiological responses and subjective fear experienced during imaginal exposure are also
      assessed.

      The primary aim of this study is to explore differences in neural activity during exposure to
      phobic, compared to neutral, mental imagery. The study will focus primarily on exploratory
      whole brain analyses, but will also include regions of interest analyses on brain areas
      previously associated with imaginal exposure. The experimental procedure consists of repeated
      exposure to mental imagery, i.e. imagery of short durations, including either highly
      emotion-provoking or neutral content, prompted by verbal instructions. A secondary aim is to
      explore the effects of repeated exposure to mental imagery, used during the experimental
      procedure, on subjective fear and physiological responses.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Results will elucidate if neural activity to phobic imagery differs from activity associated
      with the production of mental imagery per se. Findings will also increase our general
      understanding of the neural basis of imaginal exposure treatments.
