      This study will be performed with 25 patients who applied to Erciyes University Faculty of
      Dentistry for treatment and who need 2 first premolar extraction and maximum anchorage for
      treatment. In order to increase anchorage in the patient who will start the distalization of
      canine, mini screw (1.5 mm diameter, 7 mm length) will be applied to the right and left
      maxillary dentition of the patient under local anesthesia. The hycon device, which has a
      screw-shaped design for the application of force to both the right and left sides of the
      maxillary dentition of the patients, will be adapted to the bands in the 1st molar teeth.
      Patients will be randomly divided into 4 groups. Vibration will be applied to the two groups
      with the Acceledent device.

      Group 1 = The hycon device in this group will be used in accordance with the manufacturer's
      instructions.

      Group 2 = The activation period of the hycon device in this group will be modified.

      Group 3 = The hycon device in this group will be used in accordance with the manufacturer's
      instructions. In addition, patients in this group twice a day for 10 minutes with acceledent
      device vibration will be applied.

      Group 4 = The activation period of the hycon device in this group will be modified. In
      addition, patients in this group twice a day for 10 minutes with acceledent device vibration
      will be applied.

      The period of canine distalization of orthodontic treatment is one of the important stages
      affecting the duration of treatment. Shortening this time in the clinic will shorten the
      duration of treatment.

      If this application changes the tooth movement speed in any direction, it will support the
      new research.

      This study is planned as a splint mouth, randomized, non-controlled clinical trial.This study
      will be performed with 25 patients who applied to Erciyes University Faculty of Dentistry for
      treatment and who need 2 first premolar extraction and maximum anchorage for
      treatment.Patients will be selected from 12 to 18 years of age.In order to increase anchorage
      in the patient who will start the distalization of canine, mini screw (PSM Medical Solutions,
      Quattro Standard Screw 1,5x7mm, Tuttlingen,Germany) will be applied to the right and left
      maxillary dentition of the patient under local anesthesia.The hycon device (Adenta,Germany),
      which has a screw-shaped design for the application of force to both the right and left sides
      of the maxillary dentition of the patients, will be adapted to the bands in the 1st molar
      teeth.The approval of the study was taken from Erciyes University Clinical Research Ethics
      Committee in Kayseri (2018/337).Informed consent will be obtained from all patients included
      in the study.Consent will be taken from parents of those under the age of 18. At the
      beginning of the treatment and at the end of the treatment, all patients who participated in
      the study received standard treatment records including photographs, dental models and
      radiography.

      Inclusion criteria:

        -  No systemic disease

        -  Being healthy as periodontal.

        -  No smoking.

        -  No previous orthodontic treatment.

        -  Lack of congenital tooth deficiency

        -  Permanent dentition

        -  Indication of extraction for 1.premolar in the maxilla

        -  There is no restoration of upper canine teeth.

        -  Indication of the use of mini screw for maximum anchoring in the maxilla

      All models will be scanned by 3D laser model scanning device (3 Shape, R 700 Desktop Scanner,
      Szczecin, Poland) and digitalized (3Shape Ortho Analyzer â„¢ 12). The gradient of the teeth and
      the amount of space closure will be examined by using panoramic radiographs. The amount of
      root resorption in canine teeth will be measured by using periapical radiography. As a result
      of the data obtained, the effects of the hycon device(Adenta, Germany) and vibration
      device(Acceledent Aura, OrthoAccel Technologies, Inc. USA) on the tooth movement speed will
      be compared.
