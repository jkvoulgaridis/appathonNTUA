  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women represent the fastest growing population within the VHA. Many are of reproductive age
      and experience mental health concerns. Women with mental illness are at greater risk for
      unplanned pregnancy and poor pregnancy outcomes due to factors related to mental health and
      mental health treatment. Similarly, mental health concerns (e.g., impact of pregnancy on
      mental illness, psychiatric medications and pregnancy) can affect reproductive life goals and
      plans. Reproductive life planning (RLP) interventions that include considerations and
      concerns women Veterans with mental illness face are needed. The investigators adapted
      existing RLP materials to create an interactive, individualized, client-centered RLP
      intervention designed to help women Veterans with mental illness develop a mental
      health-informed reproductive life plan and reproductive life goals (RLP-MH). The current
      study aims to determine if the RLP-MH intervention is feasible and acceptable to women
      Veterans and if it increases engagement in behaviors to address RLP goals.

    <measure>Reproductive Life Planning Behavioral Intentions</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 2-Month Post-Intervention (~2 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The Reproductive Life Planning Behavioral Intentions scale was used to measure self-reported intentions to engage in behavior to address one's reproductive life goals. A total score is calculated by taking a sum of responses to the items (range = 5 to 15) with higher scores indicating greater intentions to engage in behaviors to address one's reproductive life goals.</description>

    <measure>Decisional Self-Efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 2-Month Post-Intervention (~2 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The Decisional Self-Efficacy scale was used to measures expectations or beliefs about one's ability to engage in behaviors that help in making reproductive life decisions. A total score is calculated by taking the sum of response to the items (range = 0 to 44) with higher scores indicating greater decisional self-efficacy.</description>

    <measure>Attitudes Towards Reproductive Life Planning</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 2-Month Post-Intervention (~2 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The Attitudes Towards Reproductive Life Planning developed for this study will be used to measure attitudes towards reproductive life planning and goal setting across several domains key to effective reproductive life planning. A total score is calculated by taking the sum of responses to the items (range = 8 to 56) with higher scores indicating more positive/favorable attitudes towards reproductive life planning.</description>

    <description>Reproductive Life Planning-Mental Health (RLP-MH) intervention is comprised of two parts: 1) an in-person interactive session in which the participant works with an RLP-MH facilitator to explore pregnancy intentions and RLP goals, consider important factors that impact those goals (e.g. mental health and physical health conditions, psychosocial and lifestyle factors, values, preferences), and identify personal action steps to address RLP goals and 2) a 15-20 minute follow-up session in person or by phone one month later to discuss progress in addressing RLP goals.</description>
