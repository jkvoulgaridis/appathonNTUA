    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well MLN4924 (pevonedistat), carboplatin, and paclitaxel work
      in treating patients with stage IIIB or IV non-small cell lung cancer. Pevonedistat may stop
      the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used
      in chemotherapy, such as carboplatin and paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the
      growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by
      stopping them from spreading. Giving pevonedistat together with carboplatin and paclitaxel
      may work better in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer when compared with other
      standard chemotherapy drugs.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the overall response rate (ORR) of patients with advanced non-small cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC) treated with pevonedistat (MLN4924 [pevonedistat]) in combination with
      carboplatin and paclitaxel.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the progression-free survival (PFS) of patients with advanced NSCLC treated
      with MLN4924 (pevonedistat) in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel.

      II. To estimate the overall survival (OS) of patients with advanced NSCLC treated with
      MLN4924 (pevonedistat) in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel.

      III. To evaluate the safety profile of MLN4924 (pevonedistat) in combination with carboplatin
      and paclitaxel.

      CORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate expression of nuclear factor-erythroid 2 p45-related factor 2 (NRF2) target
      genes NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase1 (NQO1) and the cysteine/glutamate antiporter solute
      carrier family 7 member 11 (SCL7A11).

      II. To determine expression of pharmacodynamic markers induced by neural precursor cell
      expressed developmentally downregulated protein 8 (NEDD-8) activating enzyme (NAE)
      inhibition: cyclic AMP-dependent transcription factor (ATF3), beta 2 microglobulin (B2M),
      glutamate-cysteine ligase regulatory subunit (GCLM), glutathione-disulfide reductase (GSR),
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-3-methyladenine (MAG1), ribosomal protein lateral stalk subunit
      P0 (RPLPO), sulfiredoxin-1 (SRXN1), thioredoxin reductase 1 (TXNRD1), and
      ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (UBC).

      III. To perform qualitative assessment of tumor NAE1 and ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 M
      (UBC12) protein expression at baseline.

      IV. To assess circulating tumor cells (CTCs) for DNA damage repair pathway alterations (i.e.,
      gamma H2AX induction, RAD51).

      V. To evaluate pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of MLN4924 (pevonedistat) when given in
      combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 3 hours on day 1, carboplatin IV over
      30-60 minutes on day 1, and pevonedistat IV over 1 hour on days 1, 3, and 5. Treatment
      repeats every 21 days for at least 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, all patients without disease progression are followed up
      at 30 days, every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months until 5 years from end of study
      treatment.

             become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating
             in this study or within 4 months of completion, she should inform her treating
             physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use
             adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation,
             and 4 months after completion of MLN4924 (pevonedistat) administration.

          -  Agree to practice 1 highly effective method and 1 additional effective (barrier)
             method of contraception, at the same time, from the time of signing the informed
             consent through 4 months after the last dose of study drug (female and male condoms
             should not be used together), or

          -  Agree to practice true abstinence, when this is in line with the preferred and usual
             lifestyle of the subject. (Periodic abstinence [e.g., calendar, ovulation,
             symptothermal, postovulation methods] withdrawal, spermicides only, and lactational
             amenorrhea are not acceptable methods of contraception.) Male patients, even if
             surgically sterilized (i.e., status postvasectomy), who

          -  Agree to practice effective barrier contraception during the entire study treatment
             period and through 4 months after the last dose of study drug (female and male condoms
             should not be used together), OR

          -  Agree to practice true abstinence, when this is in line with the preferred and usual
             lifestyle of the subject. (Periodic abstinence [e.g., calendar, ovulation,
             symptothermal, postovulation methods for the female partner] withdrawal, spermicides
             only, and lactational amenorrhea are not acceptable methods of contraception.)

               -  Patients with a history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection must have been
                  treated and cured. For patients with HCV infection who are currently on
                  treatment, they are eligible if they have an undetectable HCV viral load.

               -  Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment
                  does not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment
                  of the investigational regimen are eligible for this trial.

               -  Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &gt;= 50% as assessed by echocardiogram or
                  radionuclide angiography.

               -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent
                  document. Participants with impaired decision-making capacity (IDMC) who have a
                  legally authorized representative (LAR) or caregiver and/or family member
                  available will also be considered eligible.

               -  Patients with NSCLC harboring genomic aberrations (e.g. sensitizing EGFR, ALK,
                  ROS1, NTRK, BRAF V600E mutation positive) must have received prior treatment with
                  Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved targeted therapy for patients for
                  which FDA approved targeted therapies is available.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have not recovered from adverse events (AEs) due to prior anti-cancer
             therapy (i.e., have residual toxicities &gt; grade 1) with the exception of alopecia and
             neuropathy.

          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to MLN4924 (pevonedistat), carboplatin, or paclitaxel.

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 2 weeks (6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study.

          -  Patients receiving any treatment with clinically significant metabolic enzyme inducers
             within 14 days before the first dose of the study drug. Clinically significant
             metabolic enzyme inducers are not permitted during the study.

          -  Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness.

          -  Patients with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because MLN4924 (pevonedistat),
             carboplatin, and paclitaxel have the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient
             effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing
             infants secondary to treatment of the mother with MLN4924 (pevonedistat),
             breastfeeding must be discontinued if the mother is treated with MLN4924
             (pevonedistat). These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this
             study.

          -  Female patients who intend to donate eggs (ova) during the course of this study or 4
             months after receiving their last dose of study drug(s).

                  ischemic heart disease such as acute coronary syndrome [ACS], myocardial
                  infarction, and/or revascularization greater than 6 months before screening and
                  who are without cardiac symptoms may enroll);

               -  Symptomatic cardiomyopathy;

               -  Clinically significant arrhythmia:

                    -  Permanent atrial fibrillation, defined as continuous atrial fibrillation for
                       &gt;= 6 months,

                    -  Persistent atrial fibrillation, defined as sustained atrial fibrillation
                       lasting &gt; 7 days and/or requiring cardioversion in the 4 weeks before

                    -  Patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation or grade &lt; 3 atrial
                       fibrillation for period of at least 6 months are permitted to enroll
                       provided that their rate is controlled on a stable regimen.

               -  Clinically symptomatic pulmonary hypertension requiring pharmacologic therapy.

          -  Peripheral neuropathy that is grade &gt;= 3, or grade 2 with pain on clinical examination
             during the screening period.

          -  Uncontrolled high blood pressure (i.e., systolic blood pressure &gt; 180 mmHg, diastolic
