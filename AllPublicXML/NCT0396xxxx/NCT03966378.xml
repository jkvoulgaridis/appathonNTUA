      Assess the effectiveness of applying grape seed extract (GSE) gel versus casein
      phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate (MI) paste on remineralization of white spot
      lesion (WSLs) in post orthodontic patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The development of WSLs is a challenging problem in the track of orthodontic treatment.
      Especially in patients wearing fixed orthodontic appliances, plaque accumulation increases
      around brackets and bands and the pH on dental surfaces becomes acidic.

      These early lesions are willing to remineralization, arrest, reharden and revert to healthy
      enamel condition through a remineralization process involving the diffusion of minerals into
      the defective tooth structure. For this purpose various remineralizing agents such as casein
      phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP-ACP) and grape seed extract (GSE) have been
      used.

      This research is conducted for early intervention and treatment of the white spot lesions by
      non-invasive method.
