    <textblock>
      Mount Vernon Cancer Centre at East and North Hertfordshire NHS Trust offers patients with
      certain cancers a treatment called adaptive radiotherapy. The aim of adaptive radiotherapy is
      to respond to physical changes that occur during treatment to ensure the radiation continues
      to be directed at the cancer and to minimise the amount of healthy tissue treated. For
      example, if tumour shrinkage or weight loss occurs during head and neck radiotherapy the
      patient may have a repeat CT scan and a new radiotherapy treatment plan after a few weeks of
      treatment. For patients with cancer of the bladder or cervix changes in bladder and uterus
      size and position can be predicted allowing the prospective creation of three radiotherapy
      treatment plans, each day the best fitting plan, i.e. the one that closely covers the tumour
      whilst giving minimal dose to normal tissues, is selected and used for treatment, this is
      known as plan-of-the-day adaptive radiotherapy.

      Small changes in shape and position of the prostate occur but are generally the result of
      rectal changes which cannot be predicted, consequently adaptive radiotherapy based on
      physical change is not possible for prostate cancer treatments. However, recent literature
      suggests that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect changes within the prostate in
      response to radiotherapy, some studies have seen changes as early as the second week of
      radiotherapy treatment. A feasibility study to investigate if these changes can support
      radiotherapy treatment plan adaption for prostate cancer treatments is proposed, whether the
      plan can be adapted to give a higher treatment dose to any areas of the prostate that show
      poor response to radiotherapy without increasing bowel and bladder dose is of particular
      interest. The treatment for patients who participate in the study would not be changed but
      the results may help to personalise and improve the treatment of future patients.
