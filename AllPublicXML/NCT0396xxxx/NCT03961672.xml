    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well duvelisib on an intermittent (irregular) dosing schedule
      works in treating patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma.
      Duvelisib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell
      growth. Giving duvelisib on an intermittent schedule may result in similar effectiveness with
      less amount of severe side effects.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the efficacy of duvelisib (induction followed by maintenance [intermittent
      dosing]) in patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), as
      measured by the progression free survival (PFS).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate safety of duvelisib induction and maintenance (by intermittent dosing) in
      relapsed/refractory CLL.

      II. To evaluate clinical benefits to duvelisib treatment.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate T-cell populations in patients with CLL treated with duvelisib.

      OUTLINE:

      INDUCTION: Patients receive duvelisib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Cycles
      repeat every 28 days for 12 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      MAINTENANCE: Patients receive duvelisib PO BID on days 1-2, 8-9, 15-16, and 22-23. Cycles
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 12
      months.
