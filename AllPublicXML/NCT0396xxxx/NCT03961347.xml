  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While genetics demonstrated a major risk factor for the development of type 1 diabetes (T1D),
      microbiota dysbiosis has been suggested as an elicitor in immunological tolerance and of beta
      cell autoimmunity. The probiotic Lactobacillus johnsonii N6.2 may prevent or restore the gut
      flora and show systemic impacts and adaptive immunity in the T1D population thereby
      preserving beta cell function.

    <time_frame>52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>CBC and CMP will be evaluated at four different time points during study: 1st measure will be at screening visit and before starting intervention (visit 1/week -4, baseline period), 2nd measure will be after 12 weeks after starting intervention (visit 2/ week 12), 3rd measure will be after the 24 weeks of intervention (visit 3/ week 24) and the 4th measure will be 24 weeks later, end of washout period (visit 4/week 48). Values should be within the normal range except for glucose.</description>

    <measure>Tolerance will be evaluated according to their responses on weekly questionnaires</measure>
    <time_frame>52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The weekly questionnaire will ask participants to respond to questions regarding their gastrointestinal health (bowel movement frequency, gastrointestinal and other symptoms (i.e., constipation, diarrhea, stomach pain) and general wellness (if you consumed an antibiotic, visited a doctor, etc.). The questionnaires follow a scale from 1-7, 1 = No discomfort at all, 7 = Very severe discomfort.</description>
