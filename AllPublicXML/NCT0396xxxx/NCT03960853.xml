  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 1967, the term &quot;respirator lung&quot; was coined to describe the diffuse alveolar infiltrates
      and hyaline membranes that were found on postmortem examination of patients who had undergone
      mechanical ventilation.This mechanical ventilation can aggravate damaged lungs and damage
      normal lungs. In recent years, Various ventilation strategies have been used to minimize lung
      injury, including low tide volume, higher PEEPs, recruitment maneuvers and high-frequency
      oscillatory ventilation. which have been proved to reduce the occurrence of lung injury.

      In 2012,Needham et al. proposed a kind of lung protective mechanical ventilation, and their
      study showed that limited volume and pressure ventilation could significantly improve the
      2-year survival rate of patients with acute lung injury.Volume controlled ventilation is the
      most commonly used method in clinical surgery at present.Volume controlled ventilation(VCV)
      is a time-cycled, volume targeted ventilation mode, ensures adequate gas exchange.
      Nevertheless, during VCV, airway pressure is not controlled.Pressure controlled
      ventilation（PCV） can ensure airway pressure,however minute ventilation is not
      guaranteed.Pressure controlled ventilation-volume guarantee(PCV-VG) is an innovative mode of
      ventilation utilizes a decelerating flow and constant pressure. Ventilator parameters are
      automatically changed with each patient breath to offer the target VT without increasing
      airway pressures. So PCV-VG has the advantages of both VCV and PCV to preserve the target
      minute ventilation whilst producing a low incidence of barotrauma pressure-targeted
      ventilation.

      Current studies on PCV-VG mainly focus on thoracic surgery, bariatric surgery and urological
      surgery, and the research indicators mainly focus on changes in airway pressure and
      intraoperative oxygenation index.The age of patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal
      cancer resection is generally higher, the cardiopulmonary reserve function is decreased, and
      the influence of intraoperative pneumoperitoneum pressure and low head position increases the
      incidence of intraoperative and postoperative pulmonary complications.Whether PCV-VG can
      reduce the incidence of intraoperative lung injury and postoperative pulmonary complications
      in elderly patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal cancer resection, and thereby improve
      postoperative recovery of these patients is still unclear.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One hundred patients undergoing elective laparoscopic colorectal cancer resection (age &gt; 65
      years old, body mass index(BMI）18-30 kg/m2, American society of anesthesiologists(ASA
      )grading Ⅰ - Ⅲ ) will be randomly assigned to volume control ventilation(VCV)group and
      pressure controlled ventilation-volume guarantee(PCV-VG)group.General anesthesia combined
      with epidural anesthesia will be used to both groups.

      Ventilation settings in both groups are VT 8 mL/kg,inspiratory/expiratory (I/E) ratio
      1:2,inspired oxygen concentration (FIO2) 0.5 with air,2.0 L/min of inspiratory fresh gas
      flow,positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 0 millimeter of mercury （mmHg）,respiratory rate
      (RR) was adjusted to maintain an end tidal CO2 pressure (ETCO2) of 35 -45 mmHg.

      In operation dates will be collected at the following time points: preanesthesia, 1 hour
      after pneumoperitoneum,2 hours after pneumoperitoneum ,30 minutes after admission to
      post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU) .The dates collected or calculated are the following:1)peak
      airway pressure,plate airway pressure, mean inspiratory pressure, dynamic compliance,
      RR,Exhaled VT andETCO2，2) Arterial blood gas analysis: arterial partial pressure of oxygen
      (PaO2), arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2),power of hydrogen（PH）, and oxygen
      saturation (SaO2)，3) Oxygenation index (OI) calculation; PaO2/FIO2, 4) Ratio of physiologic
      dead-space over tidal volume(Vd/VT) (expressed in %) was calculated with Bohr's formula ;
      Vd/VT = (PaCO2 - ETCO2)/PaCO2,5) Hemodynamics: heart rate, mean arterial pressure (MAP),and
      central venous pressure （CVP），6) lung injury markers ：Interleukin 6(IL6）,Interleukin
      8（IL8）,Clara cell protein 16（CC16）,Solution advanced glycation end products
      receptor（SRAGE）,tumor necrosis factor α(TNFα) .

      Investigators will collect the following dates according to following-up after surgery: the
      incidence of postoperation pulmonary complications(PPC) based on PPC scale within seven days
      , incidence of pneumonia within seven days after surgery,incidence of atelectasis within
      seven days after surgery,length of hospital days after surgery, the incidence of
      postoperative unplanned admission to ICU, the incidence of operation complications within 7
      days after surgery, the incidence of postoperative systematic complications within 7 days
      after surgery.
