  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Wolf Motor Function Test</measure>
    <time_frame>After the 3-week intervention period</time_frame>
    <description>participants were timed as they completed 15 activities that progressively involved more difficult arm movements and interactions with objects such as lifting a soda can, stacking checkers, and folding a towel. We reported the average time to perform the 15 items and the evaluator rated the normalcy of these items with a 6-point ordinal scale (range,0-5) using the functional ability scale.</description>

    <measure>Surface electromyography</measure>
    <time_frame>After the 3-week intervention period</time_frame>
    <description>Surface electromyography was used to measure the integrated EMG（IEMG）of the biceps and triceps during maximum isometric voluntary contraction（MIVC）of the affected elbow flexion and extension and then the co-contraction rate（CR）was calculated</description>
