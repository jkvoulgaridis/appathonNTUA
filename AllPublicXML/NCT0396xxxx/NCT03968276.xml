  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medical ethics encourages medical personal to actively care for patients, however old they
      may be, if they have maintained their physical autonomy and mental integrity to travel the
      path of medical care together. Many of the patients are in this situation today and their age
      does not seem to be a limiting factor in the care required.

      For more than 60 years, antithrombotics have played a major role in the management of
      thromboembolic and arterioatheromatous diseases. the doctors have therefore seen the advent
      of low molecular weight heparins, new platelet antiaggregants and then direct oral
      anticoagulants.

      If their contribution is no longer discussed today, it is necessary to take into
      consideration the risks they cause, particularly in terms of haemorrhage. Indeed,
      antithrombotics are the leading cause of serious adverse reactions in France with
      anti-vitamins K (AVK) which are the leading cause of hospitalization for severe iatrogeny in
      France. This risk is increased by the coexistence of haemorrhagic risk factors: drug
      interaction, misuse, failure to comply with contraindications and precautions for use,
      especially as exposure to these drugs increases with age.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The risk of bleeding varies in different populations and according to the treatment used.
      Severe bleeding under AVK has an incidence of 0.6 to 10% per year. Fatal hemorrhage is in the
      order of 1%. The risk factors for bleeding are controversial: history of bleeding in the
      patient, instability of the International Normalized Ratio (INR) at the time of introduction
      of KVAs and during the first few months, poor patient compliance, drug combinations
      (antiplatelet, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: NSAIDs, paracetamol, etc.) or
      association with alcohol. National pharmacovigilance data indicate that serious accidents are
      not uncommon due to frequent misuse of antithrombotics in common practice.

      There are risk factors related to the patient and his or her comorbidities: history of
      bleeding, stroke, comorbidities such as age &gt; 65 years, diabetes, cancer, chronic renal
      failure.

      Despite the various aids to therapeutic patient education (surveillance logbook, computerised
      INR monitoring), there has been no decrease in the frequency of iatrogenic accidents, either
      in hospitals or in urban medicine.

      The use of smartphone applications in the medical field is increasingly evolving among
      healthcare professionals and patients. They allow for more personalized care, and can also
      promote interaction with health professionals.

      Strengthening the link between specialist doctors and the general practitioner for joint
      patient management will improve their follow-up and reduce the risk of iatrogeny.

      In 2016, a survey was conducted in the vascular medicine department of the Groupe Hospitalier
      Paris Saint-Joseph (GHPSJ) to assess access to smartphones among patients on anti-thrombotic
      medication. Of the 100 patients enrolled, 74 were on anticoagulant or platelet aggregation
      therapy. Of these, 50 had a mobile phone and 24% used the Internet and made downloads to
      their phones.

      This raises the question of the interest that patients might have in a mobile application on
      the use of anti-thrombotics. As the profile of patients seen in hospital is different from
      those consulting in general medicine, it seems interesting to study these two populations in
      order to know if there is a difference in their attitude towards the smartphone.

      In order to find a new way to limit the iatrogeny of antithrombotic drugs, the investigators
      wanted to set up a medical application (educational tablet) for patients to provide them with
      support to better manage their treatment.

    <description>if the patient is included in the study, an educational tablet (digital tablet) is given to the patient.
The first connection to the tablet and then to the &quot;My medication protects my vessels&quot; application is made by the investigator in the presence of the patient. The application is configured by the investigator with the choice of the vascular pathology(s) corresponding to the patient included and the prescribed anti-thrombotic treatments. Thus, for each patient, the content of the tablet is adapted and personalized according to his vascular profile.
After discharge from hospital, the patient has the educational tablet at his disposal for 1 month at home. The application offers patients various information supports (tools, questionnaires and pill box). Throughout its use, it may contact the investigating physician via a telephone number available within the application if it encounters a problem related to the study.</description>

    <description>At the end of hospitalization, the patient has an educational tablet at his disposal for 1 month at home. Throughout its use, the patient may contact the investigating physician via a telephone number available within the application if he/she encounters a problem related to the study. At the end of this month, the patient must complete two questionnaires through the application to assess his or her knowledge of his or her condition and treatment, as well as his or her satisfaction with the use of the tablet.
In this research, 1 month after inclusion, the patient will have an additional follow-up visit corresponding to a dedicated consultation in the vascular medicine department. It will allow the patient to review the use of the tablet and his or her satisfaction with the use of such a tool.</description>
