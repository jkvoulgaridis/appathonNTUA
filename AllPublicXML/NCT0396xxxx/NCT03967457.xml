  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is prospective cohort study. All the patients with primary cervical cancer in the future
      three years in Peking Union Medical College Hospital will be included in this study. Before
      and after the major therapy (including at least radical hysterectomy and/or radiotherapy),
      the patients accept (1) the questionnaires survey about quality of life; (2) urodynamic
      testing; (3) rectum dynamics testing and (4) ovarian reserve function. The survival outcomes
      (disease-free survival and overall survival) will be supplemented as secondary objectives.
