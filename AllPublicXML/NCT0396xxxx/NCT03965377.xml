  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the effectiveness of novel technology-based game to teach parents and
      parents to be home safety skills. These include the identification of home child injury risks
      under two conditions (with and without distraction) and how to resolve these risks to better
      protect preschool children from injuries. Few empirically validated home safety interventions
      exist and the best ones involve individual home visitors. These and others that use didactic
      instruction or provision of written material have poor response from low socioeconomic
      parents who are less literate and more resistant to outsiders entering their homes. The use
      of a computer game to provide education in this area is being tested for effectiveness and
      the game's engagement will also be examined.

      Given cognitive problems in parents have been linked in the PI's work to child neglect (e.g.,
      poor child supervision), links of performance on the game to cognitive capacities will also
      be examined in a preliminary way.

    <textblock>
      The study will compare a group of parents and parents to be who play the game multiple times
      (n=15) to a wait list group (n=15) who just play it once. The study will examine reaction
      times to identification and resolution of the risks overall and by category of risk (e.g.,
      poisoning, burns, suffocation, etc.). The study will also examine failures on levels of the
      game which are graded for difficulty. The game was designed for low failure rate to increase
      engagement and to improve motivation.

      Changes in the participants' perception of efficacy in preventing injuries to children and
      their engagement with the game (using a standardized usability survey) will be examined. The
      study will also examine the role of experience with the use of technology and cognitive
      capacities in relation to performance and pre-post changes with multiple plays of the game.

    <time_frame>one week (four plays of the game) The outcomes average seconds until identification will be examined across the four game plays and also can be examined for each of four plays of the game.</time_frame>
    <description>The game is designed to improve speed of identifying home safety hazards with and without distractions and also identify effective resolutions of the risks. Speed in identification is measured in seconds. Effectiveness in identifying resolutions is measured in seconds as well (e.g., seconds til correct response). Average time to identification of risks in each of the three phases of the game can be computed (Identification Phase, Resolution Phase, and Distraction Phase). The game will also give whether the resolutions selected are correct and thus, a percentage of correct resolutions can be computed for the entire resolution phase.</description>

    <measure>:Perception of efficacy in preventing childhood injuries: PARENT SENSE OF INJURY COMPETENCE SCALE</measure>
    <time_frame>pre and one week later This outcome will be measured using PARENT SENSE OF INJURY COMPETENCE SCALE. This instrument has 16 items that are rated on a 1-6 scale with 6 indicating greater efficacy. The items are totaled for overall efficacy perception.</time_frame>

    <time_frame>This instrument is collected one time at post test once they have completed game play. The time frame is one week after entering the study.</time_frame>
    <description>A survey instrument [Usability Survey (UES)] will be collected that measures engagement in the game. This instrument has 26 items that assess engagement with the game rated on a five point scale from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (5). The ratings are totalled for an overall engagement score and this will be used to measure engagement.</description>

    <description>Home Safety Hero computer game presents players with virtual rooms in a home where vilians have planted safety risks. It involves the player taking the role of a body guard for a child. It has three phases: 1. Identifying risks in a set of rooms (e.g., burn, falling, suffocation, poisoning); 2. Identifying risks and then selecting a resolution to reduce the risk or eliminate it entirely; and 3. Identifying risk when faced with distractions typical to home environments (e.g., phone ringing, fire engine siren sounds, a moving child).</description>
