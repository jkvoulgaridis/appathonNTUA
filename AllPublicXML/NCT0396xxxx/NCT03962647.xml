    <textblock>
      This is a neoadjuvant study to determine the feasibility and tolerability of 2 weeks of a
      very low carbohydrate ketogenic diet in combination with letrozole for patients with early
      stage operable ER+disease.

      Primary Objective:

      â€¢ To evaluate the feasibility and tolerability of a 2 week ketogenic diet in combination with
      endocrine therapy prior to surgery for early stage ER+ breast cancer.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To determine whether endocrine therapy in combination with a dietary intervention to
           reduce insulin pathway signaling results in enhanced inhibition of cancer cell
           proliferation (measured byKi67)

        -  To determine the effectiveness of 2 weeks of a ketogenic diet to reduce measures of
           insulin/PI3Kpathway activation in breast tumors

        -  To measure changes in weight and body composition after 2 weeks of a ketogenic diet

        -  To measure changes in insulin resistance after 2 weeks of a ketogenic diet

        -  To measure the effectiveness of a ketogenic diet in combination with endocrine therapy
           to induce and maintain a ketogenic state.

      Outline:

      Participants will have baseline metabolic parameters measured and will begin a 2-week diet
      consisting of meal replacement shakes to induce a ketogenic state. Patients will also receive
      letrozole 2.5 mg daily. At the end of 2 weeks, metabolic parameters will again be measured
      and patients will proceed with surgical treatment of their breast cancer. A tumor biopsy from
      the surgical specimen will be obtained to measure cell proliferation compared with the
      pre-treatment diagnostic biopsy.
