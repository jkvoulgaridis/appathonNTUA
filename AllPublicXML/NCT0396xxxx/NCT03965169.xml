  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing surgery under general anesthesia are susceptible to pressure-induced soft
      tissue damage because there is no change in posture over an extended period of time. In
      particular, when the patient is in a prone position, unlike the supine position, the bony
      protruding portion of the front side must support the weight, which is more vulnerable to
      pressure injury. Previous studies have shown that the incidence of pressure injury during
      surgery varied from 5% to 66% and was more likely to occur in patients with long operating
      times, prone position, obesity, and poor skin condition. These pressure injuries increase
      postoperative complications, length of stay, and medical costs. Therefore, the investigators
      analyze the incidence of pressure injury in prone position and re-examine the risk factors of
      pressure injury.

      All of the anesthetic and surgical procedures performed on the subject during the period from
      the time the subject enters the operating room to the time the subject go to the recovery
      room are the same as those for the existing spine surgery. Immediately after entering the
      operating room, immediately before going to the recovery room, and at postoperative day 1 and
      2, the patient's systemic skin condition is assessed to determine whether pressure damage has
      occurred. The primary endpoint is the incidence of pressure injury in the subject compared
      with the incidence of pressure injury in previous studies. To identify the risk factors for
      the occurrence of pressure injury, the investigators will statistically analyze the data
      collected with the assumption that this is related.
