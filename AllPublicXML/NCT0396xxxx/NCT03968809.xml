  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single-center clinical trial is designed to evaluate the CardioFlux magnetocardiograph
      diagnostic imaging system to predict major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in patients referred
      for evaluation for coronary artery disease.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, prospective, observational cohort trial to form a registry data set.
      Patients presenting for cardiac stress testing utilizing Single Photon Emission Computed
      Tomography (SPECT), cardiac CT angiography (CCTA), or cardiac catheterization will be offered
      to enroll in the registry and provide informed consent to undergo imaging with a CardioFlux
      magnetocardiography (MCG) prior to their procedure.

      Multiple studies have shown that MCG accuracy is quite high in identifying patients with
      symptomatic coronary artery disease. This difference is dramatic enough to prove superiority
      over standard ECGs in diagnosis of vital ischemic and infarction parameters. Genetesis
      presents a novel MCG analysis system called CardioFlux (CF). This modality takes less than
      five minutes to complete, is radiation-free, and is an easy to operate system. This clinical
      trial will enroll patients of all cardiac risk levels presenting for various modalities of
      cardiac diagnostic testing to have CardioFlux scanning in addition to standard of care.
      Results will be interpreted and compared to the immediate results of nuclear (SPECT) stress
      testing, cardiac CT angiography, or cardiac catheterization.

      Participants will be followed up at 30 days and 1 year via phone call or chart review. 30 day
      and 1 year MACE will be recorded and correlated with initial CardioFlux MCG results.
      Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV),
      and overall accuracy will be calculated of CardioFlux relative to the incidence of MACE, and
      in comparison to the above diagnostic modalities.
