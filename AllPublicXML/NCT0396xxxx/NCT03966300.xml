  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vaccination hesitancy is identified as a threat to global health by the World Health
      Organization (WHO). For adolescents undergoing vaccination at school, prior studies
      demonstrate that concerns about pain and/or fear of needles contribute to negative
      experiences with vaccination and non-compliance with vaccination. The investigators developed
      an intervention that addresses vaccination hesitancy. In this study, investigators will
      evaluate the effectiveness of this intervention in a randomized controlled trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vaccination hesitancy is identified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as one of ten
      threats to global health. The WHO's 3C model of vaccination hesitancy identifies 3 domains of
      vaccine hesitancy: 1) Confidence (trust in health care providers), 2) Complacency (perceived
      importance of vaccine-preventable disease) and 3) Convenience (improving clinic processes).
      The investigators developed a multifaceted knowledge translation intervention that addresses
      vaccination hesitancy in school-based vaccinations. The intervention is called The CARD(TM)
      System (C-Comfort, A-Ask, R-Relax, D-Distract). CARD is a framework for delivering
      vaccinations that is student-centred and promotes coping. CARD integrates evidence-based
      interventions related to planning and execution of school vaccination clinics to directly
      tackle all 3 domains of vaccination hesitancy. It tackles Confidence by improving pain/fear
      management (it teaches students and public health staff how to reduce student symptoms which
      improves the vaccination experience and improves student trust in health care providers). It
      tackles Complacency by educating students about what vaccines are, why they are needed,
      community immunity, as well as the specific diseases they are being protected against. It
      tackles Convenience by improving school-based clinic processes by integrating student
      preferences (e.g., privacy, having a support person present).

      In this randomized controlled trial, the investigators will evaluate the impact of CARD (vs.
      usual care) on student important outcomes and process outcomes.
