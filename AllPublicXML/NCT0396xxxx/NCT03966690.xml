  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The functional condition of the leg muscles is not only relevant to performance in sports,
      but is also of great importance in health, prevention and rehabilitation, where not only the
      general strength level is decisive but also the relationship between individual muscle
      groups. Among other things the H-Q-ratio (strength ratio of &quot;hamstring&quot; muscles to quadriceps
      muscles) is often used to diagnose possible imbalances. Isokinetic force measurements have
      established themselves as the gold standard in competitive football. In this context,
      however, force tests in the open kinetic chain (OKC) have almost exclusively been used so
      far. Especially force measurements in the closed kinetic chain (CKC) could have a higher
      relevance regarding functionality. The H-Q-ratio should better be called the flex-ext-ratio
      in the CKC due to the involvement of the hip muscles. There is little data in the literature
      on leg force or flex-ext-ratio in CKC. In particular, there is hardly any comparative data
      for isokinetic measurement systems in the CKC. Using a cross over design and randomly
      allocating 28 competitive football players into two groups (n=14 each) that either started
      tests with the leg press or legcurl device, the investigators assumed (1) a significantly
      lower flex-ext-ratio in the CKC compared to the OKC, (2) a correlation between the isokinetic
      measurement systems in the OKC and the CKC, and (3) a significant superiority of the leg
      press to predict functional performance of the lower limbs.
