  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HiSLAC is an independent, professionally-led study which will evaluate a key component of NHS
      England's policy drive for 7-day services: the intensity of specialist-led care of emergency
      medical admissions, with a particular focus on weekend provision. This research is important
      for patients and for NHS strategy because it offers a unique opportunity to evaluate the
      impact of the transition to seven-day working, and to understand factors likely to impede or
      enhance the effectiveness of this change in practice.

      In addition to examining the impact on patient-centred outcomes, the project will also
      undertake a health economics analysis of the impact of increasing specialist provision across
      the NHS. HiSLAC will therefore provide useful information across the NHS about the
      cost-effectiveness of investing in consultant and other specialist staffing in implementing
      the drive to 7-day service provision.

      In this survey instrument, physician characteristics and psychological attitudes have been
      shown to influence medical decisions. This study aims to describe the influence of several
      patient characteristics and reviewer characteristics and attitudes on the physician's overall
      case note review care quality judgement using an analytical method called multi-level
      modelling.

      The investigators describe here a protocol for comparing quality of care given to patients
      admitted as emergencies to 20 hospital Trusts at weekends and on weekdays during two epochs,
      representing periods before (2012-2013) and during (2016-2017) the implementation of NHS
      England's 7-day services standards.

      Using retrospective review of case records from 20 hospital Trusts during two time epochs,
      this study aims to determine whether there is a difference in quality of care offered to
      patients undergoing emergency admission (EA) to hospital at weekends compared with weekdays.

      The main objectives are as follows:

        1. To compare rates of errors and differences in care quality between weekend and weekday
           admissions,

        2. To examine prevalent error types for weekend and weekday admissions,

        3. If a difference in error rates or care quality between weekend and weekday admissions is
           found, examine whether the difference has changed between the two epochs.

        4. To inform the Bayesian model proposed in this parallel health economics model. The
           co-primary outcomes are the weekend:weekday error rate ratio and the global assessment
           of care quality. The error rate is calculated as the number of errors per case record
           from admission to discharge or to 7 days, whichever occurs first.

      Secondary outcomes include a comparison of weekend-weekday admissions in error typology and
      error-related adverse events (AEs), of error rates by day of the week within each admission
      group and correlation of weekend: weekday error rate ratios with weekend:weekday differences
      in specialist hours per 10 EAs.

      In this survey instrument, physician characteristics and psychological attitudes have shown
      to influence medical decisions. The case note review process of determining the overall care
      quality is a type of medical decision. The HiSLAC study gives us an opportunity to determine
      whether patient or physician characteristics and physician attitudinal scores (physician
      aversion to ambiguity, need for cognition and personal need for structure) influence the
      overall care quality judgement during case note review. The investigators develop a case for
      considering this question with a multi-level model assuming the clustering within patient and
      within reviewers; furthermore, the investigators develop pre-specified hypotheses for
      testing. (See hypotheses) Our outputs from this are intended to inform better practice with
      case note reviews.

      HYPOTHESES

      For each objective a general hypothesis is provided:

      Null hypothesis 1: To assess whether there is no significant relationship between patient
      case note characteristics and the physician's overall care quality judgements.

      Null hypothesis 2: To assess whether there is no significant relationship between case note
      reviewer characteristics and their overall care quality judgements.

      Null hypothesis 3. To assess whether there is no significant relationship between case note
      reviewer attitudes and their overall care quality judgements.

      In addition to the above two objectives, one secondary objective is to assess the same
      effects of characteristics and attitudes on reviewer confidence in their care quality
      judgement. A further secondary objective is to assess whether there is a significant
      relationship between case-specific factors and reviewers' self-assessed confidence in their
      global care quality judgements.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Need For Cognition (NFC) Scale (5 items on 6 point Likert)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks from survey commencement</time_frame>
    <description>Assessing the individual's tendency to engage in and enjoy activities that require thinking. Minimum score is 1 and the maximum is 6 (other than for items 3 and 4 which are each reverse scored; i.e. 6 is the lowest score and 1 is the highest score possible) There is no moral distinction about which score is better; they are measures of attitudinal predispositions individuals have in a respective scenario. It is then our remit to parse this information in light of the context, the nature of the participants and the overall aims and boundaries of reviewing case notes. (e.g. a higher value (thus preferring more complex situations) on 'I would prefer complex to simple problems' does not necessarily indicate a 'good' response but more that they are compelled by difficult and complex problems.
There are no subscales to consider; items are equally weighted contributing to the distinction between low and high NFC i.e. top half or the bottom half of all possible scores.</description>

    <measure>Personal Need for Structure (PNS) Scale (12 items on 6 point Likert)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks from survey commencement</time_frame>
    <description>Assessing preferences for &quot;structure and clarity in most situations, with ambiguity and grey areas proving troublesome and annoying.&quot; Minimum score is 1 and the maximum is 6 (other than for items 2, 5, 6 and 11 which are each reverse scored; i.e. 6 is the lowest score and 1 is the highest score possible) There is no moral distinction about which score is better; they are measures of attitudinal predispositions individuals have. Investigators then parse this information in light of the context, the nature of the participants and the overall aims and boundaries of reviewing case notes. (e.g. a higher value (thus preferring more complex situations) on 'I enjoy having a structured mode of life.' does not necessarily indicate a 'good' response but more that they desire more structure in their work.
There are no subscales to consider for PNS; items are equally weighted contributing to the distinction between low and high PNS i.e. in the top half or the bottom half of all possible scores.</description>

    <measure>Anxiety due to uncertainty Scale (ADTU) (5 items on 6 point Likert)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks from survey commencement</time_frame>
    <description>One subscale (total=4) of 'Revised Physician's reactions to uncertainty scale' assessing physicians&quot; affective reactions to uncertainty.
Minimum score is 1 and the maximum is 6 (other than for items 2, 5, 6 and 11 which are each reverse scored; i.e. 6 is the lowest score and 1 is the highest score possible) There is no moral distinction about which score is better; they are measures of attitudinal predispositions individuals have. It is then our remit to parse this information in light of the case note review context. (e.g. a higher value (thus preferring more complex situations) on 'I am quite comfortable with the uncertainty in patient care' does not necessarily indicate a 'better' response but more that they are more comfortable with uncertainty in their clinical work.
ADTU is a subscale of the a larger instrument; items are equally weighted contributing to the distinction between low and high ADTU i.e. in the top half or the bottom half of all possible scores.</description>
