  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep is not an optional luxury, but a fundamental biological need, essential for health and
      well-being. Insufficient sleep is a significant public health issue, with 69% of adolescents
      in America obtaining less than the minimum requirement of 8 hours of sleep per night. Early
      school start times has been identified as the most significant and modifiable factor that
      restricts sleep duration in adolescents. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommended in
      2014 that all middle and high schools start no earlier than 8:30 a.m., yet few school
      districts have implemented this change. In fall 2017, the Cherry Creek School District, a
      diverse district of almost 55,000 students outside Denver, changed school start times.
      Although previous studies have shown increased sleep duration, decreased daytime sleepiness,
      and improved academics following start time changes for secondary students, there remains an
      urgent need to understand how this policy impacts health and well-being for all students,
      including youth in elementary school. Recognizing that students are part of a complex system
      that includes parents, school staff, and the community, this observational study will be a
      multi-year, broad-based evaluation that includes key stakeholders, multiple sources of
      quantitative data (i.e., surveys, academic records, district nursing electronic health
      records), contextual qualitative data (i.e., open-ended surveys and focus groups), and
      community-based outcomes (i.e., data on vehicle crashes and juvenile crimes). The primary
      hypothesis is that later school start times will have a positive impact on middle and high
      school students sleep and health outcomes, while earlier school start times will have a
      neutral impact on elementary school students sleep and health outcomes.
