  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Canada the prevalence of spinal cord injury (SCI) is approximately 85,556, with incidence
      rates of traumatic and non-traumatic SCI at 1,785 and 2,286 cases per year, respectively.
      Common secondary health conditions experienced by individuals with SCI include psychological
      distress and pain. Appropriate management of these secondary conditions, through a
      multidisciplinary approach, is imperative as they have been shown to contribute to slower
      recovery, increased negative outcomes, and greater rates of rehospitalizations and health
      care utilization. However, resource limitations can restrict the ability of service providers
      to deliver these integrative biopsychosocial approaches in the community. Guided internet
      delivered cognitive behavioural therapy (ICBT) program offers an alternative approach for
      psychosocial service delivery in the community. The program provides online structured
      self-help modules based on the principles of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) in
      combination with guidance from a coach through weekly emails and telephone calls. ICBT was
      shown to have similar effects to face-to-face CBT. Results from the investigator's pilot
      pre-post study (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03457714), found significant effects of guided ICBT on
      primary outcome of depression (d=1.20, p=.02) post-intervention and gains were maintained at
      3-month follow-up among persons with SCI. Significant improvements in secondary outcomes
      including pain interference, resilience, positive affect, self-efficacy, ability to
      participate, and grief were also found.These studies demonstrate that guided ICBT is a safe
      and effective alternative to face-to-face interventions and it may be beneficial for
      underserviced populations.

      In the proposed trial, the investigators will examine the efficacy of the Guided ICBT Chronic
      Conditions Course for persons with SCI versus an online SCI Rehabilitation Education program.
      All participants will complete questionnaires prior to the start of the program, before each
      lesson of the program, once they have completed the program, and 3 months after completing
      the program. The primary outcome measures include anxiety and depression. As part of the
      battery of questionnaires administered after the completion of the program, clients will be
      asked to rate the program content, the overall service, and their satisfaction with the
      program.
