      This study (Part 3) is designed to build a database including EEG, neurocognitive
      performance, clinical symptoms, history and other relevant data, which will be used to derive
      a multimodal EEG based algorithm for the identification of concussion and tracking of
      recovery.

      Injured/concussed subjects will be studied at time of injury, and at 3 follow-up time points
      following injury. Subjects will come from the sports and other populations of concussed
      individuals. They will be matched with controls i.e. not head injured subjects who will also
      undergo the same set of tests and the same time intervals as the injured subjects. An
      additional pool of uninjured (not head injured) subjects will be collected who will be
      assessed at a single time point. This data will be used to populate a database for the
      purpose of deriving a multimodal concussion index.

    <description>Create a database of all assessments including brain electrical activity (EEG features including all frequency bands and measures (power, connectivity,complexity), neurocognitive performance tests scores (throughput measures), balance, and clinical/symptom assessments (SCAT5), to support derivation of a multimodal brain function/concussion index.

    <description>Injured subjects consist of subjects who are head injured and meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Injured subjects will be tested within 72 hours (3 days) of injury and at specified time points post injury. Matched control subjects will be tested at the same time intervals as the injured subject. BrainScope Battery will be performed at each time point and consists of the following components: brain electrical activity (EEG), neurocognitive performance assessment, ocular motor assessment, and clinical symptoms/assessments.</description>

    <description>This subject pool will consist of uninjured (not head injured) subjects and will be tested at a single time point. These subjects will perform the same BrainScope Battery as the injured and matched control subjects.</description>
