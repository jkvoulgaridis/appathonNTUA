      MARIO-3 is a Phase 2 multi-arm combination cohort study designed to evaluate IPI-549,
      Infinity Pharmaceutical's first-in-class, oral immuno-oncology product candidate targeting
      immune-suppressive tumor-associated myeloid cells through selective inhibition of
      phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)-gamma, in combinations with Tecentriq and Abraxane
      (nab-paclitaxel) in front-line triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and in combination with
      Tecentriq and Avastin (bevacizumab) in front-line renal cell cancer (RCC).

      MARIO-3 (Macrophage Reprogramming in Immuno-Oncology) is a prospective Phase 2 multi-arm,
      multicenter, open-label, combination cohort study designed to evaluate IPI-549, Infinity
      Pharmaceutical's first-in-class, oral immuno-oncology product candidate targeting
      immune-suppressive tumor-associated myeloid cells through selective inhibition of
      phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)-gamma. IPI-549 will be administered in combinations with
      Tecentriq and Abraxane (nab-paclitaxel) in front-line triple negative breast cancer (TNBC)
      and in combination with Tecentriq and Avastin (bevacizumab) in front-line renal cell cancer
      (RCC).

      This study will enroll approximately 90 treatment-na√Øve patients across the following disease
      cohorts. Cohort A will be composed of patients with locally advanced and/or metastatic
      triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Cohort B will be composed of patients with locally
      advanced and/or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC).

      The primary objective of MARIO-3 is to evaluate the complete response (CR) rate per Response
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 following combination treatment with
      IPI-549 and front-line treatment in patients with TNBC and RCC. Its secondary objectives
      include evaluation of the safety, objective response rate (ORR), time to CR (TTCR), time to
      response (TTR), duration of CR (DOCR), duration of response (DOR), and progression-free
      survival (PFS).

             bisphosphonate therapy. Patients who are receiving denosumab must discontinue
             denosumab use and replace it with a bisphosphonate instead while on study. There is no
             required minimum washout period for denosumab. Patients who are receiving

             confined early stage cancer that has been definitively treated with curative intent,
             does not require ongoing treatment, has no evidence of residual active disease, and
             has a negligible risk of recurrence and is therefore unlikely to interfere with the
             primary and secondary endpoints of the study, including response rate and safety.

         19. History of autoimmune disease, including but not limited to myasthenia gravis,
             myositis, autoimmune hepatitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis,

             syndrome, Wegener's granulomatosis, Sj√∂gren's syndrome, Guillain-Barr√© syndrome,
             multiple sclerosis, vasculitis, or glomerulonephritis.

         20. History of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (including pneumonitis), drug-induced
             pneumonitis, organizing pneumonia (i.e., bronchiolitis obliterans, cryptogenic
             organizing pneumonia), or evidence of active pneumonitis on screening chest CT scan.
             History of radiation pneumonitis in the radiation field (fibrosis) is permitted.

         21. Past medical history of interstitial lung disease, drug-induced interstitial lung
             disease, radiation pneumonitis which required steroid treatment, or any evidence of
             clinically active interstitial lung disease.

         22. Prior allogeneic stem cell or solid organ transplantation.

         23. Administration of a live or attenuated vaccine within 4 weeks of first dose of study
             drug or anticipation that such a live or attenuated vaccine will be required during
             the study or within 5 months following the last dose of atezolizumab.

         24. Prior therapy with experimental anti-tumor vaccines; any T cell co-stimulation or
             checkpoint pathways, such as anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, anti-CD137, or
             anti-CTLA-4 antibody, including ipilimumab, or other medicines specifically targeting
             the T cell; or IPI-549.

         25. Treatment with systemic immunostimulatory agents (including but not limited to
             interferons or IL-2) within 4 weeks or 5 half-lives of the drug (whichever is shorter)
             prior to enrollment.

         26. Treatment with systemic corticosteroids or other systemic immunosuppressive
             medications (including but not limited to prednisone, dexamethasone, cyclophosphamide,
             azathioprine, methotrexate, thalidomide, and anti‚àítumor necrosis factor [TNF] agents)
             within 2 weeks prior to randomization, or anticipated requirement for systemic
             immunosuppressive medications during the trial.

         27. Treatment with botanical preparations (e.g., herbal supplements or traditional Chinese
             medicines) intended for general health support or to treat the disease under study
             within 2 weeks prior to randomization.

         28. Administration of any of the following within 1 week prior to the administration of
             study drug:

               1. Strong inhibitors or inducers of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, including grapefruit,
                  grapefruit juice and herbal supplements.
