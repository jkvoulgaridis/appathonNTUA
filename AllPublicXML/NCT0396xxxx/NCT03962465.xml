    <textblock>
      In the proposed study, escalating doses of inotuzumab ozogamicin will be added to a standard
      pediatric inspired re-induction regimen and administered to younger adults with relapsed or
      refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Two re-induction regimens will be
      tested (one without pegaspargase and one including pegaspargase) and participants will be
      followed for disease status, allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (allo HCT),
      veno-occlusive disease following allo HCT, and overall survival.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inotuzumab ozogamicin has been studied as a single agent in refractory and relapsed ALL. In
      the relapsed setting, inotuzumab ozogamicin has been shown to achieve complete remission (CR)
      in 81% of patients and minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity in 78% of patients who
      achieve CR. In the proposed study, escalating doses of inotuzumab ozogamicin will be added to
      a standard pediatric inspired re-induction regimen and administered to younger adults with
      relapsed or refractory B-cell ALL. Two re-induction regimens will be tested. The first
      regimen is a 3-drug regimen comprised of prednisone, vincristine, and daunorubicin. The
      second is a 4-drug regimen comprised of prednisone, vincristine, daunorubicin, and
      pegaspargase. Intrathecal methotrexate (IT-methotrexate) and intrathecal cytarabine
      (IT-ARA-C) will be included for central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis with both the 3-drug
      and 4-drug regimens. We hypothesize that combining inotuzumab ozogamicin with these regimens
      is safe and will improve CR rates, successful transition to allo HCT, and overall survival in
      younger adults with relapsed or refractory B-ALL.

    <intervention_model_description>This is an early-phase study evaluating the safety of inotuzumab ozogamicin administered in combination with a 3-drug and 4-drug re-induction regimen in participants with relapsed or refractory B-ALL. The trial is planned to first determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the 3-drug re-induction regimen in Part 1 and then to determine the MTD of the 4-drug re-induction regimen (including pegaspargase) in Part 2.</intervention_model_description>
