  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patient satisfaction is the primary means of assessing the effectiveness of primary health
      care delivery. It helps in improving the quality of care by identifying and help resolving
      the potential problem areas. It assesses the effectiveness of the care provided and document
      the quality to accrediting organisations.In our institute, we have developed a patient
      satisfaction survey (PSS) questionnaire and have conducted a pilot study (Institutional
      review board approved) with fifty English speaking breast cancer patients receiving active
      cancer directed treatment in outpatient clinic, to evaluate the level of patient satisfaction
      in them. Therefore, we are now conducting a linguistic validation study using Hindi and
      Marathi PSS questionnaire to assess the overall level of patient satisfaction in a larger
      cohort of patients with diverse linguistic and economic background attending both general and
      private Outpatient Clinic.

      The aim of the study is to evaluate the overall level of patient satisfaction and their
      satisfaction at various encounters in the multi-disciplinary Breast Clinic which can be
      helpful to improve various aspects of patient care delivery.

      Methods:

      All patients who have already sort primary consultation in surgical, medical and radiation
      oncology outpatient clinics for their treatment plan and have had their last consultation
      within the last one month will be screened for the study. The Patient Satisfaction Survey
      (PSS) questionnaire (in preferred language) will be administered independently by a clinical
      research student who is not directly involved in patient care. The PSS will be anonymous. It
      will be administered to patients in the out-patient clinics waiting area. Patients will be
      asked to complete 3 surveys: one each for surgical, medical and radiation oncology
      professionals. It will take approximately 12 months to enroll the required number of
      patients.

      Sample size: Previous studies conducted in India and the pilot study conducted at Tata
      Memorial Hospital (TMH) with the PSS questionnaire have shown that approximately 70% of the
      patients are satisfied with the health care services. Assuming that the proportion of
      patients satisfied with the health services, when assessed by Hindi and Marathi PSS
      questionnaire will be ± 5% of 70%, i.e. between 65% to 75%, a sample size of 340 will be
      needed to produces a two-sided 95% confidence interval, which is determined by using
      Confidence Intervals Formula- Clopper-Pearson method.

      Potential Impact of the Study

        1. Knowledge of patient satisfaction in breast cancer patients belonging to diverse
           linguistic and socio-economic background will help in improving the quality of life of
           patients using appropriate resources and measures relevant to Indian context.

        2. Awareness of patient dissatisfaction will help improve doctor patient relationship.

        3. Awareness of patient dissatisfaction will help to identify problem areas and improve the
           care delivery.

    <measure>Linguistic validation of patient satisfaction survey (PSS) questionnaires in Hindi and Marathi.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Year</time_frame>
    <description>Scoring: For each of the rated 25 items, a score of 1-5 will be assigned. This gives a maximum score of 125 and a minimum score of 25. A score of 75 or above indicates that patient is satisfied with the care provided.
Construct validity for the instrument will be assessed using Pearson's correlation between the items and scales (It-Sc i.e. convergent validity) and between scales (Sc-Sc i.e. discriminant validity). The correlation coefficient should be &gt;0.4 and &lt;0.7 for these respectively.
Internal consistency (scale reliability) of the multi item questionnaires will be tested by Cronbach alpha coefficient. The internal consistency should be 0.70 or higher when scales are used for group comparisons.</description>
