  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ultimate goal of this study is to develop non-invasive, painless repetitive transcranial
      magnetic stimulation (rTMS) protocols to prevent cognitive decline in patients with mild
      cognitive impairment (MCI) and cognitively normal individuals at high risk of developing
      Alzheimer's disease (AD). Currently, 1 in 9 adults over the age of 65 have AD, which
      currently totals more than 5 million Americans and this number is expected to rise as high as
      16 million by 2050.

      MCI is a clinical syndrome that represents the gray area between healthy aging and dementia.
      Those with amnestic MCI (aMCI) have memory problems more severe than normal for their age and
      education, but their symptoms are not as severe as those of people with AD. Patients with
      aMCI are at high risk for AD. Notably, roughly half of those with MCI will continue to
      progress and convert to clinical dementia within 3 years. Alternatively, it is also
      worthwhile to study cognitively healthy older adults who carry genes that may increase the
      risk of AD. The frequency of the human APOE gene ε4 allele increases in patients with AD and
      the ε4 allele is also associated with an earlier age of disease onset.

      Currently, there are no known therapies that can effectively modify the progression and
      hallmark symptoms of AD. Therefore, it is crucial to provide an early intervention in
      patients with aMCI to delay or prevent the progression to AD.

      More specifically, this project has two specific aims:

        1. To plan personalized non-invasive brain stimulation location by brain Imaging with
           Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and healthy older
           adults.

        2. To identify potential personalized cognitive enhancement strategy (such as dosage or
           patterns) of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) in MCI and healthy older adults.

      Techniques to artificially and precisely stimulate brain tissue are increasingly recognized
      as valuable tools both in clinical practice and in cognitive neuroscience studies among
      healthy individuals and people with clinical conditions. With these practices, researchers
      can safely stimulate specific regions of the brain to explore causal relationships that
      comprise the brain's circuitry and modulate behavior.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In total, 60 participants (50-80 years old) will be recruited to participate in this trial.
      These 60 participants will be grouped into two distinct cohorts, with 30 participants in 2
      groups

        1. Individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI Group)

        2. Cognitively normal adults (CN group)

      There are three components in this study.

      Component 1a: If you decide to participate, you will be asked to complete 7 testing sessions
      in 7 days, which will be spaced out several days apart and each takes approximately 1 to 2
      hours.

        -  Baseline assessment (1 session; 2 hours/session)

        -  TMS*MRI (3 sessions; 1 hour/session)

        -  TMS*Memory assessment (3 sessions; 2 hours/session)

      Component 1b:

      You would be asked to receive 30 intervention sessions for three different protocols (10
      sessions for each). Before and after the interventions, MRI and Cognitive tasks will be
      utilized again as the outcome measurements. There is a one-month interval between each
      protocol. Each intervention will be around half-hour and each outcome measurement will take
      another one hour.

      Each block includes:

        -  MRI+ Memory pre-assessment (1 hour/session)

        -  TMS*10 (10 sessions; 0.5 hours/session)

        -  MRI+ Memory post-assessment (1 hours/session)

      You will experience each of the three TMS protocols. The total time commitment across these
      sessions will be 21 hours.

      After the conclusion of this study session of baseline data acquisition, the research team
      will analyze each participant's unique structural and functional connectivity patterns to
      determine the stimulation site for TMS in future intervention sessions.

      Component 2: Then, we would ask you to receive daily intervention sessions for 4 consecutive
      weeks, which will be quicker study visits lasting less than 30 minutes (notably, these will
      consist of less than 5 minutes of stimulation).

      Component 3: There will be another 4 testing sessions to evaluate treatment effects. They
      will be scheduled at the beginning, at the end of 2-week treatment, at the end of 4-week
      treatment, and 3 months after the end of 4-week treatment sessions. You don't need to come to
      the laboratory during the weekends. All sessions are located in the Biosciences Research
      Laboratories (BSLR) Building (1230 N. Cherry Ave., Tucson, AZ 85721). The schematic below
      outlines the components of the sessions.

      The investigators will acquire the following data during components for primary outcome
      measures and secondary measures.

      1) Brain imaging data 2) Neuropsychological data and demographic data 3) Memory tasks 4)
      Biological sample 5) Biometry with Heart Rate Variability 6) Frailty assessment
