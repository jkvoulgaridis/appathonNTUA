  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GH plays an important role in the synthesis of ovarian steroid hormone and follicular
      development as a paracrine hormone.GH can regulate the growth hormone receptor and strengthen
      the function of mitochondria to improve the quality of the female oocyte.In this study, a
      prospective randomized control was used to explore the effect of GH adjuvant therapy on
      embryo quality.
