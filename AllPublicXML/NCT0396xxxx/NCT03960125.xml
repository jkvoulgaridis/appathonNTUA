  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to test whether localized photodynamic therapy (PDT) treatment will
      result in increased skin levels of microvesicle particle (MVP) and if the use of imipramine
      will counteract PDT generated MVP release. The effects of PDT and ultraviolet B radiation
      (UVB) on platelet-activating factor (PAF) and MVP production have long been part of the PI's
      research experience. To test this, the investigator plans to enroll up to enroll up to 12
      male subjects whom are aged 21 to age 45. These subjects will be treated with topical
      5-aminolevulinic acid gel (Ameluz) to small areas of forearm followed by treatment with blue
      light. The areas will then be treated with either 4% imipramine cream or cream base as
      control. Four hours later, the redness of the areas will be measured using a mexameter and
      MVPs measured in skin biopsies taken from PDT-treated skin.

    <measure>Change in Skin Pain From Baseline Due to Photodynamic Therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 2</time_frame>
    <description>PI will assess change with the Skin Pain Visual Analogue Scale. Participants indicate the overall severity of skin pain from the photodynamic therapy treatment at the present time by placing a single mark on the horizontal scale (0 = no skin pain to 10 = severe skin pain)</description>

    <measure>Change in Itch From Baseline Due to Photodynamic Therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 2</time_frame>
    <description>PI will assess change with the Itch Numerical Scale. Participants will rate itching severity due to photodynamic therapy treatment by circling the number that best describes the worst level of itching in the past 24 hours. (0 = No itch to 10 = Worst itch imaginable)</description>
