  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to test the safety and preliminary efficacy of staged
      bilateral subthalamotomy performed using the ExAblate Transcranial System for the treatment
      of Parkinson's disease (PD) motor features

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the incidence and severity of adverse events
      (AE/AEs) associated with ExAblate Transcranial Magnetic Resonance Guided Focused Ultrasound
      (MRgFUS) bilateral staged subthalamotomy for the treatment of PD motor features. To determine
      the effectiveness of the ExAblate Transcranial staged bilateral subthalamotomy to treat
      cardinal motor features of subjects with PD.
