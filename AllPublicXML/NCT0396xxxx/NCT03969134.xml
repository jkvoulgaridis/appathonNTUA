    <textblock>
      This trial is designed to assess the therapeutic efficacy and safety of CHAd63-KH, a new
      candidate Leishmania vaccine, in patients with persistent PKDL. 100 participants will be
      randomly assigned (50 participants in each arm) to receive placebo or ChAd63-KH 7.5
      x10(10)vp. Doses will be administered at a single time point.

      This study is a randomised, double blinded, placebo controlled trial designed to assess the
      therapeutic efficacy and safety of CHAd63-KH, a new candidate Leishmania vaccine, in patients
      with persistent PKDL. 100 participants will be randomly assigned (50 participants in each
      arm) to receive placebo or ChAd63-KH 7.5 x10(10)vp intramuscular injection into the deltoid
      region. Doses will be administered at a single time point. Volunteers aged between 12-50
      years with persistent PKDL will be recruited at Professor El-Hassan's Centre for Tropical
      Medicine, Dooka, Gedarif State, Sudan, and will be followed up for 120 days after the dosing
      visit. The trial is planned to run for 24 months.

      Secondary objectives are as follows:

        1. To compare the humoral and cellular immune responses generated by the candidate vaccine
           in patients with persistent PKDL.

        2. To observe any clinical changes in the cutaneous PKDL disease over a 120 day period
           following vaccination

    <masking_description>Fifty volunteers receive a single intramuscular dose of ChAd63 KH 7.5x1010vp and 50 placebo. Investigators and the participant will be blinded. A pharmacist and nurse will prepare the injections. There will be stratification between patients aged 12-17, and patients aged 18-50, to ensure balanced randomisation. The pharmacist will be told which age strata the patient is in by a nurse, and will prepare the injection with the study nurse. There will be two series of sealed envelopes, one for each of the adolescent and adult cohorts. These envelopes will have external labelling, with the cohort, and successive cohort patient numbering. Each envelope contains randomisation to VACCINE or SALINE. The vaccine and placebo injections will be prepared in blacked-out syringes labelled with patient cohort number. The study nurse will take the prepared injection to the clinical team for administration. The syringe will be further labelled with the patient's initials, date and time of injection.</masking_description>
