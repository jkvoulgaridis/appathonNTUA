    <textblock>
      Sarcopenia on lumbar paraspinal muscles is receiving renewed attention as a cause of spinal
      degeneration. However, there are few studies on the precise concept and diagnostic criteria
      for spinal sarcopenia. Here, we develop the concept of spinal sarcopenia in
      community-dwelling healthy elderly people. In addition, we aim to observe the natural aging
      course of paraspinal muscle and back muscle strength, and investigate the association between
      conventional sarcopenic indices and spinal sarcopenia.

      This is a prospective observational cohort study with 120 healthy community-dwelling elderly
      people for 4 years. All subjects will be recruited according to no sarcopenia, possible
      sarcopenia, sarcopenia, and severe sarcopenia groups. The primary outcomes of this study are
      isokinetic back muscle strength and lumbar paraspinal muscle quantity and quality using
      lumbar spine MRI. Conventional sarcopenic indices and spine specific outcomes such as spinal
      sagittal balance, back performance scale, and Sorenson test will be also assessed. The data
      will be analysed using the intention-to-treat principle.

      This is a prospective observational cohort study with 120 healthy community-dwelling elderly
      people in a single center (SMG-SNU Boramae Medical Center). Individual follow-up will last 4
      years. Elderly people (â‰¥ 65 years old) who are community-dwellers and able to walk with or
      without assistive devices) will be included. Sarcopenia can be divided by two stages: 1)
      possible sarcopenia (PS) defined by low handgrip strength and/or low gait speed and 2)
      sarcopenia (SA) confirmed by low handgrip strength and/or low gait speed and low muscle mass
      by the consensus report of the Asian working group for sarcopenia. No sarcopenia (NS) group
      is added to this classification, and the study participants are classified into three groups
      (NS, PS, and SA) after the screening tests. All outcome variables will be collected at
      baseline, 2 and 4 years. However, L-S spine MRI for lumbar paraspinal muscle quantity and
      quality will be performed only at baseline.

      Data will be collected using a standardised data entry form and entered into the data
      management system. The intention-to-treat principle will be used for data analysis.
      Participant characteristics will be described using means and standard deviations for
      continuous data and frequencies and percentages for categorical data. The three groups will
      be compared using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) or the non-parametric equivalence
      Kruskal-Wallis test if required. To compare paired data (intra-group) between two different
      points, we will use repeated-measures ANOVA and Friedman tests for continuous and
      non-parametric data, respectively.
