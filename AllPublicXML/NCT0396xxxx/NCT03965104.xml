    <textblock>
      This study will assess the impact of a hypertension management certification program for
      community pharmacists on the blood pressure control of patients managed by the pharmacists
      enrolled. The investigators will compare the systolic blood pressure of patients identified
      to have hypertension in the community that are followed by pharmacists who have undergone the
      certification course, and compare their blood pressure outcomes to subjects managed by
      pharmacists who have not yet received the training.

    <textblock>
      Hypertension Canada proposes the first &quot;Hypertension Canada Professional Certification
      Program&quot;(HC-PCP), specifically designed for Alberta pharmacists, to provide care and support
      to those at risk for or living with hypertension. Through this program, the investigators
      hope to help with prevention of the costly and chronic conditions to which hypertension often
      leads, like kidney failure, stroke, and heart disease.

      The HC-PCP aims to provide training to pharmacists in the screening, prevention, and
      management of hypertension. It has been identified that the development and implementation of
      this certification program provides a unique opportunity to evaluate the impact of such a
      program on blood pressure reduction.

      The investigators are aiming to assess the impact of pharmacist management on blood pressure
      control in patients with hypertension.

      The development of the HC-PCP and the evaluation of its impact will occur in 2 phases. Phase
      1 involves the development and implementation of the educational portion of the certification
      program. Phase 2 involves conducting a 1 year long study to assess the impact of the HC-PCP
      on blood pressure in patients with poorly controlled hypertension. This will be launched in
      pharmacies in Alberta.

    <masking_description>By necessity, pharmacists in the intervention groups cannot be blinded. However, pharmacists will not be told about the cluster randomization, just that they will be contacted about when they will receive the HC-PCP. During the control period, pharmacists will be told that their patients will be enrolled in an observational hypertension registry to prepare for the intervention phase.</masking_description>
