    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to further evaluate eye movements as an aid in the diagnosis
      of concussion / mTBI and the utility of eye movement assessment in the monitoring of symptoms
      over time after an initial diagnosis of concussion.

    <description>The EyeBOX medical device tracks a patient's eye movement and calculates a BOX Score ranging from 0-20. The BOX score is interpreted as a binary classification for eye movement abnormalities, where anything equal to or greater than 10 is a positive result for the initial evaluation of concussion and everything below 10 is negative.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Provide written informed consent or assent along with guardian consent.

          2. Have sustained a suspected direct or indirect force to the head with or without
             documented loss of consciousness, memory loss, alteration in consciousness or
             neurologic deficits. Only individuals presenting for initial evaluation of concussion
             may be enrolled, however longitudinal assessments may be conducted on enrolled
             subjects.

          3. Have the ability to provide a complete ophthalmologic, medical and neurologic history
             as well as report medications/drugs/alcohol consumed within the 24 hours prior to
             tracking.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Have penetrating trauma.

          2. Have had a conventional head CT or MRI demonstrating evidence of structural brain
             injury (subdural, epidural or intraparenchymal hemorrhage, edema/mass effect per
             attending radiologist read).

          3. Either of the following conditions, immediately related to the incident head trauma:
             loss of consciousness exceeding 30 minutes or best available GCS score less than 13
             within 24 hours.

          4. Be blind (no light perception), have missing or non-functional eyes.

          5. Be unable to open their eyes.

          6. Have a history of unresolved strabismus, diplopia, amblyopia.

          7. Have a history of unresolved cranial nerve III, IV, or VI palsy.

          8. Have a history of unresolved macular edema, retinal degeneration, extensive cataract,
             or ocular globe disruption.

          9. Have a history of extensive prior eye surgery (examples include strabismus surgery,
             scleral buckle repair of retinal detachment, repair of blow out fractures of the orbit
             and any procedures that would interfere with extraocular muscle movements; prior
             cataract surgery or Lasik are not exclusions) or scarring.

         10. Have a prior history of unresolved ocular-motor dysfunctions.

         11. Be intoxicated.
