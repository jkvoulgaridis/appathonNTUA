    <textblock>
      Early mobilization is considered as an important strategy to enhance postoperative recovery.
      However, direct association between very early mobilization and improved recovery needs
      randomized control trials to prove. This study proposes the program of walking out from
      operating room (WOFOR) after surgery, which means that encouraging patients to walk out from
      the operating room and return to the ward by walking under the condition of painlessness,
      clear consciousness and normal muscle strength of lower limb. The aim of this randomized
      controlled trial is to investigate the effect of WOFOR on the postoperative recovery of
      patients undergoing laparoscopic total and partial nephrectomy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative bed rest increases the risk of complications such as thromboembolism and
      intestinal adhesion. Encouraging early mobilization after surgery should be important,
      although actual effects of early mobilization still need randomized control trails to prove.
      The aim of this randomized controlled trial is to investigate the effect of walking out from
      operating room (very early mobilization after surgery) on the postoperative recovery of
      patients undergoing laparoscopic total and partial nephrectomy.

      A sample size of 91 patients in each group will be selected by a prior power analysis on the
      basis of the following assumptions: (1) an absolute reduction in the length of the hospital
      stay by 1 day, (2) standard deviation 2 days, (3) α=0.05, (4) power 90% and .(5) missed
      follow-up rate 5%.

      Patients will receive written and verbal information about the trial before written consent
      is obtained. The randomization will take place before the day of the surgery and the patients
      will be assigned to either intervention (return to ward by walking) or control group (return
      to ward by lying on the transporting bed ). A stratified randomization with three factors
      including sex, disease character and age will be performed to ensure an even spread. The
      randomization is performed using concealed allocation where envelopes are prepared externally
      using a randomization list prepared by a statistician.

      The patients will receive general anesthesia combined with epidural analgesia. After surgery,
      the patients will be evaluated whether fulfilling the criteria for mobilization including
      stable physiological parameters, consciousness, normal level of orientation and muscle
      strength, and painlessness every ten minutes. If patients fulfill the criteria, they will
      receive different methods of returning to the ward based on the grouping. In the control
      group, the patient will return to the ward by lying on the transporting bed. In the
      intervention group, the patients will be raised to a sitting position for five minutes. If
      the patients do not complain any discomfort and have stable physiological parameters, they
      will be encouraged to stand. If standing do not cause any discomfort, they will be encouraged
      to walk within the range of 5-meter long and 60-centimeter wide. If patients can walk within
      the range, they will return to the surgical ward by walking under the protection of medical
      staffs.

      Then, all study patients will be subject to the same management such as the guidance of drink
      and diet recovery, the guidance of mobilization in the ward (the duration and distance of
      walking in the ward will be recorded every day), nutrition supplement after surgery, and the
      criteria of drainage removal and hospital discharge. The outcomes such as the length of
      hospital stay after surgery will be recorded and analyzed to evaluate the effects of walking
      out from the operating room. The analysis of Intention-to-treat and Per-protocol-sets will be
      both performed by statisticians.

Briefly, no PONV is defined as the absence of any emetic symptoms and nausea during the entire study period. Mild PONV is defined as the occurrence of mild nausea or one episode of vomiting if caused by an exogenous stimulus such as drinking or movement. Moderate PONV is reached when the patient vomits up to 2 times or experiences nausea that requires a rescue antiemetic therapy only once. Severe PONV is reached if the patient suffers more than two emetic episodes or needs more than one dose of a rescue antiemetic drugs.</description>
