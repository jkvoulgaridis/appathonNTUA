  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder who begin around 55 years old,
      characterized by brain's backmatter's dopamine neuron destruction, involved in motor control.
      Diagnosis is made with presence of 3 of 4 disease's cardinal sign: bradykinesia, rigidity,
      resting tremor, walking troubles. Treatments enhance patient's quality of life, but do not
      allow to stop disease's evolution, who is specific depending on a lot of factors. For some
      years, PD's non motor symptoms (NMS) - in particular pain, anxiety, depression, sleep
      disorders - have been highlighted and turn out to impair sometimes quality of life even
      though motor symptoms are controlled. This project's main aim is to evaluate if aquatic
      environment's care lead to an advantage on PD's NMS, symptoms currently underestimated,
      insufficiently in care and having a harmful influence on quality of life. Collaboration of
      the University Hospital (Neurology Dpt), the Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Regional
      Institute, Grand Nancy Thermal, and France Parkinson Association, will allow in this way to
      offer on PD's NMS, postural control impairments, and walking troubles an alternative or
      further non-pharmacological therapy.

    <description>Entropy mathematically evaluates the displacements regularity of the Center of Foot Pressure (CoP). If the CoP displacements are regular (lower entropy), intentionally processes are more implicated in postural control regulation. If the CoP displacements are not regular (higher entropy), automatic processes are more implicated in postural control regulation. Entropy comparison between a single and a dual task is analyzed.</description>

    <description>Rehabilitation sessions using hydrophysiotherapy will occur in a pool of Grand Nancy Thermal, three times per week during 4 weeks, and each will last 45 min. They will begin with 10 min of warm-up, then 30 min of walking. Sessions will end cool-down during 5 min, which will be a reduction of intensity every 30 sec. Rehabilitation will be carried out by physiotherapist chosen for the study.</description>

    <description>Rehabilitation sessions on treadmill will occur at Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Regional Institute (IRR), on the University Hospital's site, three times per week during 4 weeks, and each will last 45 min. They will begin with 10 min of warm-up, then 30 min of walking, where intensity of effort can be modulated by speed and inclination of treadmill. Sessions will end cool-down during 5 min, which will be a reduction of intensity every 30 sec. Rehabilitation will be carried out by physiotherapist chosen for the study.</description>

    <description>Conventional rehabilitation sessions will occur in private practices in which patients receive their habitual care (same physiotherapist). This care will be guided by prescription delivered by the neurologist. This prescription suggests to work on active and passive upper and lower limb stretching, on hip and shoulder dissociation, and balance control management on unstable ground.</description>
