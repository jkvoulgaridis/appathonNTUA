  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of COLOQUAL study is to demonstrate the superiority of analgesic effect
      of a bilateral quadratus lumborum block (QLB), performed at the end of laparoscopic
      colorectal surgery, compared to standard of care.

      The investigators hypothesized that a bilateral quadratus lumborum block performed at the end
      of laparoscopic colorectal surgery would reduce the incidence of post operative pain, time
      spent in recovery room, improve patient's satisfaction, and reduce hospitalisation time

      Visits:

        -  The patient will arrive in the department the day before the surgical intervention
           (Day-1). During this preoperative visit (Day-1), the investigator

             -  will preselect potentially eligible patients

             -  will offer to participate to this study

             -  will give the notice form to the patients

             -  will present the research: objectives, benefits and constraints for the patients

        -  The intervention day (Day 0):

      The investigator will collect the signed consent form after having ascertained the
      understanding of the notice form by the patient and checking the inclusion and non-inclusion
      criteria.

      The randomization will be done via the eCRF module (allocation group and number) and the
      preoperative data registration in the eCRF.

      Surgical Intervention (Day 1):

      All patients will receive standard anaesthesia using sufentanyl, propopol, cisatracurium and
      sevoflurane. Prevention of nausea and vomiting is performing using Apfel score. Anti
      microbial prophylaxis is performed according recommendations.

      All patients will receive post operative multimodal analgesia using intravenous lidocaine,
      acetaminophene, ketaminophene, and morphine if NRS (numerating rating scale) &gt; 3 At the end
      of the surgery, patients in the experimental group will receive a bilateral ultrasound guided
      quadratus lumborum block with 15 ml of 3,75 mg/mg of ropivacaine. Patients in the control
      group will not receive the block

Experimental group: patients receiving a general anaesthesia with propofol, sufentanyl and cisatracurium for the induction, and sevoflurane, sufentanyl and cisatracurium for the maintenance.

In this group, a bilateral quadratus lumborum block, using 20 ml of ropivacaine 3, 75 mg/ml is performed at the end of surgery, using ultrasound guidance.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Bilateral Quatratus lumborum block is performed with ultra sound guidance. The high frequency probe is placed right to the umbilicus, and slips laterally to the side to block. It allows showing the three belts of larges muscles of abdomen (External Oblicum, internal oblicum, and transversal of the abdomen). Laterally, these three are merging to from fascia transversalis. Under fascia transversalis, we can see quadratus lumborum muscle. Punction point in lateral, 1cm in the plan separating quadratus lumborum block and fascia transversalis
20 ml of ropivaca√Øne 3.75mg/ml are injected after aspiration test. If in doubt, hydro localisation car be realised.</description>
