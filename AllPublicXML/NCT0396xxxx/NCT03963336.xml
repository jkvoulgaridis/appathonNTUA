  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a syndrome characterized by elevated
      intracranial pressure (ICP) of unknown etiology.

      The investigators aim to study the quantitative D-dimer level and the role of anticoagulant
      therapy in the absence of occlusive sinus thrombosis in IIH patients.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      24 patients with IIH according to the modified Dandy criteria were enrolled. Headache impact
      test (HIT6), ophthalmological assessment including Frisen classification for papilledema,
      visual acuity, visual field by perimetry, and visual evoked potentials were performed to the
      patients.

      Serum quantitative D-dimer level was measured using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
      (ELISA) technique for the patients and for 24 healthy matched controls.

      Patients were divided into two groups: group (A) received acetazolamide and low molecular
      weight heparin (LMWH) in a prophylactic dose for 2 weeks while group (B) received
      acetazolamide only. Both groups continued the acetazolamide 1-2g/day for 6 months.

      The investigators followed-up the patients after one and six months later through the HIT6
      test and the ophthalmological assessment.
