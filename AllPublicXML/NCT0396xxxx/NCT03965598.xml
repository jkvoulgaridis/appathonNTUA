  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Considering the complex pathological mechanism and the poor treatment outcomes of
      schizophrenia, early detection and intervention gradually become the key work for the
      foundational and clinical research in schizophrenia. Ultra-high risk for psychosis (UHP) is
      defined as individuals at the prodromal stage of schizophrenia. Early intervention in
      individual at UHP can effectively delay or even prevent the development of the illness.
      Long-term longitudinal studies suggested that there are clinical outcomes in people at UHP.
      Nearly 1/3 of individuals at UHP may be naturally relieved without any intervention, about
      1/3 of individuals at UHP will remain at the prodromal stage of schizophrenia, and only 1/3
      individuals at UHP will eventually develop schizophrenia. In this regard, it will cause
      adverse effects on false positive individuals if they accept clinical intervention.
      Unfortunately, it is difficult to accurately predict which individuals at UHP will make a
      transition to frank illness. To solve this issue, we explore the association between baseline
      brain structural and functional networks, methylation modifications, gene expression,
      neurocognitive function and the clinical outcomes of UHP individuals, and to identify the
      potential biological and clinical predictors for the long-term outcomes in the individuals at
      UHP. In addition, we also detect the changes of brain structure and function, methylation
      status and gene expression in individuals at UHP during follow-up, and further to investigate
      the etiology and pathogenesis of schizophrenia.

    <description>Conversion is operationalized as the criteria of POPS (Presence of Psychotic Symptoms in SIPS/SOPS). Subjects have to demonstrate at least one psychotic level symptom (rated a '6') on at least one of the five P(Positive) symptoms (P1, unusual thought content; P2, suspiciousness; P3, grandiosity; P4, perceptual abnormalities; and P5, disorganized communication), with either sufficient frequency and duration or at a level that is disorganizing or dangerous.</description>
