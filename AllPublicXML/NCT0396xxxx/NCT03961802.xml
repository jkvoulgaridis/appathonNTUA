      Pre-inclusion: information, collection of consent, collection of antecedents and biometric
      data, clinical examination (goniometric measurement and visual analogic scale of pain),
      collection of DASH, EORTC QLQ-C30 and H&amp;N35 questionnaires.

      Surgical intervention (J0) and randomization into 2 groups:

      Group 1 - systematic early rehabilitation Group 2 - without systematic rehabilitation

      M3, M6, M12: collection of complications, adjuvant treatments, number of physiotherapy
      sessions performed, clinical examination (goniometric measurement and visual analogic scale
      of pain), collection of DASH, EORTC QLQ- C30 and H&amp;N35 questionnaires.

    <measure>goniometric measurement of flexion and abduction of the shoulder</measure>
    <time_frame>3, 6 and 12 months postoperatively (M3, M6 and M12)</time_frame>
    <description>Goniometric measurement will be performed using a Rippstein's Plurimeter, with standardized position and movement for each measurement:
Sitting on a chair, the bust is straight, arm hanging down the body.
The plurimeter is placed on the distal part of the arm.
The flexion is in the sagittal plane around a transverse axis in the frontal plane.
The abduction is in the frontal plane around an anteroposterior axis contained in the sagittal plane.</description>
