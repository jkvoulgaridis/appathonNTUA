    <textblock>
      Regular physical activity (PA) is a key element in the success of bariatric surgery and the
      prevention of complications associated with frequent co-morbidities. However, the levels of
      PA observed in patients who will benefit from bariatric surgery are generally low, and many
      patients do not comply with the recommendations of their course in terms of PA. It is
      envisaged that coaching interventions and adapted programs can improve the level of PA. The
      objective of this pilot study is to evaluate the effectiveness and adherence to digital tools
      on the level of PA in preparation for bariatric surgery.

    <description>The STIMUL Group participants in the Adaptive Physical Activity Focus (APA) program receive access to an online digital Platform, as well as a starter kit consisting of a connected pedometer measuring several physical activity indicators including the number of steps, number of so-called active minutes, sleep time, and distance travelled; a tape measure and a starter guide. They then conduct a remote assessment and motivational interview by videoconference or telephone, followed by 15-20 minute support interviews (month 1, month 3, month 6). Between these interviews, during months 1, 2, and 3, participants exchange weekly written messages with an educator on their platform. A planner of their physical activity objectives is provided.</description>
