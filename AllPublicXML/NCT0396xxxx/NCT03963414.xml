  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase I, multicenter, study is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      durvalumab (anti-programmed death-ligand 1 [PD-L1] antibody) and tremelimumab (anti-cytotoxic
      T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 [CTLA-4] antibody) in combination with intravenous (IV)
      carboplatin plus (+) etoposide in treatment naïve patients with extensive-stage small cell
      lung cancer (ES-SCLC) and performance status 2 (PS2). Eighteen patients with untreated
      ES-SCLC and PS2 will be enrolled. Cohort 1, which includes the first 6 subjects, will receive
      IV carboplatin and etoposide Q 3 weeks x 4 cycles. Durvalumab 1500 mg IV Q 3 weeks will be
      given with chemotherapy during cycles 3 and 4. This will be followed by durvalumab 1500 mg IV
      Q 4 weeks until disease progression. If 2 out of 6 patients have dose-limiting toxicities,
      then the study will be closed. Cohort 2, which will include 12 additional subjects, will
      receive chemotherapy Q 3 weeks x 4 cycles. Durvalumab 1500 mg IV + tremelimumab 75 mg IV Q 3
      weeks will be given with chemotherapy during cycles 3 and 4, then durvalumab 1500 mg +
      tremelimumab 75 mg will be administered Q 3 weeks during cycles 5 and 6. This will be
      followed by durvalumab 1500 mg IV Q 4 weeks until disease progression.
