    <textblock>
      Skin aging is a complex biological process.The physiological changes associated with aging of
      the skin are manifested in xerosis, dramatic loss of skin elasticity due to damage to
      collagen and elastin fibers; as well as barrier function, modification of rhytides and
      deficiencies in the regenerative property of the skin. All of which ultimately result in
      thinning of the skin, malar fat atrophy and pigmentary changes. Autologous fat grafting or
      lipo injection containing stromal vascular fraction (SVF) acts like ideal soft tissue filler
      for facial filling and rejuvenation. It leads to progressive improvement of the skin texture,
      elasticity, and color over a few months, therefore adipose tissue seems to be not only a
      simple filler but also a dynamic filler with two types of different and supplementary
      effects, the volumetric effect and the regenerative effect.Cell assisted lipotransfer (CAL)
      is a technique that combines aspirated fat with concentrated ADSCs in the stromal vascular
      fraction (SVF) of the lipoaspirate. This technique could enhance the survival rate of the
      transplanted fat and leads to better cosmetic improvement

    <description>Under local anesthesia using strict aseptic technique, a small incision will be done in the lateral aspect of the thigh or lower abdomen, through which the infiltration cannula will be introduced to inject the local anesthetic solution using the wet technique. This will be followed 15 minutes later by lipo-aspiration of 75 ml fat ) using a blunt tipped cannula under the negative suction pressure of a 60 ml syringe. 50 ml is used for preparation of microfat. then with blunt cannula,subcutaneous injection of the required volume of microfat is placed into temporal region.</description>
