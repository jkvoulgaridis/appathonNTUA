  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The first week after a stroke is a particularly important time, as improving blood flow may
      limit secondary ischaemic damage to the brain and help reduce the overall burden neurological
      injury and future disability.

      Small studies in patients with stroke have shown that moderate aerobic exercise increases
      blood flow to the brain, however, no studies have evaluated the safety of aerobic exercise
      within the first week after stroke, nor whether it results in changes to cerebral blood flow.

      Remote ischaemic conditioning (RIC) is when ischaemia is induced to a limb for short periods
      of time by inflating pressure cuffs around arms or legs to above systolic pressures (mmHg).
      This procedure is performed for periods that avoid physical injury to the limbs, but induce
      neurohormonal, systemic or vascular changes in the body. These changes often result in
      improved blood supply to various areas of the body. The use of RIC in the acute period after
      stroke is currently being investigated in a number of large randomised controlled trials e.g.
      RECAST, RESIST, however, our understanding of how RIC actually works is incomplete.
      Importantly, there is scarce data on the acute effects of RIC on cerebral blood flow (CBF), a
      potentially pivotal mechanism behind its effects.

      We propose an exploratory study to evaluate whether it is feasible, acceptable and safe to
      undertake low and moderate intensity aerobic exercise or remote ischaemic conditioning (RIC)
      in patients during the acute period after stroke, and whether either of these interventions
      result in changes to cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFv) in the major cerebral arteries. We
      will compare any changes to those in a cohort of healthy volunteers.

    <description>Patients will undergo 4 cycles of upper limb RIC using a blood pressure cuff. Each cycle will involve inflating the blood pressure cuff to 200 mmHg for five minutes around the upper arm, followed by a period of relaxation of the cuff for a further 5 minutes. The total RIC treatment time will take 40 minutes.</description>
