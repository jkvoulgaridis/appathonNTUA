  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to explore the safety and outcome of lymph drainage mapping(LDM) to
      individually tailor the elective nodal irradiation (ENI) to the ipsilateral neck only. The
      goal is to exclude the contralateral negative neck from the irradiation fields when there is
      no contralateral draining sentinel node. In case contralateral lymph drainage is found on
      SPECT/CT, a contralateral sentinel node procedure (SNP) is performed to remove the draining
      node. The patient will only receive contralateral ENI if (micro/macro)metastasis are found in
      this contralateral sentinel node.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The SUSPECT2 study is a modified concept from the first SUSPECT study (N14SUS). The first
      study investigated whether lymph drainage mapping (LDM) using SPECT/CT was a safe and
      feasible method to exclude the contralateral neck from irradiation, or, in case of
      contralateral lymph drainage, to tailor the contralateral ENI field to the level containing
      the tracer accumulation. In this study, large dose reductions to most organs at risk were
      realized, as well as significant reductions of both short term (mucositis, dysphagia) and
      long term (xerostomia, dysphagia) toxicities.

      Firstly, the SUSPECT2 study aims to expand the inclusion criteria of the original SUSPECT
      study. Secondly, it aims to further reduce the proportion of patients that undergoes
      bilateral ENI, by performing a contralateral sentinel node procedure (SNP) in case of
      contralateral lymph drainage. The patient will only receive contralateral ENI if
      (micro/macro)metastasis are found in this contralateral sentinel node.

    <description>After injection of nanocolloid tracer submucosally around the tumor, patients undergo lymph drainage mapping (LDM) using SPECT/CT. If no contralateral drainage is visualized, the patient receives unilateral elective nodal irradiation (ENI). In case of contralateral lymph drainage, a contralateral sentinel node procedure is performed. If pathologic evaluation finds no metastasis, the patient receives unilateral ENI. If (micro/macro) metastasis are found, the patient will receive bilateral ENI.</description>
