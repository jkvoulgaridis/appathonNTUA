  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy AtEase, a pain
      self-management app in a sample of Veterans with chronic musculoskeletal pain. The primary
      outcome is changes in PEG scores from baseline to final follow-up (12 months).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this project are to develop and examine the effectiveness of a
      mobile app (AtEase) that is designed to provide tailored behavior change guidance to promote
      pain self-management, healthy sleep habits, and effective stress management in a randomized
      clinical trial including 262 Veterans with chronic pain.

      Veterans will be recruited from VA Connecticut Healthcare, as well as from numerous diverse
      community recruitment channels (including employers, community groups that provide services
      for Veterans, Student Veterans of America, and social media).

      Eligible Veterans will be randomized to receive access to AtEase or the comparison
      intervention (a mobile-optimized adaptation of Chronic Pain Education for Veterans) for a
      total of 6 months. AtEase is a tailored pain self-management mobile app that tailors
      participant's feedback based on readiness to engage in pain self-management and preference
      for self-management strategies. Chronic Pain Education for Veterans is a free VA-endorsed
      publicly available pain management online educational curriculum that provides
      cognitive-behavioral therapy-based pain self-management materials.

      Between the baseline assessment and the 6-month follow up assessment, participants will have
      unlimited access AtEase or the Chronic Pain Education for Veterans program. All participants
      will complete follow-up assessments at 6 months and 12-months post-baseline.

      The primary outcome will be a comparison of PEG scores at 12 months follow-up. Secondary
      outcomes will include pain,Global Impression of Change; readiness to self-manage pain, manage
      stress, and engage in healthy sleep habits; well-being; and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder
      Checklist scores.

    <intervention_model_description>This study involves a 2-group X 3 occasion randomized trial that will examine whether AtEase produces more significant improvements in PEG scores (which reflect total pain intensity and pain interference) than a comparison intervention (i.e., an existing online pain self-management intervention entitled Chronic Pain Education for Veterans).</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>PEG</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PEG is a multi-dimensional three-item assessment that measures average pain rating, as well as both emotional and physical functioning.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Global Impression of Change</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Global Impression of Change scale is recommended43 as a core outcome measure in pain studies. It is a single item that asks participants to describe any change in their condition as a result of using the program. Response options range from 1 = No change (or condition has gotten worse) to 7 = A great deal better, and a considerable improvement that has made all the difference.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Level</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Level of pain will also be assessed by asking participants to rate their pain 1) right now, 2) usual level of pain in the last week, 3) best level of pain in the last week, and 4) worst level of pain in the last week. All ratings are on a scale of 0-10, with zero equal to no pain, and 10 equal to worst pain.</description>

    <measure>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Checklist (PCL-5)</measure>

    <description>PTSD symptoms will be measured using the 20-item PCL-5, which assesses the 20 symptoms of PTSD.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Well-Being</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Well-being will be assessed using the Cantril Self-Anchoring Scale, which asks participants to imagine a ladder with steps numbered from 0 to 10, with the top representing the best possible life and the bottom representing the worst possible life. Participants indicate where they feel their life falls currently and where it will fall in five years.</description>
