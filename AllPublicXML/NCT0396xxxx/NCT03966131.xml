  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project aims to assess the effect of a complete denture of new denture wearers on speech
      production using sensors placed inside a duplicate of the prosthesis according to the
      technique described in the PRESLA system. Secondly, it aims to assess the effect of a
      complete denture on swallowing for these new denture wearers. Thirdly it aims to describe a
      precise mapping of the mechanical pressures exerted by the tongue on the palate of complete
      denture user, been used in wearing denture, during speaking and swallowing. The experiments
      will take place in the department of treatments and dental consultations of the Hospices
      Civils de Lyon (Faculty of Odontology, Lyon, France).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The evaluation of speech production is based on the characteristics of the pressure signal
      (time and frequency) and the acoustic signal after synchronization during time using
      duplicate with up to 8 sensors.

      To reach the first objective, the investigators will focus on the patients who wear new
      complete denture during the first session of recording. They will first analyze the
      characteristics of the acoustic and pressure signals of the production of consonants. They
      shall select from 8 sensors, 3 sensors for the inferential analysis: a previous sensor in the
      alveolar zone, a median sensor in the palatal zone and a posterior sensor in the palatal area
      (on the border of the beginning of the soft palate). These 3 sensors will be selected on the
      basis of the amplitude of the variations of pressure during the task. This sensor's triplet
      will be specific to every patient. The investigators shall thus have after 3 sensors called:
      previous, median, posterior. They shall do, for every sensor's measurements and for the
      acoustic measures, an inferential statistical analysis based on one model shelf spaces
      generalized in mixed effects, in which the variable to be explained will be one of moderate
      variables, the fixed effects will be the session (just after wearing the prosthesis for the
      first time, 3 weeks later, 3 months later), the consonant, the index of the sensor (1 - 3,
      from the front to the back) and the index of the repetition (from 1 to 15), and where the
      random effect will be the patient.
