  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood and is a leading cause of emergency
      medical treatment. For children experiencing an asthma exacerbation, emergency department
      (ED) guidelines recommend early systemic corticosteroid (CS) administration, since studies
      have shown associated, time-sensitive, decreases in hospital admissions and ED length-of-stay
      (LOS). For patients who are treated by 911 emergency medical services (EMS) first, there
      exists an opportunity for even earlier administration of CS, prior to ED arrival. Yet,
      preliminary data demonstrate that currently less than 10% of EMS pediatric asthma patients
      receive CS prior to ED arrival.

      Given the known time-sensitivity of CS' effects on patient outcomes, the investigators
      hypothesize that even earlier EMS administration of CS will decrease hospital admissions, ED
      LOS, and intensive care unit admissions for pediatric patients with an acute asthma
      exacerbation. Using a pragmatic observation stepped wedge design in both Lee County EMS and
      Nassau County Fire Rescue Department, we will enroll between 300-500 patients over a
      three-year period o analyze clinical outcomes and comparative costs of EMS CS administration,
      and how both are influenced by EMS transport time. That novel combination of analyses will
      help build evidence-based guidelines adaptable for diverse EMS agencies nationwide.

    <description>During a sequenced rollout protocol change for Lee County EMS, certain ambulance stations who are randomized to early adoption of an upcoming protocol change will administer prednisolone to children with asthma attacks in the prehospital environment prior to ED arrival. Ambulance randomized to later protocol adoption will continue usual care, until the end of the study when all ambulance stations adopt the new protocol with early administration of prednisolone</description>
