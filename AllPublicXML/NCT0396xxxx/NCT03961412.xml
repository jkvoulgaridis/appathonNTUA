  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out the impact of the involvement of an influential
      person(s) (e.g., spouse, partners, parents, children, friends) on Pap test screening
      intention and behaviors, Pap test self-efficacy, and perceived benefits and barriers to Pap
      test screening among Chinese American immigrant women. These data specific to the impact of
      the involvement of an influential person on Pap test screening could be used to develop
      successful cancer prevention programs that target the specific needs of Chinese populations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The importance of the support from family, spouse, friends, or significant others has been
      noted among Chinese American immigrant women (CAIW), but little attention has been paid to
      the effects of family-based (FB) interventions, especially for cervical cancer screening.
      Understanding the role of CAIW's family in promoting Pap screening and other influences can
      lead to the creation of more culturally appropriate screening interventions. The objective of
      this study is to test the effects of a FB intervention on Pap test intention and behaviors,
      Pap test self-efficacy, and perceived benefits and barriers to Pap tests among under-screened
      CAIW aged 21-65. This pilot test of the FB intervention will be conducted using a randomized
      controlled design with two groups only, experimental and control groups. Interventions will
      be delivered by bilingual and bicultural CAIW trained facilitators. Post-test and follow-up
      telephone surveys will be conducted at 2 weeks and 6 months after the intervention.

    <description>The participants will identify their accompanying influential person(s) (e.g., spouse, partners, parents, children, friends) with whom they will be attending the 1.5-2 hour face-to-face education session on cervical cancer and screening. At the end of the intervention, time will be allowed for questions, as well as distributing fridge magnets and a pamphlet. Fridge magnets contain Pap test guidelines and availability of local clinics. The pamphlet covers the following topics: (a) information about female anatomy and cervical cancer, (b) risk factors for cervical cancer, (c) facts of cervical cancer incidence and mortality, and screening rates among American women, (d) methods to reduce cervical cancer (e.g., HPV vaccination), (e) Pap test procedure, (f) Pap test guidelines, and (g) availability of clinics and cost of Pap test. The participants will be encouraged to spread the message to family members and friends.</description>
