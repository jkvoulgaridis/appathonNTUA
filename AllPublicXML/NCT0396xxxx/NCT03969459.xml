    <textblock>
      Epidemiological studies link early exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs) with
      health consequences in the newborn. Experimental studies have shown the impact of POPs on the
      gut microbiota. This project aims to characterize the POPs content in breast milk in an
      exposed population and to evaluate the impact on breast milk composition and intestinal
      microbiota establishment in the newborn. The health consequences will be evaluated by the
      clinical follow-up of the newborn.

      Picardie is a sub-region with a young population and a high birth rate. The highlighting and
      the characterization of a maternal exhibition and the newborn will make it possible to know
      the in utero and postnatal exposure to the pesticides, and if necessary, to implement
      measures of information and prevention adapted to limit it.

      The study of pesticide exposure in the periconceptional period, ante and postnatal is crucial
      because of the vulnerability of this period to the environment and its immediate consequences
      on the health of the child but also in the long term on the development of chronic
      pathologies in adulthood. This study will allow us to assess the impact of POPs on the
      installation of the intestinal microbiota of newborn.

      100 mother-child pairs will be included in this project. Samples of 20 mL of breast milk,
      meconium and stool of newborns will be taken. Gas chromatography or liquid phase analyzes
      coupled with mass spectrometry will be carried out on breast milk to evaluate the content of
      persistent organic pollutants and to isolate them. An analysis of the chemical composition of
      each milk sample will be performed. A bacteriological study for the enumeration of the germs
      in the mother's milk on the one hand then in the meconium and the saddles of the new-born on
      the other part will be realized. The DNA of isolated and identified germs will be compared by
      molecular biology techniques to determine their identity or non-identity within the
      microbiota of breast milk, meconium and newborn stool. The impact of breast milk
      contamination by pesticides on the health of newborn will be studied
