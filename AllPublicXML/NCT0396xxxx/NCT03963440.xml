  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this work is to validate in French the questionnaire EARS, adapted to
      chronic low back pain.

      Physical exercise is often recognized as necessary for primary and secondary prevention and
      treatment of chronic diseases. This is particularly true of chronic low back pain. It is
      therefore of paramount importance that compliance with such treatment be assessed to allow
      for readjustments, as well as drug treatment. No gold standard6-7 measured patient adherence
      to exercise programs until the creation of the EARS in 2016 by E.Godfrey and his team
      (Exercise Adherence Rating Scale, literally &quot;joining physical exercise programs&quot;)

      EARS is a reliable and validated psychometric assessment questionnaire that assesses
      adherence to prescribed physical exercise in chronic low back pain.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Self-management of the patient to perform these exercises involves good collaboration with
      the care prescriber, leaving patients to manage and monitor their health. Long-term adherence
      to care programs, including physical exercise, is paramount for these patients in order to
      maintain a beneficial long-term effect, which is the case in non-specific chronic low back
      pain. However, evidence shows that compliance levels following a physical exercise
      prescription are low, limiting the benefits this could bring.

      Currently, EARS is validated for chronic low back pain in its English version. To our
      knowledge and to the knowledge of the questionnaire's author, E.Godfrey, there are no other
      studies that have examined the validation of EARS in the French language for chronic low back
      pain.

      Patients will be asked to complete a series of questionnaires after completing the
      non-opposition form. The management of non-specific chronic low back pain also requires
      evaluation through questionnaires, in accordance with the usual practices of the services
      participating in the study. No intervention will be taken.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The fears and the faiths measured by questionnaire FABQ</measure>
    <time_frame>at day 0, 15 days, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The FABQ can help predict those that have a high pain avoidance behavior. Clinically, these people may need to be supervised more than those that confront their pain.
The FABQ contains 2 scales: a work scale (FABQ-W) composed of 7 items and a physical activity scale (FABQ-PA) composed of 4 items. The two scales are scored separately. Higher FABQ scores indicate elevated fear-avoidance beliefs.
&quot;FABQ-W&quot; has a point score that ranges from 0-42 points. It can be calculated as follows: (Total points for items 6, 7, 9, 10 11, 12 and 15) = Work scale score.
&quot;FABQ-PA&quot; can range from 0-24 points. Scores are calculated as follows: (Total points for items 2, 3, 4 and 5) = Physical activity scale score.</description>

    <measure>The 14-item Beliefs and Behaviors Questionnaire (BBQ) measures beliefs, experiences and adherent behavior related with Low Back pain</measure>
    <time_frame>at day 0, 15 days, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The questionnaire consists of 14 items and each item is scored on a 5‚Äêpoint Likert agreement scale (ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree). Only nine items are used in the scoring of the questionnaire with the remaining items considered 'distracters' from which no scores are derived. Possible scores range between 9 and 45, with lower scores indicating more maladaptive or pessimistic beliefs about back pain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The knowledge of emotional state measured by questionnaire HAD</measure>
    <time_frame>at day 0, 15 days, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) is a valid and reliable self-rating scale that measures anxiety and depression in both hospital and community settings. HADS gives clinically meaningful results as a psychological screening tool and can assess the symptom severity and caseness of anxiety disorders and depression in patients with illness and the general population.
One questionnaire, comprising fourteen questions. Each item on the questionnaire is scored from 0-3 and this means that a person can score between 0 and 21 for either anxiety or depression.
Scoring :
0-7- normal, 8-10-borderling abnormal, 11-21-abnormal</description>

    <measure>Self-assessment of the incapacity, that deals with the echo on the everyday life measured by questionnaire QUEBEC</measure>
    <time_frame>at day 0, 15 days, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire is about the way your back pain is affecting your daily life. People with back problems may find it difficult to perform some of their daily activities. For each activity there is a scale of 0 to 5 :0 - &quot; not difficult at all &quot; , 1 - &quot; minimally difficult &quot; , 2 - &quot; somewhat difficult &quot; , 3 - &quot; fairly difficult &quot; , 4 - &quot; very difficult &quot; and 5 - &quot; unable to do &quot;. Minimum detectable change (90% confidence) 15 points.</description>

    <time_frame>at day 0, 15 days, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>(Exercise Therapy Burden Questionnaire), consisting of 10 items. For each activity there is a scale of 0 to 10 : 0 - not agree at all, 10 - completely agree. Some items of the ETBQ belong to side effects and others to the workload of health care. (lower score=better)</description>

    <measure>The personal efficacy by means of the questionnaire ASES &quot;Arthritis Self-Efficacy Scale&quot;</measure>
    <time_frame>at day 0, 15 days, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The ASES includes 20 questions that represent three subscales: pain, function, and other symptoms. Score ranging : from 1 to 10 (higher = greater self-efficacy).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The evaluation of the self-efficiency perceived of return in the work by means of the questionnaire RTWSE (10 items)</measure>
    <time_frame>at day 0, 15 days, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>10-item RTWSE scale with the goal of assessing self-efficacy of workers to return to work within two conceptual domains: controlling pain at work and obtaining help. For each question there is a scale of to 5: 1 - not sure at all, 5 - really sure. Higher score = better self-efficiency.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Level of physical activity measured by short questionnaire IPAQ</measure>
    <time_frame>at day 0, 15 days, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Results can be reported in categories (low activity levels, moderate activity levels or high activity levels) or as a continuous variable (MET minutes a week). Scoring a HIGH level of physical activity on the IPAQ means your physical activity levels equate to approximately one hour of activity per day or more at least a moderate intensity activity level Scoring a MODERATE level of physical activity on the IPAQ means some activity more than likely equivalent to half an hour of at least moderate intensity physical activity on most days.
Scoring a LOW level of physical activity on the IPAQ means any of the criteria for either MODERATE of HIGH levels of physical activity.</description>
