  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many people with symptomatic Osteoarthritis (OA) report chronic joint pain, especially if
      those patients are older than 50 years. In Europe OA is the most common form of chronic pain
      condition (34%) reported and entails a high economic and social burden for society. Probiotic
      treatment has been shown to promote bone metabolism, reduce pain and inflammatory responses
      of age-related musculoskeletal disorders, including OA. Gut microbiota has been proven to be
      of crucial importance in maintaining human health. However, the microbiota profile changes
      with aging, while the loss of microbiota diversity and the alterations in the optimal
      composition and quantity of beneficial microbes are believed to increase the risk of many
      diseases. Interestingly, emerging evidence leads to the hypothesis that alterations in the
      gut microbiome could also be considered as possible triggering factors in the onset of
      musculoskeletal disorders such as OA. We hypothesize that these patients with pain-OA will
      demonstrate an alteration of the gut microbiota to associated with the intensity of pain.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All subjects will have hip or knee OA according on radiographic findings
             (Kellgren-Lawrence scale ≥3) and who require and eligible for chronic, daily therapy
             with an NSAIDs to control OA sign and symptoms. A physiatrist (physician) will
             establish the diagnosis of pain-OA.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Psychiatric or neurological disorders, celiac disease, lactose intolerance, or
             allergies or other ongoing illnesses (i.e., irritable bowel syndrome, diabetes,
             ulcerative colitis, etc.) or recent antibiotic treatment (i.e., &lt;3 months before the
             beginning of the study).

          -  Participants with known hypersensitivity to celecoxib, ibuprofen, naproxen, aspirin or
             esomeprazole, etc.

          -  Participants require treatment with aspirin &gt; 325 mg /day.

          -  Participants who smoked more than 10 cigarettes per day were excluded.

          -  Participants will be excluded also if they score greater than 6 points on the Beck
             Depression Inventory (BDI) or more than 30 points in the State Trait Anxiety Inventory
             (STAI), dementia and not Italian speaking due to the high level of language skills
             required for questionnaires and quantitative sensory testing.

          -  Post-traumatic OA (e.g., fractures), congenital hip deformities, surgical
             interventions to the hip or knee, Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease, or degenerative or
             non-degenerative neurological conditions in which pain perception is altered will be
             excluded
