    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to adapt the Chalder Fatigue Scale to Turkish and to examine its
      psychometric properties in young adults. Within the scope of the study, firstly the Turkish
      version of the scale will be developed and then its reliability and validity will be examined
      in healthy young adults in Turkey.

      Fatigue is a subjective experience that can affect all individuals. It is a protective
      symptom against physical or psychological stress for healthy individuals. However, it can
      negatively affect the performance of individuals in activities of daily living. In the
      clinic, fatigue is assessed by self-reported scales. Different fatigue scales have some
      advantages and disadvantages compared to each other. Moreover, it is stated that only one
      scale cannot fully measure the fatigue of individuals in different health status, therefore
      different scales have been developed.Chalder Fatigue Scale (CFS) is an easy-to-understand,
      short, fast and useful fatigue scale that evaluates fatigue with two dimensions (physical and
      mental) and enable individuals to express perceived fatigue clearly. Psychometric properties
      of CFS have been investigated in general population and different disease groups but not in
      only healthy young adults.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The Turkish Version of the Chalder Fatigue Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>About 2-3 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Chalder Fatigue Scale has a 7-item physical fatigue subscale and 4 items of mental fatigue subscale. The scale evaluates the severity of physical and mental fatigue over the last month. Each item is scored 0-3 (0=less than usual, 3=much more than usual), yielding a total between 0 and 33.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The Turkish Version of the Checklist Individual Strength Fatigue Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>About 3-4 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The scale evaluates fatigue over the past two weeks.The questionnaire consists of 20 items with a 7-point Likert scale scoring. A total score is derived by summation of the item scores (20-140). There are four subscales; Fatigue Severity, measuring the subjective experience of fatigue (8 items); Concentration, measuring concentration problems (5 items); Motivation, measuring reduced motivation (4 items) and Activity, measuring the reduction of activities (3 items).</description>

    <measure>Visual Analog Scale to Evaluate Physical and Mental Fatigue</measure>
    <time_frame>About 1 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Self reported physical and mental fatigue severity over the last month. It is scored 0=no fatigue; 10= tired as bad as can be</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Turkish Version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index</measure>
    <time_frame>About 2-3 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The scale assesses sleep quality over a 1-month period. The questionnaire consists of 19 self-rated questions and 5 questions that should be answered by roommates. The latter questions are used only for clinical information. The 19 questions are categorized into 7 components, graded on a score that ranges from 0 to 3. The scale's components are as follows: subjective sleep quality (C1), sleep latency (C2), sleep duration (C3), habitual sleep efficiency (C4), sleep disturbances (C5), use of sleeping medication (C6) and daytime dysfunction (C7). The sum of scores for these 7 components yields one global score, which ranges from 0 to 21, where the highest score indicates worst sleep quality.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Turkish Version of the Beck Depression Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>About 4-5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>It is a 21-item self-report questionnaire for assessing the severity of depressive symptoms over past week; the items comprise four ordinal categories (from 0 through 3). Absence (or &quot;as usual&quot;) of depressive symptom in each item is scored as &quot;0&quot; and presence of symptom is scored between 1 and 3, with the higher score indicating more intense symptom severity. The possible total score ranges from 0 to 63.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Turkish Version of the Nottingham Health Profile</measure>
    <time_frame>About 4-5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The scale measures subjective health status using 38 items that assess 6 subscales (physical mobility, pain, energy level, sleep, emotional reaction and social isolation); each question answered by (yes) or (no) with each question assigned a weighted value. Scores for each section can range from 0 &quot;no problems&quot; to 100 &quot;all problems listed are present&quot; where the sum of all weighted values in a given subscale adds up to 100.</description>
