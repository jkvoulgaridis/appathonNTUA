    <textblock>
      Dacryocystorinostomy (DCR) is an operation that is indicated for lacrimal duct obstruction.
      As a result of the lacrimal duct obstruction, tears are retained over the obstacle and
      repeated lacrimal infections occur. During DCR, the lacrimal sac is opened above the
      obliterated lacrimal duct and subsequently drained into the nasal cavity. The most common
      cause of unsuccessful surgery is intranasal stoma scarring. One of the methods that can
      increase the success rate of surgery is the introduction of silicone stent into the lacrimal
      duct during DCR, so-called bicanalicular intubation of the lacrimal system. The aim of the
      study is to compare long term effectiveness of DCR with and without bicanalicular intubation.

      Dacryocystorinostomy (DCR) is an operation that is indicated for lacrimal duct obstruction.
      Lacrimal duct obstruction can be caused by inflamation and trauma or might be the consequence
      of previous surgery in the lacrimal duct region. As a result of the lacrimal duct
      obstruction, tears are retained over the obstacle and repeated lacrimal infections occur.
      During DCR, the lacrimal sac is opened above the obliterated lacrimal duct and subsequently
      drained into the nasal cavity. The results of DCR are generally excellent and the success
      rate (regression of complaints) varies between 85-95% depending on the condition of the
      lacrimal pathways before surgery. Yet there is a constant effort to improve the results of
      operations. The most common cause of unsuccessful surgery is intranasal stoma scarring. It is
      caused by an inadequately formed bone window, an individual tendency to healing and scar
      formation, but a frequent cause is the insufficient opening of the tear bag or the formation
      of scars between the nasal septum and the lateral nasal wall. One of the methods that can
      increase the success rate of surgery is the introduction of silicone stent into the lacrimal
      duct during DCR, so-called bicanalicular intubation of the lacrimal system. Silicone stent
      remains in the lacrimal system for 12 weeks and prevents scarring. Results of previous
      studies are not clear whether bicanalicular intubation is beneficial. The aim of the study is
      to compare long term effectiveness of DCR with and without bicanalicular intubation.
