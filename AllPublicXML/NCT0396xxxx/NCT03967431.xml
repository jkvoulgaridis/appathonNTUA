    <textblock>
      A total of 96 patients with chronic schizophrenia in two different hospitals in northern
      Taiwan were recruited in this study. The participants were divided into experimental and
      control groups through block randomization. The patients in control group received routine
      care and those in experimental group received narrative enhancement and cognitive therapy
      which contains 20 times group meetings. The research tools include demographic data, the
      Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness Scale (ISMIS), Psychometric properties of the Perceived
      Psychiatric Stigma Scale (PPSS), the Discrimination and Stigma Scale (DISC), Rosenberg
      self-Esteem scale (RSES), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II), Herth Hope Index (HHI). The
      participants were requested to fill out the questionnaires for three times, including before
      the intervention, 12 weeks after intervention, and after the end of intervention. The
      collected data were analyzed by IBM SPSS 24.0 statistical software.. The descriptive
      statistics include mean, minimum, maximum, standard deviation, frequency distribution, and
      percentages; the Generalized estimating equation (GEE) were employed to explore the effect of
      narrative enhancement and cognitive therapy on improving self-stigma, self-esteem, depression
      and hope after controlling demographic data.

    <measure>The Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness Scale (ISMIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>For two groups at baseline(T0), at 12th week(T1) and at 20th week(T2)</time_frame>
    <description>To measure internalized stigma. There are five sub-scales in ISMIS, including Alienation(6 items), Stereotype Experience(7 items), Discrimination Experience(5 items), Social Withdrawal(6 items) and Stigma Resistance(5 items). There are 29 items in this scale. Using Likert scale to rate each item (1=Strongly disagree, 2=disagree, 3=agree, 4=strongly agree) and higher score means higher internalized stigma.</description>

    <measure>The Discrimination and Stigma Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>For two groups at baseline(T0), at 12th week(T1) and at 20th week(T2)</time_frame>
    <description>To know the experiences of discrimination and stigma. There are four sub-scales in DISC, including Unfair Treatment, Stopping Self, Overcoming Stigma and Positive Treatment. These four sub-scales are independent. Using four point to rate each item(0=not at all, 1=a little, 2=Moderately, 3=A lot) or choose &quot;Not applicable&quot; if the item is not applicable for the subject.</description>
