  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sarcopaenia is associated with poor prognoses of in-hospital mortality in splenic abscess
      patients. Investigators recommend its use by surgeons in the ED to rapidly risk stratify and
      identify patients requiring urgent and aggressive intervention, to maximise patient outcomes
      and survival chances.

    <textblock>
      Splenic abscess is a life-threatening surgical emergency which requires early diagnosis and
      intervention to maximise patient outcomes. This can be achieved through accurate risk
      stratification in the emergency department (ED). Sarcopaenia refers to an age-related loss of
      skeletal muscle mass and strength with major physiologic and clinical ramifications. This
      study evaluates sarcopaenia as a radiological risk stratification tool to predict in-hospital
      mortality of splenic abscess patients.

      99 adult patients at four training and research hospitals who had undergone abdominal
      contrast CT scans in the ED with the final diagnosis of splenic abscess from January 2005 to
      December 2015 were recruited. Evaluation for sarcopaenia was performed via calculating psoas
      cross-sectional area at level of L3 and normalising for height. Univariate analyses were used
      to evaluate the differences between survivors and non-survivors, with subsequent logistic
      regression analysis to assess odds ratio of sarcopaenia with respect to in-hospital
      mortality. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was plotted to determine
      predictability of sarcopaenia, with its corresponding sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy
      rate calculated.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        All adult patients older than 20 years of age admitted to the aforementioned hospitals who
        had undergone an abdominal contrast CT scan in the ED with the final diagnosis of splenic
        abscess from January 2005 to December 2015

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients who could not be assessed for sarcopaenia in line with our study methodology
        and/or had other coexisting infections were excluded. Patients with abscesses involving the
        psoas muscles were also excluded.
