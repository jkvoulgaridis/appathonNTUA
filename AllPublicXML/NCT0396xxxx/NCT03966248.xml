  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is one of the most common musculoskeletal diseases in clinic. It
      usually occurs in middle-aged people, especially women. An estimated lifetime risk for KOA is
      approximately 40% in men and 47% in women. KOA is a chronic disease which can lead to obvious
      pain, joint stiffness, limitation of activity and even disability, with significant
      associated costs and effects on society, health systems, and individuals. Tuina therapy has
      been used and showed effectiveness and safety for pain relief and disability for the patients
      with musculoskeletal disorders for years in China. Though it is regarded that the Traditional
      Chinese medicine (TCM) Tuina therapy is similar to the modern manual therapies, the
      modalities of TCM tuina therapy are different and effect maybe equal to or more better than
      the modern manual therapy in clinic. However, little evidence exists that Tuina benefits the
      KOA. The investigators will do this in a randomized, parallel, active controlled study to
      observe whether TCM Tuina is more beneficial to KOA than the physical manual therapy, which
      has been considered an effective and standard care for KOA.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be randomly allocated to one of two groups. In the Chinese Tuina group (group
      CTG), patients will receive the traditional Chinese Tuina therapy (including rolling,
      grasping, scratching, pressing, acupressure or pushing) on the basis of KOA health education
      and home-exercise. Patients in the Physical Manual group (group PMG) will receive the modern
      physical manual therapy (including joint mobilization/manipulation, manual traction, soft
      tissue manipulations, passive stretching, range of motion and strength training) on the basis
      of KOA health education and home-exercise. Assessments will be conducted at baseline and 4
      and 16 weeks after randomization.

      It is expected that the interventions will alleviate the sufferings of the patient. The risks
      of participation are minimal. Occasionally, tuina can make people feel nauseous or experience
      a temporary increase in pain either during or after treatment. Rare side effects happen
      during and after Tuina or manual treatment.
