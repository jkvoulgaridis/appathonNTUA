  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      IRMA is a Prospective, monocenter, non-interventional investigator initiated (IIT) registry
      that aims to investigate the use of the CE-marked OncotypeDX and its impact on adjuvant
      therapy recommendations in the clinical routine. Additionally, the proportion of patients
      with low, intermediate and high RS in predefined clinical subgroups will be determined. To
      evaluate the impact of the RS on tumor cell dissemination, these subgroups also include
      DTC-negative versus DTC-positive patients.

    <measure>Evaluation of the influence of the 21-gene Recurrence-Score (RS) on adjuvant therapy recommendation</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The Recurrence Score is a continuous score that provides an individual estimate of the 10 year risk of distant recurrence and predicts the likelihood of benefit from chemotherapy. The quantitative nature of PCR allows for a continuous score as opposed to a binary result (low vs. high only). Oncotype DX test results assign a Recurrence Score — a number between 0 and 100 — to the early-stage breast cancer or DCIS.
Recurrence Score lower than 18: The cancer has a low risk of recurrence. The benefit of chemotherapy is likely to be small and will not outweigh the risks of side effects.
Recurrence Score of 18 up to and including 30: The cancer has an intermediate risk of recurrence. It's unclear whether the benefits of chemotherapy outweigh the risks of side effects.
Recurrence Score greater than or equal to 31: The cancer has a high risk of recurrence, and the benefits of chemotherapy are likely to be greater than the risks of side effects.</description>

          -  preexisting cancer disease within the last 10 years

          -  preexisting invasive ipsi- or contralateral breast cancer (non-invasive ipsi- or
