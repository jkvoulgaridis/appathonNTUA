      Primary objective:

      To evaluate the level of agreement between the NOTAL-OCT V2.5 and a commercial OCT in the
      presence of fluid as identified in the OCT images, in the central 10 degrees of the macula in
      AMD (Age-related Macular Degeneration) patients.

      Secondary objectives:

        1. To evaluate the level of agreement between the NOTAL-OCT V2.5 and a commercial OCT in
           the presence of fluid as identified in the OCT images, in the central 10 degrees of the
           macula in DME (Diabetic Macular Edema) patients.

        2. To evaluate patient experience when self-operating the Notal-OCT V2.5.

      To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity regarding the presence and absence of fluid on
      OCT images of AMD patients. OCT images from the central 10 degrees of the macula in AMD
      patients will be obtained using the NOTAL OCT v.2.5 and a commercial OCT device (Zeiss Cirrus
      / Heidlberg SPECTRALIS). These images will be evaluated for the presence/absence of fluid in
      the images by a human grader. The sensitivity and specificity will be determined by
      comparison of the presence/absence of fluid in the NOTAL OCT v2.5 images with the
      presence/absence of fluid in the commercial OCT images.

    <description>Patients will complete a questionnaire with 13 statements or questions regarding the usability of the NOTAL-OCT v.2.5 device. For the first 10 statements, patients are asked to specify a level of agreement to the statement. The scale is named &quot;Level of Agreement&quot; and ranges from 1 = strongly agree, to 5 = strongly disagree. A patient's indicating a value of 1 is considered to be a better outcome. The remaining 3 questions are free-form.</description>
