  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to compare the effect of the timing (30 vs. 90 minutes)
      between a fixed exercise and the following test meal on energy intake, appetite feelings and
      food reward in adolescents with obesity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present study will compare the nutritional response to the realisation of an acute
      exercise 90 minutes or 30 minutes before an ad libitum buffet meal in adolescents with
      obesity. 18 adolescents with obesity will be asked to randomly complete three experimental
      sessions: i) one control session (rest); ii) one session with an acute exercise realized 90
      minutes before lunch; iii) one session with the same exercise performed 30 minutes before
      lunch. Their ad libitum energy intake will be assessed during lunch as well as at dinner
      time. Appetite feelings will be assessed at regular intervals and their food reward in
      response to the lunch will also be assessed.

    <description>Change of food intake will be measured ad libitum during a lunch buffet. The adolescents will be offered an ad libitum buffet-type meal composed based on their food intake preferences. Their intake will be weighted using an electronic food scale by a member of the investigation team and then analysed using Bilnuts software.</description>
