  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the EQUODIA study is to evaluate the hemodynamic stability of hemodialysis
      with low dialysate flow in patients requiring emergency hemodialysis in the context of acute
      kidney injury or unscheduled end-stage renal disease, not in intensive care, compared to
      conventional triweekly high-flow hemodialysis.

      Short daily hemodialysis has excellent hemodynamic tolerance, which has already been
      confirmed by clinical experience. This modality, commonly used in the patient's home through
      new machines allowing a low dialysate flow purification technique, can prove to be an
      innovative, effective and safe alternative for patients admitted for hemodialysis in an
      unscheduled situation (acute kidney injury, unscheduled end-stage renal disease not
      followed).

      Up to now, no studies have evaluated the use of short daily hemodialysis with low dialysate
      flow in patients with acute kidney injury or unscheduled end-stage renal disease, requiring
      the initiation of emergency extra-renal purification.
