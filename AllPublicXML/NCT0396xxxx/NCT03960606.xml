      A Randomized, Double-Blind, Multicenter, Placebo-Controlled, Phase 2 Study to Evaluate the
      Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of Itraconazole Administered as a Dry Powder for
      Inhalation (PUR1900) in Adult Asthmatic Patients With Allergic Bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo controlled, multiple-arm study.

      Following screening and confirmation of eligibility, subjects will be randomly assigned
      (1:1:1:1) into 4 arms of 16 subjects each and will receive 10 mg, 20 mg, or 35 mg of PUR1900
      or placebo, administered via dry powder inhalation daily for 28 days. The doses of PUR1900
      are stated in this protocol as the respective nominal doses of itraconazole.

      Subject eligibility for the study will be determined within 28 days before the first dose of
      study drug (Day 1) and will be confirmed between 9 and 6 days before dosing and again on Day
      1.

      Eligible subjects will begin daily dosing with study drug (PUR1900 or placebo) on Day 1.

      Subjects will return to the study site for visits on Days 2, 7, 14, and 28 and will be dosed
      at the study site. The remaining daily doses of study drug will be self-administered at home.

      A follow-up visit will occur 7 to 10 days after the last dose of study drug.

    <masking_description>The study will be performed in a double-blind manner. All study drug will be supplied in identical packaging and will be similar in color, smell, taste, and appearance to enable double-blind conditions. All study personnel will remain blinded until after database lock, unless the nature of their activities in the study specifically requires them to be unblinded. Any study documents, supplies, and tools will be reviewed to identify components that have the potential to unblind the study, and blinding restrictions will be applied where appropriate.</masking_description>
