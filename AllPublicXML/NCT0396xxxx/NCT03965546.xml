  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ET 140202 -T cell
      combined With TAE or Sorafenib in the treatment of liver cancer
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The molecular target for ET140202-T cells is HLA-A02 complexed with a HLA-A02-restricted
      peptide of alpha fetoprotein (AFP), which is expressed on 60-80 percent of hepatocellular
      carcinoma (HCC). This clinical study evaluates the safety and pharmacokinetics of ET140202-T
      cells with TAE or Sorafenib in patients with HCC who have no available curative therapeutic
      options and a poor overall prognosis.
