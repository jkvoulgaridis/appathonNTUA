    <textblock>
      Patients with chronic wounds will be imaged using 2 imaging devices. Two types of images will
      be acquired with each device, a standard photograph (ST-image) and a fluorescence image
      (FL-image). The images captured with the 2 imaging devices will be compared off-line by many
      interpreters to assess for any differences in the images that would alter a clinical
      decision.
