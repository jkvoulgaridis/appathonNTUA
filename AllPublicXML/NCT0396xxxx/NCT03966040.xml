      This is a single center, open-label phase1b clinical trial. The study will evaluate the
      safety and immunogenicity of an experimental recombinant staphylococcus aureus vaccine with
      different immunization schedules in healthy adults aged 18-70 years, including day 0-3-7, day
      0/0-3-7, day 0/0-7 and day 0/0-7-14.

               -  Able to comply with all clinical trial protocol requirements and willing to
                  complete all the visit plan process during the whole clinical trial observation
                  period.

               -  Able to understand the content of informed consent and willing to sign the
                  informed consent.

               -  Able to complete the diary card independently.

               -  For females only (18-49 years), a negative urine pregnancy test and willing to
                  practice continuous effective contraception during the study.

               -  Axillary temperature ≤37.0°C.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  • Prior receipt of Staphylococcus aureus vaccine

               -  Any confirmed Staphylococcus aureus infection disease in the past 12 month.

               -  History of asthma, hereditary angioneurotic edema, diabetes, malignancy or other
                  serious disease. Participation in the clinical trial is likely to increase the
                  disease risk and interfere with the observation of clinical trial index.

               -  Prior blood donation or Blood loss over 400ml in the last 3 months;

               -  Coagulation disorders (coagulation factor deficiency, coagulopathy or platelet
                  disorder) diagnosed by doctors, or obvious bruises or blood coagulation noticed.

               -  History of allergic disease likely to be exacerbated by any component of the
                  vaccine, including allergy, urticaria, respiratory difficulty, angioneurotic
                  edema or abdominal pain. Any autoimmune disease or immunodeficient state,
                  parents, brother and sister with autoimmune disease or immunodeficient disease.

               -  Taking immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the last 12 months.

               -  Asplenia, functional asplenia or asplenia caused by any situation or splenectomy.

               -  History of thyroidectomy or thyroid disease requiring treatment in the last 12
                  months.

               -  Immunosuppressor, cytotoxic therapy, inhaled corticosteroid (excluding
                  corticosteroids spray treatment of allergic rhinitis, acute and nonconcurrent
                  corticosteroids treatment)

               -  Participation in another research study involving receipt of an investigational
                  product in the last 30 days.

               -  Woman who is breast-feeding.

               -  Prior administration of attenuated vaccine in last 28 days.

               -  Prior administration of subunit vaccine, inactivated vaccine or allergic therapy
                  in last 14 days.

               -  Current anti-tuberculosis therapy or HIV infected individuals

               -  Any other conditions may compromise the safety or availability of participants in
                  the judgment of the investigator.

        Following Immunization exclusion standard:

          -  Other condition violates the inclusion criteria or meets the exclusion criteria is
             noticed after the first immunization.

          -  Any grade 3 or more serious adverse reaction associated with vaccination since the
             last vaccination.

          -  According to the investigator, the participant should not continue participating in
