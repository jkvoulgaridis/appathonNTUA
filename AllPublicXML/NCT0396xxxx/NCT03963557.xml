  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The child will complete computerized tasks and paper-pencil test, and will be presented with
      symbols, letters, or numbers on a computer screen and asked to respond by pressing a button
      on the computer. Before each task a researcher will explain the instructions of the task and
      assess if the child needs a break before completing the next task. While the child is
      completing computerized tasks, the parent/guardian will be asked to fill out paper-pencil
      questionnaires about the child and to sign a release of medical information form so that we
      can study how physical markers of health effect cognition.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceptual organization index- Matrix reasoning subtest</measure>
    <time_frame>10-15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The examinee views an incomplete matrix or series and selects the response option that completes the matrix or series. Scoring is based on whether the response is right or wrong.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceptual organization index- Block design subtest</measure>
    <time_frame>15-20 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Block Design subtest is designed to measure the ability to analyze and synthesize abstract visual stimuli. While viewing a constructed model or a picture in the Stimulus Book, the examinee uses red- and-white blocks to re-create the design within a specified time limit. Scoring is based on how quickly the participant completes.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Processing speed index- Coding subtest</measure>
    <time_frame>2-3 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The processing speed index measures a child's ability efficiently to scan and understand visual information and complete a task with the data. Scoring is based on how many can the participant finish in 120 seconds.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Working memory index- Digit span subtest</measure>
    <time_frame>5-10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The task digit span uses numbers. Memory span is a common measure of short-term memory. It is also a component of cognitive ability. Scoring is based on how many correct answers (recall) are achieved</description>
