    <textblock>
      early identification of vulnerable plaques by remodeling index prior to rupture and
      development of acute event is of considerable importance especially by a reliable
      non-invasive method as CT coronary angiography.

      single-center, cross section, observational study included 150 patients with stable angina
      with normal resting ECG, negative markers, normal systolic function by 2D echocardiography
      (EF&gt;50%) and without regional wall motion abnormality at rest who were referred to MSCT
      evaluation of the coronary artery tree.

    <description>to study the changes in wall of the arteries in patients with chronic stable angina early changes don't appear in coronary angiography as it occurs in the form of positive remodeling which can be detected by multisclice coronary angiography Remodeling index is defined as the ratio of the maximum vessel area (or diameter) to a normal reference vessel area (or diameter), and plaques are classified as having significant positive remodeling when the remodeling index is &gt;1.1</description>
