  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While genetics demonstrated a major risk factor for the development of type 1 diabetes (T1D),
      microbiota dysbiosis has been suggested as an elicitor in immunological tolerance and of beta
      cell autoimmunity. The probiotic Lactobacillus johnsonii N6.2 may prevent or restore the gut
      flora and show systemic impacts and adaptive immunity in the T1D population thereby
      preserving beta cell function.
