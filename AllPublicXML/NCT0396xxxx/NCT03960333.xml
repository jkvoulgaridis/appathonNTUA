  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to learn about obesity and how insulin resistance and Type 2 Diabetes
      develops in children.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this proposed study is to determine whether the immunometabolic
      phenotypes of CD4+T cells from obese children is skewed towards Teff with mTOR-driven
      glycolysis and away from Tregs with AMPK-driven OXPHOS and whether metformin can reverse the
      immunometabolic phenotypes.

      This study consists of:

        1. An observational cross sectional immune and metabolic analysis of several groups of
           children including lean, overweight/obese, and T2D.

        2. A prospective immune and metabolic analysis of newly diagnosed children with T2D or
           insulin resistance who will be or were recently prescribed metformin as part of their
           clinical care.

      Children with T2D or insulin resistance who will be or were recently prescribed metformin,
      will be asked to complete two study visits. If completed, the second visit will occur 6
      months (+/- 2 weeks) after beginning metformin as part of their clinical care. All other
      children, will be asked to complete only the first visit.

      quantification of plasma CRP, pro-inflammatory, and anti-inflammatory cytokines and
      adipokines, and analyte analysis. The sample may be used for future research studies on
      pediatric nutrition. The urine and stool sample will be used for future research studies on

      <textblock>
        110 children ages 5-17 years old will be recruited with the goal that approximately 80
        subjects stratified across the following groups will complete the study: i) healthy lean
        (approximately n=20); ii) overweight/obese (approximately n=40, with the anticipation that
        approximately 20 of these children will be insulin resistant); iii) overweight/obese with
        T2D and prescribed Metformin (approximately n=20). Every attempt will be made to ensure
        that the desired number for each group is achieved and groups are balanced with respect to
        age, sex and ethnicity.
