  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We designed this study as a multicenter, randomized, double blinded and placebo-controlled
      clinical trial. The aim of the study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy, safety and control
      of recurrence rate of psoriasis with blood stasis syndrome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Psoriasis is a chronic, relapsing, inflammatory, multisystem disease characterized by
      infiltration of inflammatory cells, hyperplasia of epidermal keratinocytes, and abnormal
      differentiation. Latest data estimate that the prevalence of psoriasis in adults has
      increased to 11.43%, which shows that the control and treatment of psoriasis is still
      insufficient. Recent studies showed that traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is one of the
      effective methods for the treatment of psoriasis. More and more evidences support the
      recognition of psoriasis not only affects the skin, but also suffers a chronic multisystem
      inflammation. Chinese medicine believes that the blood heat is the root of the onset of
      psoriasis, so the treatment of psoriasis should focus on the method of clearing heat and
      cooling blood. Therefore, the method of promoting clearing heat and cooling blood. has always
      been the focus of TCM treatment and prevention of psoriasis. This multicenter, randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled trial will provide high-quality clinical evidences for
      evaluating the efficacy, safety and recurrence rate of Jueyin granule, a representative
      prescription for the treatment of psoriasis with blood heat syndrome, in the treatment of
      psoriasis.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Psoriasis area and severity index</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 56 days after treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>Psoriasis Area and Severity Index involves grading psoriatic plaques based on erythema (E), infiltration (I), desquamation (D). Severity is graded from 0-4 for each criteria (0 - none, 1 - slight, 2 - moderate, 3 - severe, and 4 - very severe). The body is divided into 4 regions, head, upper extremities, trunk, and lower extremities, and for each region, the surface area involvement is graded on a 0-6 scale (0 - 0% involvement, 1 - &lt;10%, 2 - 10-&lt;30%, 3 - 30-&lt;50%, 4 - 50-&lt;70%, 5 - 70-&lt;90%, 6 - 90-100%).The highest potential PASI score is 72, with higher PASI scores indicating worse psoriasis.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Body surface area (BSA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 56 days after treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of BSA involved in psoriasis is estimated by fingerprinting, where the entire palm of the patient represents approximately 1% of the total BSA. The number of handprints on psoriasis skin in a body part is used to determine the extent to which the body part is affected by psoriasis (%)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physician Global Assessment (PGA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 56 days after treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>Physician Global Assessment (PGA) is scored on a 5-point scale, reflecting a global consideration of the erythema (E), infiltration (I), desquamation (D) across all psoriatic lesions. It is calculated as follows: PGA score = (E + I + D) / 3, then the score needs to be rounded to the nearest whole number [PGA scale: Clear (0) - Very Severe (5)].</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dermatology Life quality index(DLQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 56 days after treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>The Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) is a participant-reported questionnaire used to measure the health-related quality of life (QOL) of adults suffering from a skin disease. Scores range from 0-30, a higher score indicating a greater impact on a participant's quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient-reported quality of life (PRQoL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 56 days after treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>PRQoL is used to assess the impact of psoriasis on individual social life. Scores range from 0-25, a higher score indicating a greater impact on a participant's social life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analogue Score (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 56 days after treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>Visual Analog Scale (VAS) is used to measure lesion pruritus from 0 to 100 mm at eash visit (with 0 being no pruritis and 100 being maximum pruritis).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>TCM symptom score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 56 days after treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>The TCM symptom score is used to assess changes in blood syndrome related symptoms during treatment.</description>
