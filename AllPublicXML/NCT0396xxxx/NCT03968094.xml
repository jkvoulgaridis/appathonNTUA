  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Imagine a hospital or ambulatory surgical work environment where clinicians could look at an
      electronic respiratory monitoring device and observe the patient's data over time, and be
      cued by the monitor before the patient exhibits dangerous opioid induced respiratory
      depression/respiratory compromise. Currently, clinicians use electronic monitoring data for
      real-time assessment of respiratory status. Alarms set at thresholds alert a clinician when
      the patient is currently experiencing respiratory compromise. Adverse events secondary to
      opioid induced respiratory compromise (OIRC) continue to occur in 0.5-4.2% of hospitalized
      patients receiving opioids for acute pain. Opioids continue to be a staple for acute pain
      management. In this environment of litigation around adequate pain management and the use of
      opioids, clinicians need a more sensitive and specific way to determine which patients are at
      risk of severe respiratory depression when using opioids for acute pain management in the
      hospital setting.

      This study proposes to evaluate algorithms preliminarily developed in the computer
      laboratory. This translational research will compare and test replication of our algorithms
      in a new sample of patients. Patients' electronic monitor data will be used to further
      develop our algorithms for identifying patients who exhibit OIRC and predicting OIRC events.
      Explicitly, we will monitor post-operative patients using pulse oximetry, capnography, minute
      ventilation, and transcutaneous PCO2 during recovery from anesthesia (in PACU), and on the
      general care floor for up to 72 hours. This data, along with covariates collected from the
      electronic medical record and environment will be used in machine learning models to develop
      our algorithms in an iterative process. Future studies will involve instituting these
      algorithms into a monitoring interface and testing in simulation and in real-time on
      patients. Please see AHRQ summary sheets from a submission that occurred earlier this year.
