  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized-control trial involves dyads consisting of a family caregiver (CG) and a
      person with memory loss or dementia (PwD). The FallsTalk Caregiver Resource System (FT-C)
      intervention is administered by the CG, whose role is to modify their interactions with the
      PwD. FT-C will create a 3-way partnership between an Interventionist and the dyad,
      capitalizing on CG-PwD interactions. The PwD will be observed by the CG and both will be
      evaluated by the study team. Brief daily FT-C intervention by the CG will stimulate the PwD's
      awareness and individualized weekly CG- check-ins with the Interventionist will increase the
      CG's skills. Our hypothesis is that FT-C will increase PwD's awareness of personal fall
      threats and encourage new falls prevention behaviors, resulting in reduced fall rates.

    <description>The Activity-Specific Balance Confidence scale is a standardized 16 item scale that measures an individual's self-efficacy about preventing a fall or loss of balance. The maximum score is 1600. Each item is scored from 0-100 with 0 indicating no confidence and 100 meaning complete confidence.</description>

    <time_frame>BSFC is administered at Initial interview and Follow-up interview one month later.</time_frame>
    <description>The Burden Scale for Family Caregivers is a standardized 28 item scale that assesses subjective burden of the CG. The items are scored as strongly agree, agree, disagree or strongly disagree and the maximum score is 84. A score of 0 indicates no burden and a score of 84 indicates a very severe burden with a high risk of psychosomatic symptoms.</description>
