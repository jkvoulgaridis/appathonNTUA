    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effects of corticosteroid injections over time, as well as the
      additional effect provided by subsequent transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of
      the motor cortex on patients with rotator cuff tendinopathy of the shoulder. All patients
      will receive a subacromial corticosteroid injection. Two weeks later, a third will receive a
      treatment of tDCS, a third will receive a placebo a-tDCS treatment, and the last third will
      not receive any additional treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Corticosteroid injections (CSI) are often used by physicians in the treatment of rotator cuff
      tendinopathy, a painful chronic degeneration of the tendons in the shoulder. However, the
      effect of CSI in comparison with placebo is disputed in the scientific literature, with most
      studies only showing mild short-term effect (less than six weeks) on pain compared to placebo
      injections.

      Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive technique allowing to
      stimulate areas of the brain in order to change the excitability of the neurons. When the
      negative electrode is applied on the motor cortex of the brain, it increases the excitability
      of the neurons in that area, which in turns inhibits the activity of the thalamus, an area of
      the brain linked with the perception of pain. Some studies have shown that tDCS can improve
      chronic pain of different origins, such as lower back pain, fibromyalgia, stroke,
      osteoarthritis, and post-operative pain.

      We tested whether applying tDCS following a CSI would have more effect on patient's pain,
      function, and activity, than CSI alone.

    <intervention_model_description>All participants received a subacromial corticosteroid injection.
Two weeks following the injection, participants were randomized into 3 groups:
Anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (treatment group)
Placebo tDCS (placebo group)
No further intervention (control group)</intervention_model_description>
    <primary_purpose>Treatment</primary_purpose>
    <masking>Triple (Participant, Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Participants and assessors were blind to the assignment of the treatment vs placebo group, while there was no feasible way to conceal the control group.
Participants from the treatment and placebo group received the tDCS intervention by a care provider not involved in the recruitment, data collection or outcome assessment. The tDCS apparatus was out of sight of the participant for the duration of the treatment. Treatment patients received tDCS treatment for the whole duration of the planned intervention (20 minutes), while the device was only turned on for 30 seconds, then gradually turned off for the participants in the placebo group. This was done in order to mimic the initial sensation of tingling felt by participants in the treatment group.</masking_description>

    <measure>Western Ontario Rotator Cuff index (WORC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Two weeks following tDCS (four weeks after CSI)</time_frame>
    <description>The WORC is a health related quality of life questionnaire developed specifically to assess outcome in patients with rotator cuff disease. It includes 21 questions in the form of visual analog scales (VAS) covering five domains: physical symptoms, sports and recreation, work, quality of life, and emotional status. The final score can be reported over 100 points, with a higher score represents better function.</description>

    <description>The QuickDASH is a health related quality of life questionnaire developed for pathologies affecting the arm, shoulder and hand. It consists of 11 questions in the form of Likert scales. The score can be reported on a scale of 0 to 100, with higher score representing worse outcome.</description>

    <measure>Pain visual analog scale (pain VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Filled every day, but it will be averaged for every week, starting one week before the CSI and ending four weeks after, with an additional week eight weeks following CSI.</time_frame>
    <description>The participant will be asked to rank their pain for the last 24h on a VAS, with anchors being &quot;no pain&quot; on the left end, and &quot;Extreme pain&quot; on the right end.</description>

    <measure>Shoulder Range of Motion (ROM)</measure>
    <time_frame>One week before the CSI, day of the CSI (just prior to the injection), two-weeks after CSI (just prior to tDCS), four weeks after CSI</time_frame>
    <description>Shoulder ROM will be measured using a goniometer and reported in degrees in six different planes: abduction, flexion, scapular elevation (scaption), external rotation with the arm at the side, external rotation with the arm abducted 90 degrees and internal rotation with the arm abducted 90 degree.
Additionally, internal rotation will also be measured visually with the maximal spinal level reached by the thumb with the hand at the back.</description>

    <description>The participants will be asked to rank their estimated affected shoulder use for the last 24h using a VAS, with the left anchor being &quot;Not at all&quot; and the right anchor being &quot;All the time&quot;.</description>

    <measure>Arm usage measured by actimetry</measure>
    <time_frame>Worn every day, but it will be averaged for every week, starting one week before the CSI and ending four weeks after.</time_frame>
    <description>An accelerometer developed at our institution (WIMU-GPS) will be worn at the wrist during the day for a total of five weeks. It will record acceleration, angular velocity, and magnetic field interactions in order to estimate upper extremity usage. At the time of initial ethical approval, the exact algorithm for upper extremity usage estimation was not decided. At the end of data collection, it was decided to use percentage of active time (time spent over a prespecified threshold), activity count, ratio of high intensity activities (activities in the highest 33% percentile of activity count), ratio of medium intensity activities (activities in the middle 33% percentile of activities) and ratio of low intensity activities (activities in the low 33% percentile of activity counts)</description>

    <time_frame>Two week follow the CSI (prior to tDCS), four weeks following CSI (two weeks after tDCS), eight weeks after CSI (six weeks after tDCS).</time_frame>
    <description>This form asks the participants to rate improvement in their symptoms on a scale with 15 levels, starting from &quot;A very great deal worse&quot;, with a midpoint being &quot;About the same&quot; and ending with &quot;A very great deal better&quot;. This questionnaire will be used to help validate accelerometry as an outcome measure in a secondary analysis.</description>

    <description>The tDCS anode was applied on the primary motor cortex area responsible for the control of the rotator cuff, as determined using transcranial magnetic stimulation and surface electromyography. The cathode was applied on the contralateral forehead, just above the eyebrow. The electrodes were soaked in saline solution to improve conductivity and the montage was secured with rubber bands and adhesive tape.
The tDCS device (Soterix Medical 1x1 tDCS device) was then gradually turned to an intensity of 2mA. This stimulation was continued for a total of 20 minutes, after which it was gradually stopped.</description>

    <ipd_description>We will likely be sharing an spreadsheet containing anonymized IPD, including all outcome measures for each time point. The accelerometer data will however be summarized in a per-week average and standard deviation, as the data files are too large (&gt;4 Gb each) to be shared in a practical way.
We also plan to share original study protocol, analysis plan, and participant consent forms. The data will be available for a total of 5 years after publication of the study results, and then destroyed as required by our research ethics board.</ipd_description>
