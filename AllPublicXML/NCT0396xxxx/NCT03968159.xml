  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in the Hamilton Depression Scale (17 items) (HAMD-17) total score</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Weeks Treatment Duration</time_frame>
    <description>The HAMD-17 consists of 8 items with a score on a 3 point scale and 9 items with a score on a 5 point scale. The total score ranging from 0 to 52 will be calculated as the sum of the scores for all 17 items. Higher total scores denote more severe depression.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) score</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Weeks Treatment Duration</time_frame>
    <description>The SDS is a 3-item subject-facing questionnaire used to evaluate impairments in the domains of work, social life/leisure, and family life/home responsibility. Subjects rate each item using an 11-point scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 10 (extremely). Higher scores denote greater disability.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) score for depressive symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Weeks Treatment Duration</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-S rates the severity of a subject's depression over the past 7 days and the score ranges from 1 to 7. Higher CGI-S scores denote more severe depression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) score for depressive symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Weeks Treatment Duration</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-I rates the change in a subject's depression over the past 7 days relative to the subject's symptoms at Baseline and the score ranges from 1 to 7. Higher CGI-I scores denote less improvement in depression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in the Changes in Sexual Functioning Questionnaire Short Form (CSFQ-14)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Weeks Treatment Duration</time_frame>
    <description>The CSFQ-14 is a 14-item version of the CSFQ. This is a patient-facing questionnaire, with a male version and a female version. The total score ranging from 14 to 70 will be calculated as the sum of the scores for all 14 items. Higher total scores denote better sexual functioning.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS) score</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Weeks Treatment Duration</time_frame>
    <description>The KSS is a scale that measures the subject's drowsiness and is frequently used in studies measuring subjective sleepiness. Scoring is based on a 9-point verbally anchored scale going from &quot;1 = extremely alert&quot; to &quot;9 = very sleepy, great effort to keep awake, fighting sleep&quot;. Higher scores denote more drowsiness.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment responder rates. Treatment response is defined as a reduction from Baseline in HAMD-17 total score of 50% or more</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Weeks Treatment Duration</time_frame>
    <description>The HAMD-17 consists of 8 items with a score on a 3 point scale and 9 items with a score on a 5 point scale. The total score ranging from 0 to 52 will be calculated as the sum of the scores for all 17 items. Treatment response is defined as a reduction from Baseline in HAMD-17 total score of 50% or more.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment remission rates. Treatment remission is defined as a HAMD-17 total score ≤7</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Weeks Treatment Duration</time_frame>
    <description>The HAMD-17 consists of 8 items with a score on a 3 point scale and 9 items with a score on a 5 point scale. The total score ranging from 0 to 52 will be calculated as the sum of the scores for all 17 items. Treatment remission is defined as a HAMD-17 total score ≤7.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in the Hamilton Depression (HAMD) Anxiety/Somatization factor score</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Weeks Treatment Duration</time_frame>
    <description>The Anxiety/Somatization factor of the HAMD-17 includes 6 items: psychic anxiety, somatic anxiety, gastrointestinal somatic symptoms, general somatic symptoms, hypochondriasis, and insight. The HAMD-17 Anxiety/Somatization factor score ranging from 0 to 18 will be calculated as the sum of the scores for the 6 items. Higher scores denote more severe anxiety/somatization condition.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Weeks Treatment Duration</time_frame>
    <description>The BIS-11 is a questionnaire designed to assess the personality/behavioral construct of impulsiveness. It is composed of 30 items describing common impulsive or non-impulsive (reverse scored items: 1, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 20, 29, and 30) behaviors and preferences. Items are scored on the following 4-point scale: Rarely/Never = 1; Occasionally = 2; Often = 3; Almost Always/Always = 4. For reverse scored items, a response of 1 is recoded to 4; 2 is recoded to 3; 3 is recoded to 2; and 4 is recoded to 1. The BIS-11 score ranging from 30 to 120 will be calculated as the sum of the scores for all 30 items. Higher scores denote more impulsiveness.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline to Week 1 in the HAMD-17 total score</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week (6 Weeks Total Treatment Duration)</time_frame>
    <description>The HAMD-17 consists of 8 items with a score on a 3 point scale and 9 items with a score on a 5 point scale. The total score ranging from 0 to 52 will be calculated as the sum of the scores for all 17 items. Higher total scores denote more severe depression.</description>
