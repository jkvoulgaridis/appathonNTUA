  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Babies are the best in class in order to get human milk out of a lactating breast. With this
      in mind, Philips has developed the a new electric breast pump, attempting to mimic the babies
      sucking behavior. The new electric breast pump includes a new vacuum profile and 2 new
      expression kits.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast pumps currently on the market function by applying vacuum directly to the breast. The
      effect of a build-up of pressure within the breast due to the accumulation of milk, combined
      with the external negative pressure introduced by the breast pump, results in the expression
      of milk. However, in order to express sufficient amounts of milk it is important to stimulate
      the Milk Ejection Reflex (MER). The MER, also called letdown, draught ejection, expulsion or
      pumping reflex, is described as a response of the mammary gland to oxytocin. When the nipple
      is stimulated, the mother's posterior pituitary gland releases oxytocin into the bloodstream.
      Upon reaching the breast tissue, oxytocin provokes contraction of cells within the structure
      of the breast causing milk flow. Without the MER successful breastfeeding or breast milk
      expression cannot happen. In order to stimulate the MER, Philips has developed 2 new
      expression kits to better mimic the suckling pattern of an infant.
