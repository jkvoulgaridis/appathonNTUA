  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) and their associated complications like amputations are
      increasingly becoming a problem in low and middle income (LMI) countries. Obesity (increased
      body fat/adiposity), which has been shown to complicate many diseases, is also increasing in
      LMI setting. It is however not certain whether increased adiposity, may make it difficult for
      DFUs to heal. Investigators aim to understand whether increased adiposity and accompanied
      local microbial factors have any negative impact on healing and progression of DFUs.

      A prospective cohort of 300 individuals with type 2 diabetes presenting with diabetic foot
      ulcers (DFUs) at an outpatient clinic will be recruited. At baseline, participants will be
      stratified into normal and high adiposity groups as measured by Bioelectrical Impedance
      Analysis (BIA). Both groups will receive DFU management according to locally appropriate
      standards of care and followed-up for 24 weeks or until complete wound healing, whichever
      occurs first. Local microbial characteristics, presence or absence of infection and other
      clinical parameters will also be assessed, and compared between the two groups. Enrolling 150
      participants per group will have a minimum power of 80% to detect a 20% difference in
      cumulative incidence of complete ulcer healing (at the 5% level of statistical significance)
      between the normal and high adiposity groups.

        Participants (males and females) will be newly reporting and known type 2 diabetes mellitus
        (T2DM) patients with diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) of any class, stage and grade (based on the
        university of Texas ulcer staging system). Any prior treatment and important information
        related to the ulcers and patients will be recorded using a pre-tested questionnaire. DFU
        will be defined as a full-thickness wound, through the dermis, below the ankle in an
        individual with T2DM. Duration of ulcers will be measured and reported in weeks. To recruit
        appropriate participants, a careful examination will be done with qualified and trained
        personnel. Prior to commencement of the study appropriate manuals and standard operating
        procedures will be prepared and used throughout the study period.
