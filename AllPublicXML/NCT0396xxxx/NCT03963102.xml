      A phase IV study of a single topical application of ALA for 3 hours or 4 hours to AK on acral
      sites (hands, feet, arms and legs), and subsequent measurement of clinical efficacy with
      corresponding PpIX fluorescence imaging.

      Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a relatively new treatment for skin cancer and sun-damaged
      skin, which may turn cancerous or pre-cancerous. PDT treatment consists of applying a gel
      containing aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride (licensed for clinical use as Ameluz®) to the
      abnormal area. Inside the diseased cells this gel is changed over a few hours into a
      light-sensitive chemical (photosensitiser) that reacts with light. The photosensitiser is
      inactive by itself. A red light is then shone on to the lesion; this reacts with the
      photosensitiser and destroys the abnormal cells. Only the treated area will be affected and
      inflamed. The area will be cured in most cases after the inflammation clears.

      Actinic keratosis (AK) is a type of pre-cancerous lesion caused by sun damage. If left, they
      can progress to become skin cancer. These can be treated in different ways, with different
      topical creams, liquid nitrogen or PDT. Some lesions may have reoccurred after topical
      creams, patients also have unacceptable amount of inflammation or the lesion involve too
      large an area. Liquid nitrogen is as good as PDT in treating AKs, however have been reported
      to leave a less good cosmetic result.

      PDT is a licensed treatment for AK. However, PDT has been shown to be less effective for AKs
      on certain areas such as hands and feet. Further understanding of the build-up of the
      photosensitiser may enable better cure rates at these body parts, enabling more patients to
      benefit from PDT.

      The proposed theory is that a longer application of the Ameluz gel will increase the amount
      of photosensitiser, which accumulates in the treated areas, and thus increase the amount of
      damage to cells, and mean that more patients have a successful treatment.

      The aim of this study is to investigate whether applying the Ameluz gel for 4 hours (trial
      group) rather than 3 hours (control group) will improve treatment success rates in AK lesions
      on hands, feet, arms and legs. The information gained from this study may result in better
      treatment design of PDT for AK.

      To do this the investigators plan to apply Ameluz® gel to AK lesions for either the standard
      3 hours or the currently unlicensed 4 hours. The investigators will then measure the amount
      of that has changed into the photosensitiser, using a special digital camera. This camera
      device is not invasive and does not have any side effects. Some patients may have multiple AK
      lesions on multiple sites; the investigator aim to treat all these in the same manner due to
      practicality, and will record data for these lesions as well.

      The investigator will record if patients report any associated pain during light delivery, as
      well as the temperature of the lesion during treatment. Some patients opt to have an external
      cooling system or water spray during the light treatment, but in order to standardise
      treatment during the trial this will not be used. The investigator will however give patients
      the option of taking paracetamol themselves prior to the treatment. A dermatology doctor will
      then review the patients at three months following treatment to see if their AK has been
      cured, and receive further treatment if needed.

      The pathway is the same as standard PDT treatment and does not involve an extra visit.

          2. Any disease which is caused or exacerbated by light, including systemic lupus
             erythematosus, porphyria, actinic reticuloid or xeroderma pigmentosum. Part of the
             clinical study will be the use of light-imaging system so any condition, which is
             sensitive to such instruments, will be excluded.

          3. Males or females of childbearing potential, who are not practicing adequate
             contraceptive precaution. Female patients should practice strict birth control
             (oestrogen-containing oral contraceptives or an IUD) throughout the trial. Only
             post-menopausal women (12 months or more with no menses) and women who have had a
             hysterectomy are exempt from the requirements to use birth control. Male patients
             should also use adequate contraception for the duration of the trial.

          4. Pregnant or lactating females

          5. Treatment in the previous 45 days with any cryotherapy, topical treatments for AK,
             experimental compound, an iron chelating agent, radiotherapy, chemotherapy or with any
             light activated therapy or any other medication, which may render the patient light
             sensitive (e.g. PUVA).

          6. Photodynamic therapy treatment in the previous 90 days.

          7. Co-existing ophthalmic disease likely to require slit lamp examination within 30 days
             of PDT treatment.

          8. Known allergies to porphyrins, peanut, soya or excipients.

          9. Patients not able to comply with study requirements.

         10. Patients on immunosuppression medication.
