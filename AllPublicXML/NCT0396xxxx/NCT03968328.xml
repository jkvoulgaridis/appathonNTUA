  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial uses an interview and a survey to gather information from cancer patients about
      the onset of their fever and the administration of antibiotics. Collecting information from
      patients may help doctors to assess the relationship between time to antibiotic
      administration and inhospital cause specific death, intensive care unit admission, hospital
      length of stay, and positive blood cultures.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the prognostic value of the length of time between the time onset of fever and
      first antibiotic administration on cause specific 14 day mortality rate.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the associations of the length of time between the time onset of fever and first
      antibiotic administration with intensive care unit (ICU) admission, ICU length of stay,
      length of hospitalization and percentage of patients with positive blood cultures.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients respond to a survey and participate in an interview with study staff about their
      fever and when they started feeling unwell.
