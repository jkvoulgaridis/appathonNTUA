      The study seeks to assess the effectiveness of Sanofi Pasteur´s dengue vaccine (Dengvaxia®)
      according to the age, dose and municipality of residence in five municipalities of Paraná
      State. Specific objectives include:

        -  To assess the effectiveness of Dengvaxia® in preventing dengue hospitalization and
           dengue symptomatic cases.

        -  To assess the effectiveness of Dengvaxia® in preventing dengue hospitalization and
           dengue symptomatic cases according in the following age groups 15 to 18 and 19 to 27
           years of age in the municipalities of Maringá, Foz de Iguaçu, Londrina, Sarandi and
           Paranaguá.

        -  To assess the effectiveness of Dengvaxia® in preventing dengue hospitalization and
           dengue symptomatic cases in the following age groups 9 to 14 and 28 to 45 years of age
           in the municipality of Paranaguá.

      The effectiveness of Sanofi Pasteur´s dengue vaccine (Dengvaxia®) according to the age will
      be assessed in five municipalities of Paraná State - Maringá, Foz de Iguaçu, Londrina,
      Sarandi and Paranaguá. Any health service located in each of the five municipalities may
      report a suspected dengue case. However, in all five municipalities, there is a large public
      emergency service, the UPA. There are currently three UPA in Londrina, two in Maringá and Foz
      do Iguaҫu and one each in Paranaguá and Sarandi. These facilities are responsible for
      reporting the majority of suspected dengue cases. In Londrina and Maringá, the private health
      sector also provides emergency care. The implementation of the study protocol adds a
      collection of a blood sample for PCR to the existing protocol for addressing suspected dengue
      cases among individuals within the target vaccination age groups.

      The study will count on the activities already carried out by teams of epidemiological
      surveillance of dengue intensifying the identification of the serotype through the laboratory
      method RT-PCR (Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction) in real time. In addition,
      the investigators will identify hospitals and health units that attend dengue cases for
      sample collection, to perform real-time RT-PCR and initial processing of the blood samples
      collected from the controls.

        The effectiveness of Sanofi Pasteur´s dengue vaccine (Dengvaxia®) according to age will be
        assessed in 5 municipalities of Paraná State - Maringá, Foz de Iguaçu, Londrina, Sarandi
        and Paranaguá. The municipalities were chosen because they are of medium size and have a
        history of dengue. The first 4 present a historical series of occurrence of dengue since
        the 1990s, while in Paranaguá the history of the disease is more recent. Any health service
        located in each of the five municipalities may report a suspected dengue case. In all five
        municipalities, there is a large public emergency service, the UPA, which is responsible
        for reporting the majority of suspected dengue cases. In Londrina and Maringá, the private
        health sector also provides emergency care.
