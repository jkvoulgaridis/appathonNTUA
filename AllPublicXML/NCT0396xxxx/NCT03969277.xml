  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized-controlled trial aims to investigate the efficacy of Graded Motor Imagery
      (GMI) on function, pain, and range of motion (ROM) in patients with a posttraumatic stiff
      elbow.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the efficacy of GMI on function, pain, and ROM in elbow limitation, forty-two
      voluntary patients with elbow limitation, aged between 18-65 years will be randomly divided
      into two groups: GMI group and standard rehabilitation (SR) group. Interventions will be
      applied for 12 sessions. The patients will be assessed before, after six-week treatment and
      one-month follow-up. The pain on activity, at rest and at night will be assessed with Visual
      Analog Scale (VAS). Pain pressure threshold of the elbow and soft tissue around the elbow
      will be evaluated by digital pressure algometry. ROM will be assessed with a universal
      goniometer. Isometric muscle strength will be measured with a handheld dynamometer of four
      muscle groups (elbow flexors and extensors, and wrist flexors and extensors). Grip strength
      will also be assessed. The Jebsen-Taylor Hand Function Test will establish to provide a
      standardized and objective evaluation of fine and gross motor hand. Recogniseâ„¢ will be used
      for assessing the right-left discrimination. The functional status and kinesiophobia will be
      evaluated by Disabilities Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) and Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia,
      respectively. The Global Rating of Change will be used to evaluate patient satisfaction. The
      Vividness of Movement Imagery Questionnaire 2 (VMIQ-2) will be used for evaluating the
      individuals' ability to mental imaginary.

    <description>The first stage of GMI includes laterality reconstruction. Patients will view and determine if the various images of body parts to image portrays the right or left side. The second stage targets activation of the primary motor cortex by imagine moving the involved body part. The final stage involves that the patient watches the unaffected body part moving in a mirror to &quot;trick&quot; the brain into thinking the affected body part is actually moving in a pain-free way.
