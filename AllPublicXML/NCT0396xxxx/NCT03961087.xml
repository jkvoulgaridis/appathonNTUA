      Hepatic encephalopathy is a syndrome occurs in patients with liver cirrhosis and is defined
      as neuropsychiatric abnormalities in patients with liver impairment, characterized by
      personality changes, intellectual impairment, and an impaired level of consciousness.

      Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is a necessary cofactor of the mitochondrial metabolism. It provides a
      High antioxidant and protective effects on age-related morbidities such as hypertension,
      heart failure and neurodegenerative diseases and hepatoprotective effects in drug related
      hepatic impairment.

      Meclofenoxate is a cholinergic nootropic drug used clinically to improve memory, mental
      function and general cognition.

      Hepatic encephalopathy is a syndrome occurs in patients with liver cirrhosis and is defined
      as neuropsychiatric abnormalities in patients with liver impairment, characterized by
      personality changes, intellectual impairment, and an impaired level of consciousness. Hepatic
      encephalopathy is categorized into Type A hepatic encephalopathy associated with acute liver
      failure; Type B hepatic encephalopathy is associated with portal-systemic bypass and no
      intrinsic hepatocellular disease; Type C hepatic encephalopathy describes encephalopathy
      associated with Cirrhosis and portal hypertension; type C hepatic encephalopathy is, in turn,
      subcategorized as episodic, persistent, or minimal.

      A number of theories had been postulated, it was proposed that hepatic encephalopathy is a
      disorder of astrocyte function which play a key role in the regulation of the blood-brain
      barrier, maintaining electrolyte homeostasis , a role in the detoxification of chemicals,
      including ammonia.

      neurotoxic substances, including ammonia and manganese cause morphologic changes in the
      astrocytes leading to Alzheimer type II astrocytosis in cirrhosis.

      Hepatic encephalopathy may be due to accumulated neurotoxic substances in the brain as
      short-chain fatty acids; mercaptans; false neurotransmitters, such as tyramine, octopamine,
      and beta-phenylethanolamines; manganese; ammonia; and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).

      Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is a necessary cofactor of the mitochondrial metabolism. It provides a
      High antioxidant and protective effects on age-related morbidities such as hypertension,
      heart failure and neurodegenerative diseases and hepatoprotective effects in drug related
      hepatic impairment.

      Meclofenoxate is a cholinergic nootropic drug used clinically to improve memory, mental
      function and general cognition.
