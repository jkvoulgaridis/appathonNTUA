  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      All participants were at least 6-month post-stroke and had unilateral limb involvement (8
      right/4 left). The main inclusion criteria in selection of the participants in this study
      were as follows :(1) First stroke (2) At least 6 months post stroke (3) Able to stand for at
      least one minute without any assistive devices (4) Able to walk for at least 10 meters. All
      participants were instructed to walk with bare foot or with ankle-foot orthoses(AFOs)
      separately under gait detection of the motion capture system. Participants were further
      instructed to complete the 10 Meter Walk Test at a comfortable speed with BF or with AFOs
      separately. All participants were provided with sufficient rest between each trial. Patient
      demographics such as lower limb Brunnstrom stage and Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) score were
      examined and recorded by experienced therapist. The satisfaction and outcome were measured by
      the Quebec User Evaluation of Satisfaction with Assistive Technology (QUEST) and SF-36. The
      kinematic and kinetic data were collected by Motion Analysis system.

    <measure>10 Meter Walk Test (10MWT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Each participant preformed three 10MWT trials under each condition, for a total of 9 trials, on the same day with sufficient time given to rest in between trials.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Numerical rating scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Participant fatigue before and after the 10MWT for the 3 experimental conditions was measured via a 5-point numerical rating scale (NRS), with 1 indicating no fatigue and 5 indicating strong fatigue.</description>

    <measure>The Quebec User Evaluation of Satisfaction with Assistive Technology (QUEST)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The 8 items of the questionnaire included Dimensions, Weight, Ease in Adjusting, Safety and Security, Durability , Ease of Use, Comfortable, and Effectiveness. Each item employed a 5-point scale, with 1-point representing not satisfied at all, and 5-point representing very satisfied.</description>
