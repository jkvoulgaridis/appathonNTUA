  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RIMDAMAL II is a double-blind, cluster randomized trial in Burkina Faso designed to test
      whether repeated ivermectin mass drug administrations, integrated into a monthly delivery
      platform with standard malaria control measures of seasonal malaria chemoprevention and
      insecticide-treated bed net distribution in the Sahel, will reduce childhood malaria
      incidence.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The RIMDAMAL II trial is designed to determine the efficacy of adding seasonal ivermectin
      mass drug administrations to the standard-policy malaria control measures in the Sahel
      (seasonal malaria chemoprevention in children, maximum long-lasting insecticidal net
      coverage, intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy), for reducing the incidence of
      uncomplicated malaria episodes in enrolled village children (≤ 10 years of age) assessed by
      active case surveillance. The investigators will also examine the safety of the intervention,
      as well as entomological and parasitological endpoints. This is a double-blind, cluster
      randomized trial in that will occur in villages in southwestern Burkina Faso over two
      consecutive rainy seasons. For the intervention, mass administration of ivermectin or placebo
      will be given monthly over 4 months of each rainy season to the eligible village population,
      each as 3-day course of 300 µg/kg/day. These mass drug administrations will occur
      simultaneously with the distribution of seasonal malaria chemoprevention drugs on the same
      monthly schedule to eligible children aged 3-59 months.
