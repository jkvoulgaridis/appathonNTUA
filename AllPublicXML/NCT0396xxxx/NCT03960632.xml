  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since their introduction in the late 90's, rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) have dramatically
      improved our ability to control malaria, but proved insufficient to support elimination
      efforts because of their limited sensitivity, especially for P. vivax. In addition, the
      spread of P. falciparum parasites lacking hrp2 gene jeopardizes the long-term use of P.
      falciparum-specific HRP2-based RDTs. An existing partnership between Standard Diagnostics
      (SD), FIND, PATH, and Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) is addressing these
      limitations by developing two novel malaria RDTs with an analytical sensitivity ten times
      higher than the currently available malaria RDTs: a P. falciparum-specific test targeting
      both the HRP2 and PfLDH antigens (Pf Plus), and a P. falciparum/P. vivax combo test
      additionally targeting the PvLDH antigen (Pf/Pv Plus).

      These new combo tests with improved sensitivity may become promising diagnostic tools for the
      detection of malaria, especially in settings where current tests prove to be insufficient due
      to hrp2 deletion or high burden of P. vivax malaria.

      In this study, the investigators will perform a prospective evaluation of Pf Plus and Pf/Pv
      Plus tests in malaria-endemic countries to assess their clinical performance for detection of
      malaria in their intended-use settings.
