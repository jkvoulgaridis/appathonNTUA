  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adolescents and young adults (AYA) with cancer have to deal with a relatively segmented
      organization of care between pediatric and adult medicine structures in France. However, the
      third french Plan Cancer 2014-2019 helped in the recognition of the specificities of the AYA
      affected by cancer and allowed the creation of specific structures in some care units in
      France, whose primary goal is the preservation of the social link.

      Indeed, peer relations contribute to access to quality social support, which is an important
      variable in patient adjustment with cancer. The adolescents that perceive higher social
      support report less psychological distress and exhibit higher adaptation scores.

      It nevertheless happens that AYA experience negative social support, often from friends
      because of contact reduction during the disease. Patients can then elect to turn towards
      non-intimate relations such as support groups. The main risk when a AYA with cancer defines a
      sick peer as one bringing him quality social support is the installation of a sense of guilt,
      for example, when a young person is confronted with disease negative progress or with peer
      death. The more an adolescent identifies with the deceased, the more he is able to consider
      his own mortality.

      AYA units are developing in France, creating a community of sick adolescents. These
      communities are precious for AYA and allow information and experience sharing, a feeling of
      reduced isolation and a greater emotional closeness with peers suffering from the same
      disease.

      How is social support from peers and close friends perceived by these young people in AYA
      units and through the social networks? What can the consequences of the evolution of peer
      disease be on AYA? What is the impact of the mourning of sick peers on these young people?
      What are the predictors?

    <description>This longitudinal study based upon repeated and multicentric measurement will recruit AYA with cancer in care Units dedicated to them or not. Measures will be quantitative, and repeated every 3 months by questionnaires, as well as qualitative (social network questionnaire, psychological research interview) for teenagers declaring a negative event or a death event during treatments.
Those patients presenting a high depression score will be contacted by a research psychologist for semi-directed interview.</description>
