  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to estimate the treatment effect of fremanezumab
      administered subcutaneously in reducing pain in adult patients with FM. A secondary objective
      is to evaluate the effect of fremanezumab on other efficacy measures, including pain, quality
      of life, sleep, fatigue, improvement in health, physical functioning, and mood. Another
      secondary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of fremanezumab administered
      subcutaneously in adult patients with FM.

      The total duration of patient participation in the study is planned to be 35 weeks,
      consisting of the screening period of up to 5 weeks, the double-blind treatment period of 16
      weeks, and the 14-week follow-up period.

    <description>Pain Intensity-Numerical Rating Scale (PI-NRS) is an 11-point pain intensity numerical rating scale where 0=no pain and 10=worst possible pain.</description>

    <description>The FIQR is a commonly used instrument in the evaluation of FM patients. It contains 21 questions in 3 domains: function (9 questions), overall impact (2 questions), and symptoms (10 questions). Questions are graded on a 0 to 10 numeric scale with 10 being the worst.</description>

    <description>Scale evaluates all aspects of patients' health and assesses if there has been an improvement or decline in clinical status since the start of the study. Improvement is recorded on a 7-point scale, with 1 indicating very much improved and 7 indicating very much worse.</description>

    <description>Contains 8 items with a score range from 8 to 40. Each question has 5 response options ranging in value from 1 to 5 over the past 7 days. To find the total raw score for an SF with all questions answered, sum the values of the response to each question. For the adult 8-item form, the lowest possible raw score is 8; the highest possible raw score is 40, indicating worst sleep.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline up to week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Contains 12 items with a score ranging from 12 to 36. The PROMIS Physical Function Scale measures self-reported capability rather than actual performance of physical activities. This includes the functioning of one's upper extremities (dexterity), lower extremities (walking or mobility), and central regions (neck, back), as well as instrumental activities of daily living, such as running errands over the past over the past 7 days. A single Physical Function capability score is obtained from a SF. A lower score indicates more limited physical disability.</description>
