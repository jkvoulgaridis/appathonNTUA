  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) is to assess
      molecular changes that occur in response to physical activity (PA). To achieve this aim, a
      mechanistic randomized controlled trial (RCT) is conducted, in which adult study participants
      are randomized to endurance exercise (EE) training, resistance exercise (RE) training, or no
      exercise Control for a period of approximately 12 weeks. The overarching hypothesis is that
      there are discoverable molecular transducers that communicate and coordinate the effects of
      exercise on cells, tissues, and organs, which may initiate processes ultimately leading to
      the health benefits of exercise. Because this is a mechanistic trial, the main goal is not a
      health-related outcome. Rather, the goal is to generate a map of the molecular responses to
      exercise that will be used by the Consortium and by the scientific community at large to
      generate hypotheses for future investigations of the health benefits of PA.

      Study assessments are completed before and after the intervention period (exercise or
      control), and at specific interim time points during the course of the intervention.
      Assessments include measurements of cardiorespiratory fitness, muscular strength, and body
      composition (including total body bone mineral content) determined by dual-energy x-ray
      absorptiometry (DXA). There is also collection of blood and muscle and adipose tissue
      biospecimens, monitoring of free-living PA level using wearable devices, and completion of
      participant reported outcomes and health status by interview and/or questionnaire. An
      additional group of highly active (HA) individuals currently active in either EE (HAEE) or RE
      (HARE) are recruited for a single acute exercise testing session of either endurance or
      resistance exercise and other study assessments. MoTrPAC participants are recruited, trained,
      and assessed via six adult Clinical Centers (CC), involving 10 clinical sites. As part of the
      MoTrPAC functions, participant data and biological samples are transferred from the clinical
      sites to the Consortium Coordinating Center (CCC) Data Management, Analysis and Quality
      Control Center (DMAQC)and to the Biological Sample Repository, and later analyzed by the
      Consortium Chemical Analysis Sites (CAS) and the Bioinformatics Center (BIC).

      Biological samples collected in this project undergo molecular phenotyping, including
      metabolomic, lipidomic, proteomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and genomic analyses. These
      assays are done at the MoTrPAC CAS.

      Overall coordination of the study and analyses occurs at 4 institutions which make up the CCC
      and the BIC.

    <description>Participants randomized to ET engage in four center-based ET sessions each week for 12 weeks; each session lasting roughly 1-hour with a 40-45 minute stimulus phase and the remaining time being used to warm up and cool down. Each week, two of the sessions occur on a cycle ergometer and two involve treadmill exercise (4 total sessions per week). During all sessions, the participant's heart rate is monitored to ensure they maintain exercise intensity at 70% of heart rate reserve (± 5%). Periodically during training sessions perceptual data from participants are recorded, which is used to track the subjective experience of participants and in interpreting adherence data.</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to RT engage in four center-based RT sessions each week for 12 weeks; each session lasting roughly 1-hour with a 40-45 minute stimulus phase and the remaining time being used to warm up and cool down. The prescription is a 2-day split, meaning approximately half of the major muscle groups are exercised each session and each muscle group is exercised twice per week. Two sessions per week include seven exercises that focus on the hips/thighs, back and biceps, and the other two sessions per week include seven exercises that focus on the chest, shoulders, triceps, calves and abdominal muscles. The first set per muscle group is a warm-up performed at 50-70% of prescribed loads that are based on 10-repetition maximum (RM). Three sets per exercise are then performed at 10RM intensity. Load increases when a participant is able to perform 12 repetitions for 2 of 3 sets of an exercise. During all sessions, heart rate is monitored and perceived exertion is recorded.</description>
