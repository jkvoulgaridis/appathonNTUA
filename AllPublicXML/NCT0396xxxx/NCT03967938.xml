  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At present targeted therapy with the PARP inhibitor olaparib has become standard of care in
      advanced platinum sensitive BRCA1/2 mutant ovarian cancer. The key in this sensitivity is the
      loss of homologous recombination (HR) function. The current project aims to treat patients
      with any type of cancer carrying in their germline a mutation in genes that generate such an
      homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) or have an acquired somatic mutation in their tumor
      with the targeted PARP inhibitor olaparib. The project would thus bring access to a targeted
      drug matched to the genomic profile of the tumor of these patients and provide oncologists
      with information regarding efficacy and safety of olaparib in these patients. This evidence
      could then later lead to a more routine regulatory access.
