  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain relief and functional impairment have been shown to remain poor to moderate over weeks
      after emergency department discharge, in patients who seek ED management for acute
      nontraumatic, nonradicular low back pain.

      The investigators made the hypothesis that ultrasound-guided interfascial infiltration of
      local anesthesics and corticoid is efficient and safe in treating patients presenting to the
      ED with acute non specific low back pain. The investigators aimed to compare early and short
      term functional impairment and pain relief one day and 1 week after interfacial infiltration,
      as compared to standard medical treatment

      This is a single center observational feasibility study enrolling ED patients presenting with
      acute unspecific low back pain.

      Ultrasound-guided interfascial infiltration is proposed to eligible patients presenting to
      our ED with low back pain and disability, as part of routine care. Patients receive standard
      medical treatment if they refuse interfascial infiltration or in case of absence or
      unavailability of a trained operator.

      Patients were followed-up at 1 day and 7-days pots ED discharge by telephone interview
      conducted by an independent member of our research team not involved in patient's management
