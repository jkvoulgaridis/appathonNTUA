  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Local percutaneous thermal ablation is frequently proposed in the management of metastatic
      diseases. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has demonstrated good results when the metastatic
      disease is limited and slowly evolving. The destruction of solid metastasis by RF leads to
      inflammatory and immunological mechanisms that remain poorly understood. These pathological
      events may influence the overall and anti-tumor host immune responses. The purpose of the
      study is to identify and quantify some immune mechanisms triggered by RFA of pulmonary
      metastases from colorectal cancer origin.

    <textblock>
      RFA could provide activatory signals and become a source of tumor antigens for the immune
      system. Generating a massive and transient release of antigens, RFA could boost lymphocyte
      proliferation and production of inflammatory cytokines in response to tumor extracts. Herein,
      the investigator aims to demonstrate that RFA can amplify the specific T cell response in
      metastatic cancer patients. In order to ensure this, he plans to assess and quantify tumor
      infiltrating lymphocytes through tumoral biopsies. He also plans to measure the CD4, CD8 and
      NK lymphocytes release, the circulating DNA and tumoral cells release, during RFA of lung
      metastases. On tumoral biopsies, the expression of PDL-1 ligand will also be evaluated and
      measured. Participants with bilateral metastases or with 5 or more unilateral metastases will
      be recruited. The two RFA interventions will be carried out within 4-6 weeks of each other.
      Blood samples and tumoral biopsies will be performed during each intervention. Biopsies will
      be performed on a metastasis before the thermal ablation. Blood samples will be performed
      just before RFA, 30 min after RFA and one day after. Analysis, identification and measure of
      lymphocytes release will be performed with flow cytometry. All analysis and measurements will
      be performed in the Bio-Pathology department of Institut Bergonié.

    <description>Each patient is treated with 2 RFA interventions. Abiopsy of one metastasis is done at each RF session. Histological samples are sent to the Bio-pathology department of Institut Bergonié for tumor infiltrating lymphocytes counting. Primary outcome results from this counting (stromal TILs ≥ 20% is considered as a significant level, a comparative measurement before and after RF will be performed). In parallel blood samples are performed before and after RFA to analyze the kinetics of peripheral blood T lymphocytes subsets, tumoral circulating cells and tumoral DNA.</description>
