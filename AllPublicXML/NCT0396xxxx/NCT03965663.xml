  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to investigate the influence of a vibro-tactile device on
      trans-tibial amputees in terms of gait, pain and perception of the prosthesis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is divided into three phases. The initial phase lasts 6 to 8 weeks for each
      subject. For subjects of group 2 the length of the initial phase depends on the progression
      of the re-innervation. The initial phase ends, when the subject can perceive the tactile
      stimulate at the re-innervated area of the skin. During the initial phase, all subjects get a
      new prosthesis. To minimize the adjusting to the new prosthesis only a new socket, which
      houses the vibro-tactile Feedback system, is fabricated and the old prosthetic food is
      re-used. After a period of 3 weeks minimum, where the subjects use the new prosthesis, a gait
      analysis and an assessment of the sensitivity of the skin at the stump are performed.

      Subsequently the intervention phase starts and the vibro-tactile feedback system is
      activated. For a period of 6 months the subjects use the new prostheses with the integrated
      vibro-tactile feedback system in daily living. After 2 and 4 months, the subjects visit the
      study site for an assessment of the sensitivity of the skin. After 6 months a second gait
      analysis and an other assessment of the sensitivity of the skin a the stump are performed.
      Afterwards the vibro-tactile feedback-system is disabled.

      During the observing phase the subjects use the prosthesis with the disabled vibro-tactile
      feedback system for 4 months.

      During all three phases the subjects answer the questionnaires every 2 months.

    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The Trinity Amputation and Prosthesis Experience Scales-Revised (TAPES-R) is a multidimensional instrument designed to examine the psychosocial processes involved in adjusting to amputation and a prosthesis. TAPES consists of 9 subscales, with possible scores depending on the single subscale. The range is from 0-12 to 0-25 (depending on the number of items and answer possibilities).</description>

    <measure>Fall Efficacy Scale International Version (FES-I)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The Fall Efficacy Scale International Version (FES-I) is a questionaire that assesses the fear of falling. Scores can range from 16-64, with a higher score indicating a higher fear of falling.</description>

    <measure>Pain Visual analoge scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The pain is measured with a Visual analoge scale form 0 to 10. O indicates no pain, while 10 is the worst pain the person can imagine.</description>
